												Short Review: Stunning setting (visually and thematically), great voice acting, story is top notch, but gameplay is a little lacking. If you're someone that plays games principally for story and setting, then this is for you. If not, and it breaks my heart to say this, then I would avoid this as it is narrative heavy. If you've played previous Dreamfall/TLJ games then this is definitely a worthy successor. If you haven't, then this review might not be helpful for you but give it a shot anyway.Long Review: This is a difficult game to review. The first in the series, The Longest Journey, was released around fifteen years ago. The second, Dreamfall, was released eight years ago, and was riddled with cliffhangers that are only now being resolved. I honestly couldn't tell you whether someone who hasn't played the earlier ones would enjoy this, so I won't bother. This is a review for the original fans of the game. The game is visually stunning. It's not next-gen graphics or what have you, but it's modern and the love and care the team at Red Thread Games put into making Europolis feel like a 23rd century proto-dystopian city which still manages to look fantastic and somehow make me wistfully want to live in such a place. The darkened, rain filled, sky with neon all over the place and an odd mix of 19th century, 21st century, and 23rd century architecture is fantastic, with neat little details. You'll walk past a big modern skyscraper and see parts at the base which are crumbling and showing brick walls or the original iron supports.The voice acting and story is great. The voice acting is phenomenal, and in all characters you can feel the genuine emotion and thoughts running through their dialogue. Better than most AAA games. The dialogue system they've set up should be the gold standard in games, where you can mouse over each of the answers and hear the protagonists thoughts on why that would be their answer. We only see a small snippet of the story in the first episode (called a 'book'), but already you can see how the threads are beginning to weave together into a coherent whole. And when I say a small snippet, I don't mean that it's short. My playthrough lasted four hours (it flew by so fast, I could've sworn I wasn't playing more than an hour), so in total this is looking to be a 20 hour game of pure content, and not achievement hunting, or pointless side missions, or collectibles. It's certainly got me itching for more. There appears to be genuine choice and consequences as well, though again - it's still too early to tell before the other books are released. That said, this is where one of my main concerns lies. The game has the option to track your decisions, and the majority of decisions I made, so too did 80%+ of other players. Hopefully they address this in future so there's more genuine choice, instead of obvious ones.The gameplay, sadly, is a bit lacking as well. Which is understandable, this is essentially one of the old 1990s adventure games, transplanted and moderately reworked to fit a 3d setting and is a bit lost as a result, but there haven't been any sections that have been unenjoyable as a result, and it hasn't detracted from the games main strengths. Fortunately, they haven't included combat (thus far) as they were forced to do for Dreamfall, but so far there have been none of the 'impossible puzzles' that were common in so many such games if only because there have been few puzzles full stop.I was in my early 20s when Dreamfall first came out, and it's probably the game that's moved me (emotionally? spiritually?) more than any other game. I say this with considerable relief, Dreamfall Chapters evokes the same kinds of feelings now that I had when first playing Dreamfall back in '06. If you're a fan of the series, or of top-of-the-line storytelling, this is a must-buy.			"

												EDIT: Book Three out. As soon as a new episode comes out or something gets fixed, I will update.The bad:-God-awful optimization. Constant fps drop in busy areas in both books, even on a high-end gaming PC. Multiple people have these issues, which I repeatedly checked on. In the two biggest areas in both episodes, the frame rate can drop to around 15fps. Unacceptable, especially since those are the areas you are stuck in for the longest time. Some people however can run and play the game fine, even on lower hardware, so it's a really weird issue, but it's still unacceptable to have these frame-rate issues on stronger machines.-What used to be occasional bugs has gone berserk with the release of episode two. A big chunk of bugs, starting from even the menu that sometimes spades out and will just do what it wants. There is a surprising lack of bug-testing and polish.-Very noticeable difference in quality and polish between models. Some textures look really good, some look pretty damn dreadful. Some character models are really good, some just fail to impress in comparison.-Animation, although sometimes relatively solid, at other times just seems very weird and especially walk cycles of some characters as well as how they rotate and/or talk seems very out of place.-Barely any explanation of the games that came before. Newer players will most likely feel lost.The good:-The game looks really nice. The art style is really good, it has a really nice range of colors, and some areas like the main city you explore in the first episode are insanely detailed and look alive and believable.-Really interesting characters, both from older games in the series as well as new ones. Mostly good voice actors, although some sound a bit amateurish compared to others.-Relatively lengthy episodes, which can easily take around 3 to 4 hours per episode to finish.-The story continues right off of the last game and brings a slow but interesting new start to the series.-Good choices that actually change whole parts of the books (episodes) themselves and do offer an incentive to replay the game again.Dreamfall Chapters is almost a game that should be recommended to every fan of modern adventure games. It is very slow paced, and it completely consists of walking around and talking with people, with little variation and very simple puzzles in between. Taking all of that into consideration however, it does manage to (so far) tell a really interesting tale with fun and colorful characters, and has a beautiful art style as well as decent length and structure to it. The only thing holding it back are the poor optimization and the bugs found every now and then (More so since book two). Even though players new to the series should have no big problems getting into the game, they might be left a bit confused at the start, and it does seem to target older fans more than anything. Everyone who loved the last Dreamfall game should also be in for a treat with this one, anyone else who is new to the series should still risk a look if they are primarily interested in good story telling and a slow atmosphere-focused game with little action, but a lot of wonder to breathe in. The lack of polish is the only thing keeping this game away from being as good as its predecessors.EDIT: Game still has huge performance issues and some bugs, but apparently the transition to the updated engine has helped for some people. Stay tuned for how it turns out once that engine update is out of beta and/or we get episode 4.			"

												Warning: This not a review but a personal thought about the game.  If you are looking for a review go check what other good people wrote :-)It was 7 or 8 years ago, I bought a (long gone now) PC Gaming Magazine called PC Master.  In it, there was a game called Dreamfall : The Longest Journey.   ""The long awaited continuation to the Longest Journey"" it said.  I started playing it and that was it.  I fell in love with the protagonists.  Fell in love with the story.  But the second game ended and I was full of questions.  And then nothing. Years passed.  I finished school, I nearly finished my studies. My father died.  Life continued.And then I heard about a kickstarter campaign to create a third game to the series.  That was one of my happiest days of my life.  It reminded me of a simpler time. And today, at long last I finished the story of this game.  One chapter of my life closed.  But the story has not ended.  My life continues and this game reminded me that every decision I take, adds up to who I am.  And to where I am going.Thank you Red Thread Games for creating an awesome finale to the series. Thank you.			"

												I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and completely fell in love with that game, so I obviously had to get the sequel. I love these games with all my heart- favorite series of all time- but I found myself a bit bored at times in chapters 1-3. Do NOT let this discourage you. In chapter 4, I felt all the flood of emotions from Dreamfall flood back and wrench my heart. Chapter 4 alone makes this game entirely worth playing, along with the in-depth characters, originality, and beauty throughout the entire game. I cried several times. Also, the decisions I've made warrant another playthrough in hopes that mistakes will be fixed. In Telltale games, it appears to me that the game is decided no matter what choice you make because your choices never affect the NEXT chapter. Not so will Dreamfall: Chapters. Each decision you make will have an impact on future gameplay. I cannot wait for chapter 5 to see what I will regret and cry over next.			"

												Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter and I also am a regular on RTG's official forums. I adore the game. I'll try and update it once all parts are out, but what I've played so far has been fantastic. The art is superb. The voice acting is amazing. There's a lot to explore and see. There are some kinks that the team has had to work out. Little bugs, etc. But they've been incredibly responsive to reports of issues and rolling out patches to fix any issues that slipped through testing. If you liked the first Dreamfall, you'll find a lot to love here. If you didn't play the first one, you will probably still enjoy this if you are a fan of adventure games, C&C games, Cyberpunk / Fantasy mash ups, or just games with a strong narrative thrust.			"

												9.5/10genre : point and click adventure game in 3rd person+ high production values, beautiful art, great character models, especially Zoe is very well designed, stunning environments and worlds+ excellent voice acting, one of my favorite soundtracks, music is both epic and emotional+ the story is one of the best you can find in gaming, heart breaking and emotional, other times dark and mysterious - the writing and dialogues are better than most movies you have ever watched - you continue the story of the previous games in the series, following the journey of the 2 heroes in parallel worlds, of science and magic, reality and dreams, order and chaos+ gameplay wise it's a point and click adventure game in 3rd person - there are inventory based puzzles, puzzles are scarce but well thought , but the most important part of gameplay is observation and dialogues, where the choices have consequences, the path changes according to them and the balance is shifted - combining items in inventory or choosing the appropriate action when interacting are also basic gameplay functions+ pretty long for episodic game, the 2nd book i'm playing right now seems to be twice the size of the 1st one - replayability is also good since most people will replay it to see the alternate results of their actions- it would be a 10/10 game for me if it wasn't for the optimization issues and frame drops on large open areas, it has been fixed a bit since the release but it still needs some work- some animations could be better, but for an adventure game they are way above averagethe whole series of longest journey/dreamfall is very special to me, it just feels that playing these games and following the story is something more than just gaming - makes you feel things and maybe reconsider some things in your own life - ofcourse the game is recommended to everyone , although it would be wise to play at least the longest journey first to understand the worlds since despite the fact that there is a story recap it's not enough.

												I like Dreamfall Chapters, but will you enjoy Dreamfall Chapters?Some things to consider:This is the third game in a series that started with The Longest Journey (2000) and continued in Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (2006).  The Longest Journey is a wonderful point-and-click adventure game classic: if you like adventure games and haven’t played it yet I highly suggest you do so.  Dreamfall (there’s no way around it) just isn’t as good.  This is not to say that it’s unplayable or that I didn’t enjoy it at all, but as a stand-alone game I wouldn’t whole-heartedly recommend it.  In order to really appreciate Chapters you don’t need to have played TLJ, but, unfortunately, I really think you do need to play the original Dreamfall first.  Among other things, Dreamfall ends on a cliffhanger and Chapters more-or-less picks up where it left off.Chapters takes places in a rich game world revealed and developed over the course of the series.  This applies both to Stark, a vaguely cyberpunk version of our world set in the near future, and Arcadia, a fantasy world that’s the flipside of the coin—where magic rules rather than technology.I think the legacy of TLJ and Dreamfall is both a blessing and a curse for the creators of Chapters.  As I said, they started off with a storied, well-developed setting; but, at the same time, Chapters needed to continue Dreamfall’s story—a story that had arrived at a critical moment where sinister forces are on the verge (we’re talking like seconds) of upsetting the balance/taking over the world/ripping everything apart.  Marcuria, the city we visit in Arcadia, is under military occupation and the invaders (who have their own interesting culture) want to stamp out magic and replace it with their steampunk technology (and the purpose of some of these machines is very suspect).  Meanwhile, in Stark, an entertainment device called the Dream Machine has become ubiquitous and people are using it to escape the troubles of reality and spend more and more time in a virtual dream world.  From the very beginning one feels that a dramatic climax is imminent.Chapters is a story rich game (and it’s an interesting story), but sometimes story rich means gameplay poor.  The episodes where you have control over the main character and get to move around solving puzzles are unevenly interspersed between long conversations and cut scenes.  This is, to some extent, made up for by the fact that you’re sometimes given a chance to make choices which will affect what happens later in the game (Chapters sort of beats you over the head with “This choice will matter!” although there’s an option to turn those messages off).  So all-in-all, I think you’ll risk being lost or not invested enough in the characters if you play Chapters without playing Dreamfall and there are parts where the game is light on interactivity and heavy on dialogue and exposition, but the story is an interesting one and in other places gameplay and story are balanced enough to satisfy.

												Book One:It’s been almost a decade since the ending of the previous installment left us with an abrupt cliffhanger while making us eager for more ventures of Zoë Castillo.Ever since then, the future of Dreamfall was uncertain, with Funcom shifting its focus to online games before finally being salvaged with successful Kickstarter funding. So how does the first episode hold up after all those production perils and is it a worthy successor of the Dreamfall series?For those of you who just tuned in and are unfamiliar with its predecessor (shame on you!), this story-driven adventure game takes place in two worlds, technology-infused Stark and magical land of Arcadia. Our heroine Zoë will start the journey by investigating the disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Reza Temiz, before unraveling a global conspiracy led by Japanese toy manufacturer WATIcorp. As you would assume, their real focus is far from making toys for kids and more on delivering a new, vastly damaging lucid dreaming drug to the market, something which will have dire consequences on both Stark and Arcadia in later events. Slowly you are introduced to new characters and find yourself jumping between worlds following the WATIcorp trail before realizing how small of a cog in a story they are and that much more is at stake.The story picks up several months after the Longest Journey ending with Zoë still being stuck in a Storytime limbo. It is an otherworldly realm now swarming with Dreamachine addicts and other trapped souls. Following the gloomy finale in The Longest Journey, WATIcorp has gained even more power and influence by openly selling dream consoles from previous game labeled now as “Dreamachines”, a device marketed as a tool for enhancing lucid dreaming while making most of its users highly addicted in the process. You will get to witness that side effect firsthand while roaming through the streets of Europolis later, tripping over many of its comatose inhabitants in street corners.At first, you will get a glimpse of storyline by helping other trapped souls and Dreamachine addicts in Storytime and later reconciling with our old mysterious friend Vagabond, who will inform us that both of the worlds of Stark and Arcadia are in great danger and Zoë’s help is needed once again. Before finding ourselves in Stark again, the game will briefly reunite us with another familiar face Kian Alvane, where we also learn more about his fate after the events in The Longest Journey. Along with Zoë, he is one of the three playable characters in the first episode of Chapters (I don’t want to spoil who the third protagonist is but let’s just say it is someone who I found quite charming and took me completely by surprise).Seeing how this episode mostly acts as something to entice new and returning players of Dreamfall, I can understand the lack of challenging puzzles in game for the most part. Usually you will find yourself merely repeating what the game asks of you or just combining items on few occasions but sadly that’s all there is to it. Luckily, that would probably be the only flaw that you might see in game, since everything else has been polished to the perfection. From the soothing scenery of Storytime (but only if we ignore that nightmarish wardrobe with slimy tentacles coming out of it) to the luminous and lively streets of Europolis – it is quite clear at first glance to where most of the love for the game went.Some older fans of Dreamfall might be displeased with the new voice actor for Zoë Castillo but frankly, that is something you might notice if you finished the previous game in the series only recently. And I assure you, beside that minor change the game does not hold back when it comes to delivering some quality voice acting. I can safely say that now we have a strong contender for one of the most adorable voices for a repair bot in video games ever.Speaking of Europolis, it is one of the few locations in first episode where you will spend most of the time and for a good reason. The whole city is gorgeously designed,  highlighting the contrast between rich and poor on every corner. One moment you might find yourself gazing at the beautiful skyscrapers in Sonnenschein Plaza before stumbling over one of the many slumbering Dreamachine junkies. And let’s not forget our old pals from EYE, a global police agency who will watch over your every move, creeping on you and thousands of other citizens in Europolis.In most games and movies, I always found the inclusion of lens flare nothing more than a cheap gimmick and what developers tend to incorporate when they run out of any other creative additions. But in this context, it is a feature which works incredibly well and adds something new to the whole dreamy (wink wink) undertone of the game. Dreamfall Chapters also does a remarkable job in pushing the capabilities of Unity engine to the sheer limits. Often i found myself going on short breaks from whatever game was asking me to do and decide to take an excessive number of screenshots instead. Even some seemingly bland section such as medieval prison complex makes up for an interesting and enjoyable location in the game.Another thing on what developers focused more in Dreamfall Chapters are choices. Just like in a certain Telltale’s post-apocalyptic zombie game, you will now be notified with a large text prompt whenever you make an important decision while having an option to see the percentage of selected choices from other players online which might significantly help you in making a decision. The real question here is will these decisions result in greater variety, establishing a different image of the world for each player or are they nothing more than templates merely guiding us to one of the few prearranged endings of the game. For now, I believe it could go either way. One of my decisions in prologue during the second playthrough resulted in having a completely different job and doing business with a new key NPC once I found myself in Europolis again. Every other choice implied we might only see possible results of them in upcoming episode(s), especially when I played with Kian Alvane. To be fair, I am still a bit skeptical on how my choice between pork sausages or cheese soup for boyfriend’s dinner might leave a significant impact on the future of both worlds but i guess only time will tell.Abstract:Despite the serious lack of challenge in puzzles and relatively short length (although this point might prove invalid later with the release of new episodes), Dreamfall Chapters is quite deserving of your attention. With its superb voice acting, stunning locations and captivating story which will only leave you counting down the weeks for the release of the next episode, I will say we have a rewarding sequel for the Longest Journey. After an intro as good as this one, it’s hard not to expect only the best from the next episode.8/10			"

												If you have never played The Longest Journey or Dreamfall, be warned that this game is dialog heavy. Like its predecessors, Dreamfall Chapters is an interactive story. The Good: - After eight years we are FINALLY moving forward toward a resolution. - Beautiful graphics. The city of Europolis is huge and feels like a real city. You can eavesdrop on conversations! I loved just poking around the city looking at everything (remember to look up at the sky).- Protagonists are interesting and relatable. Zoe's journal is a nice addition.- New, fantastic characters introduced. I can't wait to learn more about them.- Some new, imaginative ways to interact with the environment.- I love the costuming - even the NPCs. Really well designed and I can tell a lot of thought went into every outfit.The Bad:- The controls were almost unbearable for me. I really couldn't get used to them and I got very frustrated at times trying to click on elements to interact with them. Some puzzles took me a long time to solve purely because had no idea an item could be interacted with, despite moving it into the centre of the camera field. Moving around felt very slow and clunky, even after several hours of playing.- My computer has above the recommended specs and I got some brutal fps drops. - Some ham fisted dialog and story elements. I get that Ragnar is trying to make a statement about the political situation in the West at the moment, but really. Lea Uminska's campaign posters are exactly the same style and colour as Obama's ""HOPE"" posters. Konstantin Wolf's posters have a Futurist/Constructivist lean to them like old Soviet propaganda posters.- I noticed quite a few small errors - maybe some were intentional? They were distracting. A jellyfish is *not* a cephalopod!			"

												[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]As with many of you, I have many fond memories about the previous two games in this saga, so I really tried to like this game.But what have appealed to me the most in the previous games in the series are notably absent in Dreamfall Chapters: the characters.This series felt so good because it had such strong, yet very believable characters like April and Zoe, who looked so different from typical super heroines of other games at that time.We could easily relate to them because they were just ordinary people, like us, at the begining of their journey. Both of the games allowed us plenty of time to familiarize with the characters, and showed us many little details about their personal lives, like going to school, hanging out with a boyfriend, and etc before revealing to us how their fate would change all that in an instant, which made it much more believable and astonishing at the same time.However, with Dreamfall Chapters everything has changed.Now all the important characters start with a big mission from the start, and as the story picks up the pace, there's no time to spend on those mundane little details which are, however, crucial in making them really believable.It feels especially bad for Kian, who had limited appearances in the previous game but has been given much bigger role in Dreamfall Chapters, though without sufficient details to make him feel as familiar to us as Zoe or April in the previous games.And his story almost feels like the writer couldn't decide what to do with him, as his personality seems to fluctuate from one moment to another. In the previous game, he made various comments about how hot magical womens look in Marcuria, or saying that how deep an impression he had when he met April for the first time.Even in an earlier episode of Dreamfall Chapters, he looked to be such a guy who has led an abstinent lifestyle his whole life and he just begins to open up his eyes to the other sex, when he  awkwardly allows himself to be warmed up to Enu, for instance.But only a moment later, he just declares he's a gay so he doesn't feel anything about women at all.Earlier on, he said he doesn't drink at all, and later remarked that beer was not so bad. And in the final episode, he's going about commenting how he can't stand a Northern wine brand compared to ones at home, as if he was some kind of a somelier himself.At the beginning, he was presented as a serious, or even a blunt kind of a person, which is quite understandable considering his supposed background. But too many times, his character is abused to fill mandatory share of witty remarks which players might expect from an adventure game. But unfortunately, this series isn't The Monkey Island, and him not Guybrush Threepwood (or April Ryan, for that matter, as she had quite a few hilarious lines in TLJ).It's very unfortunate that we have such a fluctuating and underdeveloped character as one of the main protagonist in this game, as he deprives us much time we could spend enjoying more familiar characters, like Zoe or even Crow, and he's not alone in that regard because they have introduced many other new characters in Dreamfall Chapters, who feel even more shallow and underdeveloped than the character of Kian.Enu, for example, seemed she could become one of the more memorable characters in the series, but her potential completely wasted as the story moves on. The same can be said of the most other characters as well, as Dreamfall Chapters is filled with such cheap stereo types, like a girl who have a crush with the one who saved her, or a caricature of Hitler, for instance.Even those intriguing characters from the previous games turned into cardboard villains in Dreamfall Chapters, like Brian Westhouse suddenly starting to play a Sith Lord impersonation (and with that signature 'bad guy' mask, and force choke ability), or Helena Chang becoming a typical 'mad scientist' we've already seen gazillion times in movies or other games.A few characters which could have been memorable, like Shitbot, Bip, or even Mira are quickly swept aside after their brief appearances, probably to make rooms for what developers thought to be more important, like some out of place political agenda, for instance.You will keep hearing extremely exaggerated and obviously ridiculous racial hate speeches from a caricature character of Hitler all through the game, until thankfully he burns himself out in the last episode.And a cold blooded warrior in a semi-Medieval fantasy world suddenly reveals his most liberal mind for the one who wanted to kill so badly, once the target of his revenge begins a long tirade about how it is to live as a sexual minority.Probably to emphasize the importance of social diversity, people in a magical world of Marcuria show more ethnic diversity than that of modern European countries, but somehow they can't stand to live with those have blue skins. It makes them even more unbelievable as their Japanese, German, or many such contemporary regional names, as the developers decided to name them after Kickstarter backers, apparently.Granted, the plot of Dreamfall Chapters is quite complex compared to others, as it involves travelling across the multiverse and even shaping the reality itself by dreaming. But without strong characters to move the story going, and without sufficient attention to details, it simply feels like a cheap sci-fi comic from an artist with too big an ambition, and not enough skill to realize it. (And perhaps, the notably bad quality of animations and, in some cases, that of graphical effects have contributed much to that feeling.)Understandably, the high points in Dreamfall Chapters, at least for me, were those moments when I could get a glimpse of old, familiar characters like Crow, April, or even Wonkers.Thinking about those beloved characters made me realize that, however may I have been disappointed in Dreamfall Chapters, it's probably because I had such high hopes for the sequel of such a great series - a series which had so many memorable moments which haven't faded a bit, even with the disaster of this game.And it also reminded me that how hard they must have worked to create those games, and even in the times of financial difficulties, how they remembered the promise they made, to continue and conclude the story of April and Zoe someday. And actually kept their words.For that, I really feel grateful for all who have been involved in making of this series. Even though I'm utterly disappointed what it became in the end, I'm now fully aware all my fond memories of the series wouldn't have existed without their efforts.I suppose I'll play TLJ and DF again someday, when the bad taste DFC has left me fades away. And then, I'll probably stop playing at what I believe to be the emotional climax of the series, which was the moment when Zoe meets Faith in TLJ: Dreamfall. And when the credit rolls, I'll try to pretend I didn't know how the story ends and Zoe and April had so much interesting journey left in them beyonds that big cliff hanger.			"

												This review is written after completing book 1, and comes from the perspective of someone who hasn't finished any of the older games. Yes, in my opinion, this game can be played if you haven't played any of the others. It'll take you some time to get into it, but eventually events and things will make sense to you. Obviously it'll be easier if you did play the games though. (I won't discuss any specific spoilers.)I've heard many good things about the games, and when I found out that this game was coming out, I decided to check it out. I like games with an interesting story and choices that will affect how you as a player will experience it.The first thing I noticed about the game before I played it, is that two of the three playable characters are poc, persons of color. Now that wouldn't matter so much if they weren't good characters to begin with. Fortunately, Zoë and Kian are interesting characters. I have more to say about Zoë since the focus of the game was more on her in the first book, but from what I've seen during my time with Kian, he'll have to make tough decisions in later books.The intro chapter of the first book (which I will refer to by its title, Reborn) was amazing. It (re)introduces you to Zoë, what happened to her, where she is, and where she wants to go (which is a decision made by you). In the first chapter, it already becomes clear that she's unsure of her path in life, which makes her a believable protagonist if you ask me. She loves helping people, finding a good cause to work for and she's witty. Additionally, she struggles, just like you and me.I thought the last chapters of Reborn were a little dull. It involved running around the town and finishing objectives, and when I realized I was about to finish the chapter, I felt a bit relieved. However, that's not to say that the entire chapter is dull. [Zoë Castillo voice] ""Nope. Nope, nope, nope."" Like I said, the beginning of Reborn was amazing to me, and throughout the chapter, I've found many little things I thoroughly enjoy. I won't address them here, since I was surprised by them and that's the best way to enjoy something.The voice acting in this game is mostly right. The protagonists have good voice actors, so I don't have anything to complain there. Here and there, there are characters in the game who have questionable VA's, characters who have voices that don't suit their look. But these are small things that won't bother me in the long run.I don't know what happened with these games, and how Dreamfall Chapters came to be. All I know is that the community wanted it to be a thing and it absolutely deserves the praise it gets. Set in a beautiful world you can (mostly) interact with, believable protagonists, an absolutely enchanting soundtrack... if you like this sort of game, please don't hesitate. I believe in the choices I made so far, and Dreamfall Chapters did a good job of reminding me that they will all have consequences... and that I will have to face them soon.I can't wait.			"

												Dreamfall: Chapters is the third instalment in Ragnar Tørnquist’s The Longest Journey franchise and the sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (yes, the way they go about naming the games is somewhat odd). Initially pitched and funded through a Kickstarter campaign by Red Thread Games, the game is split into five books spanning thirteen chapters (referred to as Books) including a prologue, four interludes and an epilogue which took approximately two years of development. For the record, this review is based on a playthrough when all the Books were released.Aside from the great storytelling and a cast of well-rounded characters, if a fan gets asked what makes these games so special, they would easily mention the embodied worlds of Stark (the futuristic cyberpunk Earth) and Arcadia (the magical fantasy equivalent) along with their respective sceneries which suck you in, and Dreamfall: Chapters remains faithful in this regard. Even using the Unity engine, Dreamfall: Chapters manages to create two mesmerising worlds (Europolis and Marcuria) with its own stylised visuals compared to other adventure games utilising the same engine. However, even with the impressive achievements of the engine, facial and (a few) movement animations can look rather stiff, making such observations difficult not to spot nor ignore. Furthermore, that is not to say that the game should not have toned down on the unnecessary overuse of lens flares which can get tiresome after a while. Now audibly, the game features strong voice acting performances from the cast and a suitable soundtrack which fits perfectly with the game’s themes and atmosphere.The combat system from the previous game was ditched in favour of a new mechanic of choice-and-consequence, similar to the one present in recent Telltale games ever since The Walking Dead. At certain points in the game, your decisions will affect how things will play out to some extent. Most of these are only clearly visible in the last Book, and I can attest that some, not all, do manage to have an emotional impact. This clearly provides some replayability, although the game and how the story unfolds remain fairly linear even when you are allowed to wander around the environment which can honestly feel a bit challenging to navigate through at times. So, choose wisely. Now the puzzles in the game are light, easy to solve and rarely give you the sensation of accomplishment (“Oh! I felt so smart solving that!”). Most of the times they boil down to navigating your character to specific locations, going through some long-winded (expositional) conversations and occasionally doing your typical item combinations in the inventory. And I think this is where the game starts showing its first cracks. Because of these so called “puzzles”, there is a great deal of wandering around and backtracking that sooner or later gets dull, especially when you are limited to only two principal locations, Europolis and Marcuria. Throughout the journey, you will be frequently revisiting the same places. Therefore, besides the choice mechanic and solving some of the “puzzles”, that is all there is to the gameplay. It truly feels like watching a movie rather than playing a game. Even older point ‘n’ click games had more puzzles.Apart from some of the rather dull gameplay, most of the flaws in Dreamfall: Chapters are present in the story and narration actually. Now that is already a red flag for a heavily story-driven game. First off, the story starts where the last game left off by taking the role of Zoë Castillo who is trying to wake up from her coma. Later on, the player also takes the role of Kian Alvane, the Azadi Apostle, who is being rescued from prison after being accused of killing April Ryan, leader of the rebels and main protagonist of the first game. It is safe to say that the story feels like something from a The Longest Journey game: unique characters (some are not that impressive), tongue-in-cheek humour, themes of morality, the conflict between science and magic, and lots and lots of conversations. Now that sounds all fine and dandy, but throughout the 20-hours or so journey, the story takes a few major missteps. Right off the bat, the story uses not just one but a couple of deus ex machina to advance the plot which make you roll your eyes. The story has too many convenient moments pulled straight out of its butt and leaps of logic which ruin some of its charm. There is also this side-story of a never-seen before character, Saga, which is told through interludes which the writers tried to squeeze in alongside and make the player feel like it is building up to something immense, crucial to the main storyline. The setup here is interesting, and it does lead to something central to the main story, except the fact that the outcome ends up being yet another unconcealed deus ex machina during one of the biggest turning points in the story with very little coherent explanation. This character eventually meets Zoë and Kian, within various circumstances, to basically tell them “Right, I have this ability that lets me do all this. I have seen the future and this is how it must end, so here is what you got to do. And oh, I just saved your life. I will explain everything soon (hint: not in this game)”. More annoyingly, even when Zoë’s story finally gets a proper conclusion (some things make sense, others remain questionable), it still leaves so many questions unanswered regarding some of the other characters. Moving on, another noticeable flaw with the story is that whilst it starts off well, it gets muddled up somewhere in the middle. Book 3 strongly feels like the story is going nowhere, or at least very slowly, and its only highlight is the return of Crow with his hilarious dialogues. So there are some pacing issues. Thankfully, the last two Books inject some excitement and suspense back into the story when Book 3 almost makes the player fall asleep. Then there is this romance which the writers tried to allude the player into, only to get a hard slap on the face afterwards if you intended to pursue it. What is the point? Lastly, the story has a number of prominent plot holes too, for instance when Kian uses a magic veil to mask his identity and keep himself concealed from anyone he does not want to see. Yet, a kid (who he eventually befriends) is able to see him and the same can be said with a guard during a stealth section. The list goes on. Plot inconsistency is present.In conclusion, Dreamfall: Chapters, despite having the trademarks of the franchise, is disappointing as a standalone The Longest Journey game due to its limited gameplay, lack of puzzles that make you go “Eureka!”, erratic pace and a convoluted plot, but still remains a fairly competent interactive movie to sink your teeth in. As a result, I can only recommend it to two groups of people: firstly, the avid fans who waited 10 years to finally witness the closure of the Dreamfall saga (ie. Zoë’s story), like myself, and secondly, those who genuinely dig interactive movies with choice-and-consequence mechanics. If you are neither of these, then you will have hard time getting any enjoyment out of it and thus I advise you to look elsewhere. In actual fact, even if you simply enjoy interactive movies in general, you still need to have played the previous two games in the franchise to understand the already convoluted story in Dreamfall: Chapters and, hopefully, appreciate it to some degree.Ultimately, I am giving it a “Thumbs Up” since I can recommend it, with huge caveats, to some people in the end. Otherwise, a suitable rating would have been neutral, if it were possible, since the game has a balanced mix between strong and bad qualities. It is just not as great as the original The Longest Journey game, in comparison. That is all.So, are we going to wait another 10 years to finally get back to April Ryan's story?			"

												If you're reading this review and you haven't played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall stop right now and buy them. There are both here on Steam as well as on GOG. If you have played those two already then I’m sure you’re curious if Chapters lives up to being the long awaited third game in The Longest Journey series for almost a decade. The answer is a resounding yes, heck yes. Chapters is already pretty great one episode in and I’m really glad I backed it.Chapters is just as well written as its predecessors but one thing that really stands out is how freaking beautiful and immersive it is. After the first two parts that show what Zoe and Kian have been up to since the end of Dreamfall, Chapters puts you into Europolis, the huge megalopolis that’s Zoe moved to, and for an adventure game it’s a lot bigger than I expected. It’s also really dense without a lot to see and conversations to overhear. It’s really great and something that TLJ and Dreamfall didn’t achieve as well.The gameplay takes a lot of inspiration from Walking Dead and it honestly suits it well. A key difference is that instead of timed dialogue segments that force you make decisions on the fly, Chapters is a lot more contemplative, you're not timed and the characters will actually think about the dialogue options to themselves when you mouse over them. The gameplay is also your standard adventure game point and click fare but the interface is now extremely streamlined and minimalist in all the right ways, especially compared to Dreamfall’s clunky♥♥♥♥♥interface.It's still early to really tell if your choices really make some changes (Though as the game hints, your choices are going to affect the journey, not the destination) but there is a nice substantial deviation from one decision that you can make early on that can lead you to meet different characters unique to the path you choose. So if they keep that up it will be really neat.The end of the first episode also has the best run animation for a video game character I've ever seen.The only negative is that looking at other reviews it seems it's not only me and that the game isn't totally well optimized, the game can suffer slowdown in Europolis and there are graphical glitches. But that's something that can be fixed with a patch so its far from a dealbreaker.Chapters is shaping up to be truly great and potentially the best game in the series. It has all the heart and wonder that the previous games had and then some. Backers have no need to fear and those who didn’t back it definitely need to check it out.*EDIT*New patch rolled out and its definitely improved performance. Now this game really doesn't have any real flaws!			"

												I'm a huge and long-standing fan of TLJ and Dreamfall and had been waiting a decade for the conclusion of this story! I was so excited for this game that, after it launched, I WAITED IN NAIL-BITING ANTICIPATION for all five chapters to be released. The moment that happened, I dropped everything and played this game. And I was so disappointed, I was depressed. Just so you know, I waited a year before writing this review to see if some of the bitterness would go away with perspective. It did not. Somewhere in the span of time that Ragnar took off to make The Secret World, he lost his vision for this series. Chapters became his soapbox. He half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pretty much all the plots left-over from Dreamfall, ruined April's story, and butchered the ending with a random Deus Ex Machina. At the end of the game, you have five chapters of poorly assembled mish-mash, and I felt more betrayed with this game than I did after the ending of ME3.I’ll detail my major issues below, which will include spoilers, so read at your own risk.Ragnar’s Soapbox:I never even considered Arcadia to be a place where homosexuality might be a problem! Don't remember that coming up in the first or second game...but for some reason, in Chapters, being gay is taboo even for super “open-minded people like the Dolmari”. Even though I am annoyed when developers feel like it’s open season on inserting hot-button issues into their products when it doesn’t feel at all relevant to the story, it wouldn't have been a big deal to me if it didn't feel so awkwardly placed. Like the two lesbians in Stark (I can't remember their names) felt totally natural and well-written, but Kian and Likho? Ragnar says he always intended for Kian to be gay, which I have a hard time believing, but maybe so. But Likho? He was once April Ryan's lover, and for him to suddenly be gay felt like a last-minute alteration so Ragnar could make a point, which ultimately felt like it cheapened the relationship he had with April. Not to mention the awkward placement of Kian’s reveal (was completely forced) and the repetition of this fact. For example: in the end of the game, when you are rowing across a lake to save the world, Crow asks you if you were ever lovey-dovey with April just so Kian can reinforce how gay he is. I almost threw my keyboard across the room. Instead of showing us what was happening with the rescue efforts of Benrime and the other captives or how the final assault was going (you never find out about that, by the way) or a last minute heartfelt chat, we need to talk about how gay Kian is ONE MORE TIME. Kian being gay is not what bothers me; the fact that it felt like Ragnar switched things around to make a point that didn’t need to be made in this story and then drill it into our heads in place of other much more important action is.The Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""Resolutions"" of Dreamfall Plots:-Aside from burning April in the beginning, you don't see her again until the very end for five minutes where she basically says, ""Yeah, duh, me dying was me being saved because, you know, it’s hard out here for a pimp."" And then she leaves. I was soooo insulted at how cheap that felt.-""Be careful, Dad. That's not Reza."" Remember that line? Well it means nothing, nada, zip. You start the game off living with him, thinking, ""Oh my gooooosh, how is this going to turn out?! >_< She's in a romantic relationship with a Wati Corp body clone spyyyyyy!"" But no, turns out...he WAS Reza in sleeper agent format...and he was NEVER activated. They made his character disappear halfway through and never resurface until the epilogue with a bit of a confused headache.-Zoe's character loses so much momentum by the end. Seriously, she ""heroes it up"" by being scientific.-You never find out what happened to Benrime. She’s taken prisoner and that’s it. Someone says they are going to try to rescue her, but you never find out if they succeed.-The Guardian. Apparently, whatever was happening between Stark and Arcadia didn’t affect the balance…ONLY IT WAS GOING TO MERGE THE WORLDS. But definitely not a balance problem. Nope. Not one bit.-The death of the White of the Draic Kin. Just not very important other than a passing mention.Butchered Characters:-Kian! He was so strong in Chapter 1, and that's where it ends. He goes from being a warrior and believer who was moved by the rebels and ultimately let down by the corrupt zealots he thought were allies...to being a super bitter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a beard. He was seriously really bland and ""I'll do it...but only because I don't care about anything anymore!"" until he suddenly starts caring about everyone because the plot demanded it.-Kian's mother. Everything about her, her story, her place in the world and with the other characters (especially Crow) was awful, last minute, and poorly explained.-Anna. Really, what was even the point of her? She shows up out of nowhere with zero context and barely appeared again until the very end where she made such small contributions that they could've easily been taken over by another character. She seemed to be there simply to reinforce that Kian is gay, so she was just a hair-clipping nightmare of a wasted character.The Deus Ex Machina:Saga. In general, I liked her character. If you took her out of this game and put her into anything else, I would've been like, ""Awesome."" But in Chapters, she is awful. I don't even care if she's supposed to be April reborn, as many people feel is hinted at. She only exists to resolve the plot because Ragnar couldn't do it any other way, apparently. There's really very little context for her character - you play her at various stages of her life and all you know is she's ""special"". She's special, all right. A special spoiled sassy teenager who shows up at the end knowing everything with undefined powers to resurrect Kian, open a portal between Stark and Arcadia so Zoe can ""science the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this"", and then be the answer to Lady Alvane because PROPHECY so Ragnar can stick it to everyone who spent a decade of their life believing April Ryan was Lady Alvane and theorizing where it was all headed.Final Summation:Just like the Mass Effect series, TLJ and Dreamfall have been ruined for me. I can’t go back and play them again without knowing how the devs destroyed something so interesting and well-written into a steaming pile of garbage.			"

I give the game an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10About the heroesWhen i first started to play Dreamfall Chapters and started to get immersed bit in the story, it felt like it was one of the best games i had play in a long time. I loved the characters Zoë Maya Castillo and Kian Alvane and had a lot of sympathy for both, because of Zoë's captivating story and her way of handling things. Even though she lost her memory and is searching for meaning in her life, her search still doesn't stop her to be there for others. I also respect Kian, an Azadi who gets blamed for the actions of his people. Even when someone threatened to kill him, he still decided to help them.

A few things i didn't like so much from the game: ~The characters aren't walking so fast so it takes a while to get somewhere.(But at least it keeps you busy) ~The mouths of the characters don't always move when they talk.(Didn't bother me much, but it could be a point to improve) ~Both Kian and Zoë have a map each, Zoë's map is easier to use. ~It is a terribly disappointing that after the cliff hanger at the end of book 2 the game is finished, because there aren't more parts yet.This may also have done away with the whole idea that choices you make during the game might influence the course of the later story.  :(  But we will see. :)All in all: I loved it so long it took to play. I enjoyed almost every part of it :D And I hope for future parts of the book to come soon!I give the game an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10As last i want to make a special thanks to Gao Li for helping me with the formatting and grammar of this review :Dт♄αᾔк Տ  Ḡα◎ ℒḯ =)			"

												Update at book three: Undoubtedly the most boring adventure game I have ever played. The characters are so poorly written that you would be better off just reading TLJ fanfiction. Save the money and the time. ---------------------------------------------Original review at the end of book one:Very mixed feelings on this one.+ Very pretty at times+ Music and visuals fit together nicely (atmospheric)[+ Dialogue can be very frank and natural] Update: Nevermind, even this becomes terrible later on.+ Interesting dream world (but very little of it)+ Promising choice system (One my choices was picked only by 1.9% of players. A different choice that was seemingly cosmetic changed my character's career.)- Overtly and self-righteously political (I sincerely hope there is a plot twist coming and it seems like it really might be, because thus far it felt more like really bad propaganda than a political commentary [or a game about dreams for that matter!]. It's two-dimensional, militant and above all unpleasant. There is no middle ground.)- Terrible performance on modern hardware (main hub)- Nothing of essence happens in Part 1 (even the cliffhanger is a little dull)- Dialogue can be really bad and both the main character and her boyfriend sound like incredibly pretentious holier-than-thou typesMaybe it would be better to wait for more parts to come out. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't spoil anything because nothing really happened.			"

												If I was to sum up Dreamfall Chapters in one word it would be inconsistent.  Everything from writing, to acting to graphics and performance has an inconsistency to it.Coming into the game I knew there would be some areas that I wouldn't understand as I stopped playing both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall when getting to Marcuria, this didn't really hurt the experience until right at the end where I had to read other peoples opinions to understand the closing scene of the game.Zoe is a joy to play in this game.  She is well realised and is blessed with great writing and acting.  A couple of plot points in Book 3 feel sluggish for her but in Book 4 she has almost all of the best moments of the game.  Book 5 struggles to round all of her story up and feels like a missed opportunity.Kian has the majority of the weakest moments in the game, with weaker writing and acting, a lack of consistent characterisation and too much tedious hidden object fetching.  The supporting cast of Arcadia suffer from poor acting and writing, and Arcadia itself struggles with being a realised setting with too much anachronistic humour to undermine to plot it wants to host.Saga is a good character looking for a good story.  A fantastically built character that never fits into the story of the game, and then clumsily interjected into the deeper story of TLJ.  The rest of the supporting cast are wooden with a few exceptions (Bip, Nela, Shitbot), with the bad guys suffering from poor acting and nonsensical motivations, with a cringe worthy Anthony and Cleopatra situation becoming laughable in the final book.Outside of the story the character models can vary from outstanding (Zoe, Saga (and family), Crow, Witches) to poor (Reza, Anna and most of the human Arcadia cast, anything to do with The Eye, Baruti).  Animation suffers throughout the game, with cutscenes frequently showing characters rotating on the spot and puppet like lip movements.  A few moments shine through in Book 4 but animation holds this game back in a big way.  Sound design is expressive and has a musical score that is well placed, fitting and emotional.Performance is another huge problem.  I've played the game on a good rig (i7 2600K, GTX 680) with constant frame rate issues even on the lower settings.  I eventually had to play the game on medium and was around 40ish frames, but having to deal with a lot of tearing.  I also have access to a more powerful machine (i7 4820K, GTX 980) which struggled to keep 60 frames on high, let alone ultra.  The game is not bad looking, but it doesn't feel like it should tax systems anywhere near as heavily as it does, especially when it comes to lighting which causes huge framerate drops.I wouldn't recommend the game unless you want to wrap up TLJ saga, but the final Book is disappointing and the ending not satisfying.  The animation and graphics performance problems also detract from the storytelling, but the weakest aspect is the poor and sometimes unnecessary light puzzle elements the game has.  If you have not played Life is Strange, consider playing that instead.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a new episodic instalment on the TLJ series, and a direct sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.The game is wonderfully written - great story, great characters, excellent dialogue and voice acting - and beautifully designed. With two books out, Dreamfall Chapters is quickly earning its place as one of the most interesting games of 2015.Highly recommended.			"

												Recommending this game is hard, it's for the long time fans, but few else.If you've been here from the beginning, or even if you've just been here since Dreamfall, you need to get it. If you're not, then you need to give it a pass. The pacing is awkward, moving fast and doing great narrative points, then spending too long running seeming errands. The small budget shows painfully with grand ideas marred by pedestrian implementation, causing you to run around the same two areas repeatedly for the first four episodes. And it feels like it spends too little time actually building up to its ending.But if you've been here all along, it's the ending you'll want to see.			"

												Truly an incredible game.I'm honestly not sure why developers like Telltale get so much publicity for making games like The Walking Dead while games like Dreamfall Chapters are lost in the Steam store. The attention to detail that went into this game is apparent, the only real gripe I have with this game is that it uses Unity so it runs like♥♥♥♥♥ but that's not really the developer's fault. The visuals are detailed, animations are smooth and actually a reasonable fps (looking at you telltale with 5 fps animations), and the story is cohesive. It unfortunate that it took me so long to find this game, and also makes me wonder what other great games have fallen through the cracks on Steam :thinking:			"

												These are my views and I don't want to offend anyone.Dreamfall Chapters sits ill with me and allot of people might get on my back for my comments. Although this game is based on the original game, this particular chapter continuation isn't very fluent in its story telling or execution (think of it as a dull and very watered down version of the original Dreamfall). Okay, I get it, the graphics are great, the scenery is pretty cool, but the animations are clunky (especially in the cut scenes), and there isn't much fun interaction from scene to scene. The title brags about making choices and that those choices would influence the future of your events. Sadly I found that the choices you made had minimal if any real significance in the game world, and that the game designers might have been better off limiting the amount of choices they gave us. Although the concept seems good, in reality the extra choices cluttered the story and made everything very long winded. The original Dreamfall had a clear goal, a story, it tried to tell you something while it delivered some subliminal messages. It was fun to experience one scene or setting and even more so when you moved onto the next. The game itself also introduced elements and ideas from “the future” that are not in our real world today. Dreamfall felt like it was adding to an already complex world of the Arcadia and Stark by introducing the concept of the dreamer. Sadly within Chapters that entire notion of everything to do with The Longest Journey or Dreamfall is more or less washed out. Often I run around with my character wondering what the hell I’m supposed to do. I never really found myself overly caring about the characters or my influence on them, nor did I care about the main character or the actual story. After a while the constant running around began to kill the notion of “pretty scenery” and it’s then when I started to get bored.What really shook me up was the lack of care in some of the later chapters. For instance, instead of introducing a new place where you could go, some of the chapters take you back to an original place in the story arc and continue to milk on the scenery. I was tired of revisiting areas and by the end of it all I was really happy to see something new. It’s not that the areas were bad, it’s mostly that they were very underdeveloped. Moving on, the animation in some parts was really dated as the models of the characters would be very stiff and un-animated. I felt for the most part that the animation team was lacking care or they were underpaid or perhaps just lazy… The customization of your character, well, there isn’t any, and I felt like with more interactivity or clothing choices and intelligible NPC’s, things could’ve swung for the better.If you are looking into Dreamfall Chapters I would probably disregard this game. It drags on forever, and although it has some fun and interesting moments, they are generally baseless and bland. The scenery is beautiful, but t’s often forced down your throat. The characters are alright, but nothing to get worked up about. There is no customization, the interactivity is minimal, the cities although cool (on first glance) begin to show a very repetitive nature to them. This game feels like it should have been released in 2005 maybe even 2006, not 2015-2016.Oh boy.So to all the new players and Point-Click enthusiasts, go back and play the old ""The Longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall"". I would skip this series or only get it if you really liked the first two. In my case I liked the first two, and now I’m stuck suffering through these chapters.			"

												This review is updated up to Book Five.Basically, playing this game is like watching a film that stops every five minutes, and continues only after you walk around your house three times. Even though saying that, books four and five have MAJOR improvements compared to the first three, and are more streamlined and less running around randomly.5/10The good:+ A direct continuation to TLJ and Dreamfall, and a satisfying conclusion to the whole series.+ Very good graphics for the amount of money they had. The game feels AAA.+ Some characters are fun and unforgettable (Zoe, Mira, Shiit-bot, Bip, Crow, and the Yaga).+ Voice actors or the above mentioned characters are great.+ Specific scenes from episode four (Yaga and Oular Village) are just done beautifully.The bad:- Technical Design. On my Windows 10, Intel i7, GTX560 with 10GB RAM, the game barely scratches max FPS on the lowest possible settings. Sometimes it lags even then, not to mention heating up my GPU drastically compared to other, more demanding games. It feels like too much time and money were invested on looks only. The game lacks many basic animations. When a character picks up an object, jumps, falls or fights, even just stands still, most of the time it looks unnatural. Loading times aren't the best.- Fake length. You move slow, even when you run. You can skip most of the scenes and lines, but there are many random unskippable scenes or dialog lines that must be fully heard - which freezes the momentum of the game. If you read the subtitles faster than the characters talk (which you probably will), you can't always skip them. I found myself yelling at the game more than once to ""get on with it!"". If you've played the first Assassin's Creed, you know what I'm talking about. Each book takes about 3-5 hours to finish, but if every scene and dialog line were skippable, if you didn't have to mess around with the maps so much and if you wouldn't run so slow or be forced to walk for certain scenes, they would take about 1-2 hours (while still listening to lines casually).- Bad gameplay and puzzles. The most common puzzles are to reach from point A to point B, find an item by ""pixel hunting"" in a 3D world, speak to a certain character or just wait. Sometimes there will be action scenes, like sneaking behind guards or avoiding enemy attacks - which are done as poorly as possible. You will have to walk for tens of minutes without any sort of a fair guide. There are certain spots where there is a map stand, which you will have to find, reach, look at and analyse. Using the map to find out where to go is a must, and is probably the most annoying and common task in this game. A good puzzle gives you the solution in front of your eyes, and you only have to find a way to solve it by connecting the pieces. This game hides the pieces and forces you to find them in a big and uninteractable environment, and is punishing you by making you walk even more.- Soundtrack is not interesting. With the exception of the background music for the Oular village from book four, which is the single music track in the game that I noticed, the music is not as interesting enough as to be in a story based game. Both Dreamfall and TLJ had great OST, and I really wanted to hear Bjørn Arve Lagim's music again.- Overall annoying characters and mediocre voice acting. Most characters are boring or annoying. This includes mainly Kian, which was not interesting at all even during the original Dreamfall. It might be because that is the nature of those characters. Most are plain and uninspiring. Some favorite characters from earlier games had their voice actors changed. Without spoiling any appearance or non-appearance of April Ryan, changing her voice actress, for example, would feel horrible to old gamers. Some characters suffer this fate.- Useless choice system. The choice system feels useless. The choices never felt important or in place. The game keeps telling you ""This character will remember"", and ""This will have consequences"", but you never feel that your choices matter. At the start and end of each book you will be reminded that ""Your actions DID matter!"" and that ""Your future has changed!"" but it feels like the game is pathetically trying to defend a flawed mechanic that it wasn't built to hold, and might have been implanted only to draw fans of the genre.You would rather play Life is Strange or ANY Telltale game. Some choices have such bad balance between them, that one of them is clearly the ""right"" one, and according to the book-end results more than 90% of the players chose it. If the game wants me to make a specific decision, why include a choice at all?- Bad writing. There is no clear objective at any point, and you don't know or care most of the time.Cliché and expected lines. Kian's parts especially are a ""snore-fest"". The story as a whole is just not interesting and barely moving forward. While TLJ was one of the most interesting and inspiring story based video games I have ever had the honor to play, Kian saving the world from his people or Zoe finding out that everything is a conspiracy is hardly interesting, compared to April in TLJ, which always had a clear objective that lured me to keep wanting to help her.In conclusion:Even a story game should stick to what it knows. This game is heavily based on the worlds of the two previous games, TLJ and Dreamfall, but the new story is unlike them at all, and this game tries to be many things it isn't: It tries to be a Telltale game by including a choice every second, and it tries to be Game of Thrones by including so many war-politics, both which only hinders the game.The fourth and fifth books tried to change things, and felt much more like the original Dreamfall (which is still light-years below TLJ). It's an improvement, even if it might be too little and too late, but let's face it, no graphics, sound or story can save a game from horrible gameplay.The worst things about the original Dreamfall was how much backtracking, walking and running we had to suffer. There are no fighting scenes this time, which is a good thing, but the long and tedious runnings are still here, not to mention an unrelated action scene here and there with Kian, and these hold the game back from turning into the beautiful masterpiece that The Longest Journey was.The game is long not because of its content, but because of how much time is wasted by reaching from point A to point B, and only after you find out where point B is, and it is SO hard to find out where to go, even if you know the name of the place. Like I said at the beginning, playing this game is like watching a film that stops every five minutes, and continues only after you walk around your house three times. Although, again, this is true mostly to the first three books.I had bad Kickstarter decisions, but this is the worst of them all by far. I did find the ending of the game quite satisfying in giving a complete conclusion to many open threads and characters in the whole series, and the final scene placed a smile on my face, but too little and too late. During most of this journey I was screaming ""I don't care about Kian! Go back to Zoe and let me play the game!"" and I would have rather watched a let's play of it on Youtube.			"

												As someone who deeply enjoyed Dreamfall and The Longest Journey, I waited for years for the sequel, and I was completely disappointed. The only good aspect of this game is the graphics. Zoe is utterly boring and unlikeable, and the game pushes a political agenda which is the last thing I wanted to encounter in a fantasy adventure game. I have not finished it and I do not think I will be able to. Coming from someone for whom Dreamfall was a favourite, this means quite a lot.			"

												I have played this one first. By the time I end book 4, book 5 was not even yet announced but I already didn't had enough of it. That's when I found out there were two other Dreamfall Chapters Games, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall; the longest Journeyand obviously, I bought those two too. And how I loved it. this game, the people, the worlds, they all have a special place in my heart and I'm heart broken that on June 17, the journey will end. I highly recommend, not only this game, but also the other two games.			"

												The writing is impecible, hilarious, and at times moving.  The images are colorful, artistic and wonderful for an indie game.  The music is very atmospheric with some good mood elements.  The gameplay itself could use a little harder puzzles but this first episode kept me busy for quite some time, so when the entire game is finished it will be a decent sized game.  All in all it's a worthy sequel and adds to the wonderful univers of The Longest Journey.  I look forward to more.			"

Absolutely gorgeous graphics, wonderful, engaging music that fits the context, great stories, good controls (at least for me, using a mouse and keyboard). I thoroughly enjoyed this first part and I cannot wait for the next part! (Ok, I CAN wait, I would just have loved to continue straight away :P) The team has done a wonderful job!			"

												Just to sumarise what I'm about to say, everything about this game is high quality in terms of graphics quality, sounds/music, art style, story, voice acting, controls, creativity, basically anything one (or me at least) can think of about a game that's story focused, the game has it all in great care.The game has gorgeous graphics in terms of technical power (effects, textures, animations) and art direction, with smooth high quality soundtrack that conveys an epic sense of journey, also the great voice acting for the game that's almost fully voice acted with a ton of different types of accents.The story is interesting and compelling, with different scenarios happening that goes alongside with how you play with different characters other than the main character in a different world and time, and these worlds are believable ones to be in, especially the city where you mainly play in as the main character with how one can tell and differentiate one area from another, and so memorising the city slowly becomes accomplished, looking at a map becomes a useful tool to check where you're going rather than using it as a guide for the rest of the game.Although at a certain point in the game i found myself where i couldn't find the place where the game told me to go, while this annoyed me a bit i found it enjoyable to go and find it myself, thinking that the city is an area where i can see myself go to in real life, and that's kind of a great feeling to having while roaming the city, trying to find the place you want to go to. I guess instead of thinking this as a negative, I'd go with 'bitter-sweet'.The choices the game presents you with are vague but described correctly and not falsely, in which case it falls back to the person playing on which of the choices is the best one to choose, putting serious thought into a choice keeping in mind that something might happen later on.And so at the end of the game, book one out of five, the game reminds you of the choices you made and how each one will effect the story and character(s) throughout the next chapters of the game, with a ""what other players choose"" which is neat. Having the game push the idea of how the choices you make or have made will have meaningful changes or consequences later on, and whether that's true or not, having you believe it, believe in the idea that you're choices actually has an impact, is a great point for a story focused game to have.Overall i love the game, from the technicalities like the graphics, sounds, level design and controls, to the design choices like the art style, level design, characters, to the story and how there's a lot of mystery to it. If you want the full package with the full story and content, then wait until all of the chapters are out, but i do recommend getting this game, saying it's well worth the asking price on PC digital stores, and really can't say no to it, heck I'd say this is a GOTY contender in my book, but let's see where the rest of the game goes in the remaining chapters.Shamless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.

												I honestly don't believe that I am actually writing a review for Dreamfall Chapters! It's been such a long wait! After playing The Longest Journey and Dreamfall so many times, finally, finally, the third game in this saga is here.Any true fan of Adventure games should buy this right away. Game is beautiful with a story so rich and voice acting and dialogue so perfect you just don't want to stop playing. It took me twelve hours to end Book One and that's mostly because I spent hours just wandering aimlessly through the main hub, not wanting to start a mission for the ""fear"" it might lead me elsewhere. The world Red Thread Games had created is so vivid and alive you feel like you belong there. And I'm not talking about visuals only, music and ambient sounds are terrific, as well.The puzzles are neat, funny, story-driven and they make 'sense'. The dialogue ""choices & consequences"" is something I was pleasantly surprised by. It was done beautifully and I'm looking forward to see how it will all play out in the following Books.I'm anxiously waiting for the continuation!A huge THANK YOU to the devs that made my dreams come true <310/10 "

												Dreamfall Chapters recovers from its dreary first half to create an interesting adventure and a worthy sequel. The opening few episodes disappoint because they are verbose, uninteresting, and tedious. Even the puzzles can be arbitrary, or illogically linear. The second half marks a dramatic improvement, largely due to returning characters, fantastical locations and concise delivery. It focuses on the enticing parts of the story while avoiding the menial tasks from the opening episodes. If you are a fan of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey then this sequel will deliver an adequate resolution to those dramatic events, and it offers several avenues to continue in the future.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

												I'm going to be talking about the immersion/atmosphere/mystique in Dreamfall Chapters as it appears in Part 1 and appears to be the trend for the currently unreleased parts, i.e. the quality of the writing and the mechanics of how the game conveys you that writing. See other reviews for stuff like graphics and whatever. I played TLJ and Dreamfall in like 2012 or something and loved them so those don't really matter to me too much.Dreamfall Chapters seems to also rely on the story to carry it, but I don't think it will.The expansion from point-and-click 2.5D static background in TLJ to the simple 3D corridor in Dreamfall survived decently well, but Dreamfall Chapters just drops the ball on the atmosphere as far as I'm concerned.With TLJ the technology limitations and game type worked fairly well together. Fixed background allows easily for design to really make it feel more like an art piece and really define what it is that the player sees. The nature of clickable things being part of the fixed background though kept it on the game side via interactive exploration. April growing and shrinking also gave a more effective sense of distance than I think game developers these days are willing to admit.Dreamfall managed to keep the transition to 3D decently since 3D world capabilities were probably fairly limited back then. Our world's cities were fairly narrow without too much ""open world"", but there were enough things to interact with to not feel like it was simply a walking simulator. Marcuria's city was the same way.Dreamfall Chapters however is way too populated with interactable things that do absolutely nothing.What happened in TLJ when you clicked on things and they had no purpose in the story or its progression, it simply gave you no response. There were things here and there you could look into, but there weren't that many and they gave you a feel of the situation, things that felt like they were there to speak for the music, the art style, and the premise of the story.Dreamfall somewhat removed this with its eye/highlight system, but it was a reasonable system. The system had a very narrow range of view when selecting things to highlight, and although scanning was a lot easier than running a tiny cursor over the whole screen, it retained enough of the TLJ spirit to it to feel like I was still exploring and finding things out. The world shown was fairly small, but the way things were talked about made it feel fairly big and alive. Sort of like Remember Me, if you played that. The small corridors with glimpses of a huge world behind it are pretty good design choices. Creating a desire and hinting at it is often stronger than fulfilling a desire that one is unaware of; see skimpy clothing on women and basically any PR/hype for any product before it's out.The population of the world in Dreamfall Chapters completely reversed this. I can remember the look of some people and some of the things of TLJ and Dreamfall. The autotaxi I thought was super neat, and the space station scene and the type of people in it have been strongly imprinted in my mind.Whereas the technological limitations were implicitly acknowledged in TLJ and Dreamfall by its design, Dreamfall Chapters makes it way too obvious to the player. Now instead of a few things that you really pay attention, there's a torrent of repetition. In Europolis no matter what I higlighted in the market I heard the same things over and over again. Why are there 20 or so market tables but only 2 or 3 messages I hear about all of them? What is the purpose of 10 selectable trash cans? The adbots of Dreamfall Chapters nowhere near compare to the Screens of Dreamfall. There's a bunch of people now walking around that I really don't care about, and a lot of things strewn about that I don't know if I should really care about.And I know where every single one of them are because with almost no effort on my part any time I look in a general direction, I'm told exactly what is and what isn't selectable.There's something else that causes this complete lack of atmosphere or mystique.It might be the writing.In the opening of TLJ and Dreamfall we're introduced to a bit of the mystery and the scale of the story we're about to uncover within the first several minutes of the game. TLJ opens with a girl in underwear clearly from a time and place we can relate to and in a world which is clearly not. Dreamfall opens largely the same way with some vaguely modern guy with a bunch of kooky priests doing kooky stuff.There is none of this in the opening of Dreamfall Chapters. We're told everything matter-of-factly, Zoe Castillo seems to perfectly know what she's doing except when she doesn't, and whatshisface opens his mouth too much in too many stupid ways and there's nothing amazing about any of it at all. Storytime used to be this really unknowable timeless place, now it's, oh, it's basically just where dreams happen. And we have this guy who has a poor command of the english language who appears sometimes. And we have superpowers somehow. We're told that we need to go back and stop the undreaming or something, which could be great even if the intro was poor, but we don't do any of that. We go back into the real world and all we talk about is Zoe's feelings and politics. There's nothing tying this to anything at all.Not knowing the whole story is integral for a story to move forward, but thinking you know the next step is necessary for a story to even happen. April knew what her next step was going to be at all times, even if it was wrong. Zoe Castillo in Dreamfall knew at all times what her next step would be, even if it was wrong.Zoe Castillo in Dreamfall Chapters doesn't know jack about anything and any time she's about to reveal something important, we're told to decide what it's about instead.What was the 20% point for the average playthrough of TLJ or Dreamfall? Surely it's different from this. Looking over various Steam reviews it appears the average time to completion of Book 1 was somewhere between 4-8 hours (mine was 6 at time of writing). I took 13-14 hours to get through Dreamfall and about 15-17 to get through TLJ. I've seen a lot of defenses about how gameplay time isn't representative or whatever and this is true but the flow of the story is undoubtedly different and whether by percentage or by absolute playtime (which cannot be completely ignored) and in basically any story you see by the 20% point or in any game/movie/TV series/book by 4-8 hours in (unless the story is several hundred hours long) you have a fair idea of what is going on. At any time the audience can feel disengaged and you always have to have something around the corner to keep them turning the page or whatever it might be in that medium.There is nothing of the sort in Dreamfall Chapters as far as I can tell.I don't think it is reasonable to say that Dreamfall Chapters is good. I have no real reason to come back to it except for the fact that I backed the game and want to see how things turn out. I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has not already played TLJ and Dreamfall, and even to those who do I cannot really say it is a worth spending money on.For all the reasons that can be said about releasing a game in chapters, it is undeniable that RTG thought that this first book/chapter/part of their game was worthy of releasing to the public and thus fair for any and all criticism. It is not an alpha or a beta or an early release. It is a public release of a section of the game.Unless the design philosophy changes quite radically I don't think I will be changing my recommendation.Oh yeah, ""THIS PERSON WILL REMEMBER THIS"" blares in your face after like every convo choice.It's like RTG forgot ""Show Don't Tell"" is the key to immersion.

												Let me first say that I am a huge fan of the first two games, the Longest Journey and the Longest Journey: Dreamfall. They are my favorite games of all time and I have played through them several times. If you expect this sequel to be anything like the first two, like I did, then you will be sorely disappointed.I played the Longest Journey and the Longest Journey: Dreamfall because of the compelling and interesting storyline, the gorgeous scenery and because I grew attached to the characters themselves. They are the type of games that let you escape into a dazzling and mysterious world with interesting characters that you can't get enough of.Dreamfall Chapters started out pretty well in the very beginning of Book 1, but as the game progressed it very quickly became obvious that the developers of the game wanted to shove their political views down your throat. The political agenda became very clear. For example, Zoë is engaged in a political campaign helping a socialist party, Zoë has a Marxist best friend and then every other girl in the street is walking around with hijab on. I did not buy this game to play ""Politics Simulator 2015"" or ""Baby Simulator"" (if you played this game you will know what I'm talking about).  Dreamfall Chapters is otherwise visually gorgeous, but it lacks gameplay,story and puzzles. It also lacks clues to lead you to the next point.Let me also point out that the dialogue is a lot of times vulgar and forced. They manage to squeeze in profanity where it's not needed. Dropping the f-bomb and saying sh*t several times in a single sentence does not make good or ""cool"" dialogue. It seems like they are using profanity as filler to make up for a poor script. The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are not known for vulgar dialogue and it is not something that needed to be added.The developers have turned a fantastic game series into something bland and stereotypical with political propaganda. Zoë has become someone I don't recognize, doing and saying things that don't fit her personality as I know her from the Longest Journey: Dreamfall. I am also sad about April Ryan.I won't recommend this game to fans of the series, but I will likely continue with Book 3 because I invested time in the other chapters and want to see if there is some hope on the horizon. I doubt it though.I will replay the original games but not this one.Summary:+Visually gorgeous+Zoës updated model is beautiful (except her new haircut in book 3).-Blatant political agenda-Lacks story-Lacks gameplay-Lacks puzzles-Poor and forced dialogue-Vulgar language-Short chaptersTINY UPDATE 6/28-2015:Book 3 left my mouth agape. It was VERY short. I have no further comments as my opinion have not changed for the better.Thank you for reading.			"

												Really wanted to like this game but after slogging my way through I can only say I'm left with a feeling of what could have been. The story is so full of holes and fill in the blank moments its hard to get invested in it at any point in this game. There is just no natural flow to it and the overall pacing is awful jarring you from one story arc to another with zero finesse. The gameplay is simple but is not really well explained early on leading to some very frustrating moments that could have easily been avoided. As for the puzzles some of them are just so ridiculously abstract that you need to keep a walkthrough handy, its the only way to avoid hours of needless frustration. Solving the puzzles offers no sense of satisfaction either there is no great difficulty to the ones that arent illogical they are more like chores than enjoyable puzzles. The graphics are fine and passable and sometimes very nice but they are certainly not amazing like I have seen others mention. The game really chugs sometimes even on a GTX1080! Which is crazy. The animations are pretty terrible and the characters do not behave naturally at all. One final annoyance which I find amazing is that using an xbox one pad is not possible as you cannot use the inventory with the pad! I had to plug in my old xbox360 pad for the xbox one pad to work properly, really this issue has been around for years from what I've read and its still not fixed! If you want a game that will give you the same feelings as TLJ or Dreamfall this game is not it.			"

												Book One=======The long awaited 3rd chapter of The Longest Journey series has arrived albeit in the somewhat unfortunate episodic format.The majority of the first 'book' (Episode) in Dreamfall: Chapters is played as Zoe Castillo, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey's protagonist and the game does a reasonably good job of recalling some of the finer moments from the previous game, however during the 8 years since, you'd be easily forgiven for being confused after the games opening cutscene and it's not till about an hour in that the game starts to fill in some of the blanks. This could have been avoided by the promised Journey: Graphic Novel which was due to be released beforehand to recap the previous games stories - sadly this was nowhere in sight for those who backed the game on kickstarter in the $75 and above tiers which has left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth and ruined some of the experience for me as I was not able to go back and play the first two games before playing chapters.Moving on from this - chapters has started a whole new story in the TLJ universe and one that I'm ready to get involved in, the first episode is clearly aimed at laying the ground work and some will be dissapointed by the fact that half of this episode is spent running around the same environment completing quests that will clearly become big story beats in the future. After a few quests in the main area the game began to feel a little stale and almost like the developer needed to provide filler by making you run around a lot to lengthen the episode. I'm hoping that this doesn't become a common sight as the games remaining episodes are released.One feature that is new to the TLJ series is The Walking Dead style choices where RedThreadGames promise that choices made throughout the game will have consequnces in future endeavors, it's not yet clear if they'll pull this off as well as TellTale(The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us) but it's certainly something I'm excited to see as the episodes get released.In terms of puzzles, Dreamfall: Chapters contains everything you'd expect from an adventure game of this type, from inventory based puzzles (Combine everything!) to puzzles based purely on a piece of dialogue you had with someone an hour ago. I didn't find myself ever getting frustrated with any of them and they all made logical sense unlike some of the series early work(Fans will remember a certain rubber duck puzzle) however some may rightly criticise them for being a bit too easy, which is slightly alarming considering this was the main complaint fans had with Dreamfall: The Longest JourneyOverall if I had to be honest with myself as a massive fan of the previous games, it's really difficult to recommend Dreamfall Chapters as an episodic game and personally I'd wait for the full series to be released, however if you can't wait to continue the story then by all means Book One is still a solid game with solid mechanics that you'd expect from this kind of adventure game and I've come away with a definite interest in seeing how the story develops going forward.

												Been a fan of this amazing series ever since I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, years ago, and I was beyond excited to hear that they'll continue the story that left so many fans with so many questions.Dreamfall Chapters is... perfect!Storytelling, characters, environments, atmosphere... it's amazing!The developers' love for this game is palpable in the quality that they're offering in this game.Without a doubt, my favorite game in the last few years! 12/10A+++			"

												It might be clumsy. It might have ridiculous puzzles and annoying pixel-hunt. It might feel low-budget and a bit naive from the game design perspective. But this is one of the games that touches your heart and stays there forever. Complex and beatiful story. Beliaveable characters you wish to exist in the real world. Elaborately designed setting. A Myriad of meanings and ideas delivered in a clever and accurate manner. Bad news: you won't get even a half of the experience if you haven't The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. Good news: I replayed both of the previous games a couple of years ago and they don't feel outdated at all. And I'm quite sure I'll replay them again despite all good games being released every month nowadays.Many thanks to Red Thread Games and Mr. Ragnar Tørnquist for my personal Game of the Year 2016.

												Oh dear.I'm a huge fan of the first two games, warts and all. Dreamfall: The Longest Journey left the series on a cliff-hanger.  After just completing book three of Dreamfall Chapters I feel like I'm still waiting for the game to really start answering questions left over from the last game; to begin working towards a satisfying conclusion. Gameplay, (what little there is) is stale and uninteresting. The Kian character is dull and uninteresting. The Zoe character, while I like playing as her, is a totally different construct from the second game. Not only does she not even resemble the same character in the looks department but her attitude and speech patterns are different as well. Casually Discarding Damien Cavanaugh the way they  did in Book One was actually really annoying and felt like a betrayal actually. On the plus side Mira and shitbot are really entertaining. I just wish this game felt more energetic, like it had purpose and was leading us somewhere cool and interesting instead of wasting my time with pointless uninteresting errands. What is the link between Waticorp/dreamnet and the Azadi's White Tower in Arcadia?Why did Zoe say at the end of TLF: Dreamfall that Reza couldn't be trusted?What happened to April Ryan? How does she survive (And she does survive as evidenced at the end of TLJ) being stabbed and falling to a dark watery grave?And for the love of the balance, will we ever see Wonkers again?!If you were expecting any of these questions to be answered in books 1-3 you will be left feeling very sorely disappointed. In a way, I can't help drawing a comparison with this game and the writing of the Star Wars Prequels. Nothing really happened in the first two movies, everything was squished into Revenge of the Sith. Is that what's going to happen here? Will we begin to get some meaty story in Book 4 or worse book 5?This game so far just feels like a wasted opportunity to me. I'm hanging in there, but only because I've already pre brought the season pass.5/10 "

												If you like playing through a good story-based adventure game, this one was really, really excellent; BUT if you haven't played the previous two games, you're going to miss out on the full experience. Without that foundation, both the reasons behind what's happening and the empact of certain events in the story are going to be a little more lost than they should. Which makes sense: this project was funded via Kickstarter, so the TLC that went into making this game was very much on behalf of the fans.A couple of pros and cons to note:-They took out the combat mechanic that existed in the second game, which was a good thing, I think. As much as I enjoy combat in games, this series has always been about story, so there's not much sense in the game trying to be something it's not.-The visuals are beautiful, but the character's expressions don't always change to match their emotions, making some moments a little too uncanny valley. It didn't take me out of the story enough to detract from the awesomeness of the whole, but it was definitely a distraction.-Every once in a while, the game doesn't let you use the shift key to make your character run, particularly indoors. As someone who likes to get from point A to point B as fast as possible in games, this was a bit frustrating.-The way the game incorporated choice was one of the best things about this experience. I was really, really happy with how the choices I made through the characters impacted the story in ways that felt meaningful. The choices also felt real: there were the big ones which were obviously a crossroads, choices that would change everything that happened next; but there were also small ones which often didn't matter but which, every once in a while, would have a ripple effect that influenced future events in unexpected ways.-Some things that happen in this story are heavy. The writers are not afraid to kill off beloved characters or wrestle with life's unanswerable questions. If you're looking for a fun, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, ultimately memorable interactive story, you will find that here; but if you're going through some sort of personal existential crisis in your life, you may want to put off playing this game just a little while longer. (Or perhaps an existential crisis would be the perfect reason to play this game? Depends on your personality, I guess.)Again, this game is awesome. You should play it. But if you haven't played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, go play those first.			"

												An absolute must-play if you played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey before. At first I played a slightly different version of Book 1, which had some different game mechanics as the current version but I enjoyed it very much.I'm someone who gets attached to characters, especially (or maybe I should say only) when they are well-written, and have complex personalities. So of course, TLJ and Dreamfall:TLJ had me completely hooked on the story of April and Zoe. I remember very vividly being 16 (8 years ago) and  being completely heartbroken after April had died, and utterly frustrated that I was left with so many questions about the White Dragon, and the 'Undreaming'.  So yes, I became emotionally attached to the characters, and hoped that Dreamfall Chapters would live up to my expectations and be able to answer all the questions while still coming up with a great story. And they absolutely did! The story has fantastic new characters, well-written and likeable (and hateable), while still doing a great job of weaving in old characters, or other familiar things from previous games. That, in spite of some issues which I'll adress later, made the game special to me and made me feel at home in the Dreamfall Chapters universe.Purely looking from a game mechanics point of view, I agree with several reviewers that there is a lack of good, intuitive puzzels. Ok, fair enough, the  rubber ducky and the clamp  wasn't exactly intuitive either, but it felt sometimes as if I just had to look for the one thing in the room I could interact with to solve the puzzel. I'm extremely happy they cut out the combat though, that was completely horrendous in Dreamfall: TLJ. There is a little bit of stealth in the game, but not too much and it works fairly well and intuitively (if you're in someone's line of sight, they'll spot you, fair and square).Voice acting is absolutely amazing,  and I'm extremely happy that they had Sara Hamilton still voice April's character  and with the decision-making mechanic, you can actively alter parts of the story, and face the consequences of your choice. As far as I know,  there a no multiple endings, but main characters will live or die based on what choices you make. Long story short: It's an amazing game so go play it, but not before you have played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey!			"

												This is at true adventure game and a continuation of the Longest Journey and Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters again follows Zoe Castillo, a young woman who first appeared in Dreamfall being asked to find and save April Ryan, the main character  from the first game, the Longest Journey.  Dreamfall Chapter's furthers Zoe's particular part in the adventure in helping to determine the fate of the balance between the two worlds of magic and science, Stark and Arcadia.  If you like mysteries, don't mind fantasy or sci-fi and like agnozing over decisions that may affect your own fate as well as the overall fate of the world, this game is for you.To continue,  I wholly recommend this to people who like TellTale style games, as this game uses the similar mechanic of ""choose your own adventure.""  If you have not ever seen one of these type of tales, which started out in books, it's a format where your actions can lead to different paths or at least a different experience in the overall plot, can flesh out what and who characters are and give you at a deeper understanding of the environment, the story and it's meaning,  and give you a better sense of actually participating in the adventure.  You can actually feel and understand Zoe and Kian's decisions and agonize over them, and worry about what kind of effect this is going to have on the character and the worlds.  Is it going to get them killed? Is this decision later on down the line going to make the end result of the story actually change?The game development team is on the third book in several chapters, and the gameplay is over 10 hours already for $20.00.  That's less than the price of two movie tickets in my state , and there will only be more to come.  With that $20.00 you get to immerse yourself in another world, feel the environment and participate in it, make decisions that may or may not affect your life and well being, as well as the world around you.   Some decisions are quite small and some very large.   Some small decisions actually lead to larger consequences .  You get to participate in an overall mystery and experience more than one world in the combination of fantasy, sci-fi, mystery and ordinary things that are part of life.This game is not for everyone, but neither is any game that you can possibly buy out there.  Some people don't like shooters, some don't like strategy, or side-scrollers, and some people don't like adventure games.  Some people think adventure games should only come in one format and involve tons of mind-breaking puzzles.  Some people don't like certain content.  In the the end, to me It's just like some people preferring hockey over football or baseball.  It's up to you whether you like this game or not.  I can only say in the end though that I really enjoy it and it was worth every penny  spent on it for me.  These adventures are truly different and you can never quite be sure what is going on.I hope that this review was helpful, and I hope that Red Thread Games can continue making adventures in the future that are like this.

												More suffering through the Azadi storyline.  I find Kian to be a completely uninteresting character, and I'm holding out less and less hope that the later chapters will make him more tolerable.  The games use to have a wizard of oz type feel but lately they've been doing their best to kill the magic (literally).			"

												I just finished Chapters and feel like it has been completely overlooked this year. Not present in any GOTY lists, many outlets didn't even bother reviewing it. It only has ten reviews on metacritic!Here are my impressions. I spent last month playing through (first time) TLJ, Dreamfall and Chapters.I have no idea how Red Thread managed to create such extensive (28 hours), almost triple A production on such low budget and small team (although yes, they took some time). I am glad they went to Kickstarter though, because I found this Dreamfall most enjoyable of the three games. But it was a good idea to finish the first two beforehand, the story impact is much stronger thanks to it. And of course, waiting for the full game to be released before starting it - also a good idea. But first, let's get the nitpicks out of the way.- What annoyed me the most was one interface related issue. The world is full of interactive objects and people that Zoe and Kian can comment on with their internal monologue. The problem is, many of them have multiple lines, but the game does not inform when the lines are exhausted. So I often had to hear repeated lines..which breaks immersion a bit. And all that would be needed to fix this is change the color of cursor prompts to grey or something.- Voice acting is, on the whole, fantastic. But there is a bit of issue with voice actor reusage. One in particular stood out for being used for too many incidental NPCs. The fact that it is the same one who voiced Vernon Roche in Witcher series didn't help matters. But he is awesome, at least. And I went through a bit of a shellshock when hearing Zoe for the first time. She is voiced by someone else, but I got used to it after a while, and in the end I liked her even more than in Dreamfall.- Facial animations could use more work. But I understand this was an indie game made on shoestring budget, and it already looks and sounds mostly incredible, so I can't complain too much here. It didn't hurt my enjoyment.- Puzzles were, once again, a bit too vague and obscure. Not all, just from time to time. But I had to resort to guide a couple times, because I felt like the puzzle just wasted my time. The locations are so big that sometimes searching for solution was like searching for a needle in a haystack.- Last issue, framerate. In certain scenes my framerate dropped to fourties. I have GTX1070 so that wasn't pleasant. But given the genre of the game and its beautiful graphics, I wasn't too bothered.Ok, now that those are out of the way. Why would I give Dreamfall Chapters 9/10. The writing, characters, dialogues, story.Chapters start out..strangely. The first two, three books almost feel like they are not even sequels to Dreamfall. Nothing much from the unresolved plotlines is being dealt with, instead it is all about Prague-European-Arcadian politics and corruption. But even there, I already hugely enjoyed Chapters, thanks to its atmosphere and enjoyable characters and dialogue (Sully, Mirra, Queenie..). And then in book four the stakes get raised, Chapters switch into high gear and it is one big revelation after another, right into the beautiful melancholic ending. Few unanswered questions still remain, but I don't mind that. I don't need to know everything. I assume the slower start was done on purpose to ease newcomers into the universe, which is understandable.The location design and their contrast, beautiful. Europolis and Marcuria, both more beautiful and bigger than ever. I enjoyed exploring them, seeing how they change with time and passing chapters. Europolis is a futuristic cyberpunkish Prague, Marcuria fairy tale-like medieval town. And so many great characters, of course Crow, but also Enu, Likho, Shephard, Nela and many others. Zoe rules of course, but Kian and Likho with their buddy cop movie chemistry, growing into regular bromance, were great fun to hang out with. The humor was always a part of TLJ games, but Chapters take the cake I think. All the Rooster and Kitten jokes, the interactions between straight man (wink) Kian and embarrased Enu.. What surprised me though was the swearing. Characters don't mind using some Fks and Cts if they feel like it. But hey, people in real life swear. But it ain't quite as kid friendly as the previous two games. One one last thing I have to mention, the soundtrack. Simon Poole did a phenomenal job with the music, each scene enhanced by the score.Anyway, I am glad I embarked on this Longest Journey. All three games were enjoyable. I am curious what will Ragnar do next. I wouldn't mind more adventures from this world, some day.			"

												Great game and I am really looking forward to the next chapters, I think our long wait have been worth it!! Dreamfall chapters seems structurally similar to ""the walking dead"" game, where choices with consequences seems to be one of the main features, as well as the episodic content. However, unlike the walking dead - this game actually seems like the choices matter more and have real impact compared to ""the walking dead"". The setting is fantastic, the characters are very good as well - especially Zoe. Pros:- The music is immersive, and really really good.- Story is very interesting, very unique.- Zoe is a great character! And there are few games with female protagonists, which is something this industry definitely needs more of.Cons: -A couple ""objectives"" are not very intuitive, and you kinda run around without knowing what to do, this could be improved, but I imagine this to be a question of taste. Regardless, this is a minor issue.- Facial animations could be better.- The city seems poorly optimized performance wise, but it is playable.I would recommend this game to anyone that likes a good story, and making choices. I really liked it, and look forward to new chapters!!! :)The game moves a bit slower than many other games out there, so I would recommend that the player have a bit of patience in order to enjoy it, certain things aren't very intutive and might take a bit of time to figure out - but nothing is hard by any means.

												Gorgeous game, but even further removed from TLJ than Dreamfall was. My biggest problem is that there is no gameplay. The first few stages have a couple puzzles that feel like tutorials for bigger ones that come later, but then it just becomes one big talk-fest mixed in with fetch item/walk around town.Now the original, The Longest Jouney, had a ton of puzzles, even if they were inventory-based. Dreamfall less so, but still enough to feel like you're playing a game. This one, on the other hand, is just dialogue and character development (?). Decisions, how they affect you, etc.I don't know if it's meant to be like this, and the next chapter will deliver on these decisions, but for now this was sorely disappointing.Otherwise: visuals, music, environments are great.Dialogue and voice-acting are usually good, but sometimes a bit off. They do go on and on, though. "

												I can easily say that ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" is one of my favorite games of all time.Much to my displeasure however, this game is _nothing_ like that game.Negative:Techincal issues:First off, let me stress that this is another one of those badly coded Unity games that are becoming a far too common sigh recently.No matter what kind of hardware you try to throw at this game, it will struggle to ever reach 60 or more FPS. Throwing better hardware at it does nothing as it wont utilize the hardware. There is no SLI support either.A real shame and a showstopper.Script:The script is premature and there is a lot of vulgarities that are out of place and _forced_ into the dialog, unfitting for both the scenery and the game as a whole.Comparing the D:TLJ to this is like night and day in how believable it is. It is innocent and beautifully crafted.Mixed:The story is good and interesting, bit i feel like there is too much grinding put in to keep you occupied in order for things to unravel. Running around a city 10 times to find small pieces of <thing> is just tedious.Positive:The artists have done a SPLENDID job on this one, good work, i love it. Really.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is the long-awaited continuation of The Longest Journey (1999) and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (2006). If you are a fan of the previous two games, this one will not disappoint. The first book will take you about 5 to 7 hours to complete, depending on your play style. Several playthroughs are highly encouraged because of the choice and consequence system so you should get more than your moneys worth out of the first book. The game is pretty nice graphically, but there are some issues with lighting and frame rates. The gameplay is what you have come to expect from this saga and mostly boils down to exploration, collecting and combining items and talking with all the different characters. There are occasional bugs but they are never game breaking and they don't take much away from the experience. The amazing sound design and the new choice and consequence system both increase immersion and Stark and Arcadia feel like living and breathing worlds, though the focus of this book is very much on Stark. Most importantly the developers at Red Thread games have managed to create a deep, compelling and mature story filled with amazing characters. This first book will not yet give you all the answers you are looking for, but it does a great job of setting the tone and it made me very excited for things to come.			"

												The conclusion to the Dreamfall saga sure is an amazing one. This game answers the majority of questions left open in the previous games, and delivers some insane plot-twists and heart breaking moments along the way.Good:- Wonderful conclusion to an amazing story- Great writing, great characters, great sense of humor- Difficult choices that have unforseeable consequences- Graphics are pretty good, especially after playing the last 2 games.- Many great throwbacks to the previous gamesBad:- Too many ""find specific object"" puzzles, all of which are annoying- Wondering the semi-open-world cities was nice at first, but got old quickly- Not enough puzzles inside Storytime. Those were the only ones that were actually fun, and there were barely any of  them.- Animation during cutscenes is often very stiff and... well, just bad- Can't believe I'm saying this after the previous game's painfully bad combat system but... I felt a combat system should have been in this game. Kian is a master swordsman and it's a shame that we don't really get to experience that.I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great story - But you have to play the first 2 games before this. The story just would not make any sense at all otherwise.			"

												This game has great potential and I'd really want to like it, but it has many problems. The game is full of annoying puzzles, pointless erands, flat/unwitty dialogue and you don't really get anything good until after second half of episode three. To get this point, you need to suffer through roughly 10 hours of boringness. The last two episodes do have better storytelling and final episode does resolve the open issues from the original Dreamfall. Still, as a whole, the game is very mixed bag and I can't help but to feel unsatisfied after playing it.Problems (detailed list):1) Most of the puzzles are about finding right place to click and then clicking them in right order. Often you have good idea what you're supposed to do, but just can't find any way to do it. It's easy to miss interaction points and the game often hides them until you have completed all previous steps.2) Uninteresting characters, flat dialoque and everything is boring and monotone. I mean adventure games should be fun, witty or at least somehow exciting. This game just isn't. Last episodes are little bit better in this regard, but first episodes are just horrible.3) Filler content (lots of it). I can't help but to feel that some of the puzzles/tasks are there just strech the playing time. The episodic format is probably partly to blame. Each episode needs to be have decent length even if storywise the episode could be shorter.4) Uninteresting story. I kind of expected this game to pick up where the original Dreamfall left. Well... it doesn't. Original story isn't really resolved until in final episode (to lesser extent also in Episode 4). Instead we get boring relationship crap, boring rebels/magical stuff (which although has it's moments, we don't really care about) and other new stuff that is more or less irrelevant to bigger story.5) Character animations are just bad. Nothing quite ruins your character driven story like characters who look like they are some weird robots without any human emotion. I mean the original Dreamfall had better character animations frigging 10 years ago. 6) Game is resource heavy (even after engine updates). I have two years old mid-price laptop, which runs similar 3D games pretty nicely. This game had parts which where barely playable.			"

												The thing about stories and settings, in modern-day fiction, is that there's very little room for innovation or unique ideas to craft worlds without feeling like it's something we've seen before but executed differently.I'm the kinda of person who loves stories that are self-contained without being treated as a brand that inevitably needs to be pumped for money, or more sequels, faster than an OD'ing alcoholic solely for the sake of the former, and not so much for doing something new with the subject matter.The thing is; A good sequel uses the original as a jump-point to take features, mechanics, things that worked the first time around into new and interesting directions -- whereas a bad sequel merely wallows in the original like a pig in a pond of its own feces.Dreamfall/The Longest Journey, as a brand, with its setting, with its story, and as a sequel to Dreamfall, is dynamic, unique and breathtaking. It's been a long in the making but the continuation of Zoe Castillo and Kian's stories of 2006's DreamfalL: The Longest Journey is finally here, regrettably in episodic format but what can you do, right? 8 years has it been since we left off from where Dreamfall ended, which ironically ended in the precise kind of manner I remotely despise about games, as I mentioned a few paragraphs above. Calling it a cliffhanger would be an understatement but it's been so long now that any feelings that have might been on the questionable ending has long passed and replaced with a sense of ""Reconcilliation"" or ""Rebirth"" as the first chapter of the overall experience is titled (or Book One if you will).Chapters make no comprises here. It starts off directly from where the first Dreamfall left off, giving that eerie sensation that it litterally hasn't been 8 years, but both the player and Zoe seems to think so at least, judging from her elaborate inner monlogueging at least. Before we are treated to Zoe, we are presented with a summarization of what has happened, and the world itself -- In Dreamfall there exist two worlds, Arcadia (the world of magic and dreams) & Stark, our world in a distatnt futuristic-dystopian-cyberpunk-inspired-23rd-century-state. This is what seperates the franchise from truly being labeled sci-fi. fantasy, or just generally be restricted by any genre, which gives a lot of free-roam for telling a fantastical story with exostic characters.As soon as that is out of the way we are shortly introduced to a scene that showcases the sounds of a birth taking place, a scene that will make sense if one considers the scene that came right before it, which I'll avoid elaborating on due to its spoilery content, for those who've played the previous games but not this one yet -- Let's just say that it all alludes to the title of ""Rebirth"" as a soothing female narration will point out.It's interesting to note that during the story, there are words that seem to reccur again and again, like reconciliation & remembering, mostly in regards to Zoë's current condition, but consider these words and one will find they mean the same. It goes back to namely; Rebirth, the state of starting anew and building upon the old to create something new.Book One is the story of Rebirth for both Zoe Castillo and co-protagonist Kian Alvane (now voiced by Nicholas Boulton, known for voicing Hawke in DA2), and as all these introductory scenes come together we find ourselves in the company of our heroine, Zoe Castillo -- She's still in a coma and even worse, she's stuck in a limbo called Storytime, where all stories goes to die, as does hers. Having somewhat come to terms with her dire situation, Zoe has garnered a purpose in this netherrealm between worlds, as she's gained powers to manipulate the fabrics of Dreams and thus she utilizes them to guide dreamers who's lost their way, and help them find their way back to reality.Meanwhile, in the world of Arcadia, Kian has found himself facing execution after being convicted as a traitor to his people for things he did not commit in the last game. Memory doesn't serve me too well in regards to Dreamfall with everything, but Nicholas Boulton's voice acting adds that needed sense of despair to a broken man, who's been betrayed and lost so much. It's actually a quite welcoming take on the character with the new voice, but he's not alone, as Zoe's voice is also quite different.Kian, however, soon find himself being rescued by an enigmatic stranger with an eyepatch, who also briefly appeared in the beginning intro cutscene -- He reassures that Kian's story won't end here as he's somehow REALLY important to a revolution that is going on in his homeland and he's the key to turn the tide. It's safe to say that while it is seemingly uncertain how this relates to Zoë's adventure yet, it mostly likely will intertwine with hers in future episodes.Back to Zoe, after having helped a few, poor, lost souls escape their nightmares, she soon find herself being embolded to return to her world, by a mysterious being returning from the last game, called The Vagabond. He reassures Zoë that her story has not yet ended and by returning to the real world she'll have a fighting chance against whatever it is that threatens dreams and everything we hold dear.This is where the meat of Book One begins -- Chapters is largely reflected upon the dialogue choices you makes, specifically one 'major' choice that will change the kind of person Zoe might become as she wakes up again. This is a choice you make prior to this.Moving on from the premise and into the functions of the dialogue that I've been mentioning just now; The occasional dialogue decisions you make are rather well seggregated, and they are written as such not to cater to any pretentious moral compass. It's more or less as dredged in various idealogious, reflections of states of mind, that all seemingly makes sense in regards to either Zoe or Kian's characterization. No choice feel preposterous or even out of character which adds complexity and thus a more fulfilling and engaging experience. It's something I feel developers like BioWare, Sucker Punch, 2k or other developers who've dabbled in awful moral choice system mechanics, never seem to capture quite well.Both Zoë and Kian each have a short inner monologue for every choice you can pick, to truly draw the player into the character's mindset and be able to pick which response seems most appropriate, considering each circumstance. It feels more or less like a neat marriage between the dialogue systems of a few noteworth RPGs like Deus Ex or Witcher, where the moral ambiguity of the Witcher and the easy-to-monitor paraphrasing of Deus Ex's systems come great together. It's gratifying to see that the quality of The Longest Journey franchise's writing is still there, and it shines just as bright with the new addition of a dialogue system for the first time ever in the franchise.The writing being solid as it is only helps complimenting the ongoing process of bringing life to the world of Stark, as you're in the position to roam around the city of Propast -- A cyberpunk, dystopic, metropolitan, totalitarian soceity, where the affluence of Cyberpunk & George Orwell really kicks in -- Corruption, conspiracies,  surveillance everywhere, guard operatives enforcing their authority, junkies, the scum of the underworld, political intrigue etc. It's all of the things I really love from dystopic/cyberpunk/noir narratives mixed into one delicious cocktail. I'm running short of characters, so I'll sum up some thoughts here -- Chapters is what I'd consider a successful kickstarter that delivers, and only truly fails with it being an episodic game,  puzzles being a bit simple and choices more or less feeling like a retread of the pretentiousness of Telltale that amounts to nothing. Each dialogue option however feels intuitive, the world feels alive, the characters are great, writing solid... "

												Instead of writing a long review, I will just say this. By the time you are through with this 20-25 hour long game, you will experience a sense of completion and satisfaction, the likes of which you get from masterpieces such as Witcher III or Life is Strange.I don't usually follow individuals in video game industry but ever since I played the first Longest Journey in 2007, I have been following the games of Ragnar Tørnquist. He has a brand-like style when it comes to complex worlds and stories. Once again he delivers with the 3rd game in the series.A must-play for fans of good story-telling.			"

												I have waited for this game for a long time. I supported it on kickstarter and have eagerly read every update from red thread games. Last night I got access and after work today I finally could try it out.Wow. This game is so full of beautiful images, lovely music and great words.. it is like a poem.. every detail has been polished.. I just loves the mood in this game.. and the mood I get from playing it.. me a man at the age of 41 is almost crying some times.. finally its here and it really is worth the wait. I really recommend to buy this game. You get to experience some really beautiful moments in this game.. and the scenery is just stunning..Buy it.. and tell others to do it also :)			"

												Written before the release of Book 5Beautiful story and graphics with challenging puzzles. The characters are culturally diverse and refreshing. Before you play this game, you NEED to either play Dreamfall: The Longest Journey or watch a complete play-through of it. I skipped playing the first one and haven't had any confusing questions about the story line but the second installment is a must.I've encountered two glitches that were just black screens and were fixed with closing the game and relaunching. It wasn't a big deal because the game auto saves.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, mostly because I've been waiting way too long for the last update (Book 5).			"

												I dunno. I was a huge fan of Dreamfall, but I just am not enjoying a single thing about this new game. After the compelling and well-written Dreamfall, I wanted to revisit this world and find out what happens.But there's some problems. The writing is awful. Too many long expository conversations where people just talk and talk for ages. Lots of obscure (illogical pixel hunt) puzzles. Wandering around for ages with no purpose. Especially when the game unnecessarily blocks off some paths just to add to the unnecessary confusing traversal. I didn't enjoy Shitbot (yay let's be abusive because that's ""funny"" right?), nor the loud mouthed angry owner of the workshop. No-one as nice as Olivia or Benrime. Reza is now a stupid whiny jerk. Character motivations are questionable and inconsistent. The pacing is all over the place. No Wonkers, at least not working.Basically, the writing - the heart and soul of Dreamfall - is just nowhere near as good. Was this a George Lucas moment where no-one said ""that's not a good idea""?I really wanted to like this. But it's just... not fun. It's not compelling. And as much as it pains me given that I'd wholly recommend Dreamfall, I can't recommend these chapters.			"

												Part 1 of Dreamfall Chapters is a great successor to the Longest Journey/Dreamfall legacy. The voice acting is top-notch, the visuals impressive, and the music is lovely. There are so many things to click on, each with several different lines of dialogue, and there are plenty of people to talk to and loads of ambient conversations to eavesdrop on.Although you will explore other places, the bulk of the game takes place in Europlis, a fully realized segment of a cyberpunk megalopolis. It is teeming with people and details: protests, weird fashion, confusing slang, neon signs, hovering ad-bots, vending machines, market stalls, and fascist police shaking people down. There is so much detail packed into this world, and I found it really enjoyable to wander around and soak it all in. Traversing it can be confusing, though there are map kiosks that help to a degree... I wish there had been a map/compass that was easily accesible at all times, but I may just be directionally challenged. The story itself feels a bit mundane at times, introducing characters and setting details by essentially showing us a day in Zoe's life... but the characterization is great, and the dialogue is interesting, clever and at times, quite funny. There is a lot of setup with little conclusion, but hey! This is only part 1.It took me just short of 5 hours to reach the end of this ""chapter"" and I can't wait to see more. I loved both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, and I'm so glad I backed this!			"

												Being a huge fan of TLJ and Dreamfall, I was oh so very happy to finally see this on Steam. As the game progressed, however, my reaction went from excited to slightly bored to annoyed to outright♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.Good things first: it looks gorgerous. No denying that. The stunning landscapes, cityscapes, new and improved characters, it's all pure eye candy. Good controls. And I had no issue with Zoe's new voice.But really, REALLY, did I just wait 8 years to be sent on stupid pointless errands? What happened to Zoe? The cool and spirited, even if confused chick on an epic journey of self-discovery has become a whiny, pretentious git. There are hardly any puzzles. NOTHING of any consequence happens. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's only chapter 1, and it looks like they're focusing on story and character development, which is fine, but come on... throw us a bone here. Even the cliffhanger was blah even if super cute. If I could describe this game in one word, it would be ""bland"".But the main reason this game grated on my nerves was its blatant, in-you-face political agenda. Oh, look, how cute, Zoe has a Marxist friend! And every other person on the street is wearing a hijab! We're told communists are cool, nationalists are ""old white men"" with ""xenophpobic wet dreams"" [sic.] The symbol of the ideology responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people is displayed on city banners and portrayed as ""cool"". WHAT?It's not that the game creators clearly have political views different from my own. I don't want ANY politics in my games. I play them to get away from the sick twisted reality of this world, not to be immersed into it. So thanks, but no thanks.			"

												I already played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall before this game.I'm usually a bit sceptical when great series get continued after such a long time.But this game definitely exceeds all my expectations so far.The story and the characters are so deep, interesting and complex. It's just fantastic!The game also has a rather long playtime. I already have 26 h on record after finishing book 3!If you already played another game from this series you will love this one too.If you are new to the series, but like games with a rich story, you will love this game.

												This entry in the series truly defines ""1 step forward 2 steps back""1. Most of the old characters are cardboard cut-outs now. They don't fit the roles that were set for them in the first and second game. Most painful examples for me are Brian Westhouse and Robert Klacks, they are simply atrocious in this game and i refuse to belive they're the same quirky characters that i loved so much in the past games.  For some reason they've decided to throw Klack's personality development away and make him a villian again, something his character is not supposed to be. The concept of Brian being possesed by an ancient evil is awesome, if not for the fact that they've decided to reveal that Brian's been a bad guys from the start and ancient evil has nothing to do with it, which makes no sense whatsoever.   2. Constant SJW propoganda. Zoe is a strong feminist now that tries too hard to be a wisecrack. Also Kian is apperantly gay now which also doesn't make any sense considering how he speaks of magical women back in the second game. It just feels like they've tried to highlight every character by being a social minority to make you feel for them. Most of the new characters are empty shells that shove their sexual preferences in your face. 3. Previous games loved to make fun out of cliche's, but this game is full of them and they're all put in there seriously. New plot material makes no sense and is poorly explained. I couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the whole ""first dreamer"" thing and i wished it would take me back into the Draic-kin era where lore is plenty and actually makes sense.Which reminds me that we've never got to see Chavez again, while promised. Few new magical races still remain a mystery, like grubbers. It has been stated they would play a critical role in the plot but it doesn't feel like they did.4. A lot of opportunities to build awesome characters were missing in this whole murky mess of a story that jumps from one part to another. A lot of stupid decisions where one insignificant part overstays its welcome, while obscuring a more important plot details. The only story parts that brought a smile on my face were Saga's, i wish this game would just consist of Saga's adventures alone while they would try to refine the true sequel's plot more. But woe, this opportunity were wasted and there's no turning back. What's left is waiting for the bad aftertaste of Dreamfall chapters to dissapear and just remember the good parts, while making up for the bad parts in my own mind.			"

												After more than 15 years, one of the best adventure games finally came to an end. Short review: This game is a must-play for those who enjoy adventure games, captivating (albeit confusing at times) storylines and beautiful visuals. No need to wait for Steam sale.Long review:: My heart feels heavy saying goodbye to this series. It's far from perfect, but I felt close to the main characters. So this is like saying farewell to a best friend of 15+ years.Pros:- Beautiful visuals- Interesting main characters- Easy gameplay- Engaging storyCons- Puzzles were too easy- Dialogues can be unnecessarily long-winded- Complex storyline with some unanswered questions at the endThe Longest Journey still takes the cake in my book, but at least Dreamfall Chapters is much better than Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, in my opinion. But anyone serious enough to fully immerse themselves into the story should play the whole trilogy. It's worth it. "

												First its really hard to explain the entire premises of the game unless you play The Longest Journey, followed by Dreamfall: The longest Journey, or watch it on YouTube. This is not a pickup in the middle and you'll get things game. It is a continuation of Zoe from the last Dreamfall that completes the entire epic journey between Arcadia and Stark. That's pretty much all I can say without giving too much away. I have to say the gameplay, story, music, was all perfect in Chapters. The ending was amazing, leaving me completely satisfied. I didn't like the second game in the series, but I recommend at least watching it if you don't want to go through the trouble of playing it. The first Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters though are amazing. They have a solid story line, well-developed characters, and depending on your decisions, at least for me, a really good ending. And if you have played the first The Longest Journey, basically you get to see everything in 3D that was 2D in the first game. I really love that they brought back older elements but updated them.There are some things left a little bit of a mystery, but they may have been solved if I made other choices in the game. I will have to watch YouTube and figure that one out for myself. Otherwise, if Red Thread games comes out with another game similar to this I will certainly support it. I completely recommend this game!!!			"

												Powerful story!  This all started with ""The Longest Journey"" from Funcom, followed by ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"".  Dreamfall Chapters picks up where Dreamfall:The Longest Journey left off and finishes the story.  You don't have to play either of the first two to start Dreamfall Chapters (there's a story recap video to get you up to speed), but it does help.Now that the story is over, am sad to say goodbye to characters that I've enjoyed spending time with over the last couple of years.The game reminds me of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" D&D books I used to read growing up.  There are decisions you'll have to make that'll affect the story - sometimes in a big way, others not so much.  Am looking forward to several replays to see how my decisions change the experience (and spending more time in a world that I've come to love) :)The graphics are awesome, the music is enchanting, and the characters are endearing.  Thank you so much to the team that made this game! "

Posted: November 1, 2014
												I awaited this game impatiently and this is the result of more than 1½ years of production? Sorry RTG but you dropped the ball here. Hard. SOME SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!The following recommendation is based on Book 1 and 2 and may be altered later.There are two things that stand out of the things I felt most let down by.BlandnessYou start the game out with some awesome abilities, a very interesting way of showing what has been going on from Dreamfalls ending. But how is this described as an adventure game? There is no adventure. There is almost no “game” either. The most exiting part of the story is that of Kian. There is some mystery, some story and at least one interesting character to chat with. The rest is just meh as it is so bland, so nothing, that so much of what you do, despite the “NAME will remember this.” and “This action will have consequences!”, feels so uninspiring and meaningless. Yes, they do matter, but the way these messages are shoved in your face over and over just gets repetative and you stop caring.For a game to be a game at all, it needs a block. In action games, these are the form of bosses or levels. In adventure games, they need to be puzzles, quests or social interactions. Something to block the path of the game that makes you stop, think, and maybe get the correct answer, or the wrong one, or just pick one out of several bad ones but bad in different ways.There are two types of adventure games. We can call them The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, as they both symbolize each side well. TLJ had puzzles, most of them were item puzzles that gave you a inventory where you had to keep many things that might come in handy later on. The items combined with the story to make it feel interactive. Like “I did that!”. Today, we have for example the Deponia series bring up this kind of adventure game again. In Dreamfall, this was replaced with environment puzzles and social puzzles, much like is the fad right now with The Last of Us leading the front. This lowers the intractability of the game, in place for a deeper written storyline, with characters developed much further.Dreamfall chapters is so far the worst possible outcome, where it has very few challenges. Kians Informant and dock puzzles, plus Zoes steam vent puzzle, show that the game developer knows how to do them. I am just so very confused that after two chapters, there has been basically 1 blocking challange.The social side of the story is abysmal. The most glaring proof of this is the shrink section. Every positive rewiew speaks paragraph after paragraph on how gorgeous the scenery and background is in this scene. I agree. But what seemingly every single person did was get stunned by the graphics, and stopped listening. The dialoge is cramped. Stuffed into a tiny box and delivered in the most awkward way. This would have been more approperiate if it was the first session but these characters have met eachother for 3 months. Everything they talk about have already been talked about before. So why does the characters edge towards eachother like it is the first date of two extremly shy individuals? The scene makes no sense, especially when the narritive throws several curveballs in players faces that have played the former games. If you fail the conversational roadblocks, the game handily removes the wrong answer you picked last time. It is hand holding in the worst kind of patronizing ways. Information as to what you are doing is withheld as much as possible. The weel of interface is severly lacking in descriptions. For example. You need to pick a suspect of selling out information. You can Eye each person in the market. Once you Eye, there is a Hand. NOTHING is mentioned on what these actions DO! You have to guess, and guess what? The Hand instantly makes your pick, no confirmation box of any kind and it is irreversible. Want to try again? Replay the entire game.My gutfeeling is that this was intended, as you need to replay the game at least 4 times already to find all of what can be described as story. But this also means that each character, including Zoé, has nothing behind them. Every character, apart from Queene, Mira and Enu, feels like background characters I will forget within 10 seoconds of meeting them, even Zoes background becomes just a blur of nothingness. It is only in the last scenes of each chapter where we actually see some emotions come out of the main character who up to this point has been almost zombielike in her way to interact. Leading into my next point, the game feels ""cut"". Events, social interactions, item interactions. Anything to make the gameplay stand out is utterly lacking. Again, this feels very intentional, someone saying ""Look at the pretty colors! Look at our fantastic engine!"" in a way that had the gameplay been more interactive, better and more emotions (for a test, let the campain manager get beat up. Listen to Zoes reactions. She delivers them in the most unsympathetic and lobotomized voices I have heard for many years.) it would have removed the players attention from all those great things.Another thing leading into my next point is the save system. You have 1 save file. That is it! You can replay chapter 2 with the same base save file of chapter 1. But if you want to replay chapter 1, you will automatically delete every saved action. Horrible, HORRIBLE made gamemechanic RTG. Every single adventure game, episodic or not, have multiple savefiles. So that you DON'T have to play EVERYTHING over again.TimeTime is an important part of this game. Yet I get the feeling the developers did not have the time they needed. The script is good. Very good in some places. But the delivery of the voiceactors are awful. There is nothing in them. Let the actors have time to get into character. Now, most lines are delivered with horrendously fake voices.Again, time feels off in the game. Chapter 1 takes place over a single day. Chapter 2 jumps a week forward in time. The story takes a jump. And it is falling off its feet. Yes, it tries to move forwards and in some aspects it succeeds. But it feels completley discconected from the first chapter (Zoes story, not Kians). If the first chapter was a demo, I would get it. And it nearly is. The second chapter takes about 5-7 hours of gameplay to get through the first time, where the first took 2-2½ hours. The sinking feeling that creeps in is that ""This game was never meant to be played OR created episodically"". I would still have respect for RTG and Ragnar Thornquist if they had come out in september last year and said ""Sorry guys and girls. The game can not be finished by November. We need another year to finish it."". Backers would have been annoyed but understanding. Developing a full game, from scratch, takes more than 1½ years that they had.Time is something that the game does not give. The replay value should be high in episodic adventure games were you have so many choices, but after playing chapter 2, getting 1 ending, I just felt ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I am not playing through all of that again, just for a slightly different storyline."". This perhaps compared to Life is Strange I have been playing as well. Replayed chapter one 3 times, and chapter two 5 times. Yes, it is a shorter game, but I have more fun, and more interesting choices. The choices in Dreamfall: Chapters are not compelling enough to warrant multiple playthroughs becuase of all the boring♥♥♥♥♥♥I have to go through again. Having 1 save file is, again, horrible for a game like this.Conclusion. I can not recommend this game at full price right now as it is not up to par with what was expected from it. Once the FULL game is done, out, bug-tested and fixed, I may be inclined to change my opinion but as of now, do NOT buy this game.			"

												Gorgeous. Intriguing. Fun. An episodic story-driven adventure about choice and consequence, set in parallel worlds. To be honest, I wasn’t sure how I’d be able to adapt to a 16-year old game (“The Longest Journey” was released in 2000!). There’s clearly a massive fan-base and loyal gaming community. I added it to my wishlist and patiently waited for all of the chapters to be released before making the purchase.Right from the main page, there was an option to “catch-up” using the original cut scenes from all of the previous games (with ever-improving graphics for each chapter). I found this to be a really clever way to get up to speed on the story thus far and see the visual progression through the years. “Chapters” does a great job of catching up new players to the storyline and leading them into the continuation of the series.Huge wins for this game: Voice acting, gorgeous environment visuals, attention to detail, and RPG decision trees (seemed a bit shallow at first… until I realized that decisions I had made in Chapter 1 were altering the game in the final chapters).  For me, about 90% of the puzzles were easily solvable in-game with a bit of exploration and patience. About 10% needed some slight “nudges” from the online community. A few of the quests were a bit over-tedious, but for the most part, the quests matched the story. Great for casual gamers, binge gamers, and achievement hunters.~18 hrs of gameplay for the campaign. Thumbs up for all-around great purchase. "

												A great start for a new journey! Can't wait for the next book!Please note that you should really play ""The Longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" before playing this or it will make very little sense! There is a short ""summary"" of the previous game but nothing about from first one and it's really worth playing for the story and the characters.			"

												This series was an enjoyable experience and I'd recommend it. However I dont think it can really compete with the masterpiece the original TLJ was. The story writing is much shallower yet still overly complex and at times hard to follow. The game introduces far too many secondary characters, whose stories it fails to advance and explore. The main characters on the other hand felt devolved into basic archetypes, with unrealistic but totally foreseeable reactions. The puzzles are almost inexistant- the gameplay is most of the time simply a selection from a number of choices ( a la Telltale Games), rather than the old-school riddle solving I was looking forward to. The world aesthetic is great- both Arcadia and Stark are very convincing and beautiful, but the gameplay does not utilize them, other than as huge areas to walk back and forth in. All the above make for a stark contrast between this modern continuation and the original game. The latter was a fairytale of epic proportions, that hinted at the presence of a living, vast and detailed universe populated by deep and complex characters. On the other hand, DFC feels more like an incosistent mix utilizing almost cheap tricks and cliches, trying really hard to tie loose edges, lacking the subtlety of its' ancestor in how it handles sociopolitical messaging, pushing the plot way past the point of no return.Nevertheless, the game is still good. It's a must play for the dedicated fans of the series, as it finally concludes the story (wether in a good way or not, one can judge on his/her own), and is, after all, more of the universe we fell in love for. I'm not sure how well the game would play on its' own, without prior knowledge of the events and the story that lead up to its' starting point. However, it does give a short recap of the story so far before each episode so I suppose that could provide the minimum neccessary background. Overall, DFC still stands out as a single player game by today's standards. Perhaps comparing it to its' predecessor is unfair, as the standards it set were no less than that of the best adventure game of all time. If I had to assign it a number, I'd probably go with 6/10.

												It is with some regret that I, partially through Book 3, must advise people not to buy this game.Dreamfall Chapters is, frankly, not good enough. It's not smart enough, it's not pretty enough, it's not fun enough, and it's certainly not compelling enough.Which is a shame, because it could have been. Parts of it are good. Parts of it made me enjoy it, even enjoy it far more, or far differently than I normally enjoy major titles from major companies.The central problem is that the game is too in love with its own setting, and its writing tries to brush off its shortcomings with supposedly clever wit to paper over the fundamental lack of actual emotion in much of the character writing. This essentially manifests in the game being worse the more serious it gets, which means each Book is a steady slide towards worse and worse writing.Kian's half of the story exemplifies this the best, and most all the faults to be found in Zoë's story can be found first with his.Firstly, his behaviour and personality is completely inappropriate to the tone of his supposed story. A member of a resistance, a traitor to his own, hunted by his former allies. Yet he and the resistance gallivante about in a bar outside the slum which is frequented also by the soldiers of the occupying force! Much of his dialogue consists of the same witticisms that Zoë is fond of sprouting. He can even come to appear laidback. And then the moment a more important scene occurs, all this characterization is cast aside for some nebulous serious personality that seems largely unconnected with his general behaviour.What is worse, Kian's wit is rarely funny, and the gallery of rogues - really, three other characters in total - is distinctly unimpressive, and sadly one-note.The resistance proper seems to be driven exclusively by the actions of three individuals and one urchin boy, and their grand plan is nowhere to be seen.What, then, is there to invest in? For what reason might one care about Kian and the resistance?I cannot answer that question, because to my mind, there is nothing. All that seemed like it might have been worthwhile turned vacuous and meaningless the more it was dwelt on.But Zoë, then. What of her? Is there at least some merit to her story?Some, yes. Fundamentally, Zoë, almost solely from breaking mildly with convention, and from her archetypical pluck, manages to hold on to some coherent characterization. But it doesn't seem able to last. The pressures of the plot are driving her into a role that the writing cannot sustain, and her coherence and integrity seems to dissolve as she reacts in the same blandly determined manner to any sort of challenge or setback.And in the end, the core plot itself is simply not interesting enough to sustain the game on its own.

												First off, the game looks absolutely incredible. It is a huge leap from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, some of the characters I had trouble recognizing. Visuals aside, the story finally continues the story of Dreamfall, and it is doing it well so far. It definately is on par with Telltale's The Walking Dead in terms of the storytelling department, as there is plenty of ""feels."" Controls are completely changed and makes interacting with objects and walking around a lot more easy, you can even play the game with just the mouse so that you may pick your nose while you play! The voice acting is supurb and believable, some of the dialogue is comedy gold. The music really sets the tone and plays a big part depending on the situation, really well done. The animations are vastly improved from the last Dreamfall, naturally. There's many choices to make to alter the outcome, they will all have concequences. I wished I supported the kickstarter back in 2013. If you even remotely liked The Longest Journey, or even Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, pick this up. It certainly was worth the wait, unlike Duke Nukem Forever.			"

												I was very disappointed by Dreamfall Chapters, and I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Moreover, after playing Dreamfall Chapters I think it would be wise to have a healthy skepticism towards any future game by Red Thread Games. - The worst part of this game is the story. There are so many plot holes and bad, or lazy, writing. I am honestly unsure which description is more fitting. - The game ignores big parts of the story from the previous games - there are for instance almost no references anymore to the Draic and many questions from the previous games are left unanswered. - Most of the characters lack any dept or charm. Their personality have often changed drastically from the previous games, and not in a good or even logical way.  - The game is trying really hard to be political and make references to contemporary events. However, it does so in a almost childlike manner, it comes off as very crude and simple. - There are a lot of bugs in the game. - Your characters move so freaking slow - and I am sure this was done on purpose. You probably spend 40 min extra on the game due to how slow your characters move. - The game offers a very unsatisfying ending to the entire franchise.			"

												TL'DR:Not really bad, rather very disappointing and worth neither the time nor the money being asked for it.----I really don't think I'm that impressed with it.The story and some of the characters: amazing. Especially Zoe, she's really well done with her thoughts, her voice lines, her script, it all comes together beautifully.But in contrast to that, it also has:- A very boring secondary main character.- One-dimensional and mostly pointless NPCs.- Lots of technical issues- Pretty bad graphics all in all with low resolution textures, lots of popups, clipping *everywhere* and very amateurish and stiff animations- Insanely convulted and nonsensical puzzles. And I know point&click games are known for this, but this drives it through the roof and puts it right up there with Cognition or so.- The first chapter had an interesting hint system in the inner monologue of the characters. This seems gone from chapter 2 onwards, probably due to time constraints (played 4 chapters and 2-4 felt *very* rushed).Now, don't get me wrong, like I said above it's not really terrible. Just disappointing, half-baked and really not worth the name, the price of the time.There are *far* better point&click games with more than one interesting character and a sensible story out there.

												At times, I really like playing Dreamfall Chapters, while at other times, I'd rather claw my own eyes out. Only two choices here - (Recommend) Yes or No. I have to choose No, because the drawbacks below outnumber and outweigh the benefits.+ The basic ""choice and consequence"" mechanism and different story paths are the meat and potatoes in this genre, even though the consequence part seems minimal so far into the story.+ Some likable characters, such as Mira and Shitbot.+ The male protagonist is interesting and could use more screen time.- The large areas are like labyrinths and a total ♥♥♥♥♥ to navigate, even with the laughable ""running"" speed. The maps are completely useless.- The amount of running back and forth, all over and over again, is totally out of control.- The dialogue is almost impossible to hear at some points, while it's crystal clear in others. Even if you turn down the ambient noise and music volume, the main character's mumbling from the bottom of a metallic barrell is impossible to hear over the maddening, repeating cries of street vendors. How could they screw this up this badly???- Endless, pointless dialogue between playable chapters that goes from nowhere to nowhere.- Completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ political theme. The story forces the player character to do campaign work for the developers' favourite political ideology - one that has been in steady decline everywhere for several years now but is supposed to be on top again 200 years into the future. The alternatives? Marxists and fascists. 200 years into the future. I mean, seriously???- The female protagonist is a wimp and the infantile story needs a spine, while the writers need to lay off the weed.- The graphics engine looks less than spectacular, but makes the cooling fans in the graphics card whine at full speed.

												(I might have to update my impressions in the future, since this game is episodic and only one chapter is available for now.)I was expecting this to be longer than it actually was - even as a first episode it felt like nothing happened; there was no hook. Gameplay-wise, this is even more removed from TLJ than Dreamfall was. In the same amount of time I played this first ""book"", I'd have had a fair few interesting and challenging puzzles and there would have been a few events that really piqued my interest  in TLJ . None of that in Chapters so far. As far as ""puzzles"" go, you're just sent around to fetch stuff and to talk to people. Don't get me wrong: I'm fine with games that are mainly story-driven, but I would have expected some puzzles from a game that's a successor to one of the best point-and-click adventure games (even if not directly, it's still part of the same series as TLJ). And the events that are there are simply not making me curious as to what will happen next. Miscellaneous nitpicks: I found a fair few graphic imperfections (seams, floating objects)  and even managed to get out of the map once. The dubbing is OK; but no more than that (Zoe always sounds fairly detached, but she was like that in the previous instalment as well, and I can see why the devs might not want to choose another actress for the characater). I felt that one of the choices with Reza was a bit accidental for me (I walked towards him and expected to argue some more, not to do the complete opposite - a more explicit choice might have worked better there).The thing that might make things interesting is how the choices will affect the next chapter.For now, I can't say I'd recomment this. I'm hoping the new chapters will actually have some gameplay or introduce any foreshadowing or a hook of some sort.			"

												I recently finished playing Dreamfall Chapters Book One and thought I’d post my thoughts while it’s still fresh in my mind.I should start by saying that this is definitely NOT a game for everyone. If you’re new to the series, it likely won’t have nearly as big of an impact on you and you’ll be a bit lost at times. For those gamers like myself who have been waiting for a continuation of the series for YEARS, this is a fantastic continuation of a great story.PROS:-    Fantastic storytelling. Character dialogue is fresh and engaging.-    Nice graphics. I wouldn’t go so far as to consider them “amazing” but the in-game graphics definitely hold their own amidst other indie current-gen titles.-    Great music. The soundtrack stands on its own and provide nice ambient mode.NEUTRAL:-    Mediocre gameplay. Very similar to Telltale titles, the gameplay here is very simple and essentially consists of navigating to certain areas and talking to various NPCs. It’s a bit disappointing considering that the original title dating back to 2000 had TONS of puzzles to solve and variety. Oh well.CONS:-    Busy work. I hate to say it, but some of the later actiivities in Book 1 seem like busy work. Essentially “here, go talk to XYZ and fetch ABC.” I can forgive that for a bit but after awhile, it gets old and tedious. Especially when certain objectives are on opposite sides of a given city scape.Final Verdict: Strong B+			"

												Buggy and far removed from the story telling genious of the previous two games. I'm not sure how else to put it, it is BORING. The story, in the first chapter at least, doesn't really go anywhere; it didn't leave me with the want to know what comes next (a first for TLJ series). The ""person-X will remember this"" mechanic removes all subtely from the story and your desicions and is also a very blatant rip off from Tell Tale Games.  I'm very dissapointed thus far as I'm a HUGE fan of the series. Here's to hoping RTG reads the more critical reviews and somehow pulls a 180 with this game.			"

												Really interesting story with choices that have real consequences. It can be confusing at times, but it's compelling regardless. Good writing, good voice acting, great character designs and environments.Two cons:- Absolutely abysmal dialogue and cutscene animation that looks even worse because of the good quality models and textures. It initially detracts from the voice acting, but you get used to it after a while.- Some puzzles are very poorly designed. They're either treasure hunts in large, sparse environments, or an exercise in developer mind-reading. If it takes more than 5 minutes, Google it, and marvel at the obscurity.Get it at full price if you're okay with alternating between being really impressed and being slightly annoyed. Well worth it on sale otherwise.			"

												This is the final installment of a very long story. If you want to fully appreciate this game, I would definitely start by playing The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. Though there is a recap of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey that you can watch before playing this, it is a very complicated story that's best appreciated if you've been a part of it from the beginning.The story is everything in the Dreamfall series. Which is why it is easy to overlook performance and optimization issues... If you are running a lower end graphics card, be wary of frame rate drops... lots of them.All in all, I love the series and I am extremely happy with all the puzzle pieces finally being put together after all these years. The game looks pretty, but I feel like it's lacking in polish... Which I feel is due to pressure of releasing the game to the timeline promised during the Kickstarter. I’m hoping the devs will continue to improve the game past release. I know they’re planning on releasing other titles, fingers crossed this one doesn’t get neglected in return.			"

Pros:- enjoyable and enthralling story with 3 characters and lots of locations- nice, smooth graphics- good, suitable soundtracks and voices- watching Zoe's butt makes long walking more entertainingCons:- sometimes rough, clumsy animations- gameplay is linear and some puzzles are frustrating- few possible interactions with in-game objects, making it even more linear- minor bugs and glitches, FPS dropsOverall, this game suits for those who enjoy good stories and don't pay much attention to details of game process itself.

												As a huge fan of The Longest Journey story, I was thrilled about the announcement of its continuation. I couldn't wait to sink my mind in worlds again. And now that it's here, it did not disappoint. It truly marks a beginning of the part of an incredible story.Few glitches here and there, although the studio with relatively small staff count works pretty hard to amend all of that.---------------------------------ADDENDUM (2016):It's certainly been a long journey in the making, and after playing this from the start to the end, I think I should convey my feelings about this game.I want to start by saying that I stand by my words: this game did not dissapoint. In fact, it certainly had parts I had no way to anticipate, nor was I expecting them to play out as the story enveloped more and more. I was amazed and how it all played out.The glitches have been rectified, and the switch to the newer version of the engine was a spot on, with even better looks (even on the lowest settings) and added optimization that made playing this game a real treat. Just to note, if you started the game on the older engine version, I'd recomment starting all over again - there's been changes.If you are a fan of the story-driven games, I DEFINITELY recommend this.

												*I've updated this review from negative to positive*Dreamfall: Chapters was a bit slow to capture my attention in the way I hoped it would. The majority of the first three books are primarily concentrated in two major settings. For anyone who has played the previous two games this might be a bit of a buzz kill considering a lot of their charm came from a seemingly endless stream of places to explore. That being said, the two worlds of Stark and Arcadia have both been remastered from their 2D predecessors, and the results are pretty cool. Propast has to be one of the best virtual cyberpunk cities I’ve ever had the pleasure to explore. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into making this city stand out and I want to commend the team for coming up with what is probably my favourite part of this game (seriously thank you).My one really major issue with the environments is the maps, which I found largely unhelpful. I eventually just learned my way around the cities, although that was after multiple play-throughs. Don’t even get me started on Crowboy, haha. As for the story, like I mentioned before this game was a bit slow to grab my attention. Similar to the previous games there is a lot of story packed in; between the protagonists, side characters, and general lore this game tells an epic tale. However, I think the story really only starts to come into stride in the last two books. If you find yourself losing interest by book 3 like I did, hang in there! I think some of the story might be lost on you if you haven't played the first two games, but if this is your first time playing a game from this series you can prepare yourself for some pretty interesting Star Trek-esque social commentary on humanity’s relationship to corporate power and greed. Chapters also highlights race issues (albeit rather un-originally), and class tensions, which I dig a lot. On to characters. I love Zoe. She’s changed a bit from the second game, but after what she’s seen, who wouldn’t? Overall I really enjoy her commentary, and the “choices & consequences” aspect of this game lets you have a bit more control over her character development, which is cool.  Kian on the other hand… I think they tried in the end to save this character (by giving him a hipster haircut and a weird sense of humor) but ultimately it was too little, too late. Kian’s backstory was cliché, and his personality flat as the soda you opened and forgot in your fridge two months ago. His story with the mysterious woman was largely unnecessary and frankly uninteresting.  For the protagonist in a game Kian is surprisingly forgettable. There are, however, countless new and returning characters that are quirky, interesting, and memorable; I especially love the bots. For the most part the voice acting is very well done. I've played enough fantastic choices and consequences games (Life is Strange, The Wolf Among Us, etc.) to know that Chapters is not one of them. However, the choices aspect of it does add an interesting element to the overall gameplay.While I think the developers may have stretched themselves a little too thin to make any one aspect of this game phenomenal- except I would argue, for Propast- the game is definitely worth the time and money. If you don't want to spend 30 bucks (which is understandable) wait until it's on sale. I suspect you'll get at least one replay out of it. Overall this is a good game, and I definitely recommend it if you are a fan of point-and-click epic fantasy tales.			"

												This was a truly amazing, fitting, and deeply satisfying end to a saga that has lasted over a decade - and began even before that. A pair of wonderfully realised worlds, filled with colourful and well-written characters, voiced by incredibly talented actors and actresses, played out to a deep and thought-provoking script, wrapped up in quite possibly the worst game engine on the market today.Yeesh. To say this had ""performance issues"" would be like saying the sun is a ""bit warm"" - the engine choked and groaned under its own weight, often crippling itself in the process, and suffering from janky animations, poor facial expressions, missing audio effects and other not-so-niceties to boot. It's a shame that, even after the switch to Unity 5, the game still runs so poorly as it can, at times, really drag the whole experience down --- and what an experience it was! Not many games, or dev studios, or writers, can bring a satisfying resolution to so many loose ends and plot threads, but I can happily say Ragnar Tørnquist and Red Thread Games on the whole have succeeded. Not every question was answered, but the majority were and the ending was touching, and sweet, and satisfying, and brought up a few more questions :P Well worth playing, just make sure you've got the Mother Of All Rigs in order to bruteforce through lousy coding on a lousier engine. Was it worth a decade wait, a Kickstarter, and then episodic cliffhangers that dragged over nearly 2 years.....? eeeeeeghhhhhhh... maybe. It was a mighty fine experience regardless :)			"

												I really enjoyed playing the first episode of this game. As always, when you like something you want to continue doing it and now I'm really looking forward to the upcoming parts. Of course I would have loved if all parts were there for me to play already - just like I would like to start to watch and read the rest of the Game of Thrones/Song of Ice of Fire series, or play Kentucky Route Zero to the end. But my anticipation of upcoming episodes and the possible frustration with the episodic nature of any of these is not a fault on their part, but rather the result of being awesome stories.Dreamfall Chapters is much like the original Dreamfall, a highly enjoyable story in amazing settings with a high focus on dialogue and somewhat less on gameplay and controls. To be fair, the gameplay is much better than in the original Dreamfall, but still nowhere near as good as the story ... (The only hiccup I've found is the totally unnecessary ""algae-puzzle"" in one of the possible story lines, where you have to steer a robot with really lousy controls in a puzzle that is not the least challenging except to your patience.)Europolice, the largest setting is simply amazing. It's huge, beautiful and full of pulse. Going on exploration on your own, besides achieving the necessary goals, is totally worth it. It takes some time to learn to find your way around, but there is a clever (and fun) map system embedded in the gameplay that will get you started. Some of the dialogue between non playable characters you can listen to but not interact with. Still it gives you clues as to what's going on in the city and adds to the feeling of being in a live environment.The game is much about decisions and consequences, and though a lot of the consequences are yet to be revealed I like how you are warned and reminded of that your choices matter. The major decision points are marked by a symbol representing ""The Balance"", so you can think before you jump. But one time I accidentally triggered a choice before I realized that there was one. Fortunately it was late in the game so I can quite easily replay to make a real decision.For longer replays the save game system is not great. Your decisions are stored, and the ones you made in your last play through will be the one you keep for the next book. To keep my original decisions even after playing the game again, I have to locate a time stamped save slot from near the end of my first attempt. (Or copy the saved state to a different folder on my computer.) It would be great if you could name your different plays and shift between them inside the game.All in all it's a great start of a probably great game. I really recommend it.---Update after book 2:I enjoyed the second installment of the game as much as the first. A new huge area to explore (though not yet with the same pulse), and the consequences of many of my earlier decisions are starting to show. Some of them are quite subtle but some are huge and really alters the story and to some extent the characters. I've replayed the first book many times and the second book once, to check out alternatives to my intial choices, but there are so many possible paths that I'm sure there are outcomes that I have yet to see and experience.As before, the save game system makes replays harder than necessary. Book 2 does include a partial fix, where each saved game now is automatically named after the chapter. It helps to some degree, but unfortunately existing saves are not updated so they still only has a timestamp and a location.The first two books still feel much like an opening - more questions are raised than answers given. But that is to be expected - we still have three more books to look forward to. And I really do!			"

												I'm not sure I can call this game a definitive ending to the series as a whole.There are so many questions left unanswered, many plot threads set up and left forgotten. It feels like you could easily write an entire game more of things that kind of felt only barerly implied in this game.I don't think this felt like a proper goodbye for all of these characters.But maybe that's just me having played the original Longest Journey waaay back when I was a kid, and maybe I just feel too close to these characters to accept their stories ending. Regardless, I'm happy I played this as a fan. It's the best apology letter we could have gotten for the absolutely abysmal ending to the last game.The Longest Journey is still the best in the Trilogy, but Dreamfall chapters captures the feeling of the original quite well, and is more tonally interesting than Dreamfall's depressing slog.The game plays fine, Yes the puzzles are not the greatest, but they're serviceable and keep the pacing up rather than down.I just wish we could have gotten a The Longest Journey Home along with this. I think most of us really wanted a conclusion to THAT story rather than this one. But for what we got, It's Amazing, and for all my love-hate I have for the writer of the series, Mr.Tornquist really pulled off an excellent emotional rollercoaster with this entire series. Better than most pieces of Fiction I've experienced in the last 10 years. So for that, Thank you.Anyways, buy the series and play it. You owe it to yourself as an Adventure game fan, as I'm sure you are. Reader. "

												Dreamfall Chapters. 9 / 10The First Chapter: Exactly what I wanted from the DreamTeamThis Story is about Zoe after she breaks out of DreamLand. Walk around with Zoe and discover the world she lives in.I must admit that I was sad to miss out on the Kickstarter (secret - that is how much I enjoyed the prior Story - Dreamfall The Longest Journey)The is one of those slow games - like slow food.... It is good for you. Beautiful music, beautiful sets, and a beautiful story that is to be discovered one scene at a time....The GUI is quite unique and takes some getting used to.... patience pleasure peace..... point and click goodness the way it needs to be done.... The Nordic way....			"

												I can't believe I'm writing this, and it makes me want to weep tears of blood, but Dreamfall Chapters is without a doubt the worst entry in the franchise, by far. While it starts of promising, and time spent with Zoe early on is as wonderful and charming as ever, the sections with a certain Azadi are just incredibly dull. This bodes ill as the story builds and lesser plot points are forgotten, forming a plot-hole ridden and bumpy ride that goes all the way to a phoned-in and anticlimactic ending. Writing 101, having a character the player barely knows show up and unexpectedly save everything with no explanation is a bad way to end any story. Character arcs are rushed and the ending leaves massive questions hanging while failing at tidying everything up, a symptom of the utter failure of the dev-team to build a full experience within the constraints they were given. It's obvious they were setting up for another game, but have professed they were so miserable and exhausted making this game that they are done with the franchise. If I knew this is what we were going to get, I'd rather have had the previous game be the last in the series, so I could have ended the franchise with a good taste in my mouth. Pass this up. If you really need some resolution, read a wiki instead of wasting your money.			"

												Well, after the great opening in Book One, some confusing time, scratching my head during Books Two and Three, in the final two Books I got to see the sense to the whole Dreamfall saga - right from the very beginning till the end. Although the game is more of a story we watch and shape, than a point-and-click where moving forward is a challenge, Dreamfall Chapters is an epic, engaging, FULL story in itself as well as the ending to the awkward Dreamfall, which has left many in suspense. Hope Ragnar has more stories to tell us and he's gonna do it with the best style he has shown here. Be it The Longest Journey world or any other.			"

												So... Where do I begin? Well, this in one of the best video games by far for people to whom the storyline of the game matters more than the gameplay. Amazing story to say the least. Great character building and climaxes in the story along with relevance to actual status quo. The conflicts, political and other in the story of the game are relatable to the real world. Other than that, great graphics, concept art, and choices to be made by the players that shape story progression. It's a fascinating game at best, no exaggerations. I hardly spend money on video games but I couldn't resist from buyng this one and it was money well spent.			"

I'm loving what I'm seeing so far. The game really attempts to drag you into the story, and succeeds. The voice acting is remarkable, the story is very intresting, and the narrative puzzles are well thought out. The visual graphics of the game are amazing to look at, and the music really fits and sets the mood of the story. I'm really into this game, and I can't wait for more chapters to come out! I'd recommend this to anyone who completly wants to escape reality by way of story. If I had to sum up this game in two words, it would be Simply Stunning. 8/10			"

A must play if you played the prequels. This game is definitely worth playing and worth finishing (playing to the end and getting all the achievements). The game will keep you entertained the whole way through (i.e. not force you to grind).It's also contains visually astonishing scenary, which will make you stop up and take it all in and possibly take a few (hundred) screenshots.

												TLJ was one of the first adventures I played and I liked it a lot. The sequel  - Dreamfall, was attempt to cater to new audience with 3rd person view and some arcade elements, but puzzles were still here followed by rich story,  descent game overall. The new game changing it format again, now they decided to ride on Telltale success. If you like ""The Wolf among Us"" and other Telltale games you would probably like Chapters as well. No more puzzles (unless usage of key on lock is puzzling for you),barely any objects to click on (2-3 hotspots per scene, whole city has like 10 POI) but a lot of dialogs and ""choices"".The choice system is a classical approach with ""moral"" dilemmas which will affect development of your storyline. On good side - they put some efforts to help you understand your possible options better as each choice is provided with inner monolog with a detailed explanation. On other hand it still not enough and unless you share mindset with dev-team you can't predict reaction and outcomes, common flaw of such games.  Unfortunately there are no saves in game (only auto-save on checkpoint) so you can't play around with different options and need to start new game to see different outcomes.First chapter has around 3.5 hours of gameplay 2.5 of which is dialogs and cutscenes and other hour is you running around city between people you obliged to talk to. Main area of action is very small, even claustrophobic with a lot of reused props.On bright side of the game - dialogs and NPC are good, music is pretty good too but it is hard to judge a story yet. Visual style is far from being impressive and also struggle to perform properly in open area of the city. Animation is on bare minimum as well.Can't recommend unless you are Telltale fan, Also chapter is pretty short so it worth to wait for full pack on sale if you just interested in story continuation of old games.

												This is one of those bizarre examples where I am at a loss when I comes to explain what is so great about it from a purely gameplay related perspective. Because in that regard it doesn’t really do anything special, and the tried and tested stuff it does do in terms of mechanics is not especially well-made. Beautiful graphics with some very awkward animations. It’s essentially is an old-style point and click game trapped inside a third person choose-your-own-adventure-novel. So nothing new and/or exiting there. But it is in terms of story, characters and worldbuilding it excels beyond most things I have ever played. The actual narrative was a bit jarring at first; playing as two different characters in two completely different worlds, but once some familiarity sets in the rest of the ride is amazing. I don’t want to get in to too much detail but this is one of those rare examples where the ever-rising stakes scenario actually feels earned. All in all, an amazing experience. Top marks.(I played most of the game offline. The real time spent playing should be round 30-35 hours)			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is the game I've been looking for, for a long time. It's a story rich game with a story that is told well and feels believable. The dialogues feel like conversations I could have with my friends instead of being so well scripted like so often happens. Even swearing in dialogues feels very much like how swearing is normally used and not just there because. It's very refreshing to be able to connect with a character so well, being able to make their choices in a way that feels right. The choices also have impact, more impact than I experienced in the Telltale games for example. Some choices are obvious but some seemingly smaller choices have great impact which is absolutely amazing. Than finaly, for an impatient gamer like me poit and click games are usually not much of an option but the atmosphere in this game is so great I didn't mind wandering the streets looking for the next part to the story. + Best story I've played, maybe ever+ Great dialogues+ Choices with real impact+ Amazing atmosphere- You only seem to get 1 save file- Episodic release (maybe that's just a - for impatient people like me)- The story starts a bit slow at first			"

												I cannot recommend this highly enough.  The story, sound design, graphics, and gameplay are all absolute hallmarks, and what other games in the genre should aspire to be.Of course, there's nitpicks, little things that bother you here and there, and I would be lying if the few crashes I have had (mostly during saves, where the save would go through fine, so I'd just have to double click and go) weren't annoying, but they're entirely forgivable in my book because the story is just so, so good.If you're looking for a story where you can take part, there's nothing better than Dreamfall Chapters, and the entire world of The Longest Journey.

												I remember The Longest Journey vividly. I was so thoroughly engrossed in the game, the visuals, the story, the puzzles and the characters that the massive amount of time I spent playing it disappeared.Unfortunately this trend did not continue with Dreamfall. Now that I've finished the final chapter, I'm sorry to report that Dreamfall Chapters is not significantly better.The visuals are stunning and the environments are so detailed that longtime fans of The Longest Journey should at least consider playing -- it's a treat to wander around the locations. Some of them are better than others, but in general the experience is very high-quality.The story, however, is a mess. I often found myself bored, waiting for a lengthy cutscene to give way to any sort of gameplay. Endless cutscenes can be forgiven if the characters and plots involved are interesting, but, more often than not, these aren't. For example, almost everything that happened in Arcadia bored me to tears, and that encompassed *more than half of the story*.By contrast, however, nearly everything that happened in Stark seemed almost effortlessly interesting. Maybe it was the contrast with Arcadia, but I think I'd be willing to replay many moments from the science-fiction side of this game. It makes me sad that the developers chose to concentrate on the fantasy -- the other half feels much stronger.I also have to wonder how much of the development effort went into creating a branching story. The choices in the game were interesting, but I have to admit that I don't really care about choices in a game if the story they drive is dull. Not to mention that the constant reminders of the choices were overbearing and tedious -- how many times do I need to be reminded that I made a choice when the game goes out of its way to emphasize that I must make one? My Decision Will Have Consequences... but hopefully a few negative reviews will too: if there's another game in this series, I hope the creators will consider focusing their efforts on creating a single, consistent, interesting narrative in lieu of decisions that only look good as a statistic on a product page.

												I am a hardcore 'The longest journey' fan, I have played the first and second game (Dreamfall) and I really loved both. I get nostalgia and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think about these games which honestly, are my favorite games of all time. They have one of the best stories (if not 'THE best story) a video game can have, drawing you in the beautifull narative and the cool puzzles that the main characters have to solve to proggress further into the story. This game, Dreamfall Chapters has done justice to the series. The story is rich, mysterious, and immersive. The characters are well made and complex, they feel really natural, and they are not classical stereotype characters. The graphics and sound effects are stellar. I can not recommend this game enough, especialy for someone who played the first two games of the series. @Red Thread Games:  I love what you've done with the game! Congratulations, you've brought back my favorite game from childhood and it really shines, it really is a faithfull sequel to Dreamfall. Now, that being said, it is one of the most poorly optimized games I have played in my life.  I have upgraded my PC for it, now I have a Radeon HD 6850 video card, an X3 455 AMD processor and 4 GB of RAM. Sorry guys, but it is unacceptable for a system that can run Battlefield 4 and Assasin's Creed and al the cool eye candy shooters at medium to high settings, to not be able to decently run this game at even medium one (I am expecialy reffering to Europolis, the Chinese market, where the game lags like hell - like 20 seconds stutter - the picture is frozen for 15-20 seconds - when I move the camera or when I enter the area from the Sonenschein Plaza). Please tell me, is Europolis more dependant on the CPU, RAM or GPU? Anyway I am awaiting for a processor I ordered to arrive now, it is a FX 6100 and I will soon upgrade to 8 GB RAM as well. Anyway I have read from other guys that have better systems than mine (even the one I will have after upgrade) that the game still lags... So please Red Thread Games release patches and optimize my favorite game, I love it but it is so poorly optimized!			"

												After 8 years without knowing Zoë and April's fate, it's finally here! And it has everything you can expect from a TLJ/Dreamfall game: Zoë's witty and funny comments about pretty much everything, her inner conflicts about her life, carefully woven storyline and even the Crow! (somehow...) Kian's parts were shorter than I expected, but I am sure he'll get enough spotlight on the future chapters. Changing the course of the story with meaningful choices is a great addition to the series and it really makes me wonder what'll be the consequences of my actions. Also that opening scene was like a punch in the gut, but I'll leave it at that so you can see it for yourself.Overall, Dreamfall is back with it's full glory! There are some minor technical problems, but I haven't experienced anything game-breaking. If you are a fan of the adventure genre or a dreamer, you should definitely play Dreamfall Chapters.			"

I strongly recommend watching it on youtube. This game is more polished than it's predecesor. From time to time you will encounter some puzzles that may be frustrating, those you can skip with the help of a walkthrough.The story this game has to offer is great in every way. Please consider buying it.8.5/10 - The frustrating puzzles took me away from the great experience this game has to offer. "

												Definitely worth a play if you were a fan of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, but a little of the magic seems to be gone. The voice acting feels a bit off for some characters and the animations are quite awkward. Additionally it feels like the game wasn't meant to be episodic; there is a payoff in the last two books that feels lacking in the earlier chapters, but despite this the feeling of being in Marcuria or seeing Zoe in the hospital bed again gives a few shivers down the spine for me as a fan of DF:TLJ, the plot is pretty great and the visuals for the most part are pretty amazing coming from the previous game.If you were waiting for the sequel for ages you will probably be very happy with the game provided you can power through the early chapters that miss the mark a little.

												Dreamfall Chapters has several Drawbacks, that should be considere before buying.The Graphics, particular the character models are not the best, especially in the cutscenes.The Controls are clumsy, it is frustrating so search for an interactive part for a puzzle, because it is hard to get a feeling for the controls.Speaking of puzzles. they do not always make sense.Don't be ashamed of looking up the solutions, because sometimes, the puzzle can be completly strange.But the game is still worth its price, if you are searching for the one thing it offers:Storytelling.The Story is engaging, considerably complex, and well written.The game is full of Cutscenes and Cinematics, often you just sit in front of your PC and watch.And it has a Plot twist, or two.The choices you make, do matter,  but it is not like you would be missing a whole lot in your first playthrough.If not for achievements, the game offers little replayabiltiyI've put 50 hours in it because i wanted all achievements, if you are not in this collection thing, you may end up at 30-40.

												A boring game from cover to cover.Most of the time you spend in front of Dreamfall Chapters will be listening to hours and hours of exposition. This is delivered with animation that takes control away from you. The interactive sequences in between the exposition is what has to be one of the most boring professional adventure games of the XXI century. The first half of the game is plagued with aimless wandering in hard-to-navigate environments, and almost no puzzles; the second half fortunately dispenses with the backtracking, but the amount of puzzles remain slow. All the time the puzzles aren't connected to the story and are usually simple, tedious or both.My description might remind some of Telltales games, and they wouldn't be wrong to assume this game borrows inspiration from that company. I've enjoy most Telltales' games, because they excel at pacing and engagement. The decisions feel real, while in Dreamfall Chapters they feel random and unimportant (what food should I buy Reza?!)This is all a shame, because Dreamfall Chapters' art is beautiful and the designers had total dedication to the details. The world feels alive and comes through believable. The pacing however ruined it for me. For instance, after the game's climax the player is treated to, I kid not, 20 minutes of exposition in the form of epilogues. Most big characters get at least one epilogue. The major characters' epilogues get their own epilogues. One character that doesn't have a main role until the end of the last part has 3 or 4 epilogues (I lost count). At this point the player's interest is gone, and yet the writers decided to self-indulge into more exposition, most of which is a retelling of the game's events without adding any critical information.I played this game despite the negative reviews because some reviewers claimed it gets better on the second half. While it does get better in my opinion, it never gets good, and all the flaws except backtracking are carried over.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is one of the best games i have ever played. I absolutely enjoyed the deep storyline and the puzzles implemented into the game. If you are looking for a game which has a deep story that will keep you occupied and wanting to play the game then this is the game for you.My absolute favorite part about this game was the usage of a telltale-like choice system. If you have played any telltale game recently you will know what I mean. Every decision that you make alters the story. The game sets up decisions very nicely. Sometimes they make a character seem like an antagonist just for you to quickly find out that telling them the information that you did has led to the death of people you care deeply about. You don't know who is good or bad until it's too late and I absolutely love the way it was written.Another great part about this game is the length of the story. After one playthrough it has taken me 19.8 hours to complete. In my opinion, that is lengthy game. The good thing is, the story is so involving that before I know it i've been playing for 3 hours and still feel like continuing. absolutely an excellent story.The puzzles in this game make you think long and hard about how to solve the problem you have ahead of you. Some puzzles have solutions that seem difficult at first but end up making you think, ""damn, that was so much easier than what I made it."" I found these moments in the game fun and enjoyable.Where my review differes from other people is that I have never had an experience with another game from this series. I had not come to love the way a character was prior to playing this installment in the series. In my personal opinion, I loved the way the characters were. I completely enjoyed their personalities and the way they acted. I absolutely enjoyed the personality of Zoe. Kian was pretty closed off but I still enjoyed the way he acted as well. I thought the way he acted and talked was fitting to his role as an ex soldier. The side characters were also great. Crow was funny, Enu was great to have around. Likho was just what I thought he should be with his back story. It was all perfect.If I had to give this game an overall rating I would rate it no less than 9/10. I thought it was an game that was as close to perfect as you can get. I can't speak for those who have played the previous games, but I know for a fact that you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy playing games from this genre. Very well done!			"

												This Game is one of the best Games here on Steam. Now before we start off with the good things let me say that in the beginning I had a horrible stutter for the first 2-3 hours. But one day I restarted the game and it all went away as if it never exist. I don't know why or what changed but I am happy it never went back to awful again.This Game is introducing you to 3 different Characters and their Stories. I saw that this game is as such a sequel to the previous Games which I haven't played but are here on steam. (The Longest Journey & Dreamfall: The Longest Joruney).Dreamfall Chapters has an amazing Story which took me 24 hours to complete. It is very atmospheric and I immediatly fell in love with the Characters. The Voice Acting is done very well and the animation is also rather well made. Unlike the Tell Tale Games it actually does matter which choices you make and therefore has a big replayability factor. So do listen as you won't be able to just skip through. It is honestly like reading a book but making your own decisions regarding the main characters.The Last time I was so in love with a Story and its characters was on Final Fantasy XIII. I can recommend this game to anybody that loves the Tell Tale Games, Life is Strange or any kind of choice game that is as such similiar. I can also recommend this Game to anybody that has played the previous games before as I think that this one is a must for every Fan.I can also recommend this Game to anybody that hasn't played the previous games as everything in this game is explained very well. I can't recommend this game to anbody that isn't into these kinda games.			"

												Great closure to my favourite story. No questions I had from previous titles remained unanswered.Story is engaging and decisions do matter (unlike in Telltale games series). Story is well paced and I didn't encounter any weak spots.I loved the art-style. But there could be more models and skins for ambient NPCs. Lip-sync could use some corrections.Voice-over is well done.Gameplay-wise It continues in the footsteps of Dreamfall but luckily it droped the fighting and quick time events.It added a bit more of ""adventure"" elements and puzzles, but don't expect it to be like in the Longest Journey. Locations are beatiful and I was happy I could revisit many locations from the past games. For this type of game locations are kinda open and relatively big. It feels more natural than those tiny corridors of the previous game. That leads into one minor con - there is a lot of running and walking. Which I can imagine might be dull for some, but I didn't mind.I recommend it, but do Yourself a favor, and play both previous games first. There are tons of references which you would miss otherwise :-) "

												This episodic series is nothing like other episodic games out there right now. Open worlds to explore, largely varying outcomes to decisions, and an expansive and deep lore world. You can have a completely different life for Zoe depending on decisions you make as her. Small choices you make can have consequences that change the world around you in ways you didn't expect. The first ""book""/episode is a bit slow in terms of story beats. But book 2 brings all the set up together. The characters are flawed in realistic ways. They have relationships that are not perfect in ways that are relatable. The art direction of this game is really solid, and will stand the test of time in the future. It's not cutting edge graphics, by there is a definite beauty to the models and levels. If you're the type of gamer who wants their ""decisions to matter"", this is definitely the game for you.			"

												For an original TLJ fan, this game is a disappointment. Briefly, it is an adventure game where you don't go anywhere.Rather than do what made TLJ interesting - create settings and characters - Ragnar Tornquist has gone on a nostalgia trip. TLJ was essentially an interactive stage play. Each scene had a backdrop, and a few props in front of it, and the characters. Since the graphics for each location were simple, the studio could afford to make lots of them, and the journey could unfold.In this game, Tornquist spent the budget recreating locations in Arcadia and Stark - many of which have already been seen - in full 3D. This means that until very late in the game, most of the action happens in one hub in each world. To speak of the ""hub"" in Stark is an exaggeration, because Zoe never exactly travels anywhere else. People talk mysteriously behind her back, friends come and go, but none of it ever really matters. So there's half a story missing already.Things are somewhat better on the Arcadia side, but still ... not much novelty, just moving the old game pieces around with the occasional ""I am your father"" twist.The choice element is a gimmick that begs you to replay a game that didn't deliver the first time around, and won't the second time either.

												The only thing that I did find minutely frustrating is that the ""save and quit"" option doesn't actually seem to save your present progress. Available load points or selecting Continue always seem to dump me at the autosave points that occur after interactions and storyline shifts. For the most part, this was only a minor annoyance as the game saves often enough, but returning to the game I always had to reassess my active tasks and my inventory to determine which steps I needed to repeat. That said, I am anxiously awaiting Book Five after having played through Books One through Four. The visuals in the game are stunning, the variety of settings, the colors, and the people. The storyline is intriguing, although not having played the prequels, I probably felt more of a knowledge gap than someone going in after having played The Longest Journal and Dreamfall. I feel a connection to the characters, from our main characters Zoe and Kian, to some of the more minor players, such as Bip and Nela. Revelations and connections made through the story kept me engaged and invested in the stories.The puzzles throughout the game are all reasonably easy to accomplish. I think there may have been two places in which I was stumped on how to progress;  one of which I could have solved if I hadn't been so adverse to interacting with the AdBots.When making choices, you can see how your choices compare to the choices that other players made. In the few games that I have seen this feature, I have enjoyed getting to see the breakdown of which percentage made what choice. The recaps at the end of the Books that give you a sense of what impacts your choices might have in the coming books.			"

												A flawed but fulfilling experienceIt's obvious that a lot of care and love was put into this game, from the detailed and vibrant environments, to the atmospheric, moving music, and the well acted, thought-provoking plot and dialogue.  Getting around can be very tedious, and some of the puzzles are just plain annoying.  The opening hours can be a little slow, but the pace picks up soon enough. Sadly, the final episode feels a tad rushed and underexplained, but I still enjoyed the journey. In the end, though, this is still recommended for anyone who loves a good adventure.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a true adventure game in the Longest Journey saga. This game has really figured out how to translate the traditional point and click adventure games into a full 3D world while keeping the wonder, immersion, good story telling  and rich world. The game focuses heavily on delivering a good story, adopting some interactive elements from Telltale but also improving upon their formula and adding their own features. It also has a great soundtrack that really drives  home the emotions the narrative delivers.The game is not afraid of tackling difficult issues and mature topics, and this seems to be the main reasons people have given negative reviews here on Steam. However the game tackles these issues in a multidimensional way, and you'd do well not to judge the portrayal too quickly.I've been looking forwards to this game for years, and I think it's really delivered. With Episode 3 of 5 being right around the corner at the time of writing this, I think it's absolutely worth picking up. For me the first episode alone would have been worth the asking price for the whole season.			"

												Best game Ive played in a verry long while.Following from dreamfall the longest journey we are once against plunged into a new and older Zoe Castillo, Here to unravel all the secrets Europolis.. well maybe not all! but most! Verry much advised if your into loads of story and a rich gameplay of puzzle solving and cryptical meanings.Not advised if you have not played Dreamfall the longest journey.  And possible The longest journey in itself as all 3 games are followups. but starting from Chapters is not entirely impossible but you will be questioning alot of the time about zoe's past deeds etc.			"

												Like it's predecessors, the story is kinda interesting, but it falls short on it's goal of delivering a somewhat immersing story. The whole ""game"" aspect of it feels really forced. Most of the time you're just wandering around without much sense of purpose. The puzzles are unintuitive and the dialogue is jarring. It's like these guys had a real need to tell this cool story, but were kinda clueless on how to deliver it. I really wanted to like this one, but the sheer boredom one has to endure to get anywhere was just too much.			"

												In my opinion, my favorite game ever created would have to be The Longest Journey. I believe not only did it have one of the best and intriguing stories of any video game, it was a ""thinking person's"" game. It was beautifully crafted, fully detailed, featured superb voice acting, and contained challenging puzzle-gameplay. TLJ not only gave us one of the coolest female heroines, April Ryan, but created an entire world to get sucked up in. Most movies getting pumped out today do not have half the creativity that TLJ did.Dreamfall, the sequel, was an amazing game as well, though not without its faults (horrible combat system for one), that brought the loveable Zoe Castillo character into the limelight. Now we have Dreamfall Chapters, the continuation of the Zoe character arc and world.Dreamfall Chapters is one of the best games I have played in years. I am a fan of adventure games and they seem to be taking off in episodic, choice-making formats. I have played quite a number of them, and have to say that Dreamfall Chapters is about the only game where your choices do matter and have drastic effect on the gameplay. Even though Telltale and DONTNOD have made some incredible games, Red Thread is about the only company to truly master a choice making format in my honest opinion.As far as Dreamfall Chapters itself, there is nothing lazy about how this game is crafted. Just like The Longest Journey, Dreamfall Chapters is meticulously detailed and meaningful. As the books progress, the puzzles do go up in difficulty, but still not quite near the challenge that The Longest Journey provided.I ultimately feel that Dreamfall Chapters provides the best aspects of both games. I can't wait for Book 4!I can only find two cons:1) Does this really have to end after Book 5? I think I speak for a lot of old Funcom and now Red Thread fans by saying ""we want more!""2) There is no set release date or official announcement for The Longest Journey home. It would be a dark era of gaming if TLJH does not get made, as it is what started it all and deserves a proper sequel and possible closing for April Ryan's story.			"

												edit:Update for Book 5 (complete game), no spoilersConflicted about how the story ended, but if you're like me and have been wanting to know how the saga ends for many years, it's worth seeing it through to the end. The closure feels good. Overall you're mostly playing a walking simulator and not an adventure game. There are still some great moments throughout Dreamfall Chapters and it was a worthwhile experience.I can't really recommend this for people who haven't played TLJ and/or Dreamfall. Too much of the lore is meaningless to a new player for the game to be that interesting.Original review:This review is for Books 1 - 4, as that is what has been released at this time. No spoilers.If you've played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall and enjoyed the story, this is a must play. The gameplay is closer to a refined Dreamfall than it is to TLJ, but it's less buggy and without the combat. There are some ""adventure"" segments with puzzle solving, and a lot of exploring and talking. Lots of great returning characters and familiar locations, along with some new ones too. The artistic direction is pretty incredible, being able to see Marcuria in full 3D is a delight.A new feature to the series is the introduction of decisions that affect the story. I have currently only played through the four books once, so I'm not sure how ""worth it"" it is to play again and see different paths, but it's in interesting addition. Decisions can for example effect which location you end up spending some time at, or which ally accompanies you on a mission. I could take or leave this feature, but some may feel strongly about it one way or another.I am loving the story. Eager to see what happens in the concluding chapter.			"

												I feel so bad disliking this game! I tried so hard to focus on the good things and keep carry on playing, but certain parts were just too frustrating. I managed to play through the whole game but Dreamfall chapters falls short of its predecessor, Dreamfall TLJ. The main issue of this game is the puzzles (or lack thereof). So many times I was just looking for something that would make the game move forward without knowing what I was looking for. Often this was searching in the pixels for anything that the characters would recognise.Regarding the game overall, I do not understand why the makers of the game followed the current trend of telltales' choice based games. It does not work for DFC story, and the outcome is plain and underdevelopped characters, when compared to DFTLJ. It is a pity that the makers of the game did not just focus on improving the novelties of DFTLJ (Stealth and action sequences). There are a couple of stealth sequences in DFC but they are ridiculously bad. The story is much weaker. I think one of the reasons is that the choices in the game do not allow characters to be interesting. The choice mechanic does not suit dreamfall well, unlike some other games where the plot is completely dragged by the events (e.g. walking dead). But regardless, the plot has the fault of many TV series, as it tries over and over to surprise with continuous plot twists which end up making the plot meaningless.Still, it was nice to bring some closure to the dreamfall saga and I appreciated the much improved graphics.

												It's a great game with wonderful characters and an interesting story from a talented, proven developer, but don't buy it.  It's been three months since the last episode came out.  The wait has been kind of insane for an episodic series, and at this rate, the finale will be some time in 2016.  Because of how much time has passed, I have barely any memory of what happened in the first episode (Something about a spicy sausage, a Muslim prison riot and a space baby...), and it will take some work to get emotionally reinvested in the game by the time chapter 2 comes out, whenever that is.I'd say forget this is a thing, and just wait for 2016 to buy the whole thing on sale for ten bucks.- Update 3/12/15 -The second chapter is just coming out this week, making it nearly five months between two hour chapters.  No apologies or explanation from the developer, this is just how they've decided to do business.  They should have just called it an Early Access title.			"

												I absolutely loved The Longest Journey and Dreamfall so it was with great excitement that I backed this project on kickstarter. I'm afraid this game did not live up to it's predecessors.This is not a point and click adventure game, I'm not sure what this is but the closest thing it reminds me of is a Visual Novel and it's not a particularly good one at that. There was a good story here but it feels like they chose to not tell it, what we're treated to is instead about 80% fluff and pointless busywork. The 3 first books are straight up boring and contains very little of real relevance. Sure it's setting up all those choices that are supposed to shape things later on, but it's doing so at the cost of cutting the actual interesting events short.In the end I am glad that I've played the game, for no other reason than to have 'finished' the story that I loved so much in the previous games. But I'm afraid I can not recommend this game to anyone. There are by far better experiences to buy if you're after 'interactive storytelling' and there's plenty of better games if you want puzzle solving or adventure.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a decent finale to The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. I have first played the saga more than 10 years ago, and it offers everything good an adventure series is able to offer - perfected story, believable characters and complex puzzles. The third game is mostly no exception to this, though I'll expand it later. Definitely buy the game and support Red Thread Games, at least for what they and Ragnar Tørnquist had to accomplish in order to complete the series.As for the setting, you'll visit both Stark and Arcadia at about the same rate and recognize Marcuria from the previous games. There's a high variety of beautiful locations you'll have a chance to visit, ranging from the already mentioned city you'll visit the most, various cyberpunk locations in Propast, and of course some stunning places in neither of the two worlds. In some locations I almost didn't want to leave, admiring how well had they been made.The music fits quite well, like in the previous games. You'll recognize tunes from Dreamfall, and Rush appears more than once.You'll meet characters you already know from previous games, like Roper Klacks, Brian Westhouse, of course Zoë and Kian, Reza, Helena, and also - April. All characters have a developing personality througout the game, and you'll be able to progress your relationship via the choices.As for the decisions and choices, I was surprised a lot how even at first sight minor choices influence the development of the story, and how largely it may deviate. However, you'll probably at least once think how you messed everything up, same as I did.The feature not present as much as I would like though, are the traditional adventure puzzles. The previous games contained the right amount of puzzles in them, TLJ even being considered in some locations as hardcore. Although Dreamfall Chapters arguably contains puzzles and even some well-made ones, it varies noticeably between the books, some being only mostly story-related, and the amount of puzzles generally decreases over the chapters.Though the episodic format has been discussed and considered a lot during and prior to the development of the game, I think it doesn't hurt over all, and is barely noticeable if you play the game now. Each book contains close and related unit of story, and takes about 3-4 hours. The last book is vastly different to all the previous ones in that it explains more questions than it raises, something not seen previously in the saga at all.Now I find it amazing that it seems like the whole story has been thought up almost 20 years ago, and now it all wraps up perfectly in the last game. Until the last chapter, you'll be constantly puzzled and seeking explanaions, and then shocked at how the things reveal at the end.All in all, I've enjoyed playing this game since the release of the first book, despite the fact it makes me think of it more like of an interactive movie, not as bad as Minecraft: Story Mode, but it seems the good old adventure times are yet to be revived. Nevertheless, what the game lacks in puzzles, it gains in story progression and decisions.			"

												I'm probably one of few people that actually liked Dreamfall as much as The Longest Journey and don't consider it an inferior sequel. That said I wasn't exactly happy when it ended on now infamous cliffhanger. Now after nearly ten years I'm glad that had the opportunity to experience the finale of Dreamfall and definitive end of The Longest Journey as a series.While The Longest Journey was a classic point&click adventure and Dreamfall focused more on interactive story, Chapters falls somewhere between them with an added Telltale-esque consequence drama. Now, after almost a year, we can experience Chapters as a whole, and it sure has its ups and downs. Opinions my vary but for me Chapters has an excellent book one, followed with great two, okay-ish three, good four and obviously rushed five. It is clear that Red Thread Games had big ambitions but due to time and probably money constrains they couldn't realize their vision in full. There are many moments, especially in later books that could probably be interactive or contain a puzzle but are instead presented as a cutscene. That however doesn't change the fact that Chapters strongest point is its story, full of intricacies, twists and a powerful emotional core. Tørnquist's writing still has the ability to get under my skin and make me contemplate his games long after I finish them.So far It is probably best Kickstarter project I backed. Recommended.			"

												This is truly an outstanding game. I enjoyed it like I would enjoy a fantasy book as a child. I get some Neverending Story vibes from this game and even if I haven't played the previous games yet, I will start doing it right away.I got into this series by playing some hours of Dreamfall: The longest journey. I was hoping to get a similar experience with memorizable characters, great dialogues and an interesting story. I got all of this playing Dreamfall: Chapters.I can definitely recommend this game, but I'll use this review to voice some things that made enjoying this game slightly difficult.AnimationsThe main thing that bothered me was the poor execution of the animations in this game. Some of them are well done, but most of the more dynamic scenes are just awful. You want to catch an arrow mid-air? Just extend your hand and rotate your head. The game feels like a puppet show. It's so sad, because there are so many epic cutscenes and moments in this game and you just have accept them being cheesy. And I can't understand it - the quality just varies so much and I have to believe that that does not come from not being able to create better animations, but not giving the animators enough time and resources to do their job.ChoicesWell, I understand that all choice-driven games will at some point boil down to being linear. I don't have a problem with my choices not having an impact on the main plot, but the second half of the game felt like every choice that actually mattered to me was ignored or had really little impact. I'm especially angry at Reza suddenly showing up and having a baby with Zoe, even if I did everything to never see him again and april ryan not being properly explained if you don't know her, making every scene about her a confusing mess, including the ending where she steps out of the doorIf you can live with that, you'll get a great story that doesn't shy away from expecting the player from thinking. I love that the dialogues aren't dumbed down so that everyone can understand what is going on. It's mysterious and magical.This game could be a masterpiece and is easily one of the best games I ever played. The only thing that keeps me from absolutely falling in love with this gem are the horribly stiff and undynamic animations and the thought that without the cheesiness the game could deliver the story so much better.

A beautiful game with a compelling story and very memorable characters, Dreamfall Chapters successfully concluded the The Longest Journey saga almost 10 years after the last game, with what I can say to be an awfully magnificent ending - to say the least. The Epilogue, for me, did not fail to bring back all those memories of the previous games and turn them into a remarkably emotional experience [spoilers](the part with the photograph of Saga's parents really got me)[/spoilers].While the first three Books were pretty weak, in my opinion, with slow conversations and repetitive puzzles, Books 4 and 5 compensated the lackluster progression of the story. But this made Book 5 this kind of platform where they dash out all elements the developers had in their garage, making it somewhat 'rushed' - not in a bad way, but it's a bit too much information to pack into one Book. Though it's amazing to slowly realize that Funcom have already planned the story back in 2006, or probably even back in 2000 with the first game.I can say this: the graphics in Dreamfall Chapters is absolutely gorgeous. The textures and environments is one of the best for and indie game. But this left with a performance issue players with less-than-stellar computers suffer, players who managed to run the first two games pretty decently, and frankly players who make up the majority of the player base for Dreamfall Chapters. Nevertheless it's the animation that put me off. You can have the best graphics a game engine can render, but if the characters aren't replicating basic human movements it's not really believable. BUT, I personally don't mind - the voice acting was superb and the music and atmosphere readily compensated this. If you're an adventure gamer but prefer motion capture that goes with its characters, play Heavy Rain instead.If you consider the replayability with at least 40 hours of gameplay (including multiple playthrough with different decisions), yes this is worth the full price (at least in my region). I bought this back when Book One was just released back in late 2014, so stretched out 1.5 years it's not as bad as some other titles.For newer players who are interested in Dreamfall Chapters I suggest you play the first two games first, this way you can really appreciate all the little details this game has to offer - if you don't, you won't even understand The Epilogue! Trust me, pressing the Story So Far button in the menus will not make you understand what is going on - at least play Dreamfall first if you're not the type to play a turn-of-the-century point-and-click adventure game with 'bad graphics'.Honestly, I can't stress how much of an emotional rollercoaster Book Five and the whole saga has been. There are no words. Play this damn game.			"

												I would 100% recommend this game to anyone that enjoys story rich games. It deals with issues of racism in parts, and deals with corrupt leadership in others. The storyline was well put together, and immersive. As soon as I finished my first playthrough, I turned right around to play it again. And after this one, I'll probably play at least twice more. The decisions you make feel like they really matter, and the relationship development is interesting and fun to watch, as well. Personally, I didn't play the games before it (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey) and still found the story to be wonderful and fun. The puzzles can be a bit conveluted, but it's mostly a case of finally understanding the puzzle and then thinking, ""Well, maybe I'm just stupid."" because you didn't notice something. I kept mentioning to a friend that I was  ""lost"" and ""confused"" on where to go in a couple different areas toward the beginning, and they mentioned that it made the game sound bad. By all means, it wasn't a bad game, just a new area I hadn't explored that confused the everloving heck out of me. Even then, I still loved it. Like I said, I'd recommend it to anyone.			"

												I have The Longest Journey and Dreamfalls: The Longest Journey, and I really like this new game with its stunning graphics, beautiful story line, and interaction that makes me feel like I am interfacing with and watching a movie at the same time. This is a long game that draws a player into it as a participant. I strongly recommend this game. However, I do not believe a game of this caliber with today's technology should have the occasional flicker/flutter/shaking problem I get when some characters are walking toward or away from the action. I have a PC system using Windows 10 and GPU (AMD R9-270) that surpasses the “maximum recommended system requirements"". I tried many different visual setting changes to no avail until I turned off both Full Screen Mode and Depth of Field. Now my characters do not appear to shake when they move. I hope this temporary workaround helps others who are experiencing the same problem until the developer fixes the issue correctly. Here are the settings I am currently using:Visual Quality - AwesomeResolution - 1600x900Full Screen Mode – OffAnti-Aliasing - HighSSAO – HighVolumetric Lighting - MediumMotion Blur - 0%Gamma - 50%Depth of Field - OffShadow Distance - 50mPostProcessing - FullV-Sync – Off			"

												Good to finally get some closure.  And it was decent closure.  You probably don't want to play this until you've played the first two games.  I'm not a fan of changing it to be a choose your own adventure type deal.  It was well done but I would have preferred to see how the characters would have acted.Regarding this game itself, the game and Zoe's story gets better with each book.  Book 3 was the real turning point for me.  Kian's story was boring throughout for me as it wasn't as original as the story time/dreaming centered plot. Kian's story is one we've heard before.  The graphics are really good and locations are varied once you get to books 4 and 5.  But the locations your in for the first 3 books look great.The puzzles are above average.  Only one really bad puzzle and that's only because they give you a misleading goal in your quest log.  Other than that, if you played the first two I'd recommend playing this to see how it all ends.  Most of the story is wrapped up well.  Whether you like how it ends will vary from person to person.  I thought it was ok.			"

												Short video review:


Review: Dreamfall Chapters 
A Video of Dreamfall Chapters
By: Kain Klarden

			Short review of the (probably) concluding chapter of The Longest Journey saga. More detailed look here: http://klarden.dumdoi.com/2016/09/dreamfall-chapters-end-of-the-journey/		


The Longest Journey and Dreamfall were both flawed, but magical story-driven adventure games. They had some rather serious issues, some pacing and puzzle problems with the first one, and some control and ""why is there combat and stealth here"" things in the second, but those could be easily disregarded, given how beautiful the world was, how charming the characters, how good the stories. What they didn't have, after Dreamfall opened so many new threads and ideas, is a proper ending. Dreamfall Chapters is here, finally complete 10 years later, to rectify that problem. And, like the predecessors, it's quite flawed, yet beautiful.It's not fully point and click, neither fully direct character controlled, similar to how Telltale handles controls. But the game does have an inventory and huge open locations to explore and puzzles to solve, even if, like in previous games, the main meat of the game is in the story, characters and interactions. There we see another, and this time very unfortunate, influence from Telltale - the ""will remember that"" choice-consequence system that shows and teels too much, breaking the flow of the story and risks turning the intricate and beautiful world into a flow-chart of choices.Thankfully, this doesn't kill the beauty of the game. Nor do the rather terrible puzzles, including several dreadful pixel hunting parts. Nor the rather obvious budget cuts in it's structure, which characters are seen and when and other things. But the first three Books do run longer than they really should and might make you feel a bit tired. But don't be.The game really finds it's pace (not without missteps still) in the final Books, that bring the overarching story of The Longest Journey saga to a very fulfilling conclusion, while still maintaining the mystery and the appeal of the world and it's many yet untold stories. And given that the developers redid the opening bit of the game for better and still seem to be focused on improving the game, I can only hope that they will do the same improvement check on all other parts of the game to make the flow even better.As with the originals, it's full of things to criticize. As with the originals, it stays with you when you close and uninstall it. I can see myself going back to all these games again and replaying them. Not for different choices, as I won't make them, most likely. Just because it's a journey worth relieving. "

												A very likeable story rich adventure game. I recommend first playing the first part of the series, ""The Longest Journey"" (if you can bear it) and even more so the second part ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" which provides a lot of background and introduces the main characters.The combat system of the previous game of the series (Dreamfall:TLJ) has fortunately been removed and Chapters has been made a choice-based game. The choices obviously dont affect the grand story arc but are still interesting and meaningful. You mainly play as Zoe and Kian as in the previous game, and now and then the new character Saga at various ages (starting at toddler age and later at age 4 which is very cute).If you come from Dreamfall:TLJ, note that the voice actors for both Zoe and Kian unfortunately changed. At first this is very noticeable especially for Zoe but Charlotte Ritchie does a very good job and it's easily forgotten after a short while.Some adventure games these days have poorly constructed/underbudget/strange/too short/outright sad endings but Dreamfall isn't one of them. The ending is well proportioned and bearable for soft hearts like me.			"

												For seasoned TLJ players, this is the game you've been waiting for, go play it. That's all.If you have NOT played The Longest Journey and/or Dreamfall: TLJ, I highly recommend you do so. If this game looks at all appealing to you, or if you love a good story and have the time (first 2 games will probably run you over 50 hours, easily). Playing the first 2 games will make this one much more relevant. I can see that it may not be necessary, but the depth of backstory that's apparent in Chapters will make it worthwhile. (For instance, new players will not get the full emotionally crushing blow when they meet the Mole. And WHO really IS Lady Alvane? Man I can't wait to find out.)While the graphics are dated (especially for TLJ), much of the original game art consists of hand painted backgrounds, so it's still lovely to look at (especially parts of Arcadia and April's dreams). I re-play both games about once every 1-2 years, and they're still worth it. They're like being inside a particularly good fantasy/sci-fi novel. Every character is relevant, loveable (even the villains) and authentic.Favourite game series of all time. Would recommend 10/10.			"

												I recently replayed both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  I want to mention my current feelings on them briefly because they're pertinent to how I feel about Dreamfall Chapters.Apart from a few dodgy 90's style adventure game puzzles that require ridiculous leaps of logic, The Longest Journey still holds up quite well.  Interesting story, great variety of locations, and overall fun puzzles with a few exceptions as mentioned.Dreamfall: TLJ held up far worse than I expected based on my memory of it.  Seemingly inconsequential parts of the story are overly drawn out, while the overarching plot is rushed and poorly developed.  It feels very much like the developer bit off more than they could chew and had to cut huge swaths out of their planned design and rush what was left after spending too much time building the first quarter of the story.  Gameplay couldn't rescue it either.  There were far fewer puzzles and a ridiculous amount of walking back and forth between the same few locations.Dreamfall Chapters is ultimately a better game than Dreamfall: TLJ but it has its own numerous faults.Foremost, Dreamfall Chapters takes Dreamfall: TLJ's tedium and multiplies it by 10 for a good chunk of the game.  Rarely have I felt my time being more intolerably wasted by a developer than I had playing the first half of Chapters.  The game takes place primarily in two large areas (large for an adventure game at least) and there are tasks that involve walking from one side of the map to the other and then back again at a painfully slow movement speed.  There's also the modern day equivalent of pixel hunts where you need to run around looking for *something* until the game's interface highlights it.  Running, which you will always want to do despite it still being really slow, requires constantly holding a key or gamepad trigger down instead of it just being a toggle.  So there's a physical annoyance to go with the mental annoyance too.  It's hard not to feel like the run speed and tasks that have you traverse the map are the equivalent of triple spacing a term paper.  The game seems like it was padded in the worst way possible - presumably meet some playtime target promised to backers.  The latter half of the game gets rid of much of the walking around and then becomes more or less a slightly interactive movie as result.  Honestly, I prefer it as an interactive movie than it pretending to be an adventure game, but that first half is still a good 8-10 hours you have to suffer through and I wouldn't recommend it based on that alone.  Sadly, the narrative that takes over in the second half isn't great either.It's remarkable how much the game resembles Dreamfall in it's terrible pacing.  The first 3 out of 5 books are incredibly slow and spend a lot of time exploring minor details that become completely inconsequential once the game opens up the ""here's the real plot"" flood gates.  That happens in the last 2 books, and they throw so much complex metaphysical nonsense your way that it would put a modern JRPG to shame.  At a certain point, it becomes hard to feel any empathy for the characters because the events they're involved in are just *too* fantastical for them to have any believable reaction to them.To the game's credit, it does have an extended denouement, which is rare to see in games, and it does tie up a lot of (though not all) loose threads - but they're threads that barely made sense in the first place.  On some level, I appreciate that the developer shot for the stars with their narrative complexity, but it just doesn't have the nuance or time to develop things as well as, say, a novel (or series of novels) would.  They once again bit off too much for the medium in which the story is being delivered.			"

												This one is by far my favorite installment in the series (And I'm not even finished with it as of now but going by other reviews I've read I don't think my opinion is likely to change).Not to say that it doesn't have a few rather nasty flaws. For starters they could have toned down the political aspects a notch or two, especially during the first couple of hours you spend running around Stark. It quickly got to the point for me to where I was just rolling my eyes and wanting to rush through the campaign errands. It doesn't help that I'm playing the game during one of the most ridiculous election cycles in US history. When I turn the tv off and opt for some gaming instead, the last thing I want to be faced with is more political bs. So that aspect was rather disappointing to me and I view it as being inconsiderate on the writer's part to be imposing very strong views of a touchy subject onto their players. The other thing I found a bit annoying was how they didn't improve the speed at which you ""jog"" and yet there are enough back and forth ""quests"" that you'll be yearning for a rocket propelled jet pack after the first hour. Typical filler. Make it take 10 minutes to get from point A to point B and call it gameplay.Now for the positives. The thing I love most about this game is the atmosphere. In my opinion it does an even better job of combining spirituality and magic with science and technology. With many games that attempt this, it's often too abstract and weird but here I find it enthralling. I liked that many of the characters found in the first two are still around and in some cases, more interesting. Nearly everything is choice driven and your choices do impact even minor details, which makes for better enjoyment of multiple play-throughs. The voice acting is fantastic, the soundtrack is beautiful, the graphics much improved and the story is mysteriously interesting. All in all it's a great adventure for the price.			"

												As quest this game sucks(except the first one, ""The Longest journey""). The empty, dead world, with boring, primitive puzzles. But the story (through all three games) amazing. It's a shame that there is no book, i definitely would like to read it on paper. In fact, the whole game is endless dialogues and runs between them. A sort of a visual version of the book. At the beginning boring but exciting at the end.As a result, I still recommend it. Because, although as the quest it's weak, but the story compensate it's lacks. However, the is necessary go through the entire trilogy, because it's a single story.Как квест игра определенно отстой(исключение первая: ""The Longest  Journey"").  Пустой, я бы сказал, мертвый мир, со скучными, примитивными  загадками. Но сюжет истории просто потрясающий. Если существовала бы книга, я с удовольствием ее бы прочитал.  По сути, вся игра, это одни диалоги с небольшими пробежками между ними. Этакий визуальный вариант книги.  В начале она покажется скучной, но чем дальше, тем быстрее сюжет будет набирать обороты.  В итоге, игру, я все же рекомендую. Так как, хотя как квест она и не очень, но сюжет компенсирует все недостатки. Правда, что бы было интересно и понятна суть, придется проходить всю трилогию, так как это единая история.			"

												I got so immersed in this game! I can't explain how entertaining it was to watch the cutscenes and look at the phenomenal camera angles and character's expressions.. I took quite a few screenshots. I couldn't help myself. There are minor problems, the voice cuts (choppy) at times during recap, long loading screen, lots of ""where was that place again?"" situations, and some say certain parts of the story didn't quite add up, though they liked the game a lot. I loved the story, the need to think some of the puzzles through, the characters. I didn't like some of the language. They have changed with that so if you are a parent of young children and want to guard them from foul language, wait until they are not around. They do get vulgar. :-/The innuendos didn't bother me. The little curse words didn't bother me, either.The graphics, wow!   I'd give this game a rating of 9/10, at the lowest 7/10. I only managed 75% of the achievements, will replay to get the rest after saving my files to another location. I played it safe except for one torture choice. Pip and the kidbot were my faves aside from the main charactors. I can't wait for the rest of the story! You do not have to pay for the rest of story. One flat fee, that's it. If you do not feel you have the patience to wait for the rest of the story, either you can buy it now and just wait, or wait to buy, or not buy. (It's all up to you) ;) This is personally my favorite type of game... I can't predict what you like. I can only tell you that I loved it!			"

												As a fan of the previous Dreamfall games, I definitely recommend this game. Due to it being a kickstarter project, it is obviously a little rough around the edges compared to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, but I am still impressed. The characters are great, the new actions are intriguing, and I love that they have added consequences to your choices. I'm also personally glad that the puzzles are a little more challenging than in Dreamfall: TLJ, as I found them far too easy in that game. I'm already addicted after Book One.			"

												If you're a big fan of the story in this universe, even playing the first 5 minutes of this game will cause emotional turmoil for sure.People were craving for a more omnipresent ""tlj vibe"" than we could get in Dreamfall and this new installment offers a bit of both, as it is - ofcourse - a continuation of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. The visual dreamy modern cyberpunk vision of Europolis (a new area in the game) has enough ""infusion"" of that new layer of story introduced back in 2006 to peak your interest as a fan, and to finally traverse the cliff we've been hanging on for 8 years.Zoë and Kian continue their adventure across dreams and realities, in detailed and story rich worlds like the storytime, Europolis and Arcadia. This first episode - with immersive story telling and descriptions of the world around you - sets the pace for what's to come in the next 4 books.And if you think that one added layer of story to the universe is enough for RTG ? Well it's not. Not to spoil things but even in book one it's appearent there's a new depth to be found in this already rich story which makes it very ""meta"".The story builds up and becomes very ""ominous"" in many ways. There's that layer which is in front of your face. Zoë wakes up from her coma, has to follow therapy to find her place in the world again, finds a hobby in rallying for a political party as volunteer, and goes back to work in what she has been schooled for. So its obvious that we continue the obvious bits from Dreamfall, we resume our relationship with Reza, we remember bits and pieces from our ordeal with Waticorp but not everything. But something is ominous, not everything is like it seems. And I'm not only talking about how you can make regarding your relationship with reza, the political party and your Psychiatrist. Nothing is like it seems, and the pedestrians you encounter as Zoë sometimes send you weird messages. As Kian, you get a new chance to redeem his character and he'll have to help the resistance to the Azadi, and he does so because we find out that he feels he owes a debt to the ""northlanders"" after killing their scorpion. So he came to his senses and is now helping the rebellion against his own people. In that quest you'll be making some hard choises and this is what makes the game interesting.Story wise it's all okey. It hands you interesting choises and bits to ponder about and it's fun to replay the game so you can see all aspects of the story unfolding and see un expected outcomes.Running around in marcuria and europolis is also very cool. The city is big but not super huge. After a few runs, I start to remember and orient myself and that creates a bonding with these areas. The game offers no compas, just an inworld map. As you learn to localize the different sectors in both world, I have the feeling that I'm drawn more into that fantasy because it makes me think about the location names and pinpoint their location as I walk. The old town market in marcura, the souk in Europolis, I start feeling like Zoë and Kian and start associating locations just like I would with my real life city.The only few negative things I have to say about the game is some puzzle stuff and the technology side of t hings, but there's positivity in there even:I feel that unity 4.6 (the engine they are using) seems to be unable to render the game at fluid fps even if you have a geforce 970, but having the misfortune to have an i5 from several generations back doesn't help the case ofcourse. Because the engine is very cpu bound and runs on one thread.I have to be intellectually honest as well and say that these guys did a massive job of creating such a rich and detailed world in that engine. Even some professionals are in awe to see such a densely populated world can be created with that engine. So they really push it to its limit. Kinda like what we did with our left 4 dead expansion, we were constantly flirting with the source edicts limitation. But this as a side note.The great thing is that, to release the game (I am talking again about Dreamfall Chapters) on playstation 4, they need to port everything over to unity 5 and optimize. When they completed that task which they said almost wrecked their company, The game ran almost at double the FPS for the same settings on several computer configurations including mine. Unity 5.2 offers lots more cpu optimization as well as improvement in the rendering engine. So as the road is evened for the game to be released on PS4 as well. So that's the positive about this negative point I'm describing.Another little ""meh"", is that you only seem to be able to activate a multi task puzzle from one option, which will activate all others. For example: in Marcuria, when Kian has to blow up the Azadi weapon stack, you HAVE to start outside the south gate and pick upo the black powder, then all other options for that puzzle inside the south gate (such as the nails) will become available for pickup or interaction. To me, this was confusing at first, as I just knew from visual inspection that there were a few opportunities for that puzzle. There are other ""jittery"" puzzle activations like that such as the azadi runner. You can manipulate it in such a way that you can shortcut his loop. I know this is done for convenience so that you don't have to wait for him to run the entire loop, but as you learn that you can just wait for him at the junction where he has to go left and right, you ofcourse adopt this procedure of working.Book 4 is such a wonderful journey that takes me back and makes my heart jump because you revisit several crucial locations and new wonderous places that are really really having the TLJ stamp on them.It's so nice that I kinda wish the game wasn't such an interactive walking simulator at that point. I wish that when Zoë arrived in the 2 magical new locations, there would be some kind of puzzle for you to solve, so you bond more with the place other than to live the story, which is very superb, but a puzzle where you had to work a bit to get to see these story bits, would have been nice.That's it for now. I'm adding to this review as consequent books come out.			"

												Ohhhh sweet jesus, please keep Shitbot in future chapters, he's a staple of the entire game.Dreamfall Chapters has a very enriching story, but for those who have not played the previous games (such as myself) may find that the Story Recap doesn't fill in all the blanks as the developers might have expected; I still found myself confused in some parts of the game when it alludes to the previous game, mainly ""who the heck are these characters and, if I know them, why do I know them and what have they done?"" The developers should have taken this into consideration and maybe added in quick snippets of ""flashbacks"" from the previous game the moment you meet one of these characters, there are a few games that do this, especially the Metal Gear Solid series, and it's very effective.Graphics-wise, this game is both very aesthetically pleasing but there is the case where the blending of colors gets a little messy... maybe that's just my computer, I dunno, I don't judge too harshly when it comes to graphics unless they are outright crap, which isn't the case.Knowing this is one of those ""visual novel""-esque adventure games, my judgment knows not to expect ""over the top"" action and gameplay, but more on revolving around being immersed in the story and context, and by god does Dreamfall do just that. I indeed felt very pressured when confronted with difficult choices, especially towards the end with the boyfriend. I think that's the few times in my life where thinking like a woman helps you greatly in that kind of situation, but I won't delve too deeply into it because spoilers.The humor is pretty good, but don't expect to laugh at every scene of course. The dialogue is very well-written, and I absolutely LOVE adventure games that have more than a single piece of dialogue whenever you examine something more than once.The soundtrack is okay, it has its moment every now and then but it's nothing to write home about.Herein lies the main issue I found, and it isn't just a problem for Dreamfall Chapters: the complexity of the problems you have to solve to progress in the game relates to that of a children's puzzle game; the difficulty of the game may be far too easy, even for an adventure game. I shouldn't be able to complete a chapter within 3 hours simply because the challenges of the game involved ""go to Point B, pick up Item X, return to Point A, repeat for the next challenge."" Maybe this will be resolved in the later books, but so far, that's only the first half of the issues.The last of the issues I found in Dreamfall is that the depth of your choices as it relates to what Zoe is thinking in coordination to what she actually says doesn't actually match up. To clarify: If for one choice (and this is all made up and does NOT contain any spoilers) Zoe is thinking ""Hmm, if I tell Character Z about the romantic relationship between Characters H and J, he might think I'm trying to sabotage their efforts for my own gain, maybe I shouldn't tell him about it at all"", I expect her to not say anything about the relationship at all, not say ""Well there is that one issue between two lovers, but I don't want to get into it."" There are instances in the game where what Zoe says doesn't match up with what you were going for, if that makes any sense. I noticed this to be more problematic when you're on the old woman's boat, but I won't say anything else for the sake of spoilers.Overall, I'm very ecstatic about the game and would recommend it to anyone. All I can hope for is that this excitement for looking forward to the future chapters doesn't turn into Buyer's Remorse as some people had with The Walking Dead.			"

												I am a Kickstarter backer and redthreadgames.com forum denizen.  They are a great development team and are taking the time to do things right.My personal preference has been to wait to play the game until all five Books are out...but I'm strange.  It does have a lovely menu screen, though.  =)You should buy the game now, however.  I'm sure you won't regret it!			"

												There is a lot to like about this game. It's beautiful, the voice acting is quite good, and the story is compelling - just mysterious enough to keep you on your toes from chapter to chapter. The biggest issue I have with this game is that, particularly in the later chapters, it feels like a series of cut scenes with the occasional opportunity for you to play. Sometimes ""play"" meant just move a character across a room to begin yet another cut scene. The last chapter felt like the designers hadn't even tried to make the player feel like they were a part of the game.			"

												Great game I recomend it despite the flaws.Pros:-great story-nice art-great characters.you would remember if any character died.-strong story surmounts seemingly minor flaws that all come together to wreak havocCons-Unity engine caused alot of techical problems early on and gave many gamers a bad first impression.(understatement)-Dreamfall still has some lingering point and click elements that need to die. specifically the puzzle elements as its not really a puzzle more like a guess/find whatever you need and bring it back (and at times you wont know what to do.)-The government in the future knows where you are at all times but you dont know were you are. There is no GPS in the future so if you suck with a map then youre going to suck here even more so. The mapping is very bad and hurts the flow of the story. I was lost constantly and eventually had to play with youtube ready. pathing was fixed up later though with crow flying you directly to objective but crow isnt there forever and some GPS would have been nice.-You absoulutely must access the internet for help during this game. seriously there is some off the wall crap in here that youre going to need help with. like figuring out what/where the puzzle is so that you can solve it kind of thing.

												This game is amazing, I have played the longest journey and dreamfall the longest journey and I was so excited when they started the kick starter for this game. The story is well written and the art is stunning, and I love all the little things around both Stark and Marcuria that reference the first two games. This saga has come along way and i must say it has yet to let me down. I am sad its almost over but its been a great journey c:			"

												Less a game, more like a playable movie.But that doesn't matter. A compelling story in a dystopic future, where Europe is just one big city and a parallel world exists.You get to play two personable main characters. To get going in the story you need to solve some puzzles. But mostly you walk around, search things and make decisions. And you want to know where the decisions will lead you.Also the game has some interesting ideas how the future may look like.10/10			"

												I absolutely love this game. It may only be the first of five chapters, but it's still one of my favorite games of 2014. It represents everything that I enjoy about modern narrative-driven adventure games. I love that you get to see the mundane everyday life stuff. I loved getting to explore Europolis and talk to everyone and interact with everything. I love the semi-dystopian cyberpunk future setting that reminds me of the likes of Deus Ex Human Revolution's Detroit. I love the branching conversations and decisions reminiscent of The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us (Red Thread seems to draw a lot of inspiration from TellTale, which is certainly not a bad thing in my eyes).I'm a relative newcomer to this series - I picked up and played through The Longest Journey and the original Dreamfall just weeks before Dreamfall Chapters came out. I'm certainly glad I did - they're both great games on their own, and frankly the brief video synopsis isn't really enough to get to know the characters and care about them. That said, Dreamfall Chapters is definitely my favorite of the trilogy so far; they seem to have learned their lessons from the previous games, and have brought it more in line with ""modern"" adventure games. I highly recommend playing through the whole trilogy.			"

												It's great to finally have a sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and even better for it to take form in what has so far been a beautiful game. I'm loving the choice/consequence system and my choices have got me on edge waiting for episode 2!! There are still a few bugs here and there but so far everything is running smoothly. The story is living up to D:TLJ's standard and I'm excited to see where it will lead. I don't really have any complaints about this game, if I had to give one I would say that I don't think it's possible to skip cutscenes, which can sometimes become frustrating. But otherwise Dreamfall Chapters is living up to all expectations!!			"

												Characters are surprisingly interesting and funny given the large and diverse cast they've got going. I was a little cautious at reading about it and I hadn't played the previous games but I rapidly found my feet and fell in love with the characters. Not much game mechanic beyond choice/consequence but I honestly don't mind that much as it is so interesting. The different settings really break it up while carrying over common themes and characters. There has been an annoyingly long wait between books but I don’t think I’ve ever hit a bug or major issue with the game from a technical stanceIn short, I love this game and would thoroughly recommend it. If you’re a fan of story and character driven games, give it a go. However, if you are more into challenges, mechanics, puzzles and shooters then best give it a wide berth.

												After so many years of waiting the journey continues. With technical glitches (low FPS at some points, disappearing objects on the streets, camera looking through characters' insides). But that just does not matter. It still has the feeling of that exact game, it was before, mixed with Telltale-like story branching. The only thing I can complain about - lack of puzzles.Book Two update: Now that is a major step forward. Puzzles (still want more, but even that amount is great), increased playtime, even story makes me dive into it much deeper, than the first book!			"

While jarring in some areas, mostly the animations, it just delivers it's fantastic story through charm, overlaying plots and tugging on your heart strings.It was a fantastic journey, from start to end and leaves me wanting more, yet I still feel it was a worthy ending of a personal story told through games.

												Having not played the first two games and only completing Book One, I'm not sure how my review will stack up with others, but here goes:I became innitially interested in this game after watching the announcement trailer. The graphics are breathtaking and the soundtrack is simply amazing. The gamplay revives the old point and click adventure genre, which is a fine change from the general FPS and other action games that I usually play. The game's storyline is based around the choices that you do or don't make, seemingly driving home moral choices and decisions with consequences. I found myself immersed in the storyline and am probably going to try and find the previous two games so that I can ""catch up"" with the story so far. I found myself running around and interacting with almost everything that I could just to hear the part of Zoe's inner monologue. I also found myself laughing at some of the descriptions and narrations that she has for the area of Eurotropolis that you live and work in.Overall I'm looking forward to seeing how this game plays out in the future and am curious to see what happens in Book Two.

												Absolutely everything I could have hoped for, this game was obviously made for the fans with a lot of love. It's not watered down to cator to the casual players in todays gaming market..it's for the long time fans. The graphics are astonishing..specially for a kickstarter project everything in this game is just breathtaking. The game has full controller support and also buttons so people who like to use a controller will be very happy.Not gonna go into details about the story because I'd spoil the book..let just put it this way. The incredible stories the last 2 games were known for continue on in Chapters ;) even better in my opinion. The voice acting is some of the best I have heard in a long time, was wary about the replacing the actress for Zoe but I find myself liking the new one more. The script is extremely polished and there's still a ton of inside jokes xD2 playthroughs so far and clocked in at almost 10 hours, working on my third playthrough now. There is so much to do and see :)Edit: Been 4 days after launch and I'm still being drawn back into the game..there is just so many things that keep hooking me.			"

												This game is one of the greatest masterpieces that I have ever played. What you expect is a typical puzzle-adventure game that has choices that change the sotry and, since there is a decent list of choice games, this would seem like a terrible thing to play. But! This game keeps you on your toes, throws many unexpected things in your face, makes you care about the characters and hate the enemies and truly contemplate whether the choice you have made was the right one or not. When the game finally ends there will still be more that you wanna do, more that you want answered, and you would want to play it again. I would recommend this 100% to anyone.			"

												Didn't play the first games. Totally will be.Still, after finishing Dreamfall Chapters it became one of my top favourite games ever. Seriously. And that's not easy.My list was like Unreal'99, Unreal Tournament, Skyrim, Morrowind, Rune and so on and so forth.Now it's Dreamfall Chapters and the rest.Probably will stay this for a long time. And, this is my first review, never cared for writing any but this game... It's worth it.Why do I like it.- Characters - not ordinary superpowered heroes or heroines, they tend to use brains instead of force and guns. And that's something different.- Sens of humor - it matched perfectly with mine.- Story telling - Incredibly well done despite the not top quality animations.- Voice acting - a masterpiece.- Music - makes my skin crawl. Everywhere, every time.- Universe - made me want to buy other games of that series, read and discover everything there is about the Dreamtime. That's a lot.- Decissions - yep, they really have an impact on the story. Well, I guess, I'll be replaying the whole game soon to check that out.- Crow - 'cause there is Crow.Why I didn't like it.- At first the animations seemed like sloppy in the cutscenes but after a few minutes it didn't matter. Probably because we are all so familiar with tripple A mocap animations and face rigging, morphing, and that kind of crap that is really, really unimportant for the overall game experience.  So, there isn't really anything that I didn't like. Cross that out please!And that's all.A full and complete 10 out of 10. I only wish I could give it more.Hell, I can, my review, my rules. At lest 16/10. Totally blew my mind, never expected such a brilliant experience.			"

												In terms of storyline, the game has the most beautiful story ever made for a videogame (my personal opinion) which shows the intelligence of the game creators/ designers. However, I was hoping for more emphasis on gameplay. Not saying making similar to TLJ (which is best games out of the three installments) but at least I was expecting dreamfall chapters be very similar to the previous dreamfall. The other thing, making Kian as gay doesn’t fit his personality (not saying being gay is bad) he seems to be a brutal fighter with an iron personality like a Greek God. Other than that, the ending was awesome and satisfying to the core. Thank you for the awesome saga.			"

												Still not as good as The Longest Journey was, but it's a solid adventure game. It starts off a bit slow and the ending felt a little ""Deus Ex Machina"", but it gave a pretty satisfying conclusion to Zoe's story. One thing I will say is that (despite optimizations) it still runs pretty poorly. If you haven't played The Longest Journey or Dreamfall yet, PLAY THEM FIRST, not only is TLJ a fantastic adventure game, a lot of Chapters won't make sense or be of interest wihotut at least having played Dreamfall as a minimum, preferably TLJ as well.Also, the ending is very OMG THERE IS MORE STORY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT YET!! which may annoy some.

												TL:DR a really great follow up to Dreamfall the Longest Journey. Probably worth playing that at least before playing this as you'll enjoy this games story a lot more.This is a great sequel to Dreamfall The Longest journey which surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. Its not absolutely necessary to have played the previous game, as there is a video that will fill you in on the details, but I would highly recommend playing it before playing this (and playing The Longest Journey before that). This game is basically the continuation of the story of the TLJ and DTLJ and it makes for a pretty good finish to the series.The game again follows Zoe and Kian, the main characters of the last game. Zoe a resident of a futuristic version of or world called Stark who has the ability to travel to Starks counterpart world,Arcadia, which is a magic fantasy world where Kian is from. I found Zoe and Kian were more fleshed out as characters in this game and they're a lot more interesting and likeable as a result.The big new addition to this game is the choice system. Similar to Telltales games you'll be confronted with decisions as you play through the story, decisions that will affect events and characters later in the game. I know in a lot of game like this tend to have choices that in reality dont change anything but the outcomes of decisions in this game do have noticeable and unpredictable consequences later on which gives them more substance.Good points:-the locations in this game are great and look amazing. You'll play as Zoe mostly in a massive futuristic supercity called Europolis while the city of Marcuria from the last game also returns but with a massive overhaul -Zoe and Kian are actually more likeable as characters in this game as well as some interesting minor characters featuring a mix of old and new characters-its nice to have a choice system with some substance as you'll find your choices do affect outcomes later in the story.-its nice to see that the developers have removed some of the stuff that just didnt really work in the last game such as stealth and combat sectionsBad points:-this game is pretty badly optimized. Even on the lowest graphical settings I was getting a pretty low FPS even though my  machine meets the recommended specs "

												Edit :I`ve played through the full game twice now. Including book 5. And it`s a goddam masterpiece. Thanks RTG. You did well. I`m glad we could embark on this journey. It was amazing. And I do hope we will see more stories from the Dreamfall universe. There are some many questions so many untold stories. Would be sad if RTG dropped the series.The stuff I and many others complained about does wash away in the grand scheme of things. It`s just an incredible journey. No one should miss this out. Really. No. One.PS: Crow I love you.""First of all this rating is up to book 4 since the 5. and last book has not been released yet.Do I recommend this game? Well, yes I do. But you should consider a few things before buying and playing this. Dreamfall Chapters is the third game of the series which started in 1999 with ""The longest Journey"". So in order to properly enjoy and understand `Chapters` you must have played at least the second title of the series `Dreamfall - The longest Journey'. Because it ends with a cliffhanger and `Chapters` picks up where `Dreamfall - TLJ` left off.But actually you should have played `The longest Journey`as well. Because it`s a good game. And it does contribute to `Chapters` storyline. Now lets take a look at the game itself. Chapters is a game which is all about it`s storyline and characters. The gameplay is pretty much boild down to a walking simulator. The design of the worlds themself is like in it`s two predecessors top notch. Immersing and beautiful. The graphics quality is good. Could be better but they do look well enough.  On the other hand we should keep in mind that this games development is still in progress and it is beeing made by a handful of people. And they put together an amazing game. And despite some issues I had with this game I still loved it. The storyline behind all the Dreamfall games is really good. Could`ve easily been a real book. So. To draw the circle back to my first question. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. To everyone who enjoys a good story and good likeable characters.And please do keep in mind that this game is developed by few people. It is not perfect. But still a f**king masterpiece!""			"

												This is my second attempt to write a review for this game. In the previous one I spent a long time comparing this game to the previous ones in the series. However, all it boiled down to was that if you have played those games, want to see the end of the story, then buy this. Otherwise, you are better off playing the first game in this series, The Longest Journey. The point and click interface suits this style of story driven game much better. Controlling the protagonist directly adds nothing to this type of game and I would have loved to have expanded puzzles with less disconnect between the dialogue and the actual game play.However for fans of the series some things need to be mentioned. The acting really bothered me. I don't mean of the people giving the voices but of the character models themselves. While having conversations with people, they would just stand there like blocks of wood while speaking. This was the first time this has annoyed me so much in a video game and more time should have been devoted to giving the characters life. Also I had some technical  trouble. When using my 360 pad in this game control would constantly switch to mouse and keyboard as I played. Switching back was not too difficult but it did detract from the experience a little. Another thing which was rather distracting was the hair of a certain character constantly clipping into her body. These issues made the whole package seem a bit cheap.To sum up, if you've played the other games then you have probably already decided whether you want to see the story's conclusion here. The gameplay is much like Dreamfall, the precursor to this game. Others, should give The Longest Journey a try if they want to experience this world and the great memorable characters that live there. As long as you can stomach the aged visuals, play that game instead, there really is much more GAME than is on display there.			"

												Still not as good as The Longest Journey was, but it's a solid adventure game. It starts off a bit slow and the ending felt a little ""Deus Ex Machina"", but it gave a pretty satisfying conclusion to Zoe's story. One thing I will say is that (despite optimizations) it still runs pretty poorly. If you haven't played The Longest Journey or Dreamfall yet, PLAY THEM FIRST, not only is TLJ a fantastic adventure game, a lot of Chapters won't make sense or be of interest wihotut at least having played Dreamfall as a minimum, preferably TLJ as well.Also, the ending is very OMG THERE IS MORE STORY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT YET!! which may annoy some. Plz Ragnar, we can haz The Longest Journey Home?			"

												Let's be honest, its not a real adventure game, more like an interactive movie (nobody expected hard quests from it tbh). Animation and other technical things could be better... But who cares? I'm a long time fan, from the very beginning. Still one of my favorite series. Touching, mysterious, colorful, immersive. One of the greatest worlds I've ever seen in games (and I've seen a lot of them). Deep, diverse characters, you really like them. They make you laugh and cry, even if they move like robots. And this plot... never seen anything like that. I cried in the end and I don't care.Yes, may be I don't judge this game rationally. Clearly it has faults (it is a Kickstarter project for god's sake, nobody expected a technological marvel). But for me it is just love. It is the connection on emotional level. I guess you need to be a fan of the trilogy to truly understand this. Otherwise you can be disappointed and I get why there are negative reviews.I whish this Longest Journey never ended...			"

												●It`s such an amazing game! It absorbs you right from the start and till the very end. These stories, which are tangled together, are extremely touching, adventurous and striking! ● Even if I haven`t played previous games, but I hope, I will do it someday, I really enjoyed it. I don’t think that this somehow influenced my understanding of the whole plot, but, in my opinion, it has right to be as an independed piece of art with connections to the previous stories (as for the people who played only this part). ● Choices & consequences – I adore such style so much. You never know where your action may lead and that is what also keeping you up to the end. There`s always a choice. And not always this choice is the right one, you can’t know for sure. Moreover, it`s one of these examples when you can act peacefully and not use your fists to solve one or another issue. And I love it. Also you need to be attentive to things. There are things that you can do and sometimes should do that are not on your goal list. So, again, if you won`t do them, there will be consequences… And that`s cool as well. And sad, sometimes.  ●Puzzles were quite puzzles (and under puzzles I mean not only puzzles puzzles, I also mean different situation like “go there, and do it there, under the right tree, which is near the wrong tree, which is in front of the house with some roof, which is not a roof at all”), but sometime it was almost impossible for me to figure some things out, especially on the moment with the references to the previous games.  ●This part has fantastic dialogues and characters, that were well-designed (appearances and personalities). Especially Enu and Crow (who, I guess, also participated in previous stories). ●  Again – the plot is fantastic. And I’d been experiencing waterfalls of tears starting from the 3rd interlude. BUT I would like to see what happened to some characters in the end. I know, that they`re alive (at least for my story), but what`s happening to them now? And the epilogue was a bit messed up for me, as (in my opinion) I don’t quite know what was in the previous parts.●  And two more things to say:-	Amazing and stunning soundtrack-	For the first time I actually had a feeling then one achievement truly reflected my “understanding” of “what`s goin’ on”. (the beginning of the 5th book, if you know what I mean)  To sum up, I would truly recommend you to experience this fascinating journey!			"

												* No-spoilers review: *The game's Books One through Four are nothing if not spectacular and spin the story's threads in a very skilled and logical and thought-provoking manner. I couldn't recommend them more.And then comes Book Five. Which I can only describe as: WTF?First of all, it's not a Book like the others, it's an overblown ending sequence, with very brief interactive intermissions. It's so obviously rushed, that I immediately catch myself excusing the creators for some simple reason - I don't know, running out of money? out of studio time? personal issues? - the likes of which tend to plague Kickstarter-born, drawn-out projects - and I start thinking, ""well, all right, it was probably either a rushed Book Five or no Book Five"". But then again I slap myself mentally a little. After all, I did pay for five books of an interactive story. and instead I got four interactive books and one blatantly rushed epilogue. Mixed feelings abound.Oh, and if it were a nice, wrapping-it-all, climactic epilogue, I may not have whined as I am. But whine I shall.* Spoilers from here on. *First of all... Saga. Previously a doodling toddler, known to have some connection to April. A reincarnation? A kindred soul? Aaactually, no, rather a rebellious songliner (what?) who prefers songs to drawings now (because?) and she's actually traveled a countless myriad worlds, that's what she does, playing life on cheat mode and apparently being a professional prophecy-fulfiller. WHAT? Oh never mind, we'll never know. And who is this Rose, whom old Saga mentions when talking about flying teacups and dragonflies, wasn't it Queenie the Chinese-ish old lady who did those? Mind you, I love throwaway expositions and  cliffhanger endings, but not instead of a proper, logical, consistent wrap-up.Then... Kian's future. Saga steps in, saves the day, actually saves several decades, making Kian the Bloodless King with herself by his side. Roll credits, ""And The Adventure Continues""! Aaactually, no, we're seeing Kian as the king, and then Saga as an old crone, and worlds after the Merge, and... Wait, wait, the time to do a cute, perversely counter-climactic cliffhanger is over, why do we have SEVERAL of them? Next... Undreaming takes center stage. It's the most horrible, destructive force! Let's set it free. Book Four mentioned the Nightmare as being the necessary, unavoidable dark side of the Dreaming, very specifically NOT the same as Undreaming, which just cancels out everything. And yet here we go, Undreaming has an Undreamer and is needed to Balance? What?And next... The Machine. On the Arcadia side, it was built by Westhouse to power the spear to unleash the Undreaming, all right, but how come a very similar machine was built on the Stark side at the same time? Sure, there's a nice ""worlds mirrored"" vibe here, but it's never explained nor even hinted at. Brian only names Helena a ""tool"", hardly a mere insult, rather a direct reference to her being a pawn in his game - but wasn't he, like, unable to get to Stark in any way, let alone manipulate people there? Also, does Eingana ""collect dream energy"" (for whatever purpose and whatever that is), or ""influence people's dreams to reshape reality""? Those are two very different concepts, and yet they're mixed up in the same dialogue.Finally... It was all about choices so far. We got to decide people's lives or deaths, we got to watch the Balance icon shift this way or another... And in the end, Zoe simply calls Helena ""insane"" and prefers to help destroy Eingana, without a single thought that maybe, just maybe, ""rebooting the world, without disease, without violence"" might actually be a GOOD thing, if possible? No moral dilemmas, no free will versus wise control?All this looks as if the storywriter for the previous four Books got fired, and a new one was brought in for the last Book, and he/she did as good a job as they could after being given only 10 minutes to acquaint themselves with the whole story so far.Book Five belongs in a different game, in a different reality. A damn shame. The first four Books are truly magical, enthralling and a true pleasure to play - but Book Five just deserves a rewrite.			"

												Okay, I'm re-writing my original review because when I wrote it, the game only had one chapter :P I just finished the whole thing and wow! It's a fabulous experiance for fans and maybe even for newcomers as it does explain some elements of the past games enough to let newbies enjoy it too.I love the character designs, from surreal to highly decorated, to creepy and etherial. I have only one gripe: clues, or rather lack of! The puzzles are well thought out and logical but there's no clues on how to complete them and you really have to hunt high and low for the solutions which can take half an hour to fourty five minutes, I think all the game needs to be perfect is a hint system or introduction of better clues in the objecttives. Aside from that I really enjoyed it a lot, shame it's all over now *cries*Farewell Stark, Arcadia, April, Zoe, Crow and everyone else, it's been a fabulous journey all these years, and in the future, when more years pass, I'll pick it up again and enjoy it once more. :)			"

												DreamFall Chapters (DFC) is a good game with small(ish) production values.I played the whole game at once so the episodic problems were not apparent to me. I also played The Longest Journey (TLJ) and DreamFall (DF) quite recently. Pluses: very good overall story, replayability due to choices, nice graphics (especially models)Minuses: even though the game looks good (models are good, scenery is ok) the animations are bad, the overall story is good but many subplots and side-stories feel incomplete, some explanations are missing, lackluster gameplay (very few items and puzzles) feels more like an interactive story than an adventure(quest) game.TLJ was a complete story/incident in this universe (the missing guardian/balance problems). DF was not - it was only the first part of another story/incident (the problems with dreams). DFC is the second part of the story started in DF, so anyone who played DF should play DFC.And also by the same reasoning, playing DFC without playing DF makes absolutely no sense. And TLJ should also be played to really enjoy/understand this game.I hope there will be another game in this universe.			"

												If you're a fan of story driven games, this one is wonderful.But it's not perfect.  In fact there's a lot that I would want to improve about it - better puzzles and more freedom to find solutions to them, for instance.  Some of the puzzles were a bit frustrating to figure out the solutions to, and it wasn't like they were hard and then very satisfying to solve: they were just frustrating.  For instance (and this isn't necessarily the best or only example, it's just the one that comes to mind) during one of the missions you have to figure out a way to distract a guard.  You can think of a million different ways to do it, but sadly the game is limiting to the degree that there's only one solution that is written into the game, and it's not even necessarily the most obvious one.However, the characters, settings, and stories that make up Dreamfall Chapters are really cool.  And so is the soundtrack.  I found myself inspired by many of the themes and story elements in this game (for instance, in the scientific half of the Twin Worlds of Dreamfall, Stark, many of the inhabitants of the city Europolis are ""dream junkies."" The junkies wear ""dream machines"" and essentially jack in and check out, finding better lives for themselves inside of their dreams - you can see how that kind of thing poses some philosophical questions!).I'll openly admit some bias, as I really enjoyed playing Dreamfall: The Longest Journey on X-Box now over a decade ago.  So I bought Chapters upon its release, and have been playing each ""book"" as they came out.  I won't say this game is one that really digs its claws in and demands to be finished right away.  It took me more than a year to finish it, and that's not _only_ because of the way the game was released.  But the story is interesting, and there's enough to chew on, that it's a satisfying play and you'll remember what's going on every time you pick it back up.This game won't be right for everyone.  It's not action packed, there's no precision timing or jumping or aiming, and there's no combat.  But strip away some of the frustrating mechanics of how the game works and there's a beautiful and sincere story being told with a very rich cast of characters.			"

Dreamfall chapters, it is worthwhile.I decided to buy this game just from sheer curiosity at a random Steam sale they made, celebrating the completion of all the five books I think or something along those lines, and man, it was so worth it.ImpressionsAt first I was totally at loss, I was like, what in God's name is going on. The story I felt I was missing something, and yes I totally did, I was totally oblivous to the fact there were two other games before Dreamfall Chapters, even though this was in the game description I read too fast...however, having the summer sales in front of me, I just grabbed them and started playing them, that's how cool I found these games.Never having played these series, you eventually get more and more bits as story goes on, and you begin to understand the context, however, to my horror, I realized I actually spoiled myself several important things that happened in the previous games, that should I have played them, would have gone ""Aha..."" with a knowing smirk, instead I was at a loss, and then I realized I was with the whole story of The Longest Journey in front of me, shucks!If you have not played the others, don't you worry, you will get to love and understand what is happening just fine in these games, but perhaps, with less insight and complementary details of whole story. Should you go and buy the other 2 games first before playing these? Well that will depend, I'm still playing the first, and I like it, but the first game is a 1999 game, so gameplay inclusions (such as the little journal interface that tells you what are your objectives and such) & graphically-wise it *might* not be suitable for you, it is up to your tastes.The StoryIt is sort of weird at first and at a loss, but I found it quite enjoyable, really enjoyable. Quite...original in a sort of way, if you ask me. Certainly, there could be improvements here and there, and if you can't help but try to find out every single  flaws that might and is, and concentrate on them like you can in ANY game really, you will ruin yourself the game of course and won't like it. People can sometimes find anything to rant at if they want, however, if you sit back and relax, this game, I can assure, is an entertaining experience.The Story takes place in four dimensions principally, one futuristic (hovering robots & stuff), one archaic (magic, knights, etc.), dream-state, and a location in between time and space. I really don't want to go on much about what this is all about, because part of the treat of this game is to progressively discover it by yourself, but this has stories that take good advantage of their varied tematics and manage to blend them well.The voice-acting is really good, the voice tones adequate to their characters, and the dialogue is pretty funny, specially if you have a twisted/dark humor. Gotta love Mira.The GameplayThis is actually something that I found out, that if you have not played the other games, you will be probably at a loss at first like me, like ""what is this, and what does it does?"", but somehow, it was obvious enough to get it after the very first intro level, and after that you will be learning new tricks. Sometimes the puzzles can be pretty tricky because you expect to find everything in the environment, and you forget to check your inventory. Sometimes it will ask you to remember past experiences you had while interacting with the characters and the like to resolve a problem you might be facing, one involving a certain robot had me laughing in disbelief, thinking, ""Oh my, had I not talked to it for kicks and giggles before it would have never occured to me, and I can't believe this was the true purpose of it all along"". Sometimes things are just plain hidden (sometimes well too hidden) or are just plain, and you'll have to sort of just go around searching what is the only thing you can ""target"" that you had not noticed before or such, and that is a little meh, but you find the forgiveness in your heart for the devs.While you are setup in different areas, it might slightly feel at first that you have a lot to explore and that you'll find scurvy rich pirate treasure if you look hard enough, but no. I mean, you'll certainly find an interesting reference or something funny here and there, but in truth I felt it was pretty linear with a touch of an open-world illusion, but of course, you have to remember you are in a playable bedtime story and it is easy to forget it. I must confess that what has given me most thrills in this game, is the very moment where you are expected to make a decision. You are offered to see what the rest of the people has chosen the most, but I advise out of it, you'll get biased for sure. But it is not having to take the decision that gave me goosebumps, but what comes inmediately next. ""The Balance has shifted"", somehow everytime that happened I had an ominous feeling, like I had sealed my fate for good, and had me eager to see what would happen now. The little versions of it, with the ""!"" symbol at first were not as dreadful in my head, but I soon learnt to rethink that. Everytime it pops, I went ""Oh my..."", sometimes you don't expect what you answered to have an effect, not always it does, and not always you'll know that its going to be, so play true to yourself.GraphicsThe Arcadia world (the magical, archaic one) made me feel like I was playing Dragon Age: Origins, if you have played it, then you know what to expect graphically. Meaning, a beautiful world available for you to gaze at (unless you start to hyperventilate if things aren't in 4k and such), *however*, you will perhaps encounter here and there little small things that could use improvement or don't show properly, but that won't ruin your experience at all, specially in the Book 1 and 2. After the Book 3 I felt a notable improvement, even with the responsiveness of the game at a whole, but maybe it was just me. The only things that perhaps bothered me at times, where areas where the framerate dropped drastically, specially if I had high/awesome settings, and that there is few ""background NPC"" models available in the cities, this means that, the ""background people"" living in it would start to get repetitive after a little while of loitering around, and that makes the maps feel...synthetic, for lack of a better word, nevertheless, it is not something that will tamper with your overall experience by, say, having a ""way too negative impact"".ControlsFair simple, you can use a keyboard just fine, but I liked the xbox controller more, however if you plan in using a controller prepare for your left second finger to fall off, as you will abuse it by having to maintain pressed the ""run"" trigger almost during your whole gameplay.     OverallA beautiful game worth the money (although I say this because I payed 10$ for it, I would honestly wait for a sale if you can, if the full price is not an issue for your wallet, well, go ahead), good voice acting, entertaining dialogue, charismatic characters, overally enjoyable visuals, and simple but sometimes tricky gameplay. No regrets from my part, I fell in love with these series, and now I'm going to enjoy the previous ones.I say 8/10.Thank you for reading! Hope it helps, and that you enjoy as much as I did this game should you decide to get it. :)TL;DRStory - Gud, u wil lyk, if you lyk magik + future stuff. 9/10Voice-acting - Veri gud. Funny. Acceptable, would probably marry some of the people who voiced the character just by their voice tone. 8/10Gameplay - U git gud from 1st lv. No bosses. No overkills. Simple. Stuff pretty hidden sometimes & feels slightly random maybe. 7/10Graphx - Many nice. So few errors, much eye enjoy anyway. 9/10Controls - gg 2 ez. 2nd left finger hurts if you play on Xbawzx controlz 2 long. 10/10			"

												As someone who's played the two games that came before, I was happy to see the kickstarter. Some continuation on the story and maybe even a conclusion. I've been with the game since the kickstarter and the developers haven't disappointed. Regular updates and lots of fine tuning. Although they have chosen for an episodic release, I rather play the game in one go so I've waited until all 5 books were released.The game itself is a worthy successor to the story and offers some nice plot twists. Choices you make actually make an impact on the story and for some of the choices you'll hit yourself in the head later on in the game, even though at the time you thought you made the right call or thinking wouldn't have any repercussions. I'm sure there's a lot of content I haven't even seen yet.There's a pretty decent introduction to the story included in the game, but to grasp the full story you really should play (or watch a let's play) of the earlier games. There are quite a lot of references in the game that are only appreciated if you have played the earlier games.The story is mostly linear with only a few puzzles that require you to wander around and find the right things to do. This is a plus in my case as I love to enjoy the story and not have too many distractions of pointlessly running around until I find the one thing that the developer hoped you'd logically find in order to solve the puzzle. I think a pretty nice balance is found here. The pause introduced in order to solve the puzzle allows you to appreciate the story more once it continues.The graphics are great and the only downside I'd think of would be that there could be more expressions on the faces of the characters during conversations.

												The so-long awaited sequel (I waited for all books to be released before start playing it), it was initially a disappointment for me. I was really impressed with the Graphic, but after a somewhat interesting introduction, the story was feeling so..different and flat from what I expected. In some moments I had the feeling I was playing a political game, with a lot of boring back tracking and long uninteresting dialoges. Then other moments I had to do some boring quests like in modern MMO.I was really tempted to abandon the game, because I didn't feel any involment / bound with characters, the story was just uninteresting and some voice acting are kinda bad.But - but luckly I didn't dismiss the game and forced me to keep playing. And at the end of book 2 / start of book 3, finally, finally I started enjoying exactly like the previous one.  Plot got very interesting, full of emotions, and also the new characters introduced have a better voice acting.Now I'm at the last book, and I definitely don't regret that I bought this game.The magic of before is still there...it doesn't matter how it will ends, at least now I am enjoying it like I did with the previous one.

												Okay, I'm re-writing my original review because when I wrote it, the game only had one chapter :P I just finished the whole thing and wow! It's a fabulous experiance for fans and maybe even for newcomers as it does explain some elements of the past games enough to let newbies enjoy it too.I love the character designs, from surreal to highly decorated, to creepy and etherial. I have only one gripe: clues, or rather lack of! The puzzles are well thought out and logical but there's no clues on how to complete them and you really have to hunt high and low for the solutions which can take half an hour to fourty five minutes, I think all the game needs to be perfect is a hint system or introduction of better clues in the objecttives. Aside from that I really enjoyed it a lot, shame it's all over now *cries*Farewell Stark, Arcadia, April, Zoe, Crow and everyone else, it's been a fabulous journey all these years, and in the future, when more years pass, I'll pick it up again and enjoy it once more. :)			"

												A mere shadow of the games that came before it, it is, unfotunately, merly adequate as a conclusion to two of the best adventure games ever made.I will miss April and Zoe. Most of all, however, I will miss Bird (I mean Crow, sorry bird!).			"

												DreamFall Chapters (DFC) is a good game with small(ish) production values.I played the whole game at once so the episodic problems were not apparent to me. I also played The Longest Journey (TLJ) and DreamFall (DF) quite recently. Pluses: very good overall story, replayability due to choices, nice graphics (especially models)Minuses: even though the game looks good (models are good, scenery is ok) the animations are bad, the overall story is good but many subplots and side-stories feel incomplete, some explanations are missing, lackluster gameplay (very few items and puzzles) feels more like an interactive story than an adventure(quest) game.TLJ was a complete story/incident in this universe (the missing guardian/balance problems). DF was not - it was only the first part of another story/incident (the problems with dreams). DFC is the second part of the story started in DF, so anyone who played DF should play DFC.And also by the same reasoning, playing DFC without playing DF makes absolutely no sense. And TLJ should also be played to really enjoy/understand this game.I hope there will be another game in this universe.			"

												Ever since I played Dreamfall-The longest Journey, I've been a fan of this series. I played Dreamfall-The longest Journey before I played The longest Journey (I was too young to play games when The longest Journey came out in the first place^^) and I got obsessed with these games. I'm not exagerrating when I say that these games changed my life. The story and the world(s) it is set in are awesome, the characters are memorable and loveable and that's the reason why I - like so many others - waited eight years for the sequel to follow. And by far I am not disappointed at all. Dreamfall Chapters is AMAZING. I love it so much and after finishing the third episode lately I almost cried my eyes out after meeting an old friend...I hardly recommend this game for everyone who enjoys an intelligent, inspiring story with political elements and overwhelming fantasy, but I would suggest to play Dreamfall-The Longest Journey and The Longest Journey, too, because there are so many details and hints in the story you might miss otherwise. Anyway, I'm in love with the Dreamer. I love her new haircut ♥ And I freaking love this game!!!			"

												If you're a fan of story driven games, this one is wonderful.But it's not perfect.  In fact there's a lot that I would want to improve about it - better puzzles and more freedom to find solutions to them, for instance.  Some of the puzzles were a bit frustrating to figure out the solutions to, and it wasn't like they were hard and then very satisfying to solve: they were just frustrating.  For instance (and this isn't necessarily the best or only example, it's just the one that comes to mind) during one of the missions you have to figure out a way to distract a guard.  You can think of a million different ways to do it, but sadly the game is limiting to the degree that there's only one solution that is written into the game, and it's not even necessarily the most obvious one.However, the characters, settings, and stories that make up Dreamfall Chapters are really cool.  And so is the soundtrack.  I found myself inspired by many of the themes and story elements in this game (for instance, in the scientific half of the Twin Worlds of Dreamfall, Stark, many of the inhabitants of the city Europolis are ""dream junkies."" The junkies wear ""dream machines"" and essentially jack in and check out, finding better lives for themselves inside of their dreams - you can see how that kind of thing poses some philosophical questions!).I'll openly admit some bias, as I really enjoyed playing Dreamfall: The Longest Journey on X-Box now over a decade ago.  So I bought Chapters upon its release, and have been playing each ""book"" as they came out.  I won't say this game is one that really digs its claws in and demands to be finished right away.  It took me more than a year to finish it, and that's not _only_ because of the way the game was released.  But the story is interesting, and there's enough to chew on, that it's a satisfying play and you'll remember what's going on every time you pick it back up.This game won't be right for everyone.  It's not action packed, there's no precision timing or jumping or aiming, and there's no combat.  But strip away some of the frustrating mechanics of how the game works and there's a beautiful and sincere story being told with a very rich cast of characters.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is an adventure game, and its the third game in the series which also includes The Longest Journey, and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.The story takes place on two worlds which exist in different dimensions, Earth (also known as Stark), which is focused on science, and Arcadia, which is focused on magic. Earth is only inhabited by Humans, most of whom don't know that Arcadia exists, whereas Arcadia is also inhabited by several different races, and the whole parallel worlds thing is common knowledge. A very small number of people have the ability to travel between worlds.The player controls two characters, Zoe Castillo, who lives on Earth, and Kian Alvane, who lives on Arcadia. Zoe is just an ordinary young woman, struggling to figure out what to do with her life, until she gets caught up in a sinister plot involving the world's leading entertainment company and their dream machines (similar to Virtual Reality devices, but the user is asleep and has control over their dreams). Kian is a soldier for the Azadi nation, who starts to realise that his people are kind of evil, and the massive tower they're building might not actually be a good thing.Gameplay involves making dialogue choices during conversations with other characters, and quite often there are decisions to make which will influence how the story plays out. There's also plenty of opportunity to explore and interact with the environment, and a decent amount of puzzle solving.Zoe's character and storyline are really interesting. She's got a family and a boyfriend, and she's living in a massive city called Europolis, the year is something like 2220 so the technology is advanced, there are huge skyscrapers, neon lights, vibrant music, and the city is alive with people wandering around, doing their own thing.By contrast, I found Kian's sections to be a bit dull. He's completely lacking in personality, and he's a soldier in a game that features no combat, so he's just kind of pointless. And even though Arcadia is supposed to be full of magic, you don't really see it very often. The main city, Marcuria, is much smaller and quieter than Europolis, and at times just feels a bit dead. The one good thing about Arcadia is a supporting character called Crow. He's a talking bird, and he is awesome, much more entertaining than Kian. Voice acting is really good all around (including Kian - its the same actor who gave a good performance in Dragon Age 2 as male Hawke, so I think the problem with this character lies more with the script than the actor). The graphics look fantastic. I didn't get a consistent 60 FPS, but that's not really necessary in this kind of slow paced adventure, so I left all the settings at max. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes, and I played with my X360 controller. It took me 25 hours to finish, so value for money is good at full price.Dreamfall Chapters is a really enjoyable game, and if you like a good story, I definitely recommend playing this. Even though I've been quite negative about Kian, the game is still worth playing for Zoe's story, as well as every scene involving Crow. I would also strongly advise you to play Dreamfall: TLJ (the second game in the series) first, because that game ends in a cliff-hanger, and DC continues directly on from that point. I think you need to play D:TLJ to fully understand the story of DC.However, I'd say you can probably skip The Longest Journey (the first game in the series). While some characters do appear in all 3 games, the story from the first game doesn't really have much relevance for the other 2 games. (TLJ is also harder to recommend because its a more stereotypical point and click adventure, involving puzzles based around crazy logic and combining random objects).			"

												Sok fajta játék létezik...Van olyan amivel játszunk pár jó pillanattal gazdagodunk általa.Vannak olyanok amiket kedvelünk szeretjük az általuk elénk tárt világot ami körbe vesz minket.Vannak olyanok amiket kedvenceik közé emelünk évek után is betéve tudjuk mozzanatait főszereplőit vicces vagy épp sötét pillanatait.S vannak a kevesek amik nem csak egyszerűen játszunk ha nem beleolvadunk a világába minden egyes mozzanatát apró rejtett titkát keresve kutatjuk miközben észre sem vesszük az idő múlását.TLJ széria ezen kevesek közé tartozik a Dreamfall évről évre egyszer elő veszem ,hogy újra elutazhassal Arcadia és Stark az ikervilágok rejtekébe.Féltem tőle hogy az újra rész mint az megszokott mostanság elszakad attól keserédes gyönyörű történettől amiben eddig részem volt szerencsér Ragnar T. ismét tökéletest alkotott az Első köny nyitánya tartja művészien lenyűgöző színvonalat amiért a KickStarter kampány is csak hála érheti ,hogy ez műremek folytatódhatott.Maga történet fonalát nehéz felvenni a 3. rész elején rengeteg nehezen érthető és megválaszolatlan kérdéssel szembesül  majd a játékos de még így is könnyedén bele lehet merülni ebbe világba.Mind April Ryan s Zoe Castillo talán a legérdekesebb karakterek akikkel valaha találkoztam a játékokban. The Longest Journey és The Longest Journey: Dreamfall ajánlom mindenkinek aki szereti a mély fordulatokkal teli történetek a színes érdekes karaktereket. S nem riad vissza némi szellemi kihivástól sem.Csak a annyit tudnék mondeni a végére: Have a great journey! ^^ "

												Amazing follow up to The Longest Journey and The Longest Journey:Dreamfall! Lengthy game play with a multitude of different choices the player can make and changes these choices can make to the storyline. Lots of dialogue but it's well written and interesting to listen to as well as storyline related (no pointless rambling here). This game, like the previous two games in the series, has the same feel as a science fiction-fantasy novel. You've got a futuristic technology ruled dimension, a medieval sort of yee olen dimension, and a multitude of different species characters all mixed together in visually beautiful settings. If you liked the previous two games you will like Dreamfall Chapters. If you haven't played the first two games you can still follow the story of this one but you miss out on a lot of references/details in the story.			"

												I was waiting for this game since Dreamfall. Here's the deal... I cannot recommend this to just anybody. It's absolutely crucial, in my opinion, to play The Longest Journey and Dreamfall prior to this. Without the proper knowledge of previous events, this is going to make no sense. And what's more important, it's going to be waste of time if you don't KNOW and LOVE the characters. If there's one thing that this series does the best, it's the ""nostalgia feeling"" for characters and places. I just finished the last episode (book) and I cried my eyes out for half an hour. For characters and places and stories that don't even exist. It's that good.It has its problems however. Book 1 is a strong start and introduction to the ""after coma"" world, but I have to say book 2 and 3 didn't do much for me. It was book 4 (and chapter earlier when Crow appears) when I thought ""THIS is what I was waiting for"" and I felt satisfied till the very end.There are many sound bugs. The animations are as bad as 7 years ago. Some of the ""puzzles"" are just annoying (search for this and this), not actual puzzles. But it's still great game and if you have planty of time, please play the first 2 first and then get this for conclusion.			"

												Dreamfall: Chapters is the third instalment of The Longest Journey Franchise. First there was a point and click adventure called The Longest Journey staring a female protagonist called April Ryan. I cannot comment heavily on that game because it is the one I have not completed. From what I have heard it is considered one of the best adventure/point and click games of it's generation/all time with an outstanding story which I believe is the greatest asset about all three of these games. In 2006 Dreamfall: The Longest Journey was released and is one my personal favourite story driven games ever. I think Zoe Castillo the main female protagonist of both Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters is a great character and is personally my favourite female protagonist of all time. When I played and completed the game I felt very emotional about the story and the world and had so many questions due to the cliff hanger ending. I never had any idea that there would be follow up to it and was very excited when Dreamfall: Chapters was announced. Dreamfall: Chapters took an episodic approach which I'm personally not a great fan of, however that doesn't means anything now as the whole game is fully released. I was very excited during Book One trying to get answers to the questions left at the end of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. However by mid Book Two I really lost interest and was very disappointed and felt like it wasn't a good successor to the prequel. I left the game for a good six months, by which time all the Books had been released. I came back to it and started to become invested again in Book Three to Book Four. I personally felt that the ending was very good and satisfied my answers to the cliff hanger at the end of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey that was my primary reason for being so invested in Dreamfall: Chapters. As a game I personally don't think Dreamfall: Chapters gameplay is great. This game is a puzzle/adventure game but I personally thought it was a mediocre experience at best in this area. All combat has been removed from Dreamfall: Chapters, not that this is a really bad thing as it was a very basic system in Dreamfall: The Longest JourneySubjectively this series story I feel is as good as The Last Of Us, I'm sure a lot of people may disagree but that's a personal belief. The reason I say this is because not many games have made me feel as emotional at the end of the game like these two series have.Gameplay 6/10Story 10/10I recommend this game and also this is not just a recommendation for Dreamfall: Chapters I recommend playing Dreamfall: The Longest Journey as well before this and maybe the first game in the series The Longest Journey before that to give you a better understanding of the world and the characters than I believe the recap available does.Update: Just updating this review as I nominated it for The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award as part of the Autumn 2016 Steam sale and one of the tasks is to update a review for a nomination to receive the badge.

												It’s a weird feeling to finally get closure on a story that I have known for almost two decades. I can barely remember the first game and the second game is fuzzy at best.  Even with that in mind, it felt good to return to a universe that I forgot how much I cared about. Though I questioned the implementation of letting us choose the actions of characters who already had clear and dictated personalities I can say I recommend this game. I have no idea how someone who didn’t play the first two would like this one, but speaking as someone who loved those games I can heartily recommend this one.			"

												I'm taking all parts (5) in consideration while writing this (poopy review).As I finished the last part I definitely realized I did not understand everything and I absolutely should of played the previous games first... but it was not so bad I couldn't keep up or enjoy it - I still got to know the characters even without understanding where they all come from as much were explained if you just took the time to literally click and ask around. But if you have the chance to play the previous games before this one, do it.I actually don't have much to say... this was simply one of the best games I have ever played when it comes to the story and genre so if you're familiar with games where a big part is puzzles and simply watching dialogue (and picking choices) then this is for you.I'll end this with a few simple negative/positives.Positives:Amazing graphics (the details!)Excellent voice actingCaptivating story (last part did fell a bit flat but overall it was good)Choices really mattered (Telltale should take notes)Challenging puzzlesNegatives:Not enough hints where to go - you'd get stuck TOO much like a task you're supposed to do could be across town and all you'd get as a hint is ""go see this person"" A little challenge is always good but I'm just saying it was literally way too easy to get stuck and when you get frustrated you lose the mood while running around for an hourSame as above with some puzzlesCutscene animations were very awkward at timesA very heavy game like even my good comp heated up really bad but I guess those good graphics require itAnd for last there's a few things that bummed me out: if you don't kiss a girl you're automatically gay? And she still forcebly kisses you. Many questions were left unanswered (for me it was faith of Enu who was wounded but it was never told if she survived or died) and why is it that all women has to end up pregnant?? Ugh.			"

												I'll try and keep this updated as the new Books are released, but no promises.If you played both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, you're in for a treat! Book One is only about 4 hours long, but it provides a nice intro to the game world and provides a refresher video on the story so far on the initial run of the game. There's even some closure in the opening cutscene of April Ryan's fate from the end of Dreamfall, but I'm sure she'll turn up at some point or another later on.The gameplay is the same as in the original Dreamfall, minus the horrendous stealth and combat: you explore the world in third-person perspective and interact with objects and NPCs to complete puzzles, which are fairly easy but I'm sure there will be more difficult ones as new Books are released. The internal monologues that accompany the choices in the game don't adhere to a strict moral alignment, but that allows you to pick the best response to fit the current situation. At certain points you have to make a major choice that will affect the outcome of the story in later Books; the first of these is made just before Zoe leaves the Storytime and the result is seen shortly afterwards, but any larger repercussions of this choice have yet to be made manifest.The voice acting is superb and so is the dialogue. The facial expressions are a little stiff, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience at all. The music is, as expected, just a delight to listen to and is one of the sole reasons why you should get the Special Edition. The artwork is amazing, don't get me wrong, but I could listen to the soundtrack non-stop and never get bored of it.The city of Propast in Europolis, where most of the gameplay in Book One takes place, is absolutely stunning. Most of the performance issues mentioned in other reviews are due to this area, but the issues have been largely resolved with a recent patch by the developers. If you love you some dystopian science fiction, cyberpunk and George Orwell, then this city has all you could ever need. I can't wait to see what they've done with Marcuria over in Arcadia!If you're a fan of the original two games, then get this game now!10/10			"

												Christmas -99, I unwrap my very own copy of The Longest Journey. Ever since, it's played as a template for my version of the perfect adventure game. Good voice actors, compelling story, challanging puzzles, you can't die. Many years later, Dreamfall is finally released and the disapointment was overwhealming. Terrible gameplay, good story though. Believe me when I say that I had high restrictions when this game hit the market cos I was sure it was going to be another failure. Go figure - I absolutely love it! Yes, the ""puzzles"" are pathetic and shouldn't even be CALLED puzzles, but the story! I feel dreed before every conversational choice, every story changing decision.. I'm seriouly considering installing this game on another computer, ONLY to see where different choices would lead me - and I only just finished the second book! Damn if I will have to wait another 5-something months for the next part! I want it now!			"

												I would only recommend the game for those seeking closure to the story.  The stroy is complete but the game is unfinished.  This is manifested in its performance.  FPS dips down to 20 in cities on a GTX 1070, not even on max settings.  The developers have addressed this with ""update your graphics drivers,"" stating that the game is graphically intensive.  This is simply not the reason for its porr performance when other, more graphic-intensive games run fine.  There are other minor examples of an unpolished game but none more egregious than the poor framerate.The game is not like its predecessors.  There are times when it is quite boring and an asbolute slog.  The puzzles are not that challenging.Aside from these things the characters are entertaining and the story is...ok.  It's just a disappointing way for such a great series to end.			"

												My Review after chapter Two:I must say I REALLY enjoy the game and the story so far. I enjoy it so much that I consider playing it again just to find out the other options I have not chosen yet. I understand why some people dislike the ""telltale"" type of this game as well as the aimless wandering, which at times, is absolutely dreadful. If you are stuck and you simply have no way to tell where you need to go next or what to do next it can become painful.But the story itself is both, absolutely fascinating as well as scary. Considering how far we have come today with virtual reality, this game gives you a slight climpse of the ""bad facors"" of such devices. I do not want to spoil anything, but anyone who knows a bit about Zoe, knows what the Dream Machines are about.Now, for those who do not know the story at all, there is a trailer in the game that you can watch at the beginning, It will tell you in short the story of the past and lead you to the current happenings.In short:+ Deep Story+ Deep Character Backgrounds+ Quite a few good laughs and chuckles+ Cleverly written in some parts and hideously translated (german) in other parts. (Ich sag nur 'Babo')+ Stunning Graphics and lights + THE GUITARRIST! - Alot of rather slow running around aimlessly- Stiff Character faces which take away ALOT of the emotions being transported- Character Animations are often very chunky- Surroundings sometimes too much and too noisy			"

												As a fan of Dreamfall Chapters' two predecessors (particularly The Longest Journey), Dreamfall Chapters was a major disappointment. This is one of only two games I backed on Kickstarter, as I was excited that we would finally get to see the conclusion to Dreamfall, but that excitement didn't last long once I got going.The game starts off alright, but the longer it goes on, the more convoluted and ridiculous the story becomes. I won't go into spoilers, but once you get into the middle of Book 3 or so, character motivations feel so superficial and there is way too much technobabble explanation of what's happening. I had a few WTF moments during the story, where I shouted at the screen ""Seriously? THIS is where you're going with this story?""The Longest Journey, despite some flaws (particularly some obscure puzzle solutions) had a coherent, and relatively simple story. It was filled with likeable characters and there was always a sense of mystery and wonder that made you want to push forward. Dreamfall, while not quite as strong, was very similar. But all of that felt completely absent in Dreamfall Chapters.Gameplay is another sore point, in that there are barely any puzzles. This shouldn't be too unfamiliar to people who have played Dreamfall, as that game was sorely lacking in the puzzle department too, with the latter part of the game in particular amounting to you walking from one place to another to trigger another cutscene. That wasn't improved in Dreamfall Chapters, and though the horrible combat is gone, the gameplay feels even worse. Puzzles are mostly very simple, with a few amounting to nothing more than ""pixel hunts"" looking for that one thing you can actually interact with.One thing that Dreamfall Chapters emphasizes is player choice, and boy does it emphasize it. Everytime a major choice happens, the game pauses and asks you to choose from two or three options. A few of these are time limited, but most let you take your time. Once you make your choice, you get a huge ""The Balance has Shifted"" message on the screen with a large noise. On a few occasions this large message and noise actually distracted from what was happening and even drowned out dialogue. But it gets worse. When the consequences of your actions play out, the game ""shouts"" at you with  another giant message saying ""LOOK! HERE ARE THE CONSEQUENCES!!!!!!"" Are players not intelligent enough to figure this out on their own? Voice acting is uneven, with some great performances, and some lousy ones. The most shocking of these was getting an actual child to do the voice of the toddler Saga. There's a reason video games, television shows and movies typically get adult women to play children, and this is a perfect example.Visually, the game is pretty nice, particularly for an adventure game, but suffers from some optimization issues. There is also occasionally a strange doubling effect on screen with a very faint version of the scene rotated 180 degrees and overylayed on top.The game is long (over 20 hours), which is good if you're enjoying the game, but for me it was a chore. I finished it because I couldn't just give up and not see how the story ends, but if this were any other game, I probably would have stopped playing half way through.The one thing this game succeeded at doing, was make me nostalgic for The Longest Journey. I was constantly remembering how much better it was and now I have an urge to go back and revisit it.			"

												Longest Journey was fun, despite the rushed latter half of the game. Loved the dialogue and the characters.Dreamfall though, I loved, and was really looking forward to this game coming out to finally see how the story ends...Long story short, disappointing, in so many ways. Chapter 1 is pretty good, but the more you play after that the more it feels rushed, half-a$$ed, even the graphics despite how good they look sometimes have so many rough edges (some of the animations, or lackthereof, are down right lazy - anyone who has played KOTOR or KOTOR 2 will feel deja-vu). Dreamfall's and even Longest Journey's story felt dark and real and down to earth, this game by comparison feels like it was written by a bunch of teenagers, and don't even get me started on the voice acting (Zoe Enu and Kian were great though). Just seems like they wanted to rush through and finish this one just to get it over with so they could move on to their other projects and it is a shame. Played through it once to see the ending then uninstalled. Whole time felt like a stream of lame events and missed opportunities, with the occasional fun or interesting thing that keeps you going until you find yourself unimpressed again.6/10, an extra 1 point because I loved Dreamfall so much and because of Enu. I wish there had been a lot more Enu. Would not reccomend unless it's on sale.			"

												Very promising, and too short! I loved The Longest Journey, but Dreamfall couldn't quite keep my attention and I never finished it. This first part of DF Chapters seems a good start, but it was over too quickly, especially as a lot of time was spent just running around from place to place. Felt like a demo, really. If all chapters are as short as this, I'll be a bit disappointed. Also, it's maybe a bit too easy, like many adventures nowadays. I'd love to see more ""combine items in ingenious ways to achieve something great"" type of action - let's not forget the lovely floating ducky :).			"

												Recommended for anyone who enjoyed The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  This game is divided into multiple books (episodes), none of which reset the chapter counter.  I was confused by this at first.  It makes more sense to think of the game as a volume of books with continuing chapters (book 1 is chapters 1-3, book 2 is chapters 3-5, that kind of thing).With that said, give it until at least book 3 (chapter 6-7).  I wish books 1-2 were a bit more palatable.  The foul language and tense personal relationships just ground a bit on me because, in a game full of decisions, I had little control over them except at a high level.  Oh well.  I got past it.  Chapter 3 is where it took off.  Some of the early decisions can have big ramifications, but the thing is, you can only guess at their ramifications.  There is no combat.  The tension that combat might usually serve is replaced by decisions that you can only make once (unless you reload prior to the decision and do it again).The music is setting appropriate, the scripting is clever (Enu is great, as is the best bird in gaming, Crow) and taps into events in previous Longest Journey games, the voice acting is clear and fleshes out the characters (again, props to Enu and Crow), and despite a bug now and then (as of this writing, 3-20-2016), I would recommend this game.  21 hours in and I'm through book 4 and waiting for book 5!  If I was faster at some of the puzzles, a playthrough would have been a couple hours shorter.			"

												I'll say this right now. If you haven't played the previous two games The Longest Journey or Dreamfall please go out and play them, even if you only play Dreamfall. This game references them heavily, requiring the player to have some prerequisite knowledge in order to put events in the game into context. Thankfully it doesn't sacrifice the pace of the story in lieu of accessibility.It's a recurring theme actually. In a choice between story and something else, this game chooses the former. Every single time. You'll need to set your own expectations, if you come into this expecting something akin to a fantastic interactive story with some extremely well realised characters, you will not be disappointed. If you're the type of person that gets bored with dialogue and skips cutscenes to carry on playing then refrain from purchasing it. Like Myst, Gone Home, and The Walking Dead, this is an experience that requires you to take a back seat, and just enjoy the narrative presented. After seeing a presentation from Red Thread a year or two back, I was worried that the new choice system would be a cliched binary ""save the puppy"" or ""eat the puppy alive"" moral dichotomy, and that it would compromise the main characters' intended personalities. Thankfully that isn't the case. Choices never fall outside their conceivable paths of action, but there are clear distinctions between them. Neither do a lot of them centre on a moral choice, instead them being a personal one.Art direction is as fantastic as ever, and they really manage to drive home the wider state of the world, particularly in Europolis. Last time around it was Arcadia that blew me away so it's a nice change. There are some flaws in execution, such as weirdly skinned characers, art assets that can be a little rough, and some minor shader issues. But if you a consider it a tradeoff to prevent a situation as in Dragon Age 2 where areas and assets were just constantly re-used I'd happily take it.  I do have issues with framerate in some parts, but since I haven't updated my drivers in ever I'll refrain from making a judgement on it just yet.tl;dr: If you played and like the previous two, it offers everything they did and more. You won't be disappointed with it. If you're new to the franchise purchase and play the previous one first, if not both. If you like them buy this one. If you hate games with cutscenes and dialogue, only wanting to get to the next level, then stay away like the plague.			"

Yes, its different again from Dreamfall, with a little less gameplay, but, there are good puzzles in it and quite a lot of character development and story. The graphics are superb, a step up from Dreamfall. I think this game is a must have for The Longest Journey fans (and also adventure gamers). 9/10.			"

												Scaled To Book 4 Review.I fell in love with the longest journey when i first played it many years ago. I was hooked into the colorful characters, the rich storyline, the beautiful art (yes even years later it still looks good). Then i played dreamfall, which wasn't received as well as the original but still brought me back to the world which had captured my imagination. of course ending on a cliffhanger, we were promised a episodic sequel. Then it was all just rumors in the wind, looking for any glimmer we would see the sequel happen. it's hard to be unbiased about this game having such a love for it, from a fans perspective, it does stumble quote often. since the update to the Unity 5 engine, the performance issues have been resolved and the game looks graphics were turned up to 11, also in this day and age we should have support for ultrawide resolutions. overall i enjoyed this game and have easily gotten my bang for the buck entertainment. book 4....wow....i can't begin to say how hard the hammer was dropped in this one. it's finally coming to an end. 16 years. i've waited a long time to see this end. to reach the end of the longest journey is kind of a joke. but truly is my favorite game series of all time. hopefully the last book will meet our expectations and i can finally see the end to this amazing story.

												The game is a love letter to fans and picks up right where Dreamfall left off 8 years ago. An indie creation yet its world building, art, characters and dialogue are easily the equal of the classic longest journey. Decisions you make will change not only this story but those in future chapters too so there is a lot of replayability here. It's the kind of game that publishers are afriad to make because it would fail focus tests. Brilliant female protagonist, no fighting system or pointless grinding to try and pad it out, a focus on exploration/discovery and it doesn't hold your hand. Wonderful.			"

												I really enjoyed this game and such a refreshing change from the blood and gore and violence of so many games today. This is a game I can share with my kids. We have played all the previous Dreamfall games and have been waiting impatiently for this one. What I like about it: the atmosphere of Propast is extremely well done and it was fascinating to just explore. I like that you can make choices that affect the way the game unfolds although it is not clear in what way it affects the game as yet. Kudos to the developers for doing some radical things including role-playing Saga, a toddler! It was so cute to listen to her babbling and giggling as I explored the house and tried to dodge Dad to get to the shiny sparkly thing!  The characters are not stereotypes, there is no gratuitous cleavage, what a change that is!  What I don't like about it: there is not much to get one's teeth into yet but hopefully that will come. Also the people of Propast: no kids (except one), very few old people, no fat people, body types are the same (i.e. ""ideal"") (great that there is a lot of ethnic diversity though). But the main problem for me is that I have to wait for the next chapter!!!!!			"

												Being such a big fan of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall I was looking forward to this new episodic series, and I must say I'm not disappointed at all with the first episode, Reborn. Yes, its different again from Dreamfall, with a little less gameplay, but, there are good puzzles in it and quite a lot of character development and story. The graphics are superb, a step up from Dreamfall. I think this game is a must have for The Longest Journey fans (and also adventure gamers). 9/10.			"

												Since the game is not complete, just pointing out this is a review regarding Book 1 of Dreamfall Chapters.I believe it's safe to say that this game should be exactly what a Dreamfall fan could hope for. There's been so much hard work and dedication put into the making of it, I fail to see any cons. I put my faith completely blind in it and even though I am always sceptical in such situations I finished the game being absolutely mesmerized and hungry for more! It's a sequel with nothing ruined (that's a big deal these days...) : the characters, the plot, the choices, all live up to their past. There's also a thorough briefing for those new to the series and a cool new feature where you can (not necessarily) see what decisions other people made before you make up your mind. I finished the game twice and am still going for more playthroughs to make sure I have covered everything it has to offer.TL;DR: Awesome graphics, engaging plot, decision making, easy controls but lacking in character animating and... a bit short. 9/10P.S. The trailers aren't impressive. But a great game on the inside doesn't need a fancy ribbon. "

												Fantastic game and very active developers! RedThreadGames goes way and beyond to be there for the community, answering questions and frequently update on the progress of the chapters. It's a big leap to do the sequel to the game Dreamfall - The Longest Journey, as well as The Longest Journey. There has been many opinions about how the story is throught trough or not, if you tie ends together with the games before. I'm one of those who thinks it's a good way to continue the story from previous games and I feel like they keep the mystic feeling about that something is amiss while at the same time moving forward to an answer. Some choices seem very easy in the beginning but this game constantly reminds you to expect the unexptected. The more you play, the more you try to get the puzzle together about what is happening. I think I did about 5 play throughs for the currently released chapters (3) and each time I got to experience something new. There are main choices that put you in an certain direction and the smaller choices in dialogues and situations shape who you are and how others perceive you.  I think the game is stunningly beautiful. especially the clothing of the main characters and how they move and talk. You are there, in the world, not just watching it from your computer monitor. When a game makes you feel that, it's a game worth playing :) "

												if you like adventure games, this is a must have, however if this is the first time you hear about it, go play at least the previous one first. You will be disappointed with this if you don't. The game makes little sense on its own without it, you will feel majorly lost and won't understand why everyone likes this game.Many people complain about performance issues, but I haven't had a single problem all game, and I am playing on maximum (granted I have an i7, 12g ram, and an r9 290). Thing is, this game was built with Unity3D, this is a general purpose engine that can produce very nice visuals, but since it is so versatile it cannot be optimized for everything, so there's a trade-off. Indie devs can benefit of the engine, making any kind of game they want, even cross platform, but that comes with performance overhead... you just have to live with it.The only thing I can fault in this game is the length, I know this is only the first 2 chapter / book one at this point but it only just takes off the ground storywise when it ends after little over 4 hours of gameplay, so now I have to wait for the next one...

												Since 2006, I have waited. I waited so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long. It's finally here, FINALLY, and I can say it completely goes beyond the standards of the others. For people new to the franchise and long time fans, you can jump straight in and completely understand what's been going on (although I would definitely recommend playing at least Dreamfall: The Longest Journey/refreshing your mind on the events to get the full experience). Red Thread have tried to do something new with the mechanics, making them like The Walking Dead with the decisions etc, and when you come across one of the decisions you can click the logo in the middle to see what other players have chosen - Which I thought was pretty damn cool.Visuals are a huge part of this game, and they're ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. If you want something to go by then take a look at my screenshots on my profile here and you'll see. The way Storytime looks like the polar ice caps with the auroras is awesome, and the new cities are jaw dropping.It has left incredible first impressions, more than I could have ever expected. As for now, this has a 9/10 and is my personal GOTY, I can't contain my excitment fot the next parts to come out!			"

												Continues from the great adventure game that is Dreamfall.  Hard to tell from this first part if it will live up to the high expectations.  As usual, great music.  Graphics are pretty but not always run smoothly. Not much gameplay though.  Don't bother if you haven't played Dreamfall (or didn't like it).Edit: with Book Two (minor spoilers for Book One)Where Book One feels like the introduction or opening chapter in a book where the scene is set, Book Two develops the story much further.  You are still playing Kian, the ex-warrior/'apostle' who's now working for the rebels in the parallel fantasy world 'Arcadia'; as well as Zoe who is trying to rebuild her post-amnesia life in 'our' future world 'Stark', but keeps getting drawn into intrigues and conspiracies.  The patches have improved the performances.  Like Book One, choices play a big part and the game sort of hits you over your head with 'Your Choices Will have CONSEQUENCES', repeatedly (not that it's necessarily a bad thing though).  NPCs are all well-rounded characters and believable.  Voice acting and music remains fantastic.  Some of the puzzles are not intuitive, but not nearly as difficult as 'old-school' adventure games like this game's predecessors 'The Longest Journey' or 'Dreamfall'.			"

												The game is honestly one of the best choice matters games out there. The characters are so good, they are what makes the game worth it. Very diverse, and so much character development!The main characters, Zoe and Kian, are both people of color, and Kian is super gay too.Graphics of the game is 10/10. A lot better than The Longest Journey. Scenery is honestly the biggest part of it.Although, be warned, if you are looking for something to kill, this is probably not the game for you. It has little to no action, but it doesn't meant to have. It's meant to be very story rich and grabs you in. It's almost like watching a movie, only you tell the characters what to do. Honestly, I've been hooked! Worth the buy, worth the try! "

												I've not played very far into the story but so far I like what I see. The story pretty much carries on from Dreamfall The Longest Journey, also has a story so far if you need a refresher. The gameplay is slightly different, once you get use to it, it works quite well. The graphics are amazing, I'm looking forward to where the story goes, just hope it isn't ruined by being split into episodes, which is becoming popular with many games these days.All in all a good game so far, you like adventures and puzzles then this is for you.

												I really want to like this game, but I don't, I can't and I won't.I'll make it quick: FPS is all over the place bugs are not uncommon the game actively tries to waste your time in a revolutionary 90s adventure games style: find something relevant to interact with in a vast area of nothingness to advance the plot the plot is a Well of Vagueness, mixed with a mishmash of cultures, mixed with delusions of a person suffering from a messiah complex. Writting is stilted and immature, characters` motivations vary from highly questionable to non-existent, humor is... just whatever. voice acting is a mixed bag the game beats you over the head with decisions you've made. I get it, I see that mountain and I can go there. Now, ♥♥♥♥ off. And, oh, at some point, in order to advance the story you are forced to catch and horrifically murder a rat to distract a few guards. I can choose between sausages and cheese soup for the protagonist's boyfriend launch, but I can't choose not to shred a rat to a billion pieces? Okay, lovely, whatever.♥♥♥♥ this, I'm out.			"

												Dreamfall is THE game of the year in my opinion. The script is well written, the visuals are effective and pretty, and the music is simply as amazing as I thought it would be. Simon Poole, the composer, does a great job with the score and it plays along effectivly with the visuals. In addition, Egil Olsen, a singer/ songwriter from Norway, is featured in the streets of Propast. In other words, Red Thread Games really pays attention to details.I would say that this is one of the more successful Kickstarter games, maybe even one of the best projects in a while. The team delivers regardless of the delays they have had, inter alia the upgrade to the newer Unity 5 engine. There is a lack of story based games that actually focus on the story rather than the fighting to create suspense and action. That is until Dreamfall Chapters came out.  10/10 /Lifecomplete			"

												Dreamfall Series are epic and I was realy happy that they are doing after all the years a new game, I play a lot of point and click games, but the old once are the best one. Dreamfall Chapters found his way back but I`m a bit disapointed. I was not sure if I like to give this game a good or a bad review, I also know its only Book One but this game feels like they did a full game and cuttet it into Chapters, just to have more time to finish the game, a lot of dialogues are missing, also they didnt translated all into german or french, some parts are still only english. Rate: 6.5 of 10 for Book OnePro:- very nice soundtrack- good graphic and after bug fixes and performance fix games run good- Book One is 3-8 hourse, depending on how fast or slow you play- good story- some stories are funny like the last on Book one- City is not empty- funny dialogues in the city (seller in chinatown)- your choise is important Contra:- missing content, some dialogues are not spoken- after complete last chapter on book one blackscreen, if you press a button you start with your last save point- Book one is too short (or betther the mini stories are too short, 1 minute of gameplay on the last story is ....)- Book one is too easy - compare too the old dreamfall titels, game map is realy small			"

												I've waited a very long time to be able to write this review, and I was not let down. I was initially a little disappointed to learn that the original voice actors wouldn't be returning, but after the initial dislike of change wore off, I do like the replacements they've found.  I also had a bit of an issue getting the game to run initially - I have an older computer that generally has little to no issue, but it was extremely laggy even on the lowest setting. Once I switched to a newer laptop however, the issue was largely fixed, minus a bit of lag in certain areas, Europolis in particular.I'm in love with the story so far, as well as the answers we've gotten so far for some of the loose threads left over from the previous games. I can't wait to see how it's all going to play out in the end.			"

												My wife and I are big fans of the series, we are kickstarter backers of Dreamfall Chapters and we've been eagerly awaiting the release. It was a real let down to actually play it. Here's why: lots of choices presented with big letters saying ""your choice matters!"" but options to choose from that are either almost identical or equally unsavory. So I have to decide whether to pause to kill the wounded guy who helped me or let him be tortured by the guards coming soon... really? The other really annoying thing is the completely unnecessary foul language. Beware: F-bombs galore in this game and plenty of others. It's totally gratuitous. I can only remember one really foul mouth in the previous 2 games (a guy named 'flipper'.) My wife said she doesn't want to play anymore, and I've got plenty of other games I could be playing. This game is a disappointing end to a great series.			"

												Sad to see this game coming to an end,I grew up playing all of them.Lookswise the game is really pretty.I mostly enjoyed playing as Zoe in Europolis compared to being in Arcadia because I tend to like the futuristic-type of style.One thing I did notice is that the choices you make don't make that much of a difference and I think so far from what I've heard everyone gets the same ending.I was expecting some dramatic consuquences/changes from the decisions I made.It's still a fun game though and it made me laugh-especially Crow aka best sidekick ever.If you enjoy these type of games or point n click games like the first TLJ,then I reccommend playing Siberia 1 and 2;that series is one of the most amazing I've ever seen.

												As I was just entering my first year in College, and working my first job as a barista; I began to develop a deep sense of searching. Searching for deeper meaning, and adventure. During this transition I found Dreamfall The Longest Journey, and fell in love with everything, the music, the imagery, the story, it all captivated me and even felt like a symbolic dialogue to my life's journey. I can't express enough how life changing this game was. Naturally, I became a supporter of Dreamfall Chapters. I was so passionate about this series, that I dropped $135 of support through Kickstarter, during a very challenging time in my life. I had left my dead end job, was in my second year of marriage, just had a baby girl named Faith, and was buried in debt. I literally maxed my last credit card out on this Kickstarter campaign. Now, this may sound foolish to many: it even sounds foolish to me. However, this was about more than getting an amazing game or buying groceries next week. This was about changing the entertainment industry. This was about encouraging the creation of beautiful art, and deep ideas for the mainstream. I always felt there was a vast void of quality games (or quality anything). Quality games seek to be story tellers, they seek to be teachers, they seek to inspire a person to pursue their created destiny. When you leave a Dreamfall experience, you come out on the other end changed. So to me, this was joining a movement, and taking a leap of faith that there is something better ahead.I can gladly say my story has ended well. I was able to pay for my groceries that week and ended up on a new career course that has taken me to new fantastic heights. So here I am a little more than 3 years later, in a beautiful home on an acre of land in one of the wealthiest cities in my state, and a second daughter named Hope. Now, to play this masterpiece all the way through.Thank you, Red Thread ""For not underestimating your audience""			"

												It took me a while to get around to review this one, and that gave me time to process and truly realize that this wonderful journey had come to an end.And while I have a bit of hard feelings towards Chapters, and some things that I wish were done differently, it is an honorable closure to this long awaited finale of The Longest Journey saga. That's going to be a LONG review, so here's a short summary:+Long awaited continuation of the long-running saga+Story is usually well crafted and of high quality, as one would expect+Good voice acting+Good world, atmosphere, graphics, old locations revisited and new ones are wonderfully presented+Good soundtrack+You're choices affect some of the storyline, for those who love this sort of things+Powerful conclusion+/- Game might not really fit to players which are not fans of the series and haven't played the now very old previous installments of the saga (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall)+/- Music is a bit recycled throughout the game+/- A good conclusion to Dreamfall, and to the entire saga, but not a very good one to its own story- Story, although good, feels half-baked at times, and doesn't get to the peaks and leveld of depth that TLJ and DF managed to get to.- Supporting characters are simply not as good or as significant as in the past- Your choices affect some stuff, but in the end 'story is already written and can't change itThe Good:We get the thing that we came for, STORY, which is a main strong point of the three installments in the series, it what kept us going through the game and kept us waiting all those long years. Dreamfall Chapters, along 5 ""books"", gives you a high-quality, well crafted story, especially in terms of video games nowadays. The game is clearly highly story-driven and the developers made sure that it's the emphasised part of the game and nothing would keep your attention away from it for too long.And luckily you can enjoy most of the time, as the dialogues and general progression of the story are well written, full of good intentions and presentd via great cast of voice acting, and wide variation of all sorts of interesting and colorful characters.RTG also introduced to the saga an aspect which was only gently touched in previous installments, the now very trendy choices and consequences concept. You'll have to make plenty of choices throughout (some) of the game which will affect (some of) the storyline. Some of the choices would be tough, and some would have some very interesting and fatal consequences, which would make you ask yourself whether you made the 'right' choice.The universe of The Longest Journey, revolving a futuristic version of our world - Strak - and a magical land - Arcadia - are both presented wonderfully and beautifully, full of imagination and thought, as both new locations are created to explore and old ones are recreated as lively as the Unity Engine would allow. The graphics and the environment of Chapters filled me with anticipation and desire to explore the new places present in the game and to discover all over again the re-imagined locations we've already been in on previous installments.The soundtrack that accompanied the game had taken a different direction than the previous two and gave an interesting take on the game, while it had some weaker and stronger parts, I really enjoyed the soundtrack of books 1 and 5 - the very first and very last of the books - and felt they portrayed well and fit the story and atmosphere of Dreamfall Chapteres.The Bad:Unfortunately I felt that Chapters didn't manage so much to get to the peaks that its two predecessors got to. As much as I enjoyed the game, it had its downsides, some carried over from TLJ and DF, some new.The story -  which is good, as I mentioned - Just feels at times half-baked. It is sometimes filled with strange cheesy lines and some awkward and tasteless references to sex which I didn't really get how they fit into the game and what was their contribuition (see ""shine like the crazy dimoand you are"" and\or random Marcurians having random intercourses on the streers at Reapmoon's eve).The supporting characters, which in previous installments were quiet significant and felt like a major part of the whole story, felt a bit shallow in Chapters, and even the likeable and well-made characters felt like they didn't matter much, usually didn't have that heart-touching involvement in the story or with the player, and it really just felt to me that they're all just passers beside the only two characters that mattered throughout the story, Kian and Zoe.The developers also decided to stay with their old attitude and creating a ""game"" with minimal gameplay. Many fans stated that the gameplay in DF was just too easy, and while there were some good puzzles and Chapters, there aren't too many of them, or too many at all. The ones there are, are usually rather easy. And as the game progresses, Chapters becomes more and more of a walking simulator rather than an actual game, as you'll walk your chatacter from cutscene to cutscene, perhaps making one tiny dialogue choice - sometimes - and that's it. Which brings me to the downfall of choices&consequences in Chapters, which is actually a strange concept to introduce to a story which would suddenly change its attitude from ""the choices we make change everything"" to ""the story is already written and we can't change it"", and indeed, this concept seems to work nicely up to the middle of the game, and later on you'll feel that the story gets more and more linear and your earlier choices matter less and less. Which is a bit disappointing.The music of the game was good, another thing I already mentioned, but as someone who gives a lot of attention to this aspect, I did notice that the soundtrack wasn't much varied, and you could here most of it in the first and last part of Chapters. Throughout the rest of the game, it was usually a recycling of the soundtrack from book one. And that was disappointing as well.The Ugly:I don't really have much complaints towards RTG, the developers, because it's hard to blame a new and small company, but it's hard to ignore that we've waited all those long years after the release of Dreamfall to get to this product which kept us waiting some more, as those 5 chapters spread all the way through October 2014 to June 2016, about 1 year and a half, which is pretty long for a single episodic game. Chapters was also (and is still a bit) full of bugs and technical problems, being barely playable at some high-end systems, and I do give a lot of respect for Red Thread Games for working so hard on quick and efficient patches for the game and a true and honest will to make the best job in making this game work technically. It still feels a bit annoying to get a product which simply won't work well.Another strange point is, that Chapters, instead of really continuing the story of Dreamfall, actually begins a new one - without really noticing, I believe - and throughout the first 4 ""books"" of Chapters, I felt that I actually have more questions than answers in my hand. Eventually, in Book 5, we get most of the answers and the closure we wanted so much to DREAMFALL, the previous game. And it's good, and it's moving, and it's powerful. It's just that after a while I realized that everything that came before this conclusion, felt like ""filler"", felt like a whole new story, and that THIS very story doesn't really get an actual closure, it opens up new questions and many talks about future wars and struggles, without much explanation.Luckily, the very end of the game, is truly an interesting and powerful closure the this saga, that truly shows that sometimes the beginning and the end are one and the same.So, even though I have some complaints to Chapters, it's already done, and I enjoyed it, accept it and recommend it as it is, for every fan of TLJ series.

The only downfall, puzzles are a bit mediocre and easy but the point of this game is to tell story, and it does it well.Play this game for the story, wether you have played the previous games or not.

												Heyyo, so having played the second game in the series Dreamfall long ago and remembering how much fun it was? This game was definitely good as well.. I don't know if I'll quite remember it as fondly as Dreamfall but tbh Dreamfall Chapters was good... there was a few parts where the game kind of grinded to a halt or felt a little slow but I guess it's hard to always have a good pace to it so I'm not really faulting this game too much for that since it works good overall.I'll say this about Dreamfall Chapters for the TL/DR... the story might not always be exciting, but the game's ending left me feeling fullfilled and I definitely look forward to whatever comes next from Red Thread Games. I know a few people who say ""this game is nowhere near as good as Dreamfall"" but part of that is the nostalgia... It's not easy following up such an amazing game, but the storytelling in Dreamfall Chapters was still darn good and feels like a worthy game for this trilogy.Red Thread Games have also been pretty good for continuously patching the game as well and even upgrading from Unity Engine 4 to 5 which is also quite respectful for those who have bought the game and wished it ran a little better. My i7-3770K @ 4.4GHz and MSI R9 390 Gaming 8G @ 1120MHz core and 1600MHz memory got me 60fps most of the time except for some areas where the framerate tanked hard (my guess is it might be more on memory leaks with the map or particle effects tbh) but since it's not a hardcore fps or such I didn't feel the drops in framerates detracted from my enjoyment... of course, everyone experiences framerates differently so I wouldn't blame you if you didn't feel the same way. I've played through games like Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate with my PC set at a 30fps lock so I could crank my graphical quality a little higher and get a better looking game out of it... same idea, if it's not a shooter? I'm not too worried about framerate where I notice that framerate affects my aiming.As for the graphics themselves? They're pretty decent. The character models have pretty good detail and the world has lots of little intricacies but the post processing effects are quite impressive. I'd highly recommend if you can't maintain 60fps to even turn it down to 30fps just so you can crank up the post processing as it'll add a lot more immersion to the game.The voiceovers is where this game shines. Lots of high quality voice acting that gave the characters quite a lot of personality (Enu and Crow being my two favorites) that really made this game's story so damn good! I would defintiely say that a good voiceover cast and character design are extremely important in storytelling so I'm definitely glad that RTG nailed it on Dreamfall Chapters. Prime example of characters and voiceovers making a game? Deadly Premonition. Luckily with Dreamfall Chapters? The gameplay works well alongside the voiceovers and characters. ;)The music was ok, nothing that really stood out but it worked well with the game.The choice making? There was a decent amount of that and it did affect parts of the storyline which is cool and I definitely feel down the line once my wife gets the a-ok to come to Canada that I'll play through it with her and we'll make better choices than I did since I tried to pick terrible choices on purpose to see what a less happy ending would be like heh. :PSo yeah, I'd recommend Dreamfall Chapters for those who like adventure games and mainly those who want more closure to Dreamfall since the ending does bring the trilogy together quite nicely.As for value? I have 32 hours on record as of this review and I paid $16.49 CAD for it during a sale I think... so that works out to about $1.94 per hour... so I definitely felt I got my money's worth. :D			"

												With the release of Book 5 comes the close of a 17 year journey that started in 1999 with a very confused girl by the name of April Ryan. Dreamfall Chapters was a bittersweet, but satisfying end to that story. A great narrative, memorable characters, and a wonderful universe. If this game has caught your eye, do yourself a favor, and play The Longest Journey along with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.			"

												An often frustrating and brilliant story experience that lacks the polish to go down as a favourite.Pros:- The story is genuinely intruiging and mature- Characters are interesting and believable- The choice system is generally good.  Some choices, not all, have consequences- The sense of atmosphere and immersion in Propast is a triumph of game design- Humour is sprinkled across the dialogue and it is genuinely good- Not a requirement for success by any means, but the graphics are pretty decentCons:- Music is far too simplistic, forgettable, used incorrectly or not at all in places - this is surprising considering music is such an integral part of an atmospheric and story driven experience- Puzzles can be incredibly frustrating when the solutions are far-fetched, illogical, not presented clearly enough or purposefully hidden in order to draw out the experience.  Have fun alt-tabbing to all those guides!- Dialogue is hit and miss.  Some is deep, some is cringeworthy.  There is too much filler dialogue for my taste- Sound design is simply absent in too many places- At times it feels as though corners were cut - unpolishedConclusion:7/10Good enough for a recommend "

												Wow.  This game is like a long interactive movie with a great plot and excellent, unique, and well-developed setting.  The beginning starts out as mostly an adventure game, and then as the game progresses, there get to be more and more cutscenes.  It must have taken forever to make.  The mechanics consist primarily of finding things, combining things, and making choices, of which there are many, each of which has one or more effects on the later state of the game.			"

												A few years ago when i saw the news that there was planning an actual sequel to one of my favourite universe of all time TLJ i was very excited despite the announced genre, ""interactive movie"".Let's be honest, this type of ""adventures"" doesn't hold more than one ending. And all this mechanic with choises and consequences is actually not... relevant? I guess? Especially for this universe. It creates a huge plothole in the context of prophecies and stuff. However, it's worth money and my time, I really enjoyed it. Now it's a complete story. Didn't ask for more.One more thing for people who had not decided yet whether to buy this game or not. I've read a lot of reviews from people who claimed that this is absolutely another story and about another characters. Don't listen to them. Red Thread Games really did add new characters and paid to them a lot of attention but it was done for a few purposes:1. New characters close lots of plotholes (and add some new, but not so important). 2. They tell you a lot about lore of the game from different sides providing deep immersion.3. They are absolutely natural to the universe and the story and you will love them a lot.7/10 (strongly recommended for fans of the TLJ)			"

												Just finished the entire game a few hours ago. There are pros and cons and I will try to cover everything here.First, the story is amazing. Among the best I've seen in a game. It is long, complex, with many turning points and your actions in the game affect part of the story. it has two main narratives that eventually interconnect and in the final book. A story well written that will be liked by most people that like narrative-driven games.The game's graphics are also nice. Not the best and nothing out of the ordinary for 2016, but still good. Sadly, the animations aren't always that well made. It is not a major issue, but sometimes the characters seem to move unnatural. Also, the voice acting isn't that well sometimes. Now, since this is a game, there has to be some gameplay elements and not just cinematics. There are int he form of puzzles. Some are good, while others are just searching for ""that specific item"", even though in real life it could have easily been replaced with almost anything nearby.If you are looking for interesting puzzle, look somewhere else. But what you want is a great story, you found the right game.			"

												In the gaming industry, it's uncomparable story-wise in my opinion.Its gameplay, too, but not in a good way. Much backtracking, little satisfaction and soooo many missed opportunities for an awesome combat system (which is completely missing by the way).Still, I'm recommending this for people who are interested in the story of the Dreamfall trilogy. This part is the golden capstone of all three parts regarding enactement and story. An absolute masterpiece and I'm equally saddened that there probably won't be any continuation. Someone needs to record this and its world in form of a book or at least a movie.			"

												This is ""game"" is a masterful work of Art, hinged on rich, intelligent storytelling.  I laughed, cried, raged; my heart ached.  At times, various technical problems made it difficult to enjoy, but in the end, Dreamfall had a powerful effect on me.  I fell in love with the characters, was mesmerized by the imaginative worlds and actually cared about what was happening.  I haven't encountered a story in games as complex, ambitious and portentous as this one.  It has deep social, and even spiritual implications and it's uncanny how it seems to have predicted the current political climate in the US (albeit in an exaggerated, fantastical way).  Yes, there are a few cringe-worthy, heavy handed bits (mostly right at the start), but overall I've never been more engaged.  I was highly impressed with the quality of writing and consistency of voice-acting.  Not too sure what some are complaining about there, as I can hardly think of better examples, at least not anywhere in indie games.  It's clearly not for everyone; It's really more of an interactive story with consequences to your decisions than a traditional game.  The gameplay is not particularly strong and the interface is frustratingly clunky.  It's often unclear what to do or how to progress and the frame-rate is wildly inconsistent.  If you have a more than passing interest in subjects like dreaming, the occult, the nature of reality and consciousness, you stand a good chance of having your mind blown and your heart touched.  This is by far my favorite installment in the series and I look forward to the next, though I imagine I'll be an old man by then...			"

												Strong on narraitive and imagination. There are some truly wonderful moments of dialouge, charaterization, and scenery. This is offset by some attrocious animation ( most likely attributed to the budget) and some serious flaws in gameplay. This is a very hard game to casualy reccomend to everyone - however, since you are even considering buying this game I will assume that you are not a typical gamer. This game was sometimes frusterating to ""play"", but I was not dissapointed 30 hours later when I reached the conclusion. You'll laugh, cry, and occasionally want to smash your keyboard over your head in anger at some of the lack luster mechanics/design implementation. Side note - After warming up to him, Crow is BAR NONE the most entertaining character in all of video games. Made my day every time he'd open his little beak.			"

												I bought this game now during steam summer sale for 10,19€ and man, that was a catch. I have seldomly enjoyed a gameplay as much as I have enjoyed Dreamfall Chapters up to this point. The main characters as well as the supporting characters are beautifully written, you just CAN'T possibly dislike them. I got especially drawn to this whole world of the Stark universe with Zoë being the protagonist. I don't mean to say Arcadia was less good, but the whole dream-machine, flying adbots, EYE surveillance society got me caught up! I think Tørnquist and Scheve mentioned to build up a game universe with a potential upcoming fanbase which can be compared to games like Fallout 4, GTA or the witcher. Although- If you're looking for a first-person shooting or fighting adventure this is the wrong game for you. You solve missions by interacting with objects or people or make decisions, that will be important for the games outcome, yes-but you won't get to climb/attack or jump on anything particularly. To me this wasn't bothersome by any means and If there's more sequels coming up, written by Tørnquist and Scheve in the future - I'll be sure to look at it.			"

												I have never played the 2 previous games in this series. This game reminds me in some ways about puzzle-advendture games I used to play in the 90's (King's quest, The Legend of Kyrandia, and so on), in that it focuses only on story and puzzle-solving, rather than also on character development (like in role playing games). I kinda like this type of game more, as I find hack and slash quite boring. Most of the puzzles are quite easy, but some of them might be a bit tricky.I love the story in this game, and I love the main characters in this game (particularly Zoe). I also love that I can play this game in linux. Overall, this might be one of the best games I have every played.			"

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*I've waited a long time for this game and I didn't touch it before all episodes were out. I avoided anything even resembling trailers and teasers. Even early screenshots. And you will find no spoilers in this review.The previous game (Dreamfall: The Longest Journey) ended with sooooo many questions unanswered and loose threads and the fact that the gameplay was so poorly received, the chance of a sequel felt slim. Even though the writing was good (the writing have always been Funcom's strongest suits). But then the Kickstarter by Red Thread Games was launched and I jumped on it. And now, 10 years after the 2nd game, we finally get closure in the story of April Ryan, Zoë Castillo and Kian Alvane.First the negative:First off I was very disappointed that they didn't keep the same voice actor for Zoë. A shame really since the original voice actor had a certain charm I was quite fond of. That said, the new one does a great job. Zoë seems more mature with her voice and she brings new qualities to the character and she also seems like she's a stronger actor than the original Zoë actor.Secondly, the character animation is not that great. It's not terrible, but not great. This, too, have always been a recurring flaw in Funcom games.Thirdly, the puzzles does not impress me. They're not that bad, but more work could have been put into them to make them more interesting and innovative.Lastly, the graphics. The game looks good for its budget and I'm not a GFX snob, but it seems to have some framerate drops in some areas you visit rather frequently.The good thing is; these are all VERY minor complaints in a story driven adventure game.Now the positive:The best part of this game is obviously the story. I was very impressed with how well it ties in with the previous titles. Seeing how the 2nd game ended, this should be a given, but it still greatly exceeded my expectations. They even managed to throw in more references to the first game than I thought they would. But the best thing about the story is how well it is presented. The game keeps revealing more of the deep plot, but does so in an unpredictable manner that intrigues you and keeps you guessing right until the end.The characters (both major and minor) are well thought out and show depth and personality. They interact with each other and the story in a way that can trigger a full range of emotions in you.The humor in the game is also great, without outstaying its welcome. And injecting humor in a mature game like this is important because this game have some dark and disturbing moments. I mean really dark. Yet it never resorts to jump scares or gore. This is no kids game. Neither was the first two games, but this is even less so in my opinion.Next up is the choice system. This was really well made and it really made me feel I had influence over how the story pans out and not just flowing along with it. I'm really looking forward to playing the game again with different choices.It is obvious that a lot of love have been put into this game by Ragnar Tørnquist and his team. I was very impressed with this conclusion and I take my hat of for the creators. Well done! I'm glad I backed it and have my name in the credits. It was certainly worth the wait.Too bad it's all over now. Unless... we get a 3x 3 hour movie trilogy based on the series some time in the future. No, on second thought, they wouldn't be able to do the series justice.If you have played and enjoyed the previous titles, you will love this. If you haven't, do yourself a favor and go play those first.			"

												Okay I love this game so so so much.Pros: Everything. The game is heavily story based and is almost like a puzzle game incorporated into a visual novel but the story... THE STORY.. is absolutely incredible. Well told, well timed, well written and even well voice acted. I haven't been this excited about a story for a very very long time. Two parallel stories, interwoven, both as compelling as one another, and both have a great message. I cannot recommend this enough.Cons: the only cons I can think of are a few inconsistencies and the last few cutscenes could have been scrapped or shortened, or more important and telling, I think they lessened the impact of the ending. Although the epilogue can definitely stay. :)			"

												Books 1-4 were great, and posed so many questions. There were problems that needed solving, and you needed to put quite a bit of time into it. You could spend a lot of time exploring and looking at completely irrelevant things.Book 5 answered those questions, but not in a very satisfying way. Book 5 was short and much of the book was cut scenes to explain things. The world was very limited in book 5, with not much to explore.Over all, I liked Dreamfall Chapters, but I was a little disappointed in the last book. It finished the story, but it felt like they were just tying up threads, rather than having a full episode. For the gameplay you get with its price, it is certainly worthwhile, and it certainly answers questions raised in Dreamfall. While some fans of the series disliked it, I loved it overall.			"

												Pros:- An excellent fantasy, with extremely varied and very beautiful graphics. A lot of work and creativity was put into the art and styles, and it shows.- Great story, and a good wrap-up for the previous games.- Has a story re-cap for those that didn't play, or forgot, the previous games. Ultimately, the story stands very well by its own.- Many choices, which ultimately end up shaping your path.- Some replayability, through achievements for discovering unique story lines uncovered by choices.- You can pause cut-scenes, and the auto-save system is quite neat. Makes it possible to quit the game at any time.Neutral:- Less use of items than the previous games. More cut-scenes instead. When compared to its predecessors, it plays more like an interactive story than a point-and-click game.- Some (but very few) of the permanent choices are time dependent, which makes you possibly regret the action you took.Cons:- Some puzzles are quite tedious. You know what to do, but you need to find the exact location to click. Other puzzles are ""find the needle in this haystack (town)"". 90% of the puzzles are easy enough, but there is a 1-2% with really annoying ones. Be prepared to use a walk-through.- A lot of graphical issues in Europolis chapters, although these are constantly patched and might not exist anymore after this is written.			"

												Plots and characters this great are just unheard of in video gaming. Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters stand far above every other plot-focused game I've encountered, and Chapters itself is mindblowing, heartbreakingly beautiful stuff.It does a phenomenal job of drawing you into each character's head, and each 'you affect the world!' choice presents a thought-provoking dilemma of moral greys, and lend enough dialogue/scene variance to add definite replay value.The dialogue is just unsurpassed, worth playing for alone. In fact, it would be worth listening to if it were just a radio play over a blank screen.There are too many great scenes to list, inventive and compelling world-building, and relatable personalities all pleasingly playing off each other. I particularly love Kian's randomly too-thoughtful over-specified deadpan descriptions of mundane items, so perfect for his thoughtful-but-blunt character. These are often satisfyingly subtle, but are also unabashedly used as the basis for numerous silly throwaway jokes.It builds up one of the most enjoyable game worlds to simply exist within and soak up. I played much longer than necessary, looping around, admiring the scenery. The graphics are incredible; it looks gorgeous, and in terms of quality/polish, Chapters is a very well refined experience, with far fewer rough corners than its predecessors, although not entirely without small problems here and there.It's still technically an 'adventure game', and has several moments of frustration due to unintuitive item/event 'puzzle'-solving. These are thankfully infrequent and self-contained, and all brute-forceable, in that I never had to look up a solution online (unlike some parts of the original Dreamfall). I personally think that the characters and dialogue are of such surpassing quality, they more than justify putting up with a few minor gameplay gripes. Having said that, the story does have some incredibly odd, discordant moments and weirdly dark elements. I'm not saying the story or the overall experience is without flaws, but I am willing to overlook almost anything for more scenes with these characters.In terms of recommending this game, anyone who is tired of lacklustre/token writing in games must play it, and everyone else should make the effort. Having said that, it's still tricky to recommend it to people, somehow. The odd thing is, I played Dreamfall and fell into this franchise entirely by accident, and while I wish more people could do the same and appreciate it, I understand why they don't.And, DFC is an adult story with adult themes and language. Plus, DFC is very much part 2 of 2. I don't think it's a good starting point, I think Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is essential to play first.I hope Red Thread might create a graphically updated re-release of the original Dreamfall, as its graphics haven't aged well, but all the audio and most area scenery could be re-used.

												The story is Amazing. Now that the last book is out there are no more excuses, no more waiting. You can sit down for 27 or so hours and emerge in this amazing story, presented through the point of view of 2 (3) characters.All the praises are down there, here are more important questions answered:Do you need to play the previous games as well?Yes, unfortunatly (or, fortunately because they are great). While the game is enjoyable even if you have not complete The Longest Journy and Dreamfall, you cannot fully experaince the story because it is all related: from the beginning to the end, all the chaters, all th events.Is it challenging? Fans of challenging puzzles and mysteries, like me, do not turn away. While you may not find these features in the game, the game is still good enough to give it a try.Do the choices really matter?[/b]Unlike other games that advertise that choices influence the story and fail to deliver, this one doesn't. Every story changing choice will be recorded, will be summurized between books and you will be able to see why that happened.Hidden achievmentsThis is not a question but it must be noted,  Just descovering some of these achievemnts is a fantastic feeling. Not all of them are related to the story, most of them you may miss because you did not talk to someone, helped someone or simply drink something (not a spoiler, just a comparison). "

												An epic conclusion to one of my favorite video game series, maybe it can be one of your favorites as well.Disclaimer:This is the 3rd game in a series of story focused games, so obviously not knowing said story may detract from your enjoyment of the game.Pros:-Story is still here, still great.-More puzzles than Dreamfall:The Longest Journey.-Less obscure and silly puzzle solutions than the first game in the series... though there is this one part that involves arrows and pillows that was a bit silly.-They added choice and consequence to the series, I suppose taking influence from telltale games.-This game has taken the telltale model and improved upon it, something telltale can't seem to do.-Still plenty of humor-I found myself enjoying the characters in this game even more than the first 2, and that's an accomplishment when I already loved the first 2.-You already love this world, go love it some more-Satifying ending feels just as epic as it should.-everything comes together it feels great to witness it all unfold.-I somehow got this game to run smoothly enough on my garbage computer.Neutral:-I don't think you'll be able to run this on a computer much worse than mine, I can barely run it, I have a desktop from 2012, wasn't really a super amazing computer back then, but that should give you a general baseline to work from in determining if you can run the game.Cons:-I don't like the stealth parts in this game, they aren't needed and the first one especially can be a bit buggy.  I don't really have the patience to enjoy stealth games as much as some people, but I'm sure they would agree the stealth in this game is pretty garbage.Overall: Play the entire series, unless you hate story focused games for some insane reason. The games of the series in order are:The Longest JourneyDreamfall:The Longest JourneyDreamfall Chapters			"

												A continuation of the second game, with a lot of fanservice towards the first.Kian is a much better character than he was in the second game. Zoe is much of the same, ever-willing to help.There is a third ""character"", a genuine Deus Ex Machina/ Dr. Who wannabe/ out of place character that has overprotecting parents and is linked to April.Pointless Combat is no more, but Pointless Stealth is still present.They improved the narrative using the telltale model, with a lot of choices, that don't or barely affect the game despite how much it tells you that they have a major impact. The only exception is the robot quest in Book 1 that changes based on a choice.It suffers similar to the second game, because they prefer to tell a story in which the player has minimal impute and is ready for massive exposition dumps instead of proper pacing. After some playable sections there are scenes where NPCs discuss the impact of your actions (dependless of choices) as if to build up some tension, but having the opposite effect.You don't even settle matters with the Azadi leaders that ware built up in the second game, they just settles themselves out.The best part was when April from the first game appeared briefly, it was the icing on the cake of fanservice, then I realized, the first game is leagues better than this can ever be. It was focused on a ""normal"" person that embarks on a JOURNEY that she is not even sure she wants to take, but has no choice. Along the way a world is being built and presented and the only way to progress is to solve problems, including personal ones.This game barrows some of that, but is still rotted in the narrative of the second game and the telltale formula.I recommend only one playthrough of the game. A replay may diminish the good parts.			"

												Overall I liked it. The story was okay. The graphical/visual direction was excellent, and the music was just amazing. The game starts out very slowly. I was actually a little disappointed with this. The Longest Journey should have been the wind-up, and it very much was, but this is the third part of the story, so I cannot agree with the decision to start at a snail's pace again. Once you get past the first half of the game, which is filled with ""amazing"" tasks like fetching your boyfriend some take-away, and walking an idiot-savant robot, the game is actually really good. I do wish that they picked up where Dreamfall ended, and that the whole game was about the main story like, but despite that I'd still recommend this game. I found it poignant and beautiful. Mr. Tornquist et. al. have done a good job. Also, I should say that I bought this game when the first episode came out but didn't play it until just now. I hate episodic gaming and essentially waited until I could binge-play the game over several long stints.The engine is a little buggy at times, with some errors showing up in the compositing, but overall I've only ever had the game crash once, which was sucky, sure, but tolerable. I played the Linux/SteamOS port, for anyone who cares to know.			"

												I have been a fan of The Longest Journey since the point and click adventure by the same name with April Ryan.  When The Longest Journey was released, I couldn't imagine it being any better...but it was...now we have Dreamfall Chapters.  I had high hopes for this game.  And my hopes and expectation were met ... until book 5.  What happened guys?  Book 5 is almost all narrative.  There are very few things you can actually do to control the story.  There were maybe 2 puzzles in it, and the rest was watching cut scenes.  I don't mind cut scenes at all...but...there was very little game play at all in this last book.  The first 4 were brilliant.  I was hoping for a brilliant final book.   Now, about the ending.  It took me a minute since it's been literally 20 years since I've played the original Longest Journey.  It took some reading and remembering, but the ending was very good...it tied up a nice story arc, but left you wanting more as well.  I just wish Book 5 had more gameplay.			"

												Just completed my first playthrough.It is definitely a good story. Original Dreamfall game didn't have an ending. This one does. It concludes the story and does it quite well. Not flawless, but well. Dialogues are decent, music is awesome, artwork is great.Unfortunately, I can't tell the same about the actual ""game"" part of the game. If you played the Dreamfall and you liked it (as did i), then you'll probably like the Dreamfall Chapters as well.The gameplay is almost similar to original Dreamfall (minus clumsy fighting sequences, there are none of them here). You walk around, talk to some people, look at things, pick them up, combine them and use at some places later. But there are very few actual puzzles in the game, so for the most time you'll be doing the walking around and looking/talking part.And there are also cutscenes. Lots of cutscenes. The last chapter is almost one huge cutscene with almost none interactions.On the technical side, the game was really buggy after the initial release, but it much better now. Switching to Unity 5 made it run smoother and look a little better. Character animations are terrible, but I think, I can forgive that.So, in the end, we have a good story with quite a little game to actually play. If you're fine with it, you should give it a try. If you're searching for something like the ""rubber duck puzzle"" from original TLJ, you'll probably be disappointed.This is indeed a conclusion of the Dreamfall dilogy. And it also can be considered as a conclusion of The Longest Journey trilogy, but I still hope, that they will make the sequel to the TLJ itself some day.			"

												After just finishing Book 5, I have to say I am more than happy that I got to experience this game and it will forever be special to me. Having played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, it really helped me understand the storyline and fall in love with these characters all over again. That being said, this game is totally worth the purchase if you love story-rich games that really throw you for a loop sometimes, but in the end, it's totally worth the adventure. I will say this, it's called the Longest Journey for a reason, holy crap.1,000,000/10, would recommend.Shameless self promotion to the gameplay I did for it. I'm currently uploading Book 4, and Book 5 will be out soon. I'm still shaking after finishing this game, I loved it so much.

												Wonderful to have the story finally completed. The orginal Longest Journey is one of my top 5 favorite adventure games. Of course beautiful art and world immersion- though the game plays more like an interactive movie than an adventure game. Barley any real puzzles. Of course I still recommend it because it closes the circle and finishes a (very great and very long time coming) story- though I am disapointed it doesn't play like a real adventure game. I have a feeling that the rush to get this game out on ""schedule"" played a part in this.			"

												My first comments ever for a much loved game.I loved this story over the years, it's sad to finally come to an end. Wonderfully written and engaging, a joy from start to finish.I will go back and try mutiple paths, and hopefully enjoy the replay as much as the intial games. It will be the first game I have replayed. If you were ever only thinking about playing this series, strop....buy all of the games and begin your journey.			"

												The continuation of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and the conclusion to the ""Dreamer"" storyarc of the series, Dreamfall Chapters has spent a long time in development. As a player who has waited for the release of each book in turn, reviewing the entire game at once is a little odd, since it does not match up how I played the game.So to be concise and spoiler-free as reasonably possible: if you liked Dreamfall, then you owe it to yourself to see the conclusion to Zoë Maya Castillo's story arc. I will stipulate that it gets better - one gets the impression that the early books were a learning process in development and storytelling, one in which Tørnquist and co take the time to preach political messages that have no place in a fictional video game. And I freely admit I would not have recommended this game purely based off the earlier books. But it gets better, and a satisfactory conclusion (of sorts) does come through in the end.Now, here's to hoping for The Longest Journey Home.			"

												A worthy title wrapping up the 'Heros' Journey/Dreamfall franchise.A solid story with excellent voice acting and very solid programming. If you've been waiting for the chapters to be complete, now is the time to buy the game.  Issues that existed are resolved, performance issues, glitches, bugs resolved. This game is well worth the price tag.Even though you do not require the first two games to understand the whole story, I strongly urge anyone considering this title to purchase ""Heros' Journey"" and ""Dreamfall"" and play them chronologically to truly appreciate how much everything has grown and how far people have come.

The road from the beginning of Book 1 to Book 5 could have been done a lot better.Tidous puzzles, bugs, ugly animations and vague explanations helped dragging this game down to the dirt, and all the good writing and witty dialogue from the author was sadly not enough to get this games feet back on the ground.People who played the previous games will surely be satisfied, when they reach the ending credits.For others, who have not experience the previous titles, there is not much for them to get out of this game.With all that said, I am glad that I finished the game, and it will always have a place in my nostalgia closet.

												If you've not played the previous game you should play those first, and not just because they tie in so much but also because they're brilliant too, Dreamfall the Longest Journey holds up in my opinion. If you have played them then you're in for a real rollercoaster of something truly special. An incredible journey spanning 3 games; a beginning, middle and now the end to this story. As of a few minutes ago for me it's all over..... :')			"

												Here's the bottom-line: if you've played The Longest Journey and its sequel, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, then you had might as well play this and see how it all ends. Also, Crow is back and he's as delightful as ever.Book 5 is released and it ties up virtually all the loose ends from a story roughly 17 years in the making. The ending is satisfying. If you're like me, and grew up playing The Longest Journey, then you gotta play this game to see how it all ends. No need to read further; hop to it (or wait until the game is on sale).Anyway, the game isn't great. But it has great moments. The earlier episodes are repetitive and a slog. Still, they lay the groundwork for some fantastic set pieces and epic moments in Episodes 4 and 5.A lot of your choices end up being non-choices; no real impact on the ending. Still, they add a lot of flavor, and they do a good job of making you pay attention to details of whether something is a good idea to pursue or not.The animation and environments of the game leave a lot to be desired. The characters move clunkily, unbelievably.  And the environments, while cool at first, are boring after you've ran through the same areas over and over for four episodes on various errands. Finally, though, episodes 4 and 5 introduce some new environments that are gorgeous to look at, and, thankfully, they don't overstay their welcome.As an adventure game, Dreamfall: Chapters is consistently underwhelming and simple-minded. No, I don't miss the obtuse puzzles of TLJ, but I wish there was some more depth to the gameplay. I can't help but feel like the episodic nature of the game only hurt it in the end; but I suppose there was no other way of financing this project.But let's be real: you're not going to play it because you're expecting an adventure game with memorable puzzles that make you feel like a genius.You're going to play it because Ragnar Tornquist created a captivating world populated by relatable characters that you care about.And you're going to enjoy it.

												I have never played the 2 previous games in this series. This game reminds me in some ways about puzzle-advendture games I used to play in the 90's (King's quest, The Legend of Kyrandia, and so on), in that it focuses only on story and puzzle-solving, rather than also on character development (like in role playing games). I kinda like this type of game more, as I find hack and slash quite boring. Most of the puzzles are quite easy, but some of them might be a bit tricky.I love the story in this game, and I love the main characters in this game (particularly Zoe). I also love that I can play this game in linux. Overall, this might be one of the best games I have every played.			"

												Okay I love this game so so so much.Pros: Everything. The game is heavily story based and is almost like a puzzle game incorporated into a visual novel but the story... THE STORY.. is absolutely incredible. Well told, well timed, well written and even well voice acted. I haven't been this excited about a story for a very very long time. Two parallel stories, interwoven, both as compelling as one another, and both have a great message. I cannot recommend this enough.Cons: the only cons I can think of are a few inconsistencies and the last few cutscenes could have been scrapped or shortened, or more important and telling, I think they lessened the impact of the ending. Although the epilogue can definitely stay. :)			"

												You know I don't normally review games, but this game has been the culmination of an excellent series that needed an ending...well of sorts. Are there any endings truly in the Journey ;) Overall though, great game, so glad I started it all those years ago in The Longest Journey, loved Dreamfall, put aside paranoia for a moment to give money to the kickstarter, and now my eyes feel like they need a journey to the store for some tissues. Just buy it, in fact buy the whole trilogy. It will be frusturating with some of the puzzles but still great series and great game here :)			"

												After just finishing Book 5, I have to say I am more than happy that I got to experience this game and it will forever be special to me. Having played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, it really helped me understand the storyline and fall in love with these characters all over again. That being said, this game is totally worth the purchase if you love story-rich games that really throw you for a loop sometimes, but in the end, it's totally worth the adventure. I will say this, it's called the Longest Journey for a reason, holy crap.1,000,000/10, would recommend.Shameless self promotion to the gameplay I did for it. I'm currently uploading Book 4, and Book 5 will be out soon. I'm still shaking after finishing this game, I loved it so much.

												By far the best adventure game series of all time. Dreamfall Chapters is a very worthy sequel of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. It's a very story-focused game, with great dialog, unparalleled voice acting and some interesting puzzles (albeit, unfortunately, much simpler and less challenging than the original games). It's very emotional, and thera are some really fast-paced moments even though there's no combat. The game works well without playing the previous ones, but they're definitely worth buying.			"

												This was an amazing journey. And I am glad that I followed its path. The story was complicated, it was its own science, yet very fascinating and wonderful, the structure of their world. I played this game for its story, which made me buy the two previous games just to have all the pieces of it, truly worth it. Landed on my list of favorit games of all time, and will never leave. Dreamfall chapters left its marks and worth to be rememberd, the overwhelming feelings this game brought, an awesome fantasy.I did not reflect much upon the quality of its game play. Since I keept my focus on the plot. For me this game runned very smooth. The graphics is very pretty, they look beautiful, yet very, very stiff in with there emotions in there dialogues. The character models could had more movments both in there limbs and facial expressions. And the music .. I do not remember much of it .. to actually sa anything about it... so, I will leave at that.As the characters, I did not reflect that much about them, just tools to proceed the story I guess. Yet they left there traces and are easily to remember and are likeable to actually feel for them, some more or less.  Crow was my favorit through the whole game series. <3  The choices does not always make a great impact, but one notice changes in how the characters react to you, etc. One notice them afterwards if you keep up the attention for them. The puzzles are pretty simple, everything that is needed is close to find in the area you are in. Find and combine, tadaa you can go on to the next stage. Some things can be more difficult to find though, but since the area to search is pretty small, it does not take that long to look around. But I got stuck too, but that were two times only, since these puzzles are  for the most part not that complicated. ( Compared to the first game ''The longest journey'', that game was way, WAYYY more difficult ... I needed a guide all the time U_U. )Anyway this story was .. so damn good that I do not know which words I should use. All the games together, were as if a happy childhood memory was brought back, yet these games were not a part of it. I got to know of this series when ''Dreamfall chapters'' was realesed here on steam. And yet, see it connect to the ''The longest journey'', it felt as if travling far back in time to the old emotions of a memory. A nostalgia that actually only reaches a little more than a year back, yet it felt as if had been a part of my life much longer. It made me cry .. haha, I did not want this journey to end, yet it did and I am glad I saw all of it. <3 11/10 :)			"

												Perhaps one of my most anticipated games for over a decade and worthy of the support it was given. The storytelling, the characters, the setting and the choices all play part in a wonderful thrill of a journey.Do not let the mouths decieve you, nor the shimmer, for this is a beauty that delivers substance for both deep and light humours. Take long walks by the river side of Propast or stumble through the cobble in Marcuria, either path, the cities are alive and vibrant. Remember to enjoy your stay in those worlds. You will not have time for exploration of the nightlife but you may at least have a view of the towns.Although the worlds may collide a little faster than you would have hoped, and weave you into a bundle of threads, you will have memorable moments that will sing through the songlines and stay with you to the end.By the Light and the Balance and all the Others, it has been a good journey till the end.

												I've been a fan of The Longest Journey since I came across Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and it left me in a state of emptiness after I finished it, like the feeling you get after you finish a book. I found out about The Longest Journey and played it as well and ever since, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are one of my favorites games of all time. This game was a gift to me, and it remains to be the best gift I've ever received.When I learned they would be making a sequel to my favorite games I was so happy but frustrated that I would have to wait so long, but it was worth the waiting! If you're into fantasy, cyberpunk, adventure and story this game will have you come back to it's universe Stark and Arcadia over and over again to meet some of the best told and designed characters in amazingly made two different worlds. Previously, I recommended this game to my friends but I told them they should play the previous games before this one to understand the story and love it, but as I progressed, I saw that this game alone has so much to offer even if you don't know much about the universe the story keeps introducing new characters and shows how the old ones changed as the worlds kept changing. So, even if you haven't played the other games I totally recommend it and I believe it's worth your money.If you've played the previous games I doubt I need to say more because this game takes the story where it left off. As soon as you start the game and see the opening cutscene, the game says ''this journey is not going to be an easy one''. The game has one of the best stories I've ever heard, read or seen and it NEVER lost its magic for me, I was never bored in any part of the game, there was always something else to be curious about something else to explore and understand and try to figure out. The moment you start your Journey, you should be ready to be surprised by anything because this universe is anything but boring. I enjoyed every single moment of it. Exploring the world in Dreamfall: Chapters was especially amazing because of the improved graphics. Every place you wander will have it's own magic with their own colors and a theme unique to them. The game has a fantasy side to it but not in a universe that is filled with Elves and Orcs or Angels and Demons. It introduces so many races with their unique cultures, designs and stories. They beautifully fit in the games universe and they shape it into what it is. The cyberpunk side of the game doesn't look as unique as it's fantasy side, but it brings humans from different cultures together and you will be seeing how they blend in the futuristic world of TLJ. The voice acting is great dialogues are not dull and if you take your time to interact with objects around yourself the protagonist will comment on the objects and Zoë tends to have interesting things to say about pretty much everything. I like her style. Her voice actress is different from the previous game but she does a great job as well. And as I said the story is amazing but I loved how it pulled me in and at some point I was so mad at something that happened I decided harshly and the consequences were so awful it made me feel horrible. So, yes the decisions you make, so far, have great effects, makes you consider the tiniest things over and over again. I hope the fifth book will live up to my expectations and my decisions will affect how the game ends. Though, I'm not sure if I can handle it if it ends badly because of my poor decisions, I will be crossing my fingers.Yes, I really love the series and I really love this game but I do feel like I must complain about some things that made me frustrated. The controls are bad, sadly. And when you run, you're basically not so much running. So, the exploring part gets a little bit too slow. I'm not saying I don't like exploring, I would've ran around my favorite places over and over again. Well, running is more like fast-paced walking and the animation seems like it as well so I guess it fits. Puzzles are not enough challenging compared to TLJ but considering I was, at some point, randomly clicking on everything trying to find something that works in TLJ maybe this is for the best. Some animations look a little funny but the scenery makes up for it greatly.  Some objects are hard to interact with, you need to hover your mouse on them a few times before you can interact. There are some collision problems and I hate not being able to go up some stairs just because they're not important. They're stairs, they're right infront of me, they're wide open for me to walk on, but the game just won't let me. Yes, it is pointless to go up those stairs but I want to.			"

												Amazing, what an interesting game. It's more of a storybook but you get to move the characters, 3D and make decisions to affect how your story progresses through the chapters. There are puzzles to solve and I have to admit I had to Alt-Tab out to find some of the solutions as they really do not give any hints. However be vigilant and not only see, but LISTEN to what the NPC's are saying they might have a key phrase that helps to figure things out. Other times it is just click all combos until you get it. But there were only 2 puzzles that seemed to work that way. This is a very clever game, beautiful to view. I can't wait for Book Five! I screwed up Kian though so make sure you find the infiltrator and remember some of the smaller details of a task are probably very important to be completed because they will have repercussions. This took several days, probably about 30 hours if you include some of the exploring I did in the cities. Well worth it!			"

												While I loved playing both Longest Journey and Dreamfall, I REALLY hated the ending of both. For that reason, I was hesitant to buy Dreamfall Chapters. The reviewers liked the ending though, so in the end I bought it. Having now played it to completion, I agree that this is a good ending to the series. It's too bad there wasn't enough money to do the sequel.My main criticism of the game is that, even with rather modest graphics, it requires a substantial GPU to get a decent frame rate - at 1280x720 and Medium quality, I only got 15 FPS with my GTX 720.Other downsides:- It is not possible to move the cursor independently from the camera. This makes for a somewhat dizzying experience, and also makes it hard to look for objects to interact with, especially at low frame rates.- No visible cursor, and objects you can interact with are not highlighted until they are centered in the view - see previous point.- Some puzzles are quite difficult, and you can't advance in the story until you solve them. I had to resort to a walkthough for several. In most cases. the difficulty is quite artificial - it does not enhance the story.- Voices for background conversations often drowned out the main conversation.

												Like the game so far, sadly i have tons of problems with it though, sound just stops working, game keeps crashing...Not sure if the fault is on my end or the game but this is kinda destroying the fun.Also the lip sync is kinda sucky as they just seem to open and close there mouth when they speak and don't really form their mouths..Further i really hope the game will start to work properly soon, re-installing it for the 2nd time now >.>			"

												This game was one hell of a journey! Created by the same people who brought you the previous games, Dreamfall still brings with it the intriging story, relatable characters, impactful choices and moments that, as a fan, make you want to cry when they come up.Certain parts of the game can be VERY different on choices such as at the begining if you want a different life, you work in a dingy place reprogramming discarded bots to re-sell where as if you chose to keep doing what you were origonally you get a sleek-high tech working place with different staff and sell your bots brand new.These are just a few of the differences you have when playing dreamfall, however I do have a few problems with it:Sadly unlike Telltale games, you can't start a new file in a seporate slot. All that you do gets replaced and over-written which is good as now the game is finished you can replay multiple times, but before the final chapter was finished it was a pain waiting around for it and being unable to play the other choices as it would erase the choices and options from chapters 1 - 4!In typical adventure game style some things are not obvious and you have to take your time to look around the environment for solutions to your puzzles, but nothing as advanced or out-of-place as with the first game where I got stuck because I didn't know I needed to pull a chain to get a rubber duck to use with large tweezers to get an item on the railway.I highly recommend this and the previous games to anyone who loves point-and-click adventure games, although this one and the previous game do not use a mouse to move but the keybard instead.

And the game probably ruined my exam tomorrow. Well. Worth =)			"

												Fantastic episodic series, really underrated compared to the likes of TT games series, Has a very good concept and great locales and protagonists. Very different to those types of games as it has a very linear structure overall but the story in undoubtly the main feature to enjoy, if you played the original Longest Journey and Dreamfall, you'll love this game.Pro's: Incredible immersive story, Fantastically written likeable characters, choices as in every episodic game, great artistic and futuristic environments like Europolis.Con's: More linear path than expected, load times between each scene is cumbersome and takes you out of it, optimisation issues such as framerate issues although has been patched I believe.Personal opinions: Finally ties up loose ends with Dreamfall's story from a decade ago (damn, that's a long time ago!), I was grasping all this time on theories on Dreamfall threads about its ending as it left on an ending and cliff hanger and more questions left unanswered than answered. Book one was so great to delve back into the world of Dreamfall again, the waiting time for each release afterwards was really long which I appreciate as the developers had time to make adjustments, the last book contrary to some others opinions in the discussion boards was the perfect ending of the Dreamfall saga and hopefully will now focus on the other beloved character of the series 'hint.' Story: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 9/10 Overall: 9/10Verdict: This was a great final entry into the Dreamfall/Longest Journey franchise and I hope RT games will make another one in the near future, or another new IP...P.S. I love that they kept Ingvild Hasund's 'Rush' song from the last game, I balled my eyes out at the end of that game when that song played and I did the same in this game!			"

Just buy it, in fact buy the whole trilogy. It will be frusturating with some of the puzzles but still great series and great game here :)			"

												After just finishing Book 5, I have to say I am more than happy that I got to experience this game and it will forever be special to me. Having played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, it really helped me understand the storyline and fall in love with these characters all over again. That being said, this game is totally worth the purchase if you love story-rich games that really throw you for a loop sometimes, but in the end, it's totally worth the adventure. I will say this, it's called the Longest Journey for a reason, holy crap.1,000,000/10, would recommend.Shameless self promotion to the gameplay I did for it. I'm currently uploading Book 4, and Book 5 will be out soon. I'm still shaking after finishing this game, I loved it so much.

												By far the best adventure game series of all time. Dreamfall Chapters is a very worthy sequel of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. It's a very story-focused game, with great dialog, unparalleled voice acting and some interesting puzzles (albeit, unfortunately, much simpler and less challenging than the original games). It's very emotional, and thera are some really fast-paced moments even though there's no combat. The game works well without playing the previous ones, but they're definitely worth buying.			"

Recently I found it and played it from start to finish. It is a fantastic story, told in a great way. There aren't many reviews on steam of games, that I have played, so even these words, that I'm writing now speak enough. There are parts when you'll laugh, there are parts where you get angry, because of a strange design dessision and there are parts where you will... well when you get there, you will find out.

The beginning starts out as mostly an adventure game, and then as the game progresses, there get to be more and more cutscenes.  It must have taken forever to make.  The mechanics consist primarily of finding things, combining things, and making choices, of which there are many, each of which has one or more effects on the later state of the game.			"

												A few years ago when i saw the news that there was planning an actual sequel to one of my favourite universe of all time TLJ i was very excited despite the announced genre, ""interactive movie"".Let's be honest, this type of ""adventures"" doesn't hold more than one ending. And all this mechanic with choises and consequences is actually not... relevant? I guess? Especially for this universe. It creates a huge plothole in the context of prophecies and stuff. However, it's worth money and my time, I really enjoyed it. Now it's a complete story. Didn't ask for more.One more thing for people who had not decided yet whether to buy this game or not. I've read a lot of reviews from people who claimed that this is absolutely another story and about another characters. Don't listen to them. Red Thread Games really did add new characters and paid to them a lot of attention but it was done for a few purposes:1. New characters close lots of plotholes (and add some new, but not so important). 2. They tell you a lot about lore of the game from different sides providing deep immersion.3. They are absolutely natural to the universe and the story and you will love them a lot.7/10 (strongly recommended for fans of the TLJ)			"

												Just finished the entire game a few hours ago. There are pros and cons and I will try to cover everything here.First, the story is amazing. Among the best I've seen in a game. It is long, complex, with many turning points and your actions in the game affect part of the story. it has two main narratives that eventually interconnect and in the final book. A story well written that will be liked by most people that like narrative-driven games.The game's graphics are also nice. Not the best and nothing out of the ordinary for 2016, but still good. Sadly, the animations aren't always that well made. It is not a major issue, but sometimes the characters seem to move unnatural. Also, the voice acting isn't that well sometimes. Now, since this is a game, there has to be some gameplay elements and not just cinematics. There are int he form of puzzles. Some are good, while others are just searching for ""that specific item"", even though in real life it could have easily been replaced with almost anything nearby.If you are looking for interesting puzzle, look somewhere else. But what you want is a great story, you found the right game.			"

												In the gaming industry, it's uncomparable story-wise in my opinion.Its gameplay, too, but not in a good way. Much backtracking, little satisfaction and soooo many missed opportunities for an awesome combat system (which is completely missing by the way).Still, I'm recommending this for people who are interested in the story of the Dreamfall trilogy. This part is the golden capstone of all three parts regarding enactement and story. An absolute masterpiece and I'm equally saddened that there probably won't be any continuation. Someone needs to record this and its world in form of a book or at least a movie.			"

												This is ""game"" is a masterful work of Art, hinged on rich, intelligent storytelling.  I laughed, cried, raged; my heart ached.  At times, various technical problems made it difficult to enjoy, but in the end, Dreamfall had a powerful effect on me.  I fell in love with the characters, was mesmerized by the imaginative worlds and actually cared about what was happening.  I haven't encountered a story in games as complex, ambitious and portentous as this one.  It has deep social, and even spiritual implications and it's uncanny how it seems to have predicted the current political climate in the US (albeit in an exaggerated, fantastical way).  Yes, there are a few cringe-worthy, heavy handed bits (mostly right at the start), but overall I've never been more engaged.  I was highly impressed with the quality of writing and consistency of voice-acting.  Not too sure what some are complaining about there, as I can hardly think of better examples, at least not anywhere in indie games.  It's clearly not for everyone; It's really more of an interactive story with consequences to your decisions than a traditional game.  The gameplay is not particularly strong and the interface is frustratingly clunky.  It's often unclear what to do or how to progress and the frame-rate is wildly inconsistent.  If you have a more than passing interest in subjects like dreaming, the occult, the nature of reality and consciousness, you stand a good chance of having your mind blown and your heart touched.  This is by far my favorite installment in the series and I look forward to the next, though I imagine I'll be an old man by then...			"

												I really enjoyed this game, for the most part. The writing is very good, with memorable characters, locations and plot. The story is broken into many chapters, and it wasn't at all uncommon for me to finish one chapter with plans to be done for the day, only to continue on because I wanted to know what happens next. Things got a bit weird later in the game with the introduction of another main character out of nowhere (that I know of). I was also surprised by the lack of drama surrounding some character deaths. One minute they're there and the next they're dead and nobody really cares. There were also a couple of really stupid 'puzzles' during the Interludes that I would recommend going straight to a guide for, because they were extremely annoying (lots of wandering around looking for a tiny thing to click).But these annoyances were few and far between in a big, grand adventure game that gets almost everything right.

												I think I may be a bit of an odd one out here, but I never played TLJ or Dreamfall and I absolutely loved this game. Now, this may have hurt my understanding of the story a little bit - there were several times throughout the game, but especially in Book 5, where the game would reference events from previous games and I had no clue what they were talking about. However, you pick up most of what you need to know just by progressing through the game. I could tell that Book 5 was made more for the long-time fans of the entire series, but I still thought it was a very enjoyable and pretty satisfying end to the whole game.But for the game as a whole, the characters were one of the things that I really fell in love with in this game. Not every character is given equal attention or development, but the characters that shine, really shine. Zoe, Saga, Kian, Enu, and Likho are all characters who you can quickly grow to love and care about. Also, the game looked beautiful - the settings were intricately designed, unique, and gorgeous.Now, was it a perfect game? Far from it - animations were wonky a lot of the time and as I mentioned, some characters (basically all others than the ones I mentioned) fell flat. Some parts of the story and the plot were more enjoyable than others, but at least in my experience I loved this game a lot more than I disliked it.So, TL;DR, you can still enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first two! It's not a perfect game, but there's a lot to love if you give it the chance.			"

												Books 1-4 were great, and posed so many questions. There were problems that needed solving, and you needed to put quite a bit of time into it. You could spend a lot of time exploring and looking at completely irrelevant things.Book 5 answered those questions, but not in a very satisfying way. Book 5 was short and much of the book was cut scenes to explain things. The world was very limited in book 5, with not much to explore.Over all, I liked Dreamfall Chapters, but I was a little disappointed in the last book. It finished the story, but it felt like they were just tying up threads, rather than having a full episode. For the gameplay you get with its price, it is certainly worthwhile, and it certainly answers questions raised in Dreamfall. While some fans of the series disliked it, I loved it overall.			"

												Plots and characters this great are just unheard of in video gaming. Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters stand far above every other plot-focused game I've encountered, and Chapters itself is mindblowing, heartbreakingly beautiful stuff.It does a phenomenal job of drawing you into each character's head, and each 'you affect the world!' choice presents a thought-provoking dilemma of moral greys, and lend enough dialogue/scene variance to add definite replay value.The dialogue is just unsurpassed, worth playing for alone. In fact, it would be worth listening to if it were just a radio play over a blank screen.There are too many great scenes to list, inventive and compelling world-building, and relatable personalities all pleasingly playing off each other. I particularly love Kian's randomly too-thoughtful over-specified deadpan descriptions of mundane items, so perfect for his thoughtful-but-blunt character. These are often satisfyingly subtle, but are also unabashedly used as the basis for numerous silly throwaway jokes.It builds up one of the most enjoyable game worlds to simply exist within and soak up. I played much longer than necessary, looping around, admiring the scenery. The graphics are incredible; it looks gorgeous, and in terms of quality/polish, Chapters is a very well refined experience, with far fewer rough corners than its predecessors, although not entirely without small problems here and there.It's still technically an 'adventure game', and has several moments of frustration due to unintuitive item/event 'puzzle'-solving. These are thankfully infrequent and self-contained, and all brute-forceable, in that I never had to look up a solution online (unlike some parts of the original Dreamfall). I personally think that the characters and dialogue are of such surpassing quality, they more than justify putting up with a few minor gameplay gripes. Having said that, the story does have some incredibly odd, discordant moments and weirdly dark elements. I'm not saying the story or the overall experience is without flaws, but I am willing to overlook almost anything for more scenes with these characters.In terms of recommending this game, anyone who is tired of lacklustre/token writing in games must play it, and everyone else should make the effort. Having said that, it's still tricky to recommend it to people, somehow. The odd thing is, I played Dreamfall and fell into this franchise entirely by accident, and while I wish more people could do the same and appreciate it, I understand why they don't.And, DFC is an adult story with adult themes and language. Plus, DFC is very much part 2 of 2. I don't think it's a good starting point, I think Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is essential to play first.I hope Red Thread might create a graphically updated re-release of the original Dreamfall, as its graphics haven't aged well, but all the audio and most area scenery could be re-used.

I've never played The Longest Journey, so I may have missed out on some references, but the story stands on its own, for the most part. Well-thought-out and genuinely interesting and often funny. The gameplay is minimal, but not obnoxiously stupid, i.e. no pointless flash events. I'd like more games to use these kinds of mechanics rather than the idiocy that telltale games force on the player.I complained about some of the story elements on social media and one of the devs chased me down to clarify it - I haven't seen someone care this much before, really happy about that, especially since it's a pretty high-profile title. Get it, play it, enjoy.			"

												If you like games in which your choices matter, this game is for you.If you like games that can be genuinely funny and a bit silly, this game is for you (but don't believe even for a minute that it won't rip your soul apart. It will. You will cry.)If you like cyberpunk settings, this game is for you.If you like fantasy/medieval/steampunk-ish settings, this game is for you.If you like action games and don't like cutscenes, look for something else. But, really, it would be a pity to avoid this game.Also, play Dreamfall: The Longest Journey as well. I know it's really dated, but 1) it's a good game 2) it's heavily connected to Dreamfall Chapters, so you'd miss out on a lot.			"

												A beautiful game that is actually quite visually stunning despite having a bit older graphics. It reminds me of Life is Strange in that it is choice based and episodic, so if you enjoyed LiS you will most likely enjoy Dreamfall: Chapters. Fun for some cooldown after an intense shooter or thriller, or just some laid-back game time.Would reccommend, just for the views alone!			"

												An epic conclusion to one of my favorite video game series, maybe it can be one of your favorites as well.Disclaimer:This is the 3rd game in a series of story focused games, so obviously not knowing said story may detract from your enjoyment of the game.Pros:-Story is still here, still great.-More puzzles than Dreamfall:The Longest Journey.-Less obscure and silly puzzle solutions than the first game in the series... though there is this one part that involves arrows and pillows that was a bit silly.-They added choice and consequence to the series, I suppose taking influence from telltale games.-This game has taken the telltale model and improved upon it, something telltale can't seem to do.-Still plenty of humor-I found myself enjoying the characters in this game even more than the first 2, and that's an accomplishment when I already loved the first 2.-You already love this world, go love it some more-Satifying ending feels just as epic as it should.-everything comes together it feels great to witness it all unfold.-I somehow got this game to run smoothly enough on my garbage computer.Neutral:-I don't think you'll be able to run this on a computer much worse than mine, I can barely run it, I have a desktop from 2012, wasn't really a super amazing computer back then, but that should give you a general baseline to work from in determining if you can run the game.Cons:-I don't like the stealth parts in this game, they aren't needed and the first one especially can be a bit buggy.  I don't really have the patience to enjoy stealth games as much as some people, but I'm sure they would agree the stealth in this game is pretty garbage.Overall: Play the entire series, unless you hate story focused games for some insane reason. The games of the series in order are:The Longest JourneyDreamfall:The Longest JourneyDreamfall Chapters			"

												Pros:- An excellent fantasy, with extremely varied and very beautiful graphics. A lot of work and creativity was put into the art and styles, and it shows.- Great story, and a good wrap-up for the previous games.- Has a story re-cap for those that didn't play, or forgot, the previous games. Ultimately, the story stands very well by its own.- Many choices, which ultimately end up shaping your path.- Some replayability, through achievements for discovering unique story lines uncovered by choices.- You can pause cut-scenes, and the auto-save system is quite neat. Makes it possible to quit the game at any time.Neutral:- Less use of items than the previous games. More cut-scenes instead. When compared to its predecessors, it plays more like an interactive story than a point-and-click game.- Some (but very few) of the permanent choices are time dependent, which makes you possibly regret the action you took.Cons:- Some puzzles are quite tedious. You know what to do, but you need to find the exact location to click. Other puzzles are ""find the needle in this haystack (town)"". 90% of the puzzles are easy enough, but there is a 1-2% with really annoying ones. Be prepared to use a walk-through.- A lot of graphical issues in Europolis chapters, although these are constantly patched and might not exist anymore after this is written.			"

												Strong on narraitive and imagination. There are some truly wonderful moments of dialouge, charaterization, and scenery. This is offset by some attrocious animation ( most likely attributed to the budget) and some serious flaws in gameplay. This is a very hard game to casualy reccomend to everyone - however, since you are even considering buying this game I will assume that you are not a typical gamer. This game was sometimes frusterating to ""play"", but I was not dissapointed 30 hours later when I reached the conclusion. You'll laugh, cry, and occasionally want to smash your keyboard over your head in anger at some of the lack luster mechanics/design implementation. Side note - After warming up to him, Crow is BAR NONE the most entertaining character in all of video games. Made my day every time he'd open his little beak.			"

												I bought this game now during steam summer sale for 10,19€ and man, that was a catch. I have seldomly enjoyed a gameplay as much as I have enjoyed Dreamfall Chapters up to this point. The main characters as well as the supporting characters are beautifully written, you just CAN'T possibly dislike them. I got especially drawn to this whole world of the Stark universe with Zoë being the protagonist. I don't mean to say Arcadia was less good, but the whole dream-machine, flying adbots, EYE surveillance society got me caught up! I think Tørnquist and Scheve mentioned to build up a game universe with a potential upcoming fanbase which can be compared to games like Fallout 4, GTA or the witcher. Although- If you're looking for a first-person shooting or fighting adventure this is the wrong game for you. You solve missions by interacting with objects or people or make decisions, that will be important for the games outcome, yes-but you won't get to climb/attack or jump on anything particularly. To me this wasn't bothersome by any means and If there's more sequels coming up, written by Tørnquist and Scheve in the future - I'll be sure to look at it.			"

												The story is Amazing. Now that the last book is out there are no more excuses, no more waiting. You can sit down for 27 or so hours and emerge in this amazing story, presented through the point of view of 2 (3) characters.All the praises are down there, here are more important questions answered:Do you need to play the previous games as well?Yes, unfortunatly (or, fortunately because they are great). While the game is enjoyable even if you have not complete The Longest Journy and Dreamfall, you cannot fully experaince the story because it is all related: from the beginning to the end, all the chaters, all th events.Is it challenging? Fans of challenging puzzles and mysteries, like me, do not turn away. While you may not find these features in the game, the game is still good enough to give it a try.Do the choices really matter?[/b]Unlike other games that advertise that choices influence the story and fail to deliver, this one doesn't. Every story changing choice will be recorded, will be summurized between books and you will be able to see why that happened.Hidden achievmentsThis is not a question but it must be noted,  Just descovering some of these achievemnts is a fantastic feeling. Not all of them are related to the story, most of them you may miss because you did not talk to someone, helped someone or simply drink something (not a spoiler, just a comparison). "

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*I've waited a long time for this game and I didn't touch it before all episodes were out. I avoided anything even resembling trailers and teasers. Even early screenshots. And you will find no spoilers in this review.The previous game (Dreamfall: The Longest Journey) ended with sooooo many questions unanswered and loose threads and the fact that the gameplay was so poorly received, the chance of a sequel felt slim. Even though the writing was good (the writing have always been Funcom's strongest suits). But then the Kickstarter by Red Thread Games was launched and I jumped on it. And now, 10 years after the 2nd game, we finally get closure in the story of April Ryan, Zoë Castillo and Kian Alvane.First the negative:First off I was very disappointed that they didn't keep the same voice actor for Zoë. A shame really since the original voice actor had a certain charm I was quite fond of. That said, the new one does a great job. Zoë seems more mature with her voice and she brings new qualities to the character and she also seems like she's a stronger actor than the original Zoë actor.Secondly, the character animation is not that great. It's not terrible, but not great. This, too, have always been a recurring flaw in Funcom games.Thirdly, the puzzles does not impress me. They're not that bad, but more work could have been put into them to make them more interesting and innovative.Lastly, the graphics. The game looks good for its budget and I'm not a GFX snob, but it seems to have some framerate drops in some areas you visit rather frequently.The good thing is; these are all VERY minor complaints in a story driven adventure game.Now the positive:The best part of this game is obviously the story. I was very impressed with how well it ties in with the previous titles. Seeing how the 2nd game ended, this should be a given, but it still greatly exceeded my expectations. They even managed to throw in more references to the first game than I thought they would. But the best thing about the story is how well it is presented. The game keeps revealing more of the deep plot, but does so in an unpredictable manner that intrigues you and keeps you guessing right until the end.The characters (both major and minor) are well thought out and show depth and personality. They interact with each other and the story in a way that can trigger a full range of emotions in you.The humor in the game is also great, without outstaying its welcome. And injecting humor in a mature game like this is important because this game have some dark and disturbing moments. I mean really dark. Yet it never resorts to jump scares or gore. This is no kids game. Neither was the first two games, but this is even less so in my opinion.Next up is the choice system. This was really well made and it really made me feel I had influence over how the story pans out and not just flowing along with it. I'm really looking forward to playing the game again with different choices.It is obvious that a lot of love have been put into this game by Ragnar Tørnquist and his team. I was very impressed with this conclusion and I take my hat of for the creators. Well done! I'm glad I backed it and have my name in the credits. It was certainly worth the wait.Too bad it's all over now. Unless... we get a 3x 3 hour movie trilogy based on the series some time in the future. No, on second thought, they wouldn't be able to do the series justice.If you have played and enjoyed the previous titles, you will love this. If you haven't, do yourself a favor and go play those first.			"

												I have never played the 2 previous games in this series. This game reminds me in some ways about puzzle-advendture games I used to play in the 90's (King's quest, The Legend of Kyrandia, and so on), in that it focuses only on story and puzzle-solving, rather than also on character development (like in role playing games). I kinda like this type of game more, as I find hack and slash quite boring. Most of the puzzles are quite easy, but some of them might be a bit tricky.I love the story in this game, and I love the main characters in this game (particularly Zoe). I also love that I can play this game in linux. Overall, this might be one of the best games I have every played.			"

THE STORY.. is absolutely incredible. Well told, well timed, well written and even well voice acted. I haven't been this excited about a story for a very very long time. Two parallel stories, interwoven, both as compelling as one another, and both have a great message. I cannot recommend this enough.Cons: the only cons I can think of are a few inconsistencies and the last few cutscenes could have been scrapped or shortened, or more important and telling, I think they lessened the impact of the ending. Although the epilogue can definitely stay. :)			"

The beginning starts out as mostly an adventure game, and then as the game progresses, there get to be more and more cutscenes.  It must have taken forever to make.

												A few years ago when i saw the news that there was planning an actual sequel to one of my favourite universe of all time TLJ i was very excited despite the announced genre, ""interactive movie"".Let's be honest, this type of ""adventures"" doesn't hold more than one ending. And all this mechanic with choises and consequences is actually not... relevant? I guess? Especially for this universe. It creates a huge plothole in the context of prophecies and stuff. However, it's worth money and my time, I really enjoyed it. Now it's a complete story. Didn't ask for more.One more thing for people who had not decided yet whether to buy this game or not. I've read a lot of reviews from people who claimed that this is absolutely another story and about another characters. Don't listen to them. Red Thread Games really did add new characters and paid to them a lot of attention but it was done for a few purposes:1. New characters close lots of plotholes (and add some new, but not so important). 2. They tell you a lot about lore of the game from different sides providing deep immersion.3. They are absolutely natural to the universe and the story and you will love them a lot.7/10 (strongly recommended for fans of the TLJ)			"

												Just finished the entire game a few hours ago. There are pros and cons and I will try to cover everything here.First, the story is amazing. Among the best I've seen in a game. It is long, complex, with many turning points and your actions in the game affect part of the story. it has two main narratives that eventually interconnect and in the final book. A story well written that will be liked by most people that like narrative-driven games.The game's graphics are also nice. Not the best and nothing out of the ordinary for 2016, but still good. Sadly, the animations aren't always that well made. It is not a major issue, but sometimes the characters seem to move unnatural. Also, the voice acting isn't that well sometimes. Now, since this is a game, there has to be some gameplay elements and not just cinematics. There are int he form of puzzles. Some are good, while others are just searching for ""that specific item"", even though in real life it could have easily been replaced with almost anything nearby.If you are looking for interesting puzzle, look somewhere else. But what you want is a great story, you found the right game.			"

												This is ""game"" is a masterful work of Art, hinged on rich, intelligent storytelling.  I laughed, cried, raged; my heart ached.  At times, various technical problems made it difficult to enjoy, but in the end, Dreamfall had a powerful effect on me.  I fell in love with the characters, was mesmerized by the imaginative worlds and actually cared about what was happening.  I haven't encountered a story in games as complex, ambitious and portentous as this one.  It has deep social, and even spiritual implications and it's uncanny how it seems to have predicted the current political climate in the US (albeit in an exaggerated, fantastical way).  Yes, there are a few cringe-worthy, heavy handed bits (mostly right at the start), but overall I've never been more engaged.  I was highly impressed with the quality of writing and consistency of voice-acting.  Not too sure what some are complaining about there, as I can hardly think of better examples, at least not anywhere in indie games.  It's clearly not for everyone; It's really more of an interactive story with consequences to your decisions than a traditional game.  The gameplay is not particularly strong and the interface is frustratingly clunky.  It's often unclear what to do or how to progress and the frame-rate is wildly inconsistent.  If you have a more than passing interest in subjects like dreaming, the occult, the nature of reality and consciousness, you stand a good chance of having your mind blown and your heart touched.  This is by far my favorite installment in the series and I look forward to the next, though I imagine I'll be an old man by then...			"

However, I'm having a difficult time really enjoying the game b/c of POOR performance. It really makes me sad and angry that a game that has potential is severly being hamstrung b/c of frame rates.Very sad. I have a 7950 w/ 3GB card. Given that the game isn't heavy on FPS style action, my card should shred this game at high settings; running it at medium to no avail.

												(Episode Five is the primary focus of this spoiler-free review)It's the best possible ending to the Longest Journey series. The previous entry, Dreamfall, was utterly ruthless in its emotional brutality - a tragedy compounded by time, akin to if Empire Strikes Back had gone without a planned sequel for over a decade. Dreamfall Chapters is the complete opposite: it doesn't merely crank out the happy ending that fans clamored for; it presents a thorough, multithreaded series of conclusions that expertly merge Dreamfall's dark maturity with the first game's sense of wonder and magic. The former is certainly the dominant element, though, make no mistake, but it's used to satisfying effect.Also, those jerks made me burst into tears within 5 or 10 minutes of starting the fifth episode. A day later and it still makes me misty-eyed. If it hadn't been for the achievement text that popped up I think I would have literally died of sadness and missed all the bittersweet or even happy conclusions.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters Book 2 is awesome. I love how my actions in Book 1 shaped my experience. It made me want to go back and play Book 1 and Book 2 in a different way to see how things would have turned out. The puzzles in this Book were a little more challenging. Not mind bending, but there seemed to be more thought put into them in my opinion. The story is getting better and better and man that cliffhanger. I have to wait 3 or 4 more months for the next Book and it will be the Longest Wait! I was hesitant to pay $30 for the season pass, but I am so happy that I did. It took me 3 hours to complete Book 1 and 6 hours to complete Book 2. That is almost the same length of time spent for the equivalent season of any telltale game.  Not only that but we still have several books to go before the season is over! Are there some graphical glitches? For sure, and I am pretty confident that in the near future, there will be patches to address these issues. Is the game flawless? No, but it is a deep engrossing and awesome story. You will not regret your purchase. I love each and every minute of my experience with Dreamfall Chapters.			"

But even if you've never touched either of those games, I highly recommend you play this. Some of the best voice acting in games is included in Chapters, as well as some of the best writing. On top of that, the world the story is based in is intriguing and unlike anything you've seen before. Ragnar Tornquist has done it again, bringing an emotionally captivating, deep and immersive world and storyline that is perfectly suited to the interactive experience of a point-and-click adventure.

												You get to select who you want to be and how you want to do things. This is still a story based game where your descisions have little to say about the outcome of events throughout the episodes 1-3, they do not change the static events as ""what is out of our control"" ( paraphrasing ).  But honestly, i love this game, and the story it tells. Highly recommended.			"

												I had never even heard of this series until they ran the kickstarter for Dreamfall Chapters, but it caught my attention. I now own all the games in the series and love them. The only problem I have and it seems to be a common issue is that the game isn't optimized properly. Or so that is what I keep hearing. Personally the game runs fantastic for me on my pc at high settings, but for only 30 minutes or so. After that the framerate drops significantly. I can stop the game and restart and the problem is fixed. Sometimes I even have to logout out of my pc account. Trying to lower the settings does absolutely nothing. I am sure that Red Thread will address this situation at some point. It doesnt make the game unplayable and it is well worth this small inconvenience. It is a treat for the eyes and ears. The graphics wont blow everyone away but the art style really catches the eye. The story for all of these games is probably the best I have encountered in the video game industry and the voice acting from game to game is consistent as well. I think only one major character has a different voice actor in Dreamfall Chapters and it is a vast improvement. (I am a little biased due to the fact that this actor voiced one of my all time favorite video game characters of all time;  Sir Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. All in all this game is amazing so far and I am sure books 3-5 will be just as amazing, and I for one cant wait for them to drop. I give it a 9/10 only for the fact that the gameplay is a little soft. Even though its predecessor was lauded for its horrible stealth and combat mechanics, at least it had them.  There is no combat (so far) and there was one instance where you have to avoid a guard by making sure he is pointing in the oppsite direction. If he catches you then it places you outside a gate 20 feet from where you were. And you actually get an achievment for the quest called ""And you thought there wouldnt be stealth."" Despite these minor flaws the game has me hungering for more and I cant wait to see how it all ends.			"

												I have been waiting a long time for Dreamfall to continue. if you like fantasy adventure with a captivating story then you will enjoy this. This lastest addition to the series is using the desicion making style of game mechanics to get you more involved in the story. I love these kinds of games because they mix up a bit of puzzle solving with good casual gaming. So far I am loving these books. Book one and two have only left me craving the next episode. If you played the previous games is this series then you absolutely must play this. If its your first experience with these games then to be honest I recommend playing them in sequence because it will make a lot of sense but it is very playable as a solo title. The others can be played and prequels. Episodes are a good length too with decent amount on content, unlike some other similar desicion based games where the episodes only last just over an hour this was a good 4 hours or so of game time, part of that was running around finding things and locations but thats what adventure games are all about!

												After years of waiting whe can finaly continu our journy of Dreamfall.If you loved the first and second game you will love this one.The voice acting is amazing as always, The city looks awesome and feels like big a city. I think a walked around for a hour just to click on everything in the city and find some history about the city. It's also a good way to explorer and find your way around the city.The voice animation is not that great but hey thats dreamfall but because the voice acting is so perfect you wont even bother.This game will also have a big replay value because of the choices you make. And there are some hard choices to make, its not like you know the best choice because in most cases you dont know, you really have to think twice and make the choice you think is best. But it makes the story go completly different.If you love a good story or you like The walking dead serie for example then this game is for you. If you dont like to watch alot of talking without any action then this game isn't for you.Also good to know is that you dont get much clue's where to go. You get a name of a store or place and thats it! No dot on the map where to go. You do have navigation maps all around the city.If you did't play the first and second game i higly recommend playing it before you start playing on chapters or you could get a little bit lost in the story.The only downside are the sepperate books and that you need to wait to continu you story. On the plus side the books are pretty long. I think i am almost done whit book 2 and i think il get to 14 hours whit just the 2 books. Not bad for a 30 euro game right? "

												As the previous titles, this game is story-rich and built on the deep lore of the universe. The settings are wonderful and magical, and the game has a great soundtrack that flows well with the game. The characters are colorful and well-written, and the game has an excellent balance between the comical and serious parts. Already in the first 2 of the 5 parts, it delivers in longevity, and is basically already longer than your normal Telltale game. Some gameplay mechanics could use some fine tuning, but the story of the game makes me forgot these things along the way.Just a wonderful experience			"

												The mere existence of this game makes me happy, but it is also actually a really worthy continuation of the Longest Journey franchise.To think, the last game in this series came out around the same time as Half Life 2...I'd genuinely given up hope of ever seeing the story being resolved, but now it is happening. It makes my heart happy.This is the only kickstarter game that I have ever backed, and I did so gladly.It's a choice driven puzzle game in the same kind of style as recent Telltale games. The story has always been great, and still is. Runs really well on my system and the art style is also great.One of my favourite game series that I have ever played. Might be difficult to get into if you haven't played the previous games, and they (particularly the first one) are starting to look pretty dated now. Dreamfall still holds up quite well though, and is worth playing just for the story.			"

This dreamlike game succeeds in touching the fragility, pureness and limitation of life in all its facets perfectly. It's a marvellous illustration how past and future are always woven together and act side by side in the present.DreamFall - The Longest Journey was one of my favorite games of all time because of it's strong time travel (or need I say 'parallel world travel') story. It contained some deep, nostalgic, difficult to describe atmosphere which could silence you and after completing Chapters' concluding part 'Redux' I'm convinced this one's even better. The soundtrack, voices and narrative voiceover are the best I've heard since years in a game.My favorite game of 2016.			"

												This is the third installment in The Longest Journey saga. We have actually waited for this game, fans of the series, for a lot of years, always with a fear that it may actually never get published.In an age where story-rich games get fewer and fewer, lost in the heaps of, so called, AAA dumbed down games that appeal to the masses, this would be terrifying indeed.After many ordeals the game was finally made, in episodic format, with crowd-funding. And its much better than what we actually expected. It builds up slowly but as the story progresses deeper and deeper and reap the consequences of your actions, you get more and more lost into it.Currently at the 4th book, there's one last book missing to conclude the story. This is a game about a great story, with heavy choice consequences. Do not go into it expecting anything else. If you have not played the first two games, it is highly recommended that you do. Although they are old and their graphics are dated, fans of story-rich games should have no problem at all getting into them. You will thank me later if you do. If you start directly with this title a lot of things will not make sense and you will lose a lot from the experience.			"

												Amazing, simply amazing. I started playing dreamfall: The Longest Journey when I was in sixth grade. Being captivated by the story, I played the click and go first game. I can confidently say I'm a huge fan of this series and 10 times out of 1o will play it until my last breath. I strongly reccomend playing the first game as this story is quite complex and one needs to understand that the basics are simple: One world is split into two. One of magic, Arcadia.One of logic and reality, Stark. People who can shift and dream themselves between these two realms is whom the story is revolving around. It's quite clever and the originality and amazing.			"

(“Dreamfall Chapters” has a recap in the main menu, but it doesn't cover everything.)+ Excellent overall story with a very satisfying ending.+ Solid visuals.+ Knows what kind of game it is.  (Doesn't try to shoehorn action style combat into an extremely story based game.)- Poorly designed puzzles in the middle of the story.- Animations feel a bit wooden at times.			"

												I found out about Dreamfall after hearing about the successful Kickstarter of this game. After completing it I wish I had been there to back it. Dreamfall TLJ was an excellent story-driven game, and Chapters continues that. The game switches between the two main characters: Zoe and Kian. At times their stories intertwine with each other. Which brings me to the writing. Without spoiling anything, the plot is filled with ups and downs and makes you feel invested and immersed. And as with many good RPGs there are plenty of moments that will make you laugh, perhaps even cry. As far as mechanics go it is far smoother than either of the previous games in the series which comes with it being built in a more modern engine. This is helped by the removal of direct combat. Something that I felt was particularly stiff and frustrating in the previous game and didn't quite belong.If I had to say anything bad it would be that the game came out in five books. I get the developer what the Red Thread Games was trying to do and I appreciate getting to play the game earlier, but by the time I finished book five I was a bit fuzzy on some of the details from the earlier books. If you are buying this game today this doesn't matter. Another thing to be aware of that can stump people at times is that you have to be sure to look all around you, 360 degrees, every nook and cranny. Sometimes things that aren't meant to be puzzles end up holding people up, myself and LPers included.All in all a fantastic game! Highly recommend, but you should probably play Dreamfall: The Longest Journey first.			"

												That’s it, then.Dreamfall Chapters: Book Five – Redux has the unenviable task of not only wrapping up its own plot, but offering a proper conclusion to the original Dreamfall, released back in 2006. That’s a heavy task in and of itself; both games are companion pieces to The Longest Journey, a mammoth tale of twin worlds and the people who can move between them. That initial story was begun much further back, in 1999, and has threads of its own woven into Chapter’s narrative. What all of this means is that, at least for now, a story that took more than fifteen years in the telling has finally drawn to a close.It’s a lot of narrative to conclude. And while Ragnar Tørnquist’s trio of games has sometimes come under fire for mechanical failings, there’s rarely been much complaint about the encyclopaedic lore and deep intertwining plot lines. These tales are a clear labour of love, all brilliantly sobering, self-deprecating, tragic and immersive. They're about a futuristic dystopia under the ever watchful eye of a Big Brother with ill intentions and a magical world at war with religious zealots determined to wipe magic out completely. So, yeah, there’s a lot of ground to cover, and Redux does struggle to bring closure to it all. There are still some questions unanswered, while others seem rushed through, thrown in during a static corridor of exposition leading to the big villain reveal some of us figured out in 2006 (and, to be fair, even the game pokes fun at itself for giving this away too early). There’s a lot of weight on the shoulders of Redux, so credit where credit is due: its knees might wobble now and then, but they never buckle.Screen time is roughly split between the two protagonists, who mainly stick to their respective worlds to tidy away their efforts. Kian returns to his résistance army, which is under different shades of disaster depending on some of the running choices you’ve made thus far in the adventure. Zoe, on the other hand, finds herself returning to Stark in a way she couldn’t have expected. While Kian’s left to pick up the pieces of his shattered comrades, Zoe’s trying to piece together her origins.That description sounds vague, doesn’t it? Some of that is because I’m graciously tiptoeing around spoilers, but some of it is also because a lot of what you'll experience depends on those pesky choices you’ve made. Sometimes, they kind of matter. Kian’s shattered group is tragically splintered regardless of what you’ve done, but people you’ve grown close to and come to rely on are either alive or dead based purely on your actions. You have that soul-destroying sucker punch at the end of the fourth book to deal with, for instance. On the other end of the spectrum, everything you’ve come to believe about Zoe’s adventure is turned on its head in a second, forcing you in an instant to re-evaluate everything you’ve done thus far and to ask yourself if any of it really mattered, or if any of it was real at all.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/13026/pc/dreamfall-chapters-book-five-redux/review.html "

												I'm speechless. This, what an incredible journey. I've never played TLJ or DTLJ so I didn't understand a single past-game references. But because of this game, I'm going to, and then, I'm going to replay this. Don't worry though, the story's still understandable even if you haven't played the previous games. Personally, I loved the characters. Each and every one of them, I got attached to them just as much as I got attached to Clementine (although not as attached as I was to Lee, which, fun fact: did the voice for Likho). The two vastly differing worlds (one with magic, and one without) are amazing. The characters are great. Unfortunately, this is the end for the series. I'll keep the story alive in my heart, but for now, goodnight sweet prince.			"

												This is a must have for adventure gamers, particularly if you played the previous games in the series. It has a great story, and the 3D environment is a big advance on The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. While, IMHO nothing is better than a Tex Murphy game, this comes as close as just about any other.Being broken into 5 separate books, the game provides a lot of hours of gameplay: 4.5 our of 5 stars.

												If I could I would relive the whole story of all three games. It was such a beautiful experience. I recommend the series to anyone and everyone of all ages. It's beautifully created, and beautifully scripted.One of my favorite games, if not my favorite. Beautiful music.Beautiful script.Beautiful characters.Beautiful words.Enter Arcadia, Enter Stark.Find Her, Save Her!Start with The Longest Journey, then Dreamfall, and last but not least Dreamfall Chapters.

												Dreamfall is mostly about a good fantasy story, filled with colourful characters and worlds. You can choose your actions, and they will have some impact on the plot.Animations and character appearances seem a bit rough and stiff. This is a MUST for those (like me:) who've played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.I played those as a little girl, and they both left me an ever lasting impression..			"

												A worthy sequel to two of the greatest gaming storytelling experiences, The Longest Journey & Dreamfall. If you are a fan of the Longest Journey universe, Dreamfall Chapters will melt your heart. However, it is also surprisingly accessible to newcomers in the series and those familiar with the branching storylines of Telltale or Life is Strange.			"

Best if played after the other two titles of the franchise (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall). Especially for fans of good ol' fantasy/sci-fi point-and-click adventures, The Longest Journey is a must-play.Thumbs up!			"

												I wish I could recommend this game multiple times or give it stars, it's a 5-star adventure. It has something for everyone. The only catch is, if you didn't play The Longest Journey or Dreamfall Chapters, you will be a little lost. On the other hand, you OWE it to yourself to pick those games up, if the story of your game is remotely of importance to you.			"

												Followed the series from the first The Longest Journey game and was pleasantly surprised to see that it remained an excellent story with great character development in each new iteration. The Dreamfall Chapters game is a treat to play, it has, in my opinion, a great story, excellent characters and dialogue and really nice visuals. Thanks to Ragnar and his team for creating games like these, can't wait for the final chapter ( actually I can wait, take your time and keep up the good work :) )!			"

												*Update*The last episode was a good wrap up to the overall story, HOWEVER, I was extremely bummed that I had no idea how the choices I made in the previous episodes played out in the last one.  And there were absolutely no choices to make in this one, nor was there much gameplay.  There was barely anything to interact with and I think for about 15 minutes I just sat and watched without actually doing anything and got achievements. And apprently I missed 15 achievements, which I assume were due to the choices I made, but it's a bummer I have to reply a few times just to get them. Like go way back... And no summary at the end telling me how my choices affected anything either.  BUMMER! Overall, I give this game a 7.5/10. Really cool story, but bummer ending/overall gameplay. Episode 1 review:So far so good! I did not play the original game so I was a bit lost in the beginning, but no matter.  It did take me a little time to figure out what her ""skills"" in the Storyland part did, but when I did figure it out, it made sense.  I like the fact that there is quite a bit you can interact with as well as walk around, which adds more time in the game since the city is quite large.  The dialogue is pretty good, especially between Zoe and the Shitbot.  I have to say I still am not sure what all the different storylines mean, and some of the important decisions you had to make were very cryptic. I'm sure it will come together soon enough, and I look forward to playing more.Scenery and visuals are pretty graphically great.So far 9/10! Also glad this game was on sale as it was on my Wishlist for some time :)			"

												A truly captivating story driven game that beautifully immerses the player into the lives of Kian and Zoe.It starts off slow, running seemingly useless and boring errands, running from one side of the city to the other BUT it gets better.  It builds the foundations of each character so that the player gets a true understanding of what each character resembles. Reading the other reviews, I see that this alone caused many players to lose all hope in the game and give up after only just beginning Book 1. That's their loss.Dreamfall chapters accomplishes something that many games cannot, to make unqiue, likeable characters. Sounds easy but it is rarely achieved. The choice factor in this game DOES MATTER. Sometimes its something silly, other times it can be the difference between your favourite character surviving or dying. It also strongly matters to the relationships between characters in the game which will further impact how the characters will interact with each other. Will they assist one another or choose not to. That is based on the players dialogue decisions.Being such a long game, averaging around 20-30 hours for the first 4 Books it really draws out and explores everything that it can, without it seeming like a bland and boring story. The pace is just right.SUMMARY This is a beautiful adventure game with gorgeous visuals, logical and likeable characters, a stunning choice of music and a choice-consequence system that can advertently effect the future. Dreamfall Chapters clearly demonstrates that story driven games can still be masterpieces in todays gaming world.			"

												As a fan of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Dreamfall Chapters delivers, and is a very enjoyable new installment in the saga. The game has great storytelling and enjoyable, and well written characters. It looks good, and it is nice to finnaly see this world in good and stunning graphics. Some of the puzzles are hard to figure out, and sometimes you get lost trying to finding out where to go, but this should be expected in an adventure game.If you are a fan of the other games in the series, you will enjoy this game. And if you want a great story and great characters you shuld play this game.On a side note, I was kind of dissapointed when i played Book 1, and it is the weakest part of the game. So don't just play Book 1 and judge the game on that, Book 2-4 are all much better and where the story really kicks into gear and gets amazing. The final book wraps up the story well enough, with a few treads left lose. My critisism of the last book is that it has to many cutscenes and little gameplay.			"

But I cannot help but feel that some of the dialouge feel forced between the characters and they try to be edgy.But I still enjoy the game, even though it isent as engaging and mystical as the very first game, but then again that could just be my nostalgia-spectacles talking.8/10 I would get it, especially if you find it on sale and enjoyed the previous games.If you are not a fan of this series? Well you could still pick it up, but some of the plot will be a bit weird for you, nothing a few minutes of youtubing wont fix though.			"

Grand finale of a The Longest Journey sagaIt was a realy Longest Jorney, started at 2000 and finished in 2016.Campaign on Kickstarter was held not in vain, Ragnar Tørnquist[en.wikipedia.org] knew what he doing. And with help from fans we at last got what we needed all this time.Dreamfall ChaptersAll those questions what stayed in our heads after finishing Dreamfall: the longest journey, finally we've got answers for them. At least to most of them.And YES I advise you to play thru all story from the beginning: The Longest Journey, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and then Dreamfall Chapters.Game has a little video for those who've not playing previous two game, but it's not enough.In Dreamfall Chapters good almost everything:Characters. We have a lot new and ofcource old characters and every of them fully open and has his own story.Visual style. Two worlds Stark and Arcadia, science and magic. First sci-fi future, by style remind me blade runner. And second world from our fairy tales with magic, wizards, weird species and talking birds :)Everything looks very nice. Colourful when it's needed and dark where it's needed.Music. Just great job of Simon Poole[simonpoole.bandcamp.com], this music weaves thru all game and inseparable from main story line.Story. And last but definetly not least the story of this game. The Hart of the TLJ saga. This is not just answers to questions from previous parts, this not linear story where from your decisions will depend many aspects of the further story in whole and some characters in particular. With just epic finale where every story from every of three games comes to logic end and whole stORY... but no, this you might know by yourself without spoilers.As I said earlier good almost everything and Dreamfall Chapters not without issues:Optimisation. Game freezing and even might crashed on big locations (Europolis, Marcuria), it's really annoying. There are two solution:Reduce ""Visual quality"" in settings.Add more RAM :)A lack of animations. Most characters in the game like wooden toys. Especially in dialogues it's looks weird.But this can't ruin impressions of the game.Overall I'm very like this game, it's one of my favorite game and series in one row with ""Beyond Good & Evil"".

												Dreamfall Chapters is the direct continuation of the critically acclaimed adventure games The Longest Journey and its sequel Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, both published by Funcom. In a rare case of trademark Heaven on Earth, Red Thread game, a game company consisting mainly of some of the key people from the previous games in the series (such as the writers) have been allowed to borrow the rights to the series.Dreamfall Chapters plays very much like an improved version of Dreamfall. The good parts have been amplified and iterated upon, whereas the less than stellar elements of its predecessor have been toned down or eliminated entirely.It is very much a game driven by its narrative, it has more puzzles then the first Dreamfall, but nothing like in The Longest Journey. This is a game that should be played for it's story, characters and worldbuilding rather than its gameplay, so if that doesn't sound appealing to you, this is most likely not a game you would appreciate.So far, I have not been disappointed with the first two episodes.

												I highly recommend playing The Longest Journey or at very least Dreamfall (you can get a recap of either but Dreamfall is at least not very long or difficult) because this game's beauty, depth and worth are even more impressive if you feel a little bit at home in the worlds of Stark and Arcadia. It's been such a long, well, journey and despite the damage that hype and nostalgia can ravage on a new entry to a beloved series, this game just feels right. If you appreciate story and the unique capabilities of games this whole universe is for you, and this latest entry is mesmerizing to say the least. Now let's just get The Longest Journey Home paid for and all us crazy fans who have been following this slow and strange release of games will finally be able to die happy.			"

They should've just went further to book 6 or 7 and made the story go smoother. There's no need for rush here.-) In Book 5 one of the heat character's voice was excluded. It was a huge shame.-) In Book 5 there is a place where there should be a scream but they didn't put it.-) Some choices result in totally unexpected behavior. You selected it thinking that it was a casual answer but your character suddenly goes all red Hhahahahahaha.-) I wish there were quick saves and quick loads so you can save and load right before or while choice of answers.

In a rare case of trademark Heaven on Earth, Red Thread game, a game company consisting mainly of some of the key people from the previous games in the series (such as the writers) have been allowed to borrow the rights to the series.Dreamfall Chapters plays very much like an improved version of Dreamfall. The good parts have been amplified and iterated upon, whereas the less than stellar elements of its predecessor have been toned down or eliminated entirely.It is very much a game driven by its narrative, it has more puzzles then the first Dreamfall, but nothing like in The Longest Journey. This is a game that should be played for it's story, characters and worldbuilding rather than its gameplay, so if that doesn't sound appealing to you, this is most likely not a game you would appreciate.So far, I have not been disappointed with the first two episodes.

												Another great game from the creators of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. Amazing visuals, gameplay, soundtrack, and  a deep and satisfying story. The only requirement for newbies to this latest adventure is that you should play ""The Longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall"" BEFORE starting this game to fully appreciate the story.			"

												Dreamfall chapters book 5, now with 70% more Darth Vader and use of the force ™ THIS IS THE   REVIEW POST BOOK 5 COMPLETION.   I’LL MAKE THE FIRST PART AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE THEN LATER ON MENTION SPECIFICS WHICH MIGHT BE SPOILERS. I have waited…. SO long for this book, to finally play it has been great and really happy to finally get an ending to the story. So, storyline. The story line is mostly great, to summarise it you have two worlds one of magic, one of science and both can be affected by each other and I won’t mention exactly how because you know, spoilers but yeah it’s interesting. I really loved the fact you have 2 worlds and one semi world/ in-between world? Anyway these three worlds you play in and eventually they begin to merge then finally they all meet at one point. Look, as of writing this it’s on sale for about US$10.20 which, if you’re paying in Australian dollarydoos or Canadian Maple Money/ Monopoly money is a bit more than that but at that it’s worth it to play the story.  Things I really liked    I loved the fact you could examine just about anything(Because I’m a nosey♥♥♥♥♥♥I suppose) and get a character’s thoughts and at times humorous dialogue or little bits. For example, examine a rocket and get character dialogue of “Ground control to Major Tom!” Nice touch. Makes more sense given the rough era the area is based on.  I like the fact choices do seem to matter, think of it like a stat check. A string of choices could have an affect later and a couple times I found myself thinking “♥♥♥♥, I made a bad decision last book. Bad things are going to happen” That or regret a decision after it was made.  The scenes are pretty beautiful. Especially europolis, it’s always dark and rainy. Your apartment is small but still very beautiful and I just love that city and contrasting medieval style city. Very nice.  The characters are great. I especially like Zoe, Enu, Mira, Crow and♥♥♥♥♥♥Bot. Specifically Enu, she is so ditsy and cute and awkward.   Miner dislikes/ gripes  It could be a little slow sometimes to go from place to place just to do something seemingly simple.  It would have been nice to see more of some characters to really get more of a feel for the world and be more engrossed within it.   Now, I’d just like to chuck on some quotes form the game I found particularly amusing before the small spoiler section down below later.   “I need to be in that body. And I need to stop sounding like a pervert.”  “Affirmative. I will stop doing this thing that I live that makes me happy and fulfilled to follow you on our pointless, depressing journey. “ “Requests for sexual favours will be bogged and reported to the appropriate authorities. WATIcorp adbots do not ‘talk dirty’ or perform fellatio.”  “Every step you take’ I’ll be watching you, as mandated by martial law.” ….. “How about every breath I oh I give up”  MOVING SLIGHTLY INTO SPOILER TEROTORY NOW FOR BOOK 5 AND POTENTIALLY PRECIDING BOOKS Things I really liked (cont)     symbolism maybe?  I’m not up with Buddhism or things within it but in book 5 Zoe comments on the “between world” place being like a Buddhist temple. Might be some form of a reference to something from Buddhist beliefs but not sure.  The choices I made meant that in the story line I made good with people. And I’m so glad I did, just a few different decisions and maybe that wouldn’t be the case.   "

												All credit to the developers for creating such a fantastic end to a legendary series like the Longest Journey. A story that draws you in completely, characters you really care about. and such a magnificent ending, I can't praise it highly enough. The game itself ran flawlessly for me. A sign of a great game is when I am sad it comes to an end and I am very sad this ended. I loved every minute of this game. A worthy end.			"

Lovely. Books 1 - 3 have been very nice, a definitive opinion can of course only be formed once the fifth one is out.			"

												Slightly different from The Longest Yourney and the previous Dreamfall when it comes to how the point-and-click works. You adapt extremely quickly though and before you know it you find yourself stuck in yet another beautiful game. The fun part about this game is the fact that you feel you're watching a movie - and actually get to choose some of the plot yourself, a lot of people has criticized the story but i personally love it!  Red Thread Games just posted a great movie for those of you that either can not remember the story from the previous games, or the ones that has not played either of them. I don't feel it is a 100% necessary for you to know the story behind but it will absolutely enhance your perception of the game.It is an absolutely stress-free game so far, and a game you can enjoy whether you're tired, up for a movie, ready for some action or just bored and looking to spend some easy time. This, combined with loads of riddles, makes it the perfect game.A few glitches here and there as the game is still in an early stage, but the publisher is really listening to their players when it comes to reports and bugfixing etc. I still have not stumbled across any glitches that are severe enough to require a report. As i mentioned earlier, this is yet another beautiful game. I have always favoured Arcadia and seeing the graphic quality-facelift they've put on stark, i can hardly wait for loads and loads of more level designs and hopefully lots of Arcadia. I'll be like christmas everytime a new chapter gets released. Well done, red thread games! I love it and the game absolutely lives up to my expectations.			"

												I'm going to write this for people who have never experienced anything from ""The Longest Journey"". And it's unfortunately a negative. If you're familiar with ""The Longest Journey"" series, then you can just ignore this review and purchase the game. However, if you've never played ""The Longest Journey"", or ""Dreamfall"", you might find your money wasted here. If you feel compelled to, play The Longest Journey and Dreamfall first.While the game does a decent job of catching you up on things, those things that have passed by only really matter if you've played the past titles. When I put some thought into how a totally new player to the franchise would feel, I realized that much of the story of ""Dreamfall Chapters"" just falls flat. There is little to compell a new player to the world. To me, the story only works because I'm familiar with the previous titles. The game is rather linear and doesn't offer many approaches to situations. The game gives choices, but they don't seem to impact much of the game. The choices you make are just cosmetic, but they're not bad. There is some satisfaction with some of the results despite their lack of impact to the game. For an episodic game though, you shouldn't be expecting much from these though. I've yet to play an episodic game that wasn't mostly on rails. At least they didn't try to incoporate combat like they did in ""Dreamfall"", whew, that was bad.Sometimes the script and voice acting feel off as well. Often times the subtitles never matched the actual voice acting. The puzzles are rather simplistic, but they can be a little frustrating at times. Hiding objectives in obscure places doesn't really make for good gameplay. Such setups may encourage exploring, however I've found that exploring doesn't really benefit the player much. Also, sometimes the critical elements don't highlight when you would expect them too. During a late game puzzle, I was pacing around an object I needed to interact with but couldn't. Turned out that I needed to look way above the character to interact with the thing, and the animations afterward interacted with the part I was just staring at... The Longest Journey series hasn't been known for outstanding animations, but I have encountered many scenes where things were just... janky because of bad animations. This can be largely forgiven for the story, but as I've said before, newcomers with no knowledge of the back story may find this to be much more annoying. Overall, I'm pleased with the game but that's only because I'm familiar with the franchise. Newcomers, exercise caution with your money here.			"

												A well written story with memorable characters and engaging dialogue. Choosing dialogue options is actually meaningful since your character explains what they are thinking with a few sentences when you hover over an option. Making choices is often done by actions like stepping into a conversation or just eavesdropping instead of always through dialogue.			"

												Judging from Book One alone, I still cannot recommend this game except for hardcore Dreamfall chapters who enjoyed the previous games (Longest Journey and Dreamfall).Pros:- Excellence in story telling and character development.- Great graphics.- Decisions affect the story line. (Deja vu?)Cons:- Not optimized at all. Too much FPS drops especialy in Europolis.- Repetetive gameplay - out of around 5 hours needed to complete this, you spend around 2 wandering around Europolis fighting your way to know where to go next. It wouldn't have been so bad if there was actually something you can do along the way. The city is boring with big amounts o repetitive environments and NPCs. Overall score: 6/10			"

												It's the third game in The Longest Journey series, the first of which was to the Point and Click adventure what Freespace 2 was to Space Sims, and Serious Sam was to shooters. The last, and the very best, example of a dying genre. To this day, the story and the gameplay is touching, bittersweet, engaging, and brilliant, unlike anything else.The second game, Dreamfall, was produced during the Adventure Dark Ages, and was also excellent. Despite some unwise ""innovations"" and streamlining, and a cliffhanger not-ending. In many ways it invented storytelling devices that Telltale games and ""Walking Simulators"" such as Gone Home are just beginning to understand.Basically, you owe it to gaming to play this series. all of it.

Well take that remove the cheating of turning back the pages then slap it on one of the most engaging adventures you will ever likely to play. Every decision is constantly changing the story, changing the game. A small decision will encounter you later in big ways. It is definately worth a go but be sure to play the previous 2 games before picking this one up.			"

												Definitely worth it if you were a fan of the previous installments. If you're new to the Longest Journey saga - you might want to wait until more chapters are released. Or go play Dreamfall!I played through the first chapter in about 4 hours. The story is immersive and richy detailed. Europolis was a beautiful example of how a cyberpunk city should look. Can't wait for the next chapters to come out.On the downside, there were a couple minor bugs that I noticed. The characters lips and words did not always match up all that well in some of the scenes. The controls are a little different and take some getting used to - but they did away with the horrible combat controls I suffered through in Dreamfall so I can't complain that much.Zoe was hilarious as usual. I wish there'd been more Arcadia but hopefully in the next chapters. Definitely glad I bought.			"

												Thought I would write a few lines to even out some of what I find to be ludicrous negative points to make about an Adventure game. If you don't have a high enough I.Q to read a map and find your way around a reasonable sized area, then stick to the mindless game offerings of EA and the like. The Forums at Red Thread Games are a great way to get help if you need it.The main draw of the game is the storyline, characters and dialog. Plus more Longest Journey is always a good thing. The 2nd book alone is longer than lot of other games. By the time all books are out, you might be looking at round 30 or more hours of game time, and thus is superb value for money.If you like Adventure games, then DFC is up there with the best of them. I would also recommend playing the previous games.			"

												This is a good game. It is a adventure (not exactly the old point and click) in a 3d environment. It presents a great story (so far I have played 3 of5 episodes) and follows the events of the last game however I do think that the gameplay itself could be better.Graphics 7.5/10 - Do not get me wrong, these are very good graphics however they are not truly optimized. In a 270x even if it does not stay at 99% usage, I have to disable anti-aliasing to get over 30 fps. Using far higher settings I can get 45-50 fps in Mordor with the same hardware. There are also strange lighting effects with weird results. If the graphics in this game were optimized, I would have given it one more point.Sound 8.5/10 - The music is good and there are voiceover gems . Shitbot is hillarious.Story 10/10 - I love the story and its intrigue. Lots of unexplained misteries. True choices and consequences (better than telltale). Gameplay 7/10 - Although I love the story, sometimes I wonder why the developers opted to construct the gameplay the way they did. It feels awkard sometimes. Some tasks are just random and almost no clue is given. Navigating on the open world is tedious and there is a lot of backtracking. You do not carry a map, which is only available in selected places.Overall 8.5/10 - If you enjoy adventures, liked the The Longest Journey, or like a great mistery story, I recommend this game to you. It is a very good game indeed. A few of the design choices are awkard however they do not take away the charm the story offers. "

												Full disclosure: I'm a fan of the series, and supported the Kickstarter.But that said, this game is great, and the adventure aspect is fully realised. Your choices actually have consequenses that you can feel, and you actually want to go back and try other options after a playthrough, to see what could have been different, and believe me, a lot can be different.The only real cons I can find are some of the very tedious ""find these items"" or ""figure out how to solve this very illusive situation"", but they're few and far between, and guides are there to help you if you get stuck. Guides does not feel like cheating in this game, since it's very story based, and not puzzle based.Otherwise a very sure reccomendation from me, especially if you enjoyed the earlier games in the series. As a new player you'll have fun, but do check the story of the earlier games beforehand, or you'll be lost very quickly, since this is quite an expansive lore to follow.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a very worthy successor to TLJ and Dreamfall. Once again featuring rich story-telling and world building while at the same time being completely hilarious at times it's an absolute joy to play and watch.While the ending is a bit abrupt, that's to be expected in an episodic game release - the post game screens promise a lot of further consequences to your chosen actions during book one.Which leads to the main (though probably fixable) criticism: DFC should really include the option to save different playthroughs (the way the Mass Effect games do for example) to see the effect of your choices in future games.Nevertheless a highly recommended game!

												This is truly wonderful.I won't discuss the story in details. The only thing that really matters is that this is an adventure made with an incredible amount of love and care. Awesome, tragic, deep. Very consistent. All that's left is Book Five, which is, well, coming soon.EDIT: Book Five is out right now, and, well -- although some story lines were wrapped, let's say, really quickly and in case of the few -- without proper explanation as of how and why, the main story line and an epilogue are massive tear-squeezers.Graphical and sound design are executed very thorough. This is a very solid work, with the teeny-tiny exception of voicing for some characters, especially Reza. Voice volume levels are also tend to differ from chapter to chapter, but I can live with that.As for technical realization, well -- as a Linux gamer, I'm quite used to all sorts of glitches. Fortunately, they are mostly visual, due to use of some shaders which are not available in *nix-version of Unity. Lack of optimization also shows, for I'm struggling at Arcadia with medium graphic settings set, on a rig running 2-gig GTX750Ti b\w AMD quad-core and 32 Gbytes of RAM. Propast, on the other way, runs super-smoothly. Dunno what I'm doing wrong, to be honest.Nevertheless, ported version is, well, okay. It's stable, it's not crashing. And Linux is my personal choice, so I guess most people won't encounter these issues which I've mentioned.To summarize: yes, this, in my opinion, is a good game. It does not feature complex puzzles. Sometimes it suffers from technical issues. But I do recommend it, for it's a game made with unbelievable amount of love & attention to details of the story (which is pretty much what you'd want from an adventure/quest), memorable characters -- and let's not forget great soundtrack. So yeah, don't be a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and buy this one already. We almost drove everything to hell once, with pirating The Longest Journey and everything. Let's not make the same mistake again.			"

												Definitely a 10/10!I was eagerly awating the resolution of a story, which left us all with a cliffhanger for almost a decade. But yey, it's finally here! Even though I have only played the first Book yet, I can already say that this game has exceeded my expectations. This game brings back the nostalgia I have felt when I first played the Dreamfall game as a teenager and fell for it the same way I felt for its prequel. The amazing characters, voice acting, environments, and story decisions that will keep you on your toes awaiting their outcome are all top notch. Too bad the game was split into episodes, because now I can't wait for how the story unrawels itself. Must buy for every adventure fan!			"

												It looks great on one of the stories, the other feels extremely blocky and bad looking. Exploration is EXTREMELY unrewarding. The quests have no guides and the saving system is flat out awful. I really, really wanted to get into this, but couldn't. Even upon googling a solution to a part I was stuck at it was a simple game mechanic where you had to stand there listening to NPCs repeat the same dialogue for an extended amount of time. If somebody can help me get into this, by all means.. But I can't recommend it with how it feels right now. (Also feels like you don't get to make decisions.. not that I managed to get far.)This is the first game I have not recommended and I feel a little bad about it, I just wish they'd have put more effort into letting people feel rewarded for exploring (i.e. finding items, dialogue that changes things, etc..) and when you do start dialogue it's just long lines where you have no choice in what to say.  Sorry Dreamfall, you just failed to impress me. :(			"

												Updated 09/2016: They rewamped the animations a bit. It is not perfect, but a great improvement on how they shipped book 2. From book 4 onwards the game stops being a game and starts being an interactive movie. You hunt for items on screen and when you click on items in the right order (That saga prelude between book 4 and book 5 could have easily been a hidden object game) the story moves forward. You watch dialog heavy cutscene for 5-10 minutes and do another 5 minutes of clicking. I mean if not for the story, I would definitely not recommend this as a game. Find a full playthrough video and watch it as a movie instead.I am a huge fan of the Dreamfall franchise. Loved the old games, wanted to love the new one. I guess my expectations were just too high but I can't help but be a bit underwhelmed by this one.Don't get me wrong the storytelling is still there. Just as good as it ever was, but the animations (or the lack of it) takes a lot away from the atmosphere. Especially in the book 2 the cutscenes involving the Azadi faction are ... sub par.Still I see no reason not to be hopeful. Afterall they managed to raise a huge chunk of money. I guess we can expect them to put that money to use in better animations for book 3.			"

The adventury side of the game isn't really hard until now, but I enjoy the game and its presentation very much.

Its a shame to see how small the market for deep games like this is, really a shame. Jogo muito particular, dono de criatividade e sensibilidade únicas. Pena que não haja tantos outros assim (sinal disso é o quanto a própdia produtora demorou para lançar este, colocando games de outros gêneros anteriormente).Faz todo sentido chamarem de ""livros"" os capítulos, pois são donos de um lirismo único.

												I've played through the whole The Longest Journey series and just waiting for the final book to get a closure.There are many questions one want answered.The game is very well made. Story wise, voice acting, graphical and you find out things tying previous events.You have great worlds to explore.I did enjoy this game tremendously.There are characters of all kinds in the game. From shy, corrupted, murderous, bots, devious, foul mouth and so on you will meet it all. Your decisions does affect outcomes so think about your decisions when you do and have the time.I do recommend playing previous games to get the full enjoyment and understand all even thou you do not have to.I do have restrictions usually when it comes to releases with chapters that take such time between release dates.I was thinking of waiting but went ahead anyways as I had played the other games.In a way I regret it but at the same time not.I do recommend the game strongly.Thou if you're one who doesn't like to wait for a part to finish it all and to get closure then wait until the date is known for Book 5.Have a jolly good day!

												One of the best games I have ever played. It has interesting characters, great story, choices that affect it, vast locations, good humour and graphics. This is the third part of a trilogy: The Longest Journey -> Dreamfall -> Dreamfall Chapters. I didn't like The Longest Journey - too many puzzles, weaker plot - didn't finish it. Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters are completely different - more videos, fewer puzzles - more like interactive movies. I recommend to play Dreamfall before this one for better experience.The pros are clear, the cons are: no good map (finding places sometimes takes much more time than it should), some puzzles (don't like puzzles). Though puzzles are not a big deal - if stuck I just read the walkthrough - that way they didn't bother me to much.			"

												I can not fully recommend this one:I love The longest Journey and it will be one of my favourite games forever!!!! But Dreamfall and Dreamfall chapters are not that good. Don't get me wrong the story is awesome and it's worth checking out but the gameplay?There is none.Almost none. I never liked episodic games and I played quite a few. I love point and click and I hate it when they change what made the game so awesome just because it's not popular anymore.In Dreamfall you just walked around talking or interacting with things/persons to get thing A and than to put it with thing B you do the same steps again. There was so much backtracking.Dreamfall chapters is just the same but you can make decissions which may have an impact of some sort but some of those decissions are really weird or the reactions you get are not fitting.Spoiler example:Decission: Torture a man or just question him-apparently torture makes him more reliable (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!)Decission: kill him or don't kill him- kill him and you'll make one of your teammates really happy- I didn't kill him because Kian is a rebel now, not a warrior and not an azadi. He becomes your spy which is not at all what I wanted and leaves me very unsatified.Also YOU SHOULD play the first and second game. "

The game is quite easy though and there are very few opportunities to go 'deep' in the story in Episode 1.Moreover it borrows heavily from the recent Telltale Games, like The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead series, where 'you choose your reply among 4-5 alternatives' and it may have consequences ('shift the balance').

												As a fan of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Chapters has been on my radar pretty much since it became public knowledge (I cursed The Secret World for delaying it).  With such a lead-time, games generally will either fail to live up to the hype (possibly being objectively terrible [sorry Duke]) or be truly amazing.  I am happy to report that Dreamfall Chapters falls closer to that selective second category (a bit too early to tell if it'll stay there).  The music, voice acting and sound engineering are excellent, the graphics are beautiful (the landscape/background design particularly), the environmental details greatly amplify the realism of the unabashedly-surreal world and the writing, well, it's Ragnar Tornquist & company (need I say more?).  While the episodic format is a significant shift in pace from the earlier games, it makes sense on many levels (not the least of which being developer budget) and allows the content to remain fresh enough for multiple different playthroughs, which is more important in Chapters as the choice aspect is central to the way the story plays out.  The start is a bit abrupt if you haven't played the other games in the series, so I recommend playing through The Longest Journey and Dreamfall first (and in general), though Chapters does stand on its own.Right now it's short and sweet; highly recommended. TL; DR: Pros: Story (writing), dialogue (writing), graphics, music, voice acting, sound editing, environmental interaction, world design.Cons: Short (episode), heavily focused on previous story content (with brief synopsis), some minor clipping/finishing detail issues			"

												Okay, it's been many years in the waiting but in the end it was worth the wait.On a negative side, the game still feels like a beta quality - most importantly, the performance is not really optimized and the FPS  is poor. This is partially attributed to Unity I guess but even with that in mind I believe there's still a lot of space for optimization. Also, there are hundreds of anoying and not so annoying lesser bugs. But all of these could be easily fixed before the next chapter - so no worries here. Great game with tons of bugs is way better than a poor but polished one in my book.Other than that, things are looking pretty amazing for Dreamfall Chapters. Most importantly, so far this looks like the true TLJ game to me. The storytelling, the characters the atmosphere, the locations - all is in place and lives up to the high bar of expectations set by the original games. It seems like the team behind the game has made a solid work and clearly has an ambition of delivering the best TLJ experience possible (given, of course, the short budget they have).So far, only the first of five books (episodes) has been released. While most players seem to complete this episode in ~5 hours, it took me ~8 with all the exploration. This btw is quite long for an episodic adventure game as most of the Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us episodes are clocking in at 2-2.5 hours. So we can expect at least 25 hours of TLJ goodness for a fair price of just under $20.For those of you wondering - please don't expect Red Thread Games to charge you more for each episode. You buy the game now, pay once and get the episodes as they're ready to roll.			"

												THIS IS AN ANALYSIS FOR THE FIRST BOOK Dreamfall Chapters is a very good game with stunning voice acting and graphics but unforunately it has a poorly optimization, I hope there is a fix for the fps drop in several regions and some controllers support in the upcoming updates. The story is very interesting, I haven't played nor The Longest Journey nor Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, but you kind of get intrigued with the story, also the way the story is told, reveals you what happened before so if you haven't played previous games that doesn't make so much of a difference. In the matter of gameplay it is good for the ones that like slow paced games, in my opinion it has a lot of dialogues, that many persons would consider boring, if you're looking for shooting combat, etc. this is not the game for you, it is more like point a click game with a very good story.ConclusionIf you're looking for a game with good graphics and story for a reasonable price and you can tolerate some minor issues with the game this is totally a game for you.9/10 would recommend.

												--- Review will contain spoilers ---God I wanted to love this, but it's simply not as good as the previous two. The story is convoluted, you are constantly introduced to new ideas and concepts which are just as easily discarded ten minutes later. Most characters from the previous games are simply killed off of screen. Even April ♥♥♥♥ing Ryan only shows her face near the end of the game. Just to remind you that this is a TLJ game. Her entire original storyarch just discarded and she has like 8 lines of dialog.It's not a bad game. It's an okay game. But the story should have been its strong point and quite honestly, it's a rather generic story.			"

												Just play it.It's so good.Please.I'm not even joking about how much Iove it. I haven't even played any of the other games in the series, but I LOVE IT SO MUCH.The game itself is beautiful, with a vast range of highly interesting and lovable characters, and i feel they really bring the game alive (especially Crow. I love Crow to bits. 10/10 best bird companion ever)I also feel that the enviroments you are placed in are very immersive, and each location is just oozing personality.There is so much more I could say about this game, but my head feels like a potato right now. I wouldn't have written this review at all if I didn't feel the sudden need to gush about how much I LOVE THIS GAME. That and, I doubt half of this review has made sense so far, probably due to my head FEELING LIKE A POTATO.There.I am done.Joining the strike.Had enough of this nonesense.Going to stop before my potato head makes more of a fool out of me.What?I don't know.So, uh, yeah, great game 10/10.I think I need a moment to calm down. (BUY THE FRIGGIN GAME, IF I DIDN'T MAKE THAT CLEAR. YOU'LL PROBABLY LOVE IT. IF NOT, WELL I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY GIVEN THAT YOU ARE (PROBABLY) A HUMAN BEAN WITH YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL FREE WILL. IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU LISTENED TO SOME RANDOM PERSON IN THE REVIEWS. Frankly, I'm amazed your still reading this. You're not, did you say? Well, splendid. Probably the most sensible option. Ahem.)Ok, I'm done.No, really, I'm done.Buy the game. 10/10This is what happens when you write a steam review when you're in a potato-ish mood.I'm done.This was ridiculous.And a complete waste of both my and your time.Have a nice life, good sirs/madames/lobsters.I wish you a good life. Don't squander it.Ok, done.Bye-bye.			"

												This game absolutely rocks!There are some minor bugs but nothing game breaking. There were also some situations which needed some time to solve, but that's just part of being an adventure game.The story is really captivating, the dialog well written (and spoken) and the visuals and atmosphere absolutely great (well, the animations could need some work).All in all I can really recommend this game.

Disclaimer: I was a Kickstarter backer.We thought it couldn't get any worse than the second game. We were wrong.While the clumsy action combat is gone, in it's place is terrible writing, butchered/boring characters, and bugs to hell and back. Nearly all of the most interesting lore from TLJ is gone, and the new stuff is either dull or poorly concieved. All of the characters have the worst facial animation possible, with their lips barely moving in time with the syllables and their expressions NEVER change; they just keep staring dead-eyed straight in front of them.Unlike TLJ, which gave pretty much everything at least some explanation or snarky note from April, neither Stark nor Arcadia get the attention they deserve outside of the immediate plot. What little IS there is usually tied in to the game's ham-fisted political commentary (of course aimed at America, despite the game being developed in Poland and the half that isn't in Arcadia is in EUROPE).Almost none of the questions raised in TLJ and Dreamfall are answered, and those that are answered are done so in the laziest way possible in the last episode, as if the writers were getting ready to submit their final draft and went, ""Oh yeah, we were supposed to do that, weren't we?"" and shoved it all in in the last second. Characters' motivations and even personalities completely change between Dreamfall and this game, with absolutely no reason given.Oh yeah, it also falls for the ever lovely ""choice"" illusion so many games are doing now, and it's especially obvious that your choices don't actually mean that much. I can think of one or two that have signifigance, and even then it only applies for a few scenes and then goes away.And to cap it all off, the entire climax hinges on a Deus Ex Machina in the form of an Opinionated Alt Chick who comes out of nowhere and literally only exists to make the ending possible and to clumsily fill a plot hole that this game CREATES ON ITS OWN because writers decided they didn't want to follow their own canon.tl;dr - this game sucks, just play the first one and pretend the other two don't exist.

Morally Questionable ContentLots of moments intelegent as pornography but in its core it's still a decent story and conclusion to it that I would recommend for those Dreamfall and The Longest Journey fans that have enough patience to sit through all technical and game design silliness and can tolerate writter's wet dream lines that are scattered throughout the whole game (I suspect the level of ethics is dramatically droping and is the reason low jokes like 'rooster and kitten riding it', gay\lesbian references are considered to be normal). So DO keep that in mind if you've decided to play it yourself or to watch someone else play it on Youtube, etc., because if you prefer to stay away from morally questionable content you should consider this game as highly suspicious.

												The Longest Journey and its sequel Dreamfall are some of my favorite games.  Dreamfall Chapters continues the rich lore and storyworld first established in its predecessors and strives to provide that same level of storycraft and immersion.That said, I am not sure if a newbie to the franchise would get much out of Chapters.  So much of it, including the characters and settings, are direct continuations of Dreamfall (and The Longest Journey) that I don't think it would be very ""new user friendly"". Also, I would say it is more helpful to think of this as an interactive story or comic book on par with Telltale Game's offerings rather than a full-on video game.  In that sense, Chapters is a good successor to the point and click adventure, but it is much different than most other games today.  People looking for continuous action, open world exploration, or a handholding tutorial will be disappointed greatly as the game does one thing--narrative--and it does it well, often at the sake of other game play features.The graphics are also somewhat dated, but still quite nice.  The people look a little plastic, but the voice acting makes up for that and then some.So, all and all, I would definitely recommend Dreamfall Chapters, with the cavet that you should plan on playing The Longest Journey and Dreamfall as well or you will miss out big time.  I hope that Chapters is successful and inspires more entries in the franchise, as this is a very unique world that bears much more exploration.			"

												Amazing game. I played the 2 prequels shortly before beginning this one. They are a brilliant series. I recommend to play the 2 first games beifore this one, to fully understand the story, which can be very complex. Even if they are old games, it is really worth it.I enjoyed playing choice driven episodic games like the Telltales' one or Life is Strange, but I really think that this one is the best I've tried in this genre. Your choices seem really to matter and the game is not just an 'interactive movie' where you make decisions. There are puzzles inbetween and the game is really a crossing between a point&click and choices matter game, which I enjoy both.The universe is amazing (as I enjoyed the both previous games) and it has elements from both fantasy and sci-fi. The story is great and has a lot of plots. The characters are various and enjoyable. The graphics are beautiful and the music is nice.I'm looking forward to playing the last chapter!			"

												What a specactular experience! I am not a huge fan of the episodic format, so I played through Chapter 1, then just waited until all the other chapters were released. I'm so glad I took this path, as it made the game so much more immersive.The storyline is just beautiful. I laughed, I was scared, I felt affection for the characters... and annoyed and angry at some, and I cried. To me, the ability for a story to touch my emotions is a sign of success, a sign that the story and characters are so well crafted that they're believable, and I find that immersive.I highly recommend this for those of you who are patient and looking for a long, touching and beautiful narrative.

												Do I recommend Dreamfall Chapters? Yes, but only if you played the previous 2006 Dreamfall game and 1999’s The Longest Journey. Is it an improvement over the previous Dreamfall game? Yes. Chapters fixes the flawed gameplay of the previous installment by removing combat and stealth modes. Thus, Chapters is designed to be a bit more linear, but it still has that open world feel. It feels more like an adventure game and less like an action/adventure (like the original DF). Also, Chapters introduces a new choice system, which can affect different outcomes in the story. Overall, Chapters concludes the events from the previous installment (and even TLJ to an extent). The game is beautifully rendered and sounds great. Ragnar Tørnquist knows how to tell an engaging story. If you enjoyed the other two games you owe it to yourself to play Chapters. Here's the bad. The first couple Books are slow. Things kick up a bit around Book 3 and onwards. Also, running around everywhere can get repetitive. I’ll get straight to the point and clarify that the DF entries are inferior to the original game (TLJ). First, the DF games exclude the adventure genre elements of TLJ such as: the 2D prerendered backdrops, the wacky puzzles, and the classic point-n-click interface. Also, Zoe Castillo steals the spotlight from April Ryan. However, April is still essentially the primary focus in the DF games despite serving as a supporting character. The only thing that saves the DF games is the return of the engrossing worlds and characters Tørnquist introduced in TLJ. Otherwise, the DF games can be deemed as unnecessary as TLJ stands quite well on its own. Finally, Chapters concludes the previous installment quite well. If the true sequel to TLJ (aka TLJ Home) is ever greenlit it's essential to have April Ryan as the protagonist and return to the roots of the original. There is a big story gap between TLJ and DF that has not been told, which might serve as that true sequel fans have wanted. If Tørnquist, Red Thread Games, or Funcom can’t make this happen then I see no point in continuing from Chapters. Just play the game and you’ll see what I mean. In the meantime, the original TLJ really stands on its own and is a PC classic. If you’ve never played it, I highly recommend playing it over or prior to the Dreamfall spin-offs.			"

												This game really has the feel of an interactive novel with relatable protagonists.  Highly recommended.  Compellingly flawed and vulnerable characters explore and grow in this tale of disparate but connected worlds. Dreamfall mixes futuristic modernism with medieval fantasy in a melange of myths that will be sure to intrigue adventure game lovers. I was surprised at how the two (actually three) settings combined to make a narrative whole as the story progressed. The voiceover acting for most of the main characters is top notch. (The sidekick character seemed to not match the volume and timbre of the other characters IMHO).  Each character is distinctively defined with his or her own motivations.  The choices you make playing the two protagonists are fraught with realistic angst and ethical challenges.  There is no right answer.I liked the ability to click to see how other players decided to play each turning point--or to not click and go it without peer input.  However, I did not like that some of the decisions were timed with a very short countdown.  I was not aware this would happen at first, and some decisions were made automatically for me because I did not choose in time--not always the way I would have played it.The game has good repeat play value because of the decisions.  If you'd like to play Kian or Zoe as harsher, more fearful, more selfless, or with a more black-and-white view of moral choices, you can do so.  The curious story of the third protagonist is a bit disconnected, but in a good way. It also has very few choices.  I am curious how she fits in with the other two in the next chapters.I loved The Longest Journey but missed Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters has massive spoilers for Dreamfall, since the story is continuous--that's a *good* thing.  A caution to those unfamiliar with games released over time: the end of Book 4 is not the end of the game.  The Steam release date for Dreamfall Chapters is listed as October 2014; however, Book 4 was released December 2015.  I bought 1-4 together thinking it was a complete set and was disappointed and surprised at the unfinished ending.  There is no epilogue to indicate when I might be able to get the rest.Nonetheless, I would buy it again and can't wait for the next release.			"

												Let me start off by saying it's straight up unfair to review this as this game is not finished. I like how they release it in chapters but I would prefer if every chapter had a ""finish"" of sorts. Alas we can't get everything we want. I feel everyone who has reviewed the game based on it's story has given it an unfair review. It's like, if everyone reviewed The Longest Journey based on the first stretch or ""chapter"" of the game they would've said it was horrible. That duck on a fishing line puzzle was ridiculous.Ramble done.The choices that affect the story in Dreamfall Chapters are VERY interesting I've not had to think this hard about making one for awhile. Choosing lovers, choosing friends, dooming friends, betraying friends and killing enemies. One that sticks out to me is that you are given the option to kill a horrible person and I chose to whereas many people did not.The story is very well done. It doesn't impose it's ideas on you. It has no agenda. There is just some controversial characters in a general story with politics, drama, romance and action. As the chapters come player input is taken into account.It is the first game in a long while to give me the feeling of not knowing at all what to do. Which is one thing I remember fondly of the first game. But I enjoyed walking around the world figuring it out.Nearly every character is amazing. Shitbot is amazing.I'm excited for every new chapter and can't wait til the game is done.With the new upgrade a lot of the other concerns were fixed. I hope that all the mixed reviews don't put people off. I am enjoying this game more than even the first two. By the time this game is finished I know it will be a magnificent game.			"

												Great follow-up so far to the previous games - we're only at Book 3 at this time, still got a little more to go (five books in total, I believe).  Furthers the stories of Zoe Castillo and her involvement in Wati Corp's mind control conspiracy through dreams that is happening in Stark, the world of science and order, as well as Kian Alvane's involvement in a concurrent dream-stealing conspiracy of sorts that is occurring in the parallel world of Arcadia, the world of magic and chaos. Zoe has easily become one of my all-time favorite video game personalities since she was introduced in this game's predecessor, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey - can't get enough of her.The recently-released revamp that converts the entire game to the Unity 5 engine is a pretty significant difference. I thought the game looked great before - what a MAJOR difference in the lighting and shadowing effects this version of Unity has on offer. It's a very welcome improvement over the original iteration of the game that was built on Unity 4. Maybe it's just me, but it seems the in-game antialiasing is much more effective now as well.If you're a fan of story-driven games, decision-making consequences affecting various environment variables (similar to Telltale's Walking Dead series), and no combat, this is a great game for you. I'm a sucker for a good story, and between the three games that make up this franchise thus far, it's a damned good story.Awesome job Red Thread, and thanks for getting back to Zoe and this story overall, it's certainly a great one that needed some long-overdue progression.

												Beautiful, exquisite, engrossing. Dreamfall Chapters continues the story of Dreamfall and The Longest Journey in a beautifully rendered, exquisitely voice-acted, and engrossingly written episodic game where your choices affect the outcome and direction of the story. As with most initial releases, there are a few hiccups with FPS in various areas regardless of the player's machine configuration. The developers have been responsive and acknowledged these complaints and working towards fixes. I commend them for being responsive as they are, I've seen MANY companies drop the ball. I've only run into a few FPS issues (namely the intro movie) but seem to be fine going through Europolis (where lots of people have been complaining).I do not regret this purchase in the slightest and am eager for the upcoming chapter releases. I stand by my choice to pre-order the Special Edition (since I missed the Kickstarter campaign).			"

												Edited after the third episode is outA great start to a sequel of one the best adventure game series. Book one is about 4-5 hours long (depending how long you spend running around looking at the pretty graphics). Book two is much bigger about 8 hours and book three is about 4 again. With two more books to come its fairly evident this will be one big adventure. Game is gorgeous , has a pretty good ost, great characters and great VO (shitbot!). Story is good and the first book (or episode if you prefer) set the tone for the game great introduced a lot of characters and happenings that will become more apparent later on.  There is a lot of brancing decision wise in the game so far. Small decisions will have big impact later on you will find. Last but not least on the positive side (at least for me) is the minimalistic UI which just get out of your way so you can enjoy looking around without a permanent ui in the way. Its very contextual so mostly it's just not there and popups when there is something to interact with. Loved it. more games need stuff like this. The technical problems the game had (some low fps in europolis) when it came out have long been fixed. TLDR : Get it. If you like adventure games. Or good stories. Or people that actual behave in a believable manner (in a game about magic,shifters dreamers etc no less). Just get it. Its great.			"

												I've played this game since the beginning (The Longest Journey and then Dreamfall:The Longest Journey).  This entire series is probably the best written game ever.  No exaggeration.  The story is so rich.In Chapters, the voice acting is phenomenal, the story is engrossing, the graphics are amazing (my little laptop couldn't keep up with em, even after the Unity 5 update - but that's my own issue).Red Thread has done an amazing job rejuventaing this series - I am very impressed.  I can't WAIT to see this on console!  I hope that this game opens the door for more awesome adventure games.  Great ones like these are few and far between - so SICK of 1st person shooters! Awesome game!  I can't wait to see how this ends!			"

												I recommend the game to the fans of the series. New players may have a hard time having nostalgia tears like I did. Some lagging on Book Four, but Unity 5 makes everything smoother :D A wonderful story that keeps you wondering all the time, like me :D Beautiful, crisp locations and interesting characters. Too MANY choices, which got me seeing Balance symbols above people's heads in real life as well! Anyway, I do recommend the game, be sure to have an above average PC or laptop, as it is a pretty demanding game and on Book Four I almost gave up because of some bugs and slow movement. Totally recommended!* PLAY BOOK FIVE. The ending is simply magnificent and in true Ragnar nature, mysterious. There are explanations, a happy ending and still a few questions left for the Longest Journey Home, which I hope will be made someday. There is also a cameo that nearly brought me to tears. :DNo spoilers. Buy the game, the ending is worth everything you go through four Books.			"

												Book 5, can't hardly wait. Problem is, since there is no way to start a new save with my current data still in tact, this does somewhat pose a dilemma for me, especially since I want to go back and pick some different options. If book 5 happens to come out in a few months, well it would be nice if I can keep the info I have now. Not that getting back there would be too difficult (but it is time consuming). This game is excellent. The story is very emotive, very smart, it really does feel like your decisions have weight. I felt like it was such a weighty cliff hanger at the end of this game, very bittersweet, sad but hopeful. As a person who was not familiar with the previous games, I sort of just jumped in, based on some videos about it and other reviews. I have to say, I was not disappointed. Sometimes, there were parts, especially during book 1 & 2 where I had to think about things on some puzzles, or how to interact with an item or how I was suppose to use said item, but it's not impossible things. The vents was very tricky and I admit, I had to seek out help during that part, but I did not want to read hints on other parts of the game. I really did want to be surprised by the results. I came to the conclusion that there are a few choices which are better than others, but like most things, there's really no wrong answer. Life by its nature is reactive, it's fluid, it's changing, and this game does a great job of capturing how tough it is to know which is the right path, and is there truly a right path, rather than simply things you get caught up in sometimes? I like how this game truly makes you think about things, it's not the average cookie-cutter adventure/RPG, but it's not morbid, it's strange I'll give you that, but in a wonderful way really.I do think this game would be better served by allowing you to save different formats, instead of it rewriting over your saves. I don't honestly know why some games choose to do that, but that is always a little annoying for those of us who need to see different sides of a game, who want to get different perspectives (and perspective, isn't that mostly what life is about anyway?). But, it's still probably a minor point. I have to say that, I would have prefered some of the buildings to be a tad more interactive, just being able to go inside more places instead of only being allowed in certain areas, but I realize this was fan-backed, so I have to say in that respect, much was accomplished from that and the development team seemed to make good use of what was provided. It's a game I'm proud to say I wanted to finish, and I'm still thinking about Saga, and Zoe. I really thought that showing Saga grow from a baby to a child to a teen was really clever, it gave me a strange sense of ...wonder I guess, development did a really good job of making that baby look so very realistic, baby fat and chubby cheeks, and I loved that locket, it was so touching to see that scene, and I really felt for Saga's dad (even if he placed those wards in the first place, I'm sure he had his reasons, even if they were misguided). I loved how authenic Saga's dad's accent was, I swear he was from Dublin, who knows maybe that voice actor was haha.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Stephanie Leonidas play Zoe? I only know because I've seen mirror mask like 20 times, so you get to pick up things when you hear someone enough, anyway, it does sound like her, but not fully sure if it is. In fact, so many of the voice actors sound really authenicly UKish, you even threw in some Cockney sounding rustic gents, in the Mercuria village, like some of the farmers saying ""I'm really lookin' forward to this years fes-teee-val, I could really hear that rustic charm, it really made me laugh. I'm from America, though I have a few UK friends, but I've never been to any of the isles, but you get to know a thing or two about voices once you've heard an accent enough. Like how the people from London tend to say ""innit"", the cockney people tend to put extra S's on everything and they generally reflect a more laid back way, like people in the south in American do, though we tend to not say ""we be over there"", now we might say reckon, which is strange the similarities there. Anyway, sorry...nerd alert I like language and and literature. Anyway, I've played alot of games where the voice acting just did not sound believable, but it's really awesome in this game, closest one was perhaps Bard's Tale (but then again Cary Elwes is Welsh I believe, kind of surprised I didn't hear his voice in this, wouldn't he have also made a great Doctor therapist, wink, wink). I do like how there's different sounding nationalities, and all the languages seem hodge-podge, like some of the curses are mashed together, you saw this in Blade Runner (movie/short story), though there were quite a few Indian sounding people as well, but it really gave the future a more wider scope. Isn't it ironic in the story though, that everyone doesn't seem to make a big deal about langauge or race, in the future, it's when Kian is in his world, where people start discriminating against magicals (book 4, especially the end, reminded me of the Nazi concentration camps, to be honest... Ge'en was very believable, and I did not expect the admin of the camp to look like that, very unassuming, but isn't that how it is sometimes? Scary. I'm hoping in book 5 we'll find out what happened to Bip, he became very endearing, I almost felt bad about not telling him the truth about his parents, even though I know the game is usually ran a certain way, if I think about it psychologically, he needed to prepare himself for that death camp; it might have helped him to put up a smarter fight, though in the end he's still a boy, not superman. I really felt for his character, and I really didn't feel guilty about knowing that woman into the pit, it was quite enjoyable really, she was really sadistic, and the joke between Kian and Leiko was funny, though it makes me wonder, if you go solo ...I do wonder, does she just point the gun at Kian, and if so how would you distract her? That's part of the joy to getting more than one perspective in a game. I'll really enjoy another play through, but I'm not sure if I should wait, and maybe part 5 will come out in a few months, if that's the case I can probably wait then, but I would like to alter a few of my decisions on a next run through, since I'm fairly aware which choices are the worse ones. There are a few parts where it's simply personal choice, like about either torturing that solider or not doing it, in one instance Enu will like you, in another Leiko will dislike you (but you can redeem with him later). In this respect, it is in a similar vain as many of the Tell-tale games, however...I'll choice fantasy and sci-fi anyday over zombie/horror, perhaps because I'm more a dream than a realist, but people can display many sides sometimes, just depends on which you do/enjoy the most? I really recommend this game, especially to a buff of either genre, and I do enjoy my share of thriller titles, but I'd rather be thought-provoked, than just adrenalined all the time, I will admit Yaga's house was scary as hell though, and that really creepy feeling you get when you hear that voice (yikes), but it was only in one part of the game, so it's not like my adrenaline was high the whole time. I sort of like that, when it's used as a rare effect, but not in everything. I mean, once you get jump scared 20 times it sort of looses it's rush, and you're still getting anxiety which is not so good on the stress meter you know. A good story can win over game play, but it all matters. This game felt like just the right balace to make it immersive, in fact when you first see the sprawling city, it's easy to just be in wonder at the sheer size of it, it really felt like another world.

												Years ago, I played Dreamfall: The longest Journey on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC without much experience with PC games, and loved it, even though I barely remember the story. So I had to buy this game for nostalgia reasons. Again, I love it.The story and the really well developt characters alone makes it worthwhile and fun. The puzzles are good, there's even some tiny form of stealth in there. I expected some sort of combat like in ""The Longest Journey"", but even without that it is really fun to play.I really liked the choices, too, so far. Not all choices have big influences on the story, and because I've seen with a lot of these ""your choices matter""-games, I don't expect the ending to be completely different and influenced by everything you decided. But the NPCs give you the feeling the choices matter. Mostly it's relationships that depend on what you do, and seemingly also some lives. Also, not every choice is obvious and you'll only notice later that you actually made that choice, which is a great touch. And sometimes your choices don't matter at all, just like in real life :)I have some negative points, but those shouldn't keep you from playing this game:* The first two hours or so in the first book start off a bit slow. You run around a lot, you talk a lot, you don't really get to do that much. From a story-perspective, it makes sense, but it's very linear.* It is sometimes buggy, though I know the devs are working on it. Most bugs I've encountered fixed themselves after restarting the game.* The puzzles are linear. I would have loved to have two or three different possibilities to approach most puzzles. the levels are also quite linear, there's not much exploring to be done - which I would have loved to see in such a rich and well-developed world as this.EDIT: Oh yes, and there's a lot of swearing and genital-jokes in there! Fits the settings perfectly ;)			"

I'm not sure where it's going and even debating going back to play the first parts before continuing as I never have played the previous related titles. So yeh who knows, my opinion, I LOVE this game so far and even convincing me on the series, excellent game especially if you have the system that can make it shine that much more cause it does impress, I would say anyway;)			"

												By far the most emotion I've ever gotten playing a game, it's like the feeling of reading your favorite book or movie the moment you realize it's your favorite. But that feeling is present almost the entire duration of the game, each of the three main world spaces and their sub-areas all change as you move on, and there is a constant feeling of awe with different tones in each world.

												After so many years of believing that I'd never see a true sequel to The Longest Journey/Dreamfall, I was very excited to see this long-awaited new chapter emerge! I 've always felt that the conclusion to Dreamfall left so many unanswered questions so when Chapters came along, I had to jump right back in and see where the story would take me.Thumbs Up:- A well written continuation of the events in the previous game. Zoe feels very authentic regardless of the decisions she's faced with making. I can only assume that Kian will be given the same kind of development as the additional Chapters are released.- A fully realized environment. The layout of Propast feels filled in and lively.- Interaction with almost everything in the enviroment. Even if Zoe or Kian can't touch or use something directly, they will have thoughts and feelings to share with the player.- Continuity and nostalgia. So many story elements from the previous games are faithfully touched on and added to. There are a number of little tributes to Dreamfall and The Longest Journey if you know where to look!- Every decision counts. I particularly like this feature. It makes doing multiple playthroughs worthwhile.- An AMAZING soundtrack. So much of the score is just brilliantly done and it does a great job of conveying the story without being overbearing.- Driven by narrative. Chapters definitely covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time. It feels like a really good book or TV show. However, as it does not feature combat (so far), this may not be everyone's cup of tea.Thumbs Down:- Some of the voice acting is a little hard to listen to. Additionally, the amount vulgar language just seems to be overkill. A little bit can add spice and depth to a character. Too much just makes them uninteresting.- Some of the puzzles and goals could stand to have a bit more explanation to them. I'm not talking outright hand-holding, but a gentle nudge or exposition could go a long way. Especially if you're negotiating between two people...- Many of the NPC are too identical. Repitions in hairstyle and clothing tend to break up the immersion, unfortunately.- Optmization issues. Even with settings at the lowest, this game could suffer from framerate issues on some machines. The is VERY noticeable in Propast.Overall:This is a worthy sequel. It feels finished and fully fleshed out. I'm enjoying it immensely and I cannot wait to see what happens next.			"

												I have a great expectation with this game, I played The Longest Journey and the Dreamfall: The Longest Journey after I played the first book of the Dreamfall Chapters. The game, in my opinion, is very unique, the Red Thread had a great ability to develop an engaging and at the same time very deep narrative storyline. The description of the game as a game that marries ""cyberpunk universe with medieval fantasy"" very unfair. He is more than that. I try to set it in a nutshell as a game that provokes reflection on the notion of each person on their commitment to society. And does it with elements - for me - other than the ""blockbusters"": empowered women characters and protagonists in the unfolding of the story enventos. Let's see how the story ends..			"

												Chapter one was great did 7/7 achievements the first night, meaning I played it all the way through in one night... twice lol.  It definitely gives warm and fuzzy feeling to TLJ fans, as I have played since the beginning.  I played all the games through several times.  One of my favorite series.  My only complaint is the language used when speaking to the only mentally disabled NPC ever to be represented in the series.  It was sort of offensive to a mother with a child with autism.So now we are on book 4.  Feels like I'm having my hand held through the entire book.  Not very challenging and very easy in comparison to the original TLJ playthrough.  Are games getting too easy, that's the question of the decade? :D			"

												Iv'e been waiting for Dreamfall Chapters to come out since the last game ended on a cliff hanger. and so far it does not dissapoint!. (there thats for fans of the series)For newcommers, Dreamfall Chapters is a 3D adventure game in the manner of Walking Dead and many of the old point and click games from the early years of video games on PC.Now Ill say this now. you should play The Longest Journey: Dreamfall before you play this game (you do not have to play The Longest Journey but its got some usefull backstory and can help expand your appreciation of the world) now you do not have to in order to enjoy the game but it will have that much more meaning and you will really understand the characters and events at the start of the game if you have finished the earlier game.on with the rest of the review:What sets this game apart from its forebears is that it has a tree based structure to its storyline. so for each choice you make there is a real consequence. Now thats the claim from Red Thread the studio responsible for the game. As there is only the first part of the game available, it remains to be seen how extensive this system of choices is, but after some time playing the first book and trying every choice I could make. I am fairly confident that the game will deliver in its promises with upcomming episodes.The game uses two choice systems, one is the Balance system a set of events that have a coinflip answer, where the resulting choice greatly effects future outcomes for the character. the other is a walking dead esque system where characters remember your reactions to various events and these are taken into account with future conversations and events.while many of the choices and events presented provided numerous choices and possibilities, there were very few choices available that had immediate results. I am greatly looking forward to the second book to see how these choices pan out. Now, it would be remiss of me to not mention some current issues with the game:It has some known graphical bugs and issues with resource usage they are working on fixes for.( they fixed the large framerate drop happening in Europolis and other areas)Some people are having crashes and freezes (not me but some people are)The save game system needs work because it just makes a ton of autosave files without any sensible naming system or organisation.(only an issue if you want to try a different response or load a non current game)The game is mainly about making choices and solving puzzles, this in future will include things like stealth and probably some light combat. but it will be unlikely that combat will be particularly reflex intensive or action oriented.Characters in the dream world seem to have various powers so a kind of magic is also featured in the game in certain areas.Will you enjoy this game?If you liked games like myst, the stanley parable, any older point and click adventure  you will love this game.if your into combat and violence, you may still enjoy it but it will feel slow and boring due to long heavy dialogue sequences and alot of travelling.I love what they have done with dreamfall chapters and am looking forward to the next chapter to see how far they will go.

												One of the best games I've ever played. After eight long years waiting for the sequel for the marvelous Dreamfall and The longest journey, I started to doubt whether there would be any sequel at all, but here it is: Dreamfall Chapters. Thanks to the choice and consequence thing I care even for more for the characters, especially Zoe. I can honestly recommend this game to anyone who likes good stories. This story keeps me wanting more. I just can't get enough of this game, I've played it so many times, it's amazing how your choices shape your path. The graphics and music are just amazing. And as for the voice actors, they are brilliant, all of them, however my favorite is Zoe, probably because she, together with April, is my favorite character. There are so minor bugs, but really when you immerse yourself in this story, they just don't mean a thing... at least to me. Red Thread Games, I love you for this game :). edit: The book three is out! :D I love it, it's the best one, just amazing, and exactly when I thought that this game can't get any more awesome. It proved me wrong. LOVE IT!Update: Book four proved me wrong again. It's doubtlessly the best one but I guess book five will be even better :D. The worst thing about this game is waiting but I love it so much that I can do it. :) Also, I guess I've changed my mind a lot regarding the characters. Yes, Zoe is still awesome! :) But I care very much about Saga and Kian too. They're all one of the best characters I've ever encountered in a game :). If you are still considering, just play it, it is worth it			"

												Amazing game. I played the 2 prequels shortly before beginning this one. They are a brilliant series. I recommend to play the 2 first games beifore this one, to fully understand the story, which can be very complex. Even if they are old games, it is really worth it.I enjoyed playing choice driven episodic games like the Telltales' one or Life is Strange, but I really think that this one is the best I've tried in this genre. Your choices seem really to matter and the game is not just an 'interactive movie' where you make decisions. There are puzzles inbetween and the game is really a crossing between a point&click and choices matter game, which I enjoy both.The universe is amazing (as I enjoyed the both previous games) and it has elements from both fantasy and sci-fi. The story is great and has a lot of plots. The characters are various and enjoyable. The graphics are beautiful and the music is nice.I'm looking forward to playing the last chapter!			"

												What a specactular experience! I am not a huge fan of the episodic format, so I played through Chapter 1, then just waited until all the other chapters were released. I'm so glad I took this path, as it made the game so much more immersive.The storyline is just beautiful. I laughed, I was scared, I felt affection for the characters... and annoyed and angry at some, and I cried. To me, the ability for a story to touch my emotions is a sign of success, a sign that the story and characters are so well crafted that they're believable, and I find that immersive.I highly recommend this for those of you who are patient and looking for a long, touching and beautiful narrative.

												What I like:This game has a fantastic story and pretty good graphics/dialog/atmosphere. Choices that you make affect the story and it's really well made. There hasn't been a game recently that sucked me in and made me want to keep playing as much as this one.What I don't like:Some of the puzzles are hard or frustrating. Some you have to walk around aimlessly looking for ""something"" until you stumble upon something you can pick up. Then comes finding where to use it...Overall, this game is definitely worth buying for the story and the experience as a whole. I don't mind shift-tabbing to look at a walkthrough every now and then to get to the next cutscene or choice. Because of this, i'll give it an 8.5/10 until the last book comes out.			"

												Do I recommend Dreamfall Chapters? Yes, but only if you played the previous 2006 Dreamfall game and 1999’s The Longest Journey. Is it an improvement over the previous Dreamfall game? Yes. Chapters fixes the flawed gameplay of the previous installment by removing combat and stealth modes. Thus, Chapters is designed to be a bit more linear, but it still has that open world feel. It feels more like an adventure game and less like an action/adventure (like the original DF). Also, Chapters introduces a new choice system, which can affect different outcomes in the story. Overall, Chapters concludes the events from the previous installment (and even TLJ to an extent). The game is beautifully rendered and sounds great. Ragnar Tørnquist knows how to tell an engaging story. If you enjoyed the other two games you owe it to yourself to play Chapters. Here's the bad. The first couple Books are slow. Things kick up a bit around Book 3 and onwards. Also, running around everywhere can get repetitive. I’ll get straight to the point and clarify that the DF entries are inferior to the original game (TLJ). First, the DF games exclude the adventure genre elements of TLJ such as: the 2D prerendered backdrops, the wacky puzzles, and the classic point-n-click interface. Also, Zoe Castillo steals the spotlight from April Ryan. However, April is still essentially the primary focus in the DF games despite serving as a supporting character. The only thing that saves the DF games is the return of the engrossing worlds and characters Tørnquist introduced in TLJ. Otherwise, the DF games can be deemed as unnecessary as TLJ stands quite well on its own. Finally, Chapters concludes the previous installment quite well. If the true sequel to TLJ (aka TLJ Home) is ever greenlit it's essential to have April Ryan as the protagonist and return to the roots of the original. There is a big story gap between TLJ and DF that has not been told, which might serve as that true sequel fans have wanted. If Tørnquist, Red Thread Games, or Funcom can’t make this happen then I see no point in continuing from Chapters. Just play the game and you’ll see what I mean. In the meantime, the original TLJ really stands on its own and is a PC classic. If you’ve never played it, I highly recommend playing it over or prior to the Dreamfall spin-offs.			"

												The Longest Journey is back after so many years of waiting, and i couldn't be happier to experience it again, i played both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall when they came out years ago and i got hooked on the fantastical but mature story, the awesome characters and the comedy (oh my god the comedy, despite some dark events TLJ and Dreamfall never ceased being funny and witty and to a great effect.Now let's see what we have here, the long awaited continuation of the Dreamfall story, Zoe's story, i can't deny i'm a big fan of April and adore her character but Zoe too grew on me, not as much as April but she has her charm too (sadly her sweet accent from Dreamfall is absent her due to VA change but no big deal really as the voice acting overall is still fantastic), the story of Dreamfall Chapters picks up right where Dreamfall:TLJ left us hanging, and it is clear that that the graphics got a major upgrade (which is always welcome, and it was funny when i saw they called the highest graphics option ""Awesome"" instead of Ultra or something else boring, that was funny XD), Zoe looks a little different after spending some time in the realm of dreams but it's good to see her again and resolve her dilemma early on instead of dragging it on and on.Now the real highlight is the gameplay, gone are the clunky combat/stealth sequences from Dreamfall:TLJ and now the game actually evolved and adapted new mechanics from the best storytellers in gaming now (hint hint, yeah Telltales), and i love they added their own spin to the mechanics, first you can hear the character's own thoughts before you pick a dialog choice .. not only does it give a chance for the voice actors to further flesh out the characters but also gives us insight into their mindsets, there is also the fact they highlight the important critical choices that will impact the story and let you know what other players chose before you pick your choice ... also .. i was surprised to see The Witcher 2 level of boldness where they block and entire section of the game based on a choice you make early on (now that's some consequence i'd like to see more often, but it's probably why some people might think the episode was short), oh .. and the witty humor that made the TLJ games so much fun is back .. loads of it .. Zoe now is reaching April's level of wittiness with snarky remarks and snappy witty jokes which is great since we don't get much of April in ep1 (won't spoil it more than that), IMO the length of the episode is spot on and the back and forth between Kian and Zoe was nice for sake of variety ... some people are complaining about lack of complex puzzles but i have to disagree, the puzzles here are simple and story relevant in a good way, so while i kinda enjoyed the tough puzzles of The Longest Journey some of them were too hard and ruined the pacing of the game when you spent too much time trying to figure out how to solve them .. i managed to finish them all without any online guides (except one early puzzle that required some pixel hunting), so i'm glad the focus is on the story this time, if i wanted to play a puzzle game i'd go play Portal 2 or The Talos Principle.Oh, and there is that sweet surprise at the end, although only players of TLJ will know its full significance and recognize the location but either way it's still very intriguing and interesting section that i didn't expect at all .. adds lots of mystery and makes me so eager to play the next episode.To sum it up: +The return of one of the best adventure games out there, Telltales have a serious competitor now.+Lovely graphics and attention to details that makes exploring the world a real joyful video/audio experience.+Fantastic top notch Voice acting and music.+Evolved dialog/choice story driven gameplay, simple puzzles that don't get in the way of the story.+Moves the story onward resolving plot points while also leaving Lots of mystery and anticipation for the fans to speculate on. -Some minor graphical hiccups and frame-rate drops-It is better if you play the previous games first as some of things might not make sense.Overall i'm very satisfied with the first episode and didn't regret buying this one bit, specially after waiting for so many years to continue the story, go buy it and do yourself a favor and play the older games as well, despite any problems they have (first game looking outdated, and 2nd game having some cumbersome mechanics) they are still excellent adventure games and a truly an forgettable journey.

												To keep this review short and sweet with no spoilers all I will say is the voice acting is amazing, the game is beautiful, and the gameplay is easy to control. Anyone can play this game even without playing the previous ones, and I love how choices can make up whether you go this direction of the game, or a completely different direction. Definitely would recommend to anyone and can't wait until Chapter Two!

Like, you can actually see how your choices affect the world around you. ...Might see, but hoping for the best with Rebels!			"

												Love this game. The trilogy in all is amazing, and Dreamfall Chapters doesn't disappoint. I feel like I have been waiting for this to come out forever. Very story-rich told by two characters. Zoe Castillo from ""the real world"" (although far more advanced than our word) is a complex character from the previous game, growing and dealing with difficult worlds. Kian Alvane, (also from the previous game) from the magical world, is also a deep, strong charcter. This game is not just for looks, although it definately looks beautiful. Your choices in the story actually mean something and change the story for better or for worse.  This game and the characters in it are like a good book you can't put down. You should play the previous games or at least Dreamfall before playing this.			"

												I played The Longest Journey and TLJ: Dreamfall and despite their faults I loved them. Though i only just completed chapter 4, so far I can say the same about Dreamfall Chapters. It is a beautiful and well written game that continues directly from where TLJ:Dreamfall left off. Characters will sometimes remember conversations and decisions you make will have consequences later on in the game, ranging from meaninful to hardly mattering at all (I still don't know what all the consequences might be yet). It's a nice touch no matter how much impact this has ultimately on the story as i find myself thinking more about who Zoe and Kian are and who I want them to become, or at least how they get there (which when your telling a story is more important).

												I like it a lot. The futuristic city is very immersive and the story is pretty interesting. As for the other story line set in like a skyrim type world, its okay, but I could probably do without it. Overall it s a pretty good game, but at time specifically with some quests or objectives, it lacks a bit of direction as to where you need to go or exactly what you should do. Which usually results in you running around for quite some time. And last, I have to say it. Whoever drew Zoe Castillo gave  her so much♥♥♥♥♥ It's like unbelievably fat. That may be part of the reason why I prefer the futuristic city storyline more. She is unbelievably hot. The accent gets a little old though.			"

												I just finished Book One today. Overall, the story has been fascinated and easy to follow. There are references to Dreamfall The Longest Story, but you can understand the story line even if you haven't played the previous games yet (I haven't). The puzzles are straightforward, I don't find them struggling since there is always an obvious clue nearby. This has given more time to enjoy the story. About the cutscenes, I wish the conversation could go a bit faster, but if you're not in a rush, it's the right pace to get yourself familiar with the story. Visual: I would say I haven't got to the highest quality yet but the game already looked quite awesome. The level of details that go into this game is somewhat the best I have played with so far. Having playing the dark and twisty Book One, I would hope that the later books would be lighted up a bit. I want to see more of the sun :D.Audio: You first listen to the voice in the head of Zoe, then the others, then bam! Here come the voice of the Vagabond, can someone tell me who voiced him? I think I felt in love with that voice. And yes, the rest is properly done, can't really say if anyone else's voice has made that much of the impression to me as the Vagabond's. The background music is sufficient, not bad but not very noticing when you're running to find and talk to people.Control: At first, I think the camera is a bit odd, but then I grow used to it. However, there is too much camera movement needed everytime we need to use the mouse click to something. Just my opinion.Bug: Sometimes I can't talk to some characters (like those at the Chinatown). Does it happen to everyone? Or just me?I would definitely reccommend this game to my friends and be awaiting for the next book to be out. Loving it more and more!			"

												Dreamfall Chapters in my opinion is a nice game and I would recommend it. 16 years after the first part ""the longest journey"" this is a decent and worthy sequel.Its worth a playthrough and if you are a fan of the series even more.Some of my experiences:- Controls are better with a controler then with keyboard.- The graphics and models are not really up to date for a modern graphic novel game. Thats one of the few negative parts of this game. But like (for example) Life is strange, wich also lacks with better graphics, the story is the more important part and you have to focus on that. - The Character impression sometimes feels like controlling a robot talking to other robots. No Lip sync at all, and almost no facial expressions of any character. Thats really annoying in times of good graphic engines and little unhyped games doing a better job. Feels like playing a 10years old game with better graphics. So almost every dialog you have to watch looks like this: Robot1: BaBaBa Ba Ba, Robot2: Ba BaBa BaBa Ba- Sometimes models look like they've seen a scary ghost, but convulsive try to follow their role. That really ruins the atmosphere sometimes, but all in all it is negligible.- Some of the city areals are some kind of sterile and you have to overlook that sometimes.All in all, after some playing time, all this little flaws feel a little bit annoying, but when you concentrate on the story its ok and the game is nice.

												Trying to run this with an older PC, but within the min. requirements - Book One runs (mostly) okay but Book Two crashes all over the place with 32-bit Windows, to the point where I can't get through it, even with the graphics settings completely dumbed down.   Too bad, it's very good and lives up to the original TLJ.Recommended for fans of the series with at least the minimum system requirements and probably 64-bit version of Windows for PC users.  UPDATE: Reinstalling Windows as 64-bit helped a lot.  Runs OK even on medium quality.  First time I had to do that with a recent game, though.			"

Thats what happend in this game visuals are pleasent to see and move around the places which are available doing all kind of errands for ton of people. With out having any combat action for the characters there was a nice workaround those things. overall a nice game to play for all kinds of casual gamers.Story Rich, Patience, Beautiful Visuals...waiting for next book.

Welding...PROS: Beautiful graphics; Very good story; Very good voice acting; Great soundtrack; Some of the decisions you make affects the story; Very nice characters; The game is replay worthy The game is pretty long, about 25-30 hours for the first playthrough.CONS: The video performance is not perfect, the game is not optimized good enough. There are frame drops in some places, like closed locations in Europolis, or big open spaces in Mercuria; Some of the characters flicker in the cut-scenes; The player can not skip some of the cut-scenes; The map of Europolis is somewhat confusing but one gets used to it after awhile.Recommended! 9/10!

												This is a piece of art. True, it has more from an interactive film than a classic adventure since inventory and item usage only occur sparingly throughout the game. Yet still, this is a must-play. Chapters looks drop-dead gorgeous on modern hardware, sometmes the graphics look like painted. It is funny yet also has a lot darker, mature tendencies like addressing fascism and genocide. It can feel oppressing at later stages. For me it's an emotional rollercoaster ride for mature gamers and I'm proud  to be a backer of it. Maybe you need a certain degree of empathy to fully appreciate this game. And do yourself a favor, at least try playing it in English if you're not native. The voiceovers are great except that of Na'ane.I'll probably go back to TLJ and Dreamfall TLJ some time in the future to fully grasp the story arc. Yet questions remain since in my view the TLJ/April arc is not fully finished.As I said the only negative, if you will, can be that it transcends the classical adventure genre (which, to be honest, Dreamfall TLJ already did).

												The Longest Journey is probably one of the best Point & Click adventure games ever made, allying great character development, astounding world-building and a sensational feeling of being in a fairytale. Dreamfall clumsily tried to implement fighting sequences and at the same time expand the scale of the first game with three playable characters instead of a single one. I appreciated the developer’s effort and like many was left thunderstruck by the final cliffhanger and so like every worldwide fan of the series, I was happy to pay for the kickstarted episodic sequel: Dreamfall Chapters.After finishing the final chapter of the game, I feel conflicted. On one hand, I really wanted to love DC as I am already in love with the setting and the characters. On the other hand, the game is just not very... fun to play and lost what made the prequels so interesting in the first place. Gameplay-wise, the game has ""lite-adventure"" mechanics à la Telltale Games: minimal inventory, minimal interactions and rich dialogue paths replaced by ""important"" decisions affecting the next chapters. The first two chapters' pace is dreadful and a map button to navigate is nowhere to be seen! The in-game maps are kinda terrible too. The third character's segments consist of hidden objects searches, which is quite frankly boring. Characters' inner monologues are usually funny and a nice touch but that's about it. I never feel challenged or interested in the gameplay and ended focusing only on the story itself.Story starts as intriguing asking many essential questions about the setting and the relationship between Arcadia & Stark. Unfortunately, as it unfolds it drops the ball. Instead of antagonists, we get cardboard like cliches and the crux of the plot turns into a generic mambo-jumbo of cosmic balance. Main characters personalities seems to change from episode to episode (and not by the player's own twisted hand). The new playable character felt like a cheap addition too. One might say that it kinda IS her point but it felt too disjointed from Kian's and Zoe's driving goals and ends up a cheap Deus Ex Machina.Not everything is bad obviously, far from it. Developers tried to do their best with the tight budget and offer a great art direction, excellent voice-acting and neat music. Some set pieces are great and I finally got the closure I wanted. The epilogue is a nice touch all in all. I shed my little tear.All in all, I feel like the episodic structure and the presence of three playable characters just kill the game. You don't have time to grow attached, you don't have time to care as you go from obvious story twists to dramatic cutscenes and other expository dumps. The scale was too big for embracing the Telltale structure, which is more akin to pulp literature and comics than lengthy enthralling fairy-tales/coming-of-age stories like TLJ/Dreamfall.In France, we have a saying ""Whatever the flask, provided that one gets the drunkenness"". I got my drunkenness alright but it was a cheap vodka-orange in a plastic cup.			"

												A fine ending to the series begun with the Longest Journey. I've logged about 44 hours, which I think included about two playthroughs of at least chapters 1-3, so I'd estimate all 5 chapters take about 20-25 hours to play through. Although the story is engrossing and the artwork is beautiful, it is a little buggy, and the gameplay is a little thin, leaving it more like a lightly interactive TV series than a game. If you liked the Longest Journey or Dreamfall, it is worth picking Dreamfall Chapters up.			"

												I've been a very big fan of any decision making game. Life is Strange, Heavy Rain, etc. I even loved how your choices throughout the Dragon Age series effects the future games in a way. But I feel this game takes it to a whole new level. In many choice based games you end up feeling that the final decision makes all the choices in between fell pointless. So not to spoil the game, I will leave out the name, but one has a final decision of saving one or sacrificing that one to save everyone else, and despite the toughness of the decision, you may or may not feel like being nice to everyone else, or mean, or accusatory, was completely trivial since they're just dead.However, in Dreamfall, you feel like every decision will not only effect you, but a person you care about too. And the effect of some decisions will make you think ""Did I just trade a good friend's life for a good friend's life?"" Rather than choosing a lesser of two evils, you feel you need to pick between two equally bad decisions that can put people in jeopardy. You end up feeling like if you reload and change your decision, you might hurt someone else just as badly. So rather than a traditional ""choice based"" game it in turn seems to be more of a ""punishment for your actions"" most of the time. Even ordering the lunch in episode one seemed to have more of a consequence and visible change in the relationship between your character and other characters, even though you look at it and think ""ordering lunch is such a trivial decision, why did they add it?"" But it has a lasting effect. I'd compare this to watering your plant in Life is Strange, correct me if I'm wrong please, but that action seemed to be pointless. I don't remember in my few playthroughs of that having an actual effect, other than the plant sprouting, but I could be wrong.Now I understand the premise of those other games I mentioned, listed and left out, are different, but I just feel like this is a game where you feel like every decision actually has a lasting effect. Not just on the lives of others, but relationships too. Sometimes you feel like ""I'm making progress with this character, he/she is starting to like me"" but unfortunate circumstances rip them out of your character's life. And other decisions you made that didn't seem like the; lets call it a line of cause and effect, I'll refer to it as a line, so think of it like a string, it doesn't seem like that line of decision making would matter with other lines, but suddenly, those lines intertwined and start having an effect on one another.The game makes you realize something that's not just true in some games, but is true in everyday life, things you say and do, no matter how trivial it may seem, mayeffect the people around you, not always physically, but how they look at you or your relationship with them, whether a friendship or otherwise.Now as for the game's premise. I played the first two games as well, and despite everyone's *****ing and moaning about the second game in the series, I've enjoyed the whole series and world. I feel since the first game, it's gotten deeper with more of a depiction of social issues but in the past and present. And that makes it feel that much more realistic. I never could've imagined just how interesting a story about ""dreaming"" could be until I found these games. The rivalry of ""science and faith"" that is ever so present in modern culture. The ""crusades"" that are talked about and in motion in the final game. And a very ""1984"" type feel to it at times. The list could continue for the points of the game that could relate to history or the present, but some of those would spoil, so I won't continue.I know that people were upset with the structure of the second game, ""the story"" was not good enough, ""not the same gameplay style"" I've seen somewhere about it. I think that one may refer to it not being point and click. Yes, it's too bad that now you have to use TWO HANDS to play a game. Partially. However I thought it was a great lead in to this game. And you have to realize, the first was made in 1999, the second in 2006 (correct me if either years are wrong) as technology advances, the game does too or it could get left behind. I hope everyone one who plays the game judges the whole series rather than individual parts, as I think it's a masterpiece when played. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes story, choices and some puzzles to be predominant in a game.I am ecstatic for the last book and eagerly await.If I made an error with the information of something I mentioned. Correct me please.			"

												This game has one of the best stories I've played through in a very long time.When I Purchased this I didn't even know there was a previous game. Whilst I'm sure part of that game set some of the tone from the start that was only implied in this one I didn't feel like I'd missed out on too much between the recap and the bits of dialogue that explained the world as I played through this one.The characters are believable and interesting, and the decisions from Chapter 1 onwards have affects on how the final chapter plays out. In fact, The final chapter doesn't even give you any choices, the entire final chapter is a single destiny decided by your previous actions.I finished last night at 21 hours play time, and that was just the one playthrough (although there were moments when I got stuck) I never left the game playing for any significant amount of time. In my eyes thats a lot of high quality story content for my money.It's difficult to endorse something without spoiling anything about the story. Especially when the thing that amazed me most was the depth itself of that story. I will say that whilst I have a lot of games in my steam library, the 10 hour mark is about the average playtime for a ""good game"" in my eyes before I discover something else to do (with a couple of exceptions) So for this game to keep me engrossed even as I had to wait for new episodes to come out until I finished it is a testement to how much I enjoyed and looked forwards to each chapter.There were a couple of times when I did need to use a walkthrough to finish this, and there were a couple of graphical anomalies during utscenes (people turning around impossibly quickly before walking away, or suddenly appearing after the camera was facing that direction) that kinda hurt immersion, but I don't feel they were numerous enough to count against the plot. That said, they're worth mentioning, because if those things do really put you off games then it may affect your decision to buy.			"

												Wow, this has definately been the longest journey game-wise =)Excellent graphics, music and captivating stories, with so much going on and choiches that impact how the story goes or at least changes your path toweards the end.My sister and I played through the first game (the swedish dubbed version) back in 2001 or something like that. I remember we took turns doing all the puzzles and it really felt like a good modern point'and'click adventure.When Dreamfall came I decided to get both that and the english version of the first game to play through again on my own. I remember I thought the second game had too few puzzles and felt more like an interactive movie, but the story was still good and captivating.Then came the years of waiting for funding for a followup and thanks to kickstarter it happened. I have been playing Dreamfall Chapters on and off for a year or more now and it has been a really good experience.They have added in more puzzles like in the first game, but still maintained the cut scene style gaming of the second in a perfect combination.I highly recommend getting all the games and playing through them =)			"

												Even though I played through this game within a period of 24 hours once episode five came out, the build and storyline is def one of my favorites and I really wish it wasn't over from the Longest Journey up until the last book Dream Chapters it is amazing to see how the story really comes together in the end <3			"

												!0/10!Very impressed with the game! The ending was an epic conclusion to a great triology of games!If you have played any of the other Longest Journey/Dreamfall games you NEED to play this.For newcommers to the series, you can play this game without prior knowledge and have a great time too!It's not the typical episodic game following the telltale formula. The episodes are much longer and does not have timed dialogue and button-mashing quick time events.			"

Thats what happend in this game visuals are pleasent to see and move around the places which are available doing all kind of errands for ton of people. With out having any combat action for the characters there was a nice workaround those things. overall a nice game to play for all kinds of casual gamers.Story Rich, Patience, Beautiful Visuals...waiting for next book.

												Dreamfall Chapters fills a hole that’s long been in many gamer’s hearts, continuing the story of Zoe Castillo that felt like it was cut abruptly short at the end of the previous game. It might not have next generation graphics or play as smoothly as some other adventurers other there however it makes up for it with one of the best dialogue systems I have seen in recent times. It will be interesting to see how the player choices pan out in the greater story as they’re making a big deal about player agency and I hopeful that they will be able to deliver on it. Dreamfall Chapters really is only for fans of the series but should your interest be piqued I would heartily recommend making the investment to play through its predecessors.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/11/07/dreamfall-chapters-book-one-the-balance-has-shifted/ "

												On the whole, I found Dreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey – Book 1: Rebirth to be very well done though it was lacking in a couple places. The length at 3 hours was somewhat disappointing as one would have hoped for something more around 5 hours per Book to tell the story and explore especially with 2 protagonists and worlds to go through. The short run time sadly is most notable in Kian’s story where the world he’s in isn’t allowed to establish itself – who the Azadi are, what world this is and such aren’t allowed time to be seen. The lack of the interactive story recap at this point is also most notable here, as while it helps inform on Zoë it is much more essential to having any grounding in the Arcadia plot.Full Review: http://techraptor.net/content/dreamfall-chapters-storytime "

												Dreamfall Chapters continues the story where Dreamfall: The Longest Journey left us, and does so with beautiful characters, inspiring environments, and a plot to make any science fiction and/or fantasy fan lose their grip on reality. This game tugs at my heart strings, and I find myself completely immersed by the characters and their relationships. I've been following the Dreamfall series for over 10 years, and in my opinion, it is the only series I'm willing to wait this long for (8 years since 'Dreamfall: The lonest Journey' & 14 years since 'The Lonest Journey'). I cannot wait for Book Two. I know it's going to be magical :)			"

												Review of Book One:From begeining to end this is short...Too short and the jail area is just very poor. Game looks a decade behind the times. Mouth movement is very off and choppy. That is until you get to Zoe and her city. This looks a lot better but the game runs so glitchy. Crashed a few times on me and often the system stops to catch up to you. This has a very very poor unpolished feel. However when your standing still or walking slow the game does look very good. I feel more interactions could have been worked into the city area. A mini map would be a god send as the city map system is very hard to clearly understand as its vague. All in all I love the story and the landscape graphics are good the people could use alot more work. I think mouth movement could be stopped all together and it create a better feel. It would be old school but at least a better old school.I am only glad that for the money your going to get all the chapters and not have to fork over more each time. That would end things right there for me.			"

												It's hard to properly express how I feel about this... I have waited over 8 years for the continuation of this story that has meant more to me than any other story ever told. The wait is finally over, and it seems it has been worth it! Seeing these amazingly well written characters again is like being reunited with old friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a lover of good stories, even non-gamers.Disclaimer: This review only covers impressions from book 1.So... About the game. If you are looking for a fast paced game with a good combat system, this game is not for you. There is no combat. If you are easily offended this game is probably not for you either. It is a mature game, and characters in it reflect the wide variety of people you find in the real world. There are offensive characters. There is profanity. It is relatable. On the topic of characters, that's one area where this game truly shines! The characters you meet feel genuine, they feel complex. Real. This is a reflection of the overall fantastic writing which is revealing a thought provoking, deep and mature yet magical story. The dialogue alone had me laugh out loud on several occasions, while other moments pulled at my heartstrings. Of course this is only book one, but it is clear that great things are set in motion already.About choices. Choices make up a key aspect of the actual game-play. They are difficult! Generally there are no obvious good vs. evil choices. Most are morally grey. But they do impact your story in important ways. To help you make the choice you will hear the PC's inner though process as you mouse over each choice. This very effectively serves the dual purpose of letting you get to know the characters better while helping you guess at what the PC will say.This game is visually stunning. Sure, if you compare it to the flashiest of the AAA next-gen titles you might find the graphics a bit lacking. But the artstyle is fantastic and it is clear that the world has been crafted with a careful eye for detail. The two worlds of Stark and Arcadia feature very distinct styles, yet there is a cohesiveness that tie them together.The Soundtrack is simply amazing amazing. There is one spot in Europolis where you will find a crowd of NPCs around a musician, and I found myself standing around for a few minutes just listening. But even the music coming out of radios, night clubs and the ""atmospheric"" music is all highly effective and does a great job of underlining the impact of the story. The voice acting is also absolutely superb. Better even than most AAA titles I have played. I must admit it took some getting used to the new voice for Zoe, but she does such a good job I quickly got over it.TL:DR - If you love a good story and great characters, buy it. The interactions with Shitbot alone are worth it.			"

												What I like:This game has a fantastic story and pretty good graphics/dialog/atmosphere. Choices that you make affect the story and it's really well made. There hasn't been a game recently that sucked me in and made me want to keep playing as much as this one.What I don't like:Some of the puzzles are hard or frustrating. Some you have to walk around aimlessly looking for ""something"" until you stumble upon something you can pick up. Then comes finding where to use it...Overall, this game is definitely worth buying for the story and the experience as a whole. I don't mind shift-tabbing to look at a walkthrough every now and then to get to the next cutscene or choice. Because of this, i'll give it an 8.5/10 until the last book comes out.			"

Definitely would recommend to anyone and can't wait until Chapter Two!

												The Longest Journey is back after so many years of waiting, and i couldn't be happier to experience it again, i played both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall when they came out years ago and i got hooked on the fantastical but mature story, the awesome characters and the comedy (oh my god the comedy, despite some dark events TLJ and Dreamfall never ceased being funny and witty and to a great effect.Now let's see what we have here, the long awaited continuation of the Dreamfall story, Zoe's story, i can't deny i'm a big fan of April and adore her character but Zoe too grew on me, not as much as April but she has her charm too (sadly her sweet accent from Dreamfall is absent her due to VA change but no big deal really as the voice acting overall is still fantastic), the story of Dreamfall Chapters picks up right where Dreamfall:TLJ left us hanging, and it is clear that that the graphics got a major upgrade (which is always welcome, and it was funny when i saw they called the highest graphics option ""Awesome"" instead of Ultra or something else boring, that was funny XD), Zoe looks a little different after spending some time in the realm of dreams but it's good to see her again and resolve her dilemma early on instead of dragging it on and on.Now the real highlight is the gameplay, gone are the clunky combat/stealth sequences from Dreamfall:TLJ and now the game actually evolved and adapted new mechanics from the best storytellers in gaming now (hint hint, yeah Telltales), and i love they added their own spin to the mechanics, first you can hear the character's own thoughts before you pick a dialog choice .. not only does it give a chance for the voice actors to further flesh out the characters but also gives us insight into their mindsets, there is also the fact they highlight the important critical choices that will impact the story and let you know what other players chose before you pick your choice ... also .. i was surprised to see The Witcher 2 level of boldness where they block and entire section of the game based on a choice you make early on (now that's some consequence i'd like to see more often, but it's probably why some people might think the episode was short), oh .. and the witty humor that made the TLJ games so much fun is back .. loads of it .. Zoe now is reaching April's level of wittiness with snarky remarks and snappy witty jokes which is great since we don't get much of April in ep1 (won't spoil it more than that), IMO the length of the episode is spot on and the back and forth between Kian and Zoe was nice for sake of variety ... some people are complaining about lack of complex puzzles but i have to disagree, the puzzles here are simple and story relevant in a good way, so while i kinda enjoyed the tough puzzles of The Longest Journey some of them were too hard and ruined the pacing of the game when you spent too much time trying to figure out how to solve them .. i managed to finish them all without any online guides (except one early puzzle that required some pixel hunting), so i'm glad the focus is on the story this time, if i wanted to play a puzzle game i'd go play Portal 2 or The Talos Principle.Oh, and there is that sweet surprise at the end, although only players of TLJ will know its full significance and recognize the location but either way it's still very intriguing and interesting section that i didn't expect at all .. adds lots of mystery and makes me so eager to play the next episode.To sum it up: +The return of one of the best adventure games out there, Telltales have a serious competitor now.+Lovely graphics and attention to details that makes exploring the world a real joyful video/audio experience.+Fantastic top notch Voice acting and music.+Evolved dialog/choice story driven gameplay, simple puzzles that don't get in the way of the story.+Moves the story onward resolving plot points while also leaving Lots of mystery and anticipation for the fans to speculate on. -Some minor graphical hiccups and frame-rate drops-It is better if you play the previous games first as some of things might not make sense.Overall i'm very satisfied with the first episode and didn't regret buying this one bit, specially after waiting for so many years to continue the story, go buy it and do yourself a favor and play the older games as well, despite any problems they have (first game looking outdated, and 2nd game having some cumbersome mechanics) they are still excellent adventure games and a truly an forgettable journey.

												The Longest Journey is probably one of the best Point & Click adventure games ever made, allying great character development, astounding world-building and a sensational feeling of being in a fairytale. Dreamfall clumsily tried to implement fighting sequences and at the same time expand the scale of the first game with three playable characters instead of a single one. I appreciated the developer’s effort and like many was left thunderstruck by the final cliffhanger and so like every worldwide fan of the series, I was happy to pay for the kickstarted episodic sequel: Dreamfall Chapters.After finishing the final chapter of the game, I feel conflicted. On one hand, I really wanted to love DC as I am already in love with the setting and the characters. On the other hand, the game is just not very... fun to play and lost what made the prequels so interesting in the first place. Gameplay-wise, the game has ""lite-adventure"" mechanics à la Telltale Games: minimal inventory, minimal interactions and rich dialogue paths replaced by ""important"" decisions affecting the next chapters. The first two chapters' pace is dreadful and a map button to navigate is nowhere to be seen! The in-game maps are kinda terrible too. The third character's segments consist of hidden objects searches, which is quite frankly boring. Characters' inner monologues are usually funny and a nice touch but that's about it. I never feel challenged or interested in the gameplay and ended focusing only on the story itself.Story starts as intriguing asking many essential questions about the setting and the relationship between Arcadia & Stark. Unfortunately, as it unfolds it drops the ball. Instead of antagonists, we get cardboard like cliches and the crux of the plot turns into a generic mambo-jumbo of cosmic balance. Main characters personalities seems to change from episode to episode (and not by the player's own twisted hand). The new playable character felt like a cheap addition too. One might say that it kinda IS her point but it felt too disjointed from Kian's and Zoe's driving goals and ends up a cheap Deus Ex Machina.Not everything is bad obviously, far from it. Developers tried to do their best with the tight budget and offer a great art direction, excellent voice-acting and neat music. Some set pieces are great and I finally got the closure I wanted. The epilogue is a nice touch all in all. I shed my little tear.All in all, I feel like the episodic structure and the presence of three playable characters just kill the game. You don't have time to grow attached, you don't have time to care as you go from obvious story twists to dramatic cutscenes and other expository dumps. The scale was too big for embracing the Telltale structure, which is more akin to pulp literature and comics than lengthy enthralling fairy-tales/coming-of-age stories like TLJ/Dreamfall.In France, we have a saying ""Whatever the flask, provided that one gets the drunkenness"". I got my drunkenness alright but it was a cheap vodka-orange in a plastic cup.			"

												This is a piece of art. True, it has more from an interactive film than a classic adventure since inventory and item usage only occur sparingly throughout the game. Yet still, this is a must-play. Chapters looks drop-dead gorgeous on modern hardware, sometmes the graphics look like painted. It is funny yet also has a lot darker, mature tendencies like addressing fascism and genocide. It can feel oppressing at later stages. For me it's an emotional rollercoaster ride for mature gamers and I'm proud  to be a backer of it. Maybe you need a certain degree of empathy to fully appreciate this game. And do yourself a favor, at least try playing it in English if you're not native. The voiceovers are great except that of Na'ane.I'll probably go back to TLJ and Dreamfall TLJ some time in the future to fully grasp the story arc. Yet questions remain since in my view the TLJ/April arc is not fully finished.As I said the only negative, if you will, can be that it transcends the classical adventure genre (which, to be honest, Dreamfall TLJ already did).

												TL;DR : The story of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapters, while set in the same universe as The Longest Journey and with common characters, feels very unrelated to the story of TLJ. If you liked the second game's story and are okay with the first game being left as a side-show, then you'll probably love Dreamfall Chapters. If not, you'll likely be left with a bitter taste in the mouth.-------------------------------------Like most of the people who purchased this game, I absolutely love The Longest Journey and can sing its praises all day. The main reason why I didn't like Dreamfall Chapters is that it overcomplicates the storyline of the first two games, and in the process, does not properly close out the entire saga.One of the great things about The Longest Journey was that the protagonist, April Ryan, was very much likeable. Her adventures and the settings/locations of her adventures inspired a sense of wonder (remember seeing Marcuria for the first time?). The second game, Dreamfall, continued along the same lines but the focus of the story started shifting from maintaining a balance between the two worlds to dreaming/undreaming, etc.And now for Dreamfall Chapters: the storyline is carried in such a different direction that it seems almost completely unrelated to the first game. It's as if they forgot about The Longest Journey and only provided a continuation of Dreamfall (the second game).None of the characters, including April Ryan, are given a proper or satisfactory closure. This includes Abnaxus, the Draic Kin, etc. There is almost no mention of what the hell happened to any of those characters after the end of the first game. I won't say any more about this because I don't want to spoil anything, but out of the 25 hours that I played, not more than 20 or 30 minutes were dedicated to the original TLJ characters except Crow. The mess-up with the story could've been offset if there were good puzzles, but aside from a couple of tricky ones in the first 3 chapters, the rest are absolute no-brainers. Book 5 has no puzzles at all- it's more or less an interactive movie where you click on dialog choices or search for stuff.To sum up, if you didn't like or care about the first game but liked the Dreamfall storyline, it's worth playing. But if you want a proper closure to The Longest Journey saga that started in 1999, you will most definitely be disappointed. For me, it begins with and ends at the first game itself.			"

												A farewell but also a welcome.The story ends here and starts here.After all these years, finally the jorney ends. Everyone has gone to his or her place. Outside the game, however, our jorneys still go on. Our stories has not yet come to an end.Some people came, some people left, some people stay.Nearly 17 years, The Longest Jorney kept company with us. This is the best fairy tale I've been told ever.In the end, when April open the door of The House of All Worlds, I almost cried out.Thank you for the great arts you brought to us.

												It's hard to properly express how I feel about this... I have waited over 8 years for the continuation of this story that has meant more to me than any other story ever told. The wait is finally over, and it seems it has been worth it! Seeing these amazingly well written characters again is like being reunited with old friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a lover of good stories, even non-gamers.Disclaimer: This review only covers impressions from book 1.So... About the game. If you are looking for a fast paced game with a good combat system, this game is not for you. There is no combat. If you are easily offended this game is probably not for you either. It is a mature game, and characters in it reflect the wide variety of people you find in the real world. There are offensive characters. There is profanity. It is relatable. On the topic of characters, that's one area where this game truly shines! The characters you meet feel genuine, they feel complex. Real. This is a reflection of the overall fantastic writing which is revealing a thought provoking, deep and mature yet magical story. The dialogue alone had me laugh out loud on several occasions, while other moments pulled at my heartstrings. Of course this is only book one, but it is clear that great things are set in motion already.About choices. Choices make up a key aspect of the actual game-play. They are difficult! Generally there are no obvious good vs. evil choices. Most are morally grey. But they do impact your story in important ways. To help you make the choice you will hear the PC's inner though process as you mouse over each choice. This very effectively serves the dual purpose of letting you get to know the characters better while helping you guess at what the PC will say.This game is visually stunning. Sure, if you compare it to the flashiest of the AAA next-gen titles you might find the graphics a bit lacking. But the artstyle is fantastic and it is clear that the world has been crafted with a careful eye for detail. The two worlds of Stark and Arcadia feature very distinct styles, yet there is a cohesiveness that tie them together.The Soundtrack is simply amazing amazing. There is one spot in Europolis where you will find a crowd of NPCs around a musician, and I found myself standing around for a few minutes just listening. But even the music coming out of radios, night clubs and the ""atmospheric"" music is all highly effective and does a great job of underlining the impact of the story. The voice acting is also absolutely superb. Better even than most AAA titles I have played. I must admit it took some getting used to the new voice for Zoe, but she does such a good job I quickly got over it.TL:DR - If you love a good story and great characters, buy it. The interactions with Shitbot alone are worth it.			"

												Review of Book One:From begeining to end this is short...Too short and the jail area is just very poor. Game looks a decade behind the times. Mouth movement is very off and choppy. That is until you get to Zoe and her city. This looks a lot better but the game runs so glitchy. Crashed a few times on me and often the system stops to catch up to you. This has a very very poor unpolished feel. However when your standing still or walking slow the game does look very good. I feel more interactions could have been worked into the city area. A mini map would be a god send as the city map system is very hard to clearly understand as its vague. All in all I love the story and the landscape graphics are good the people could use alot more work. I think mouth movement could be stopped all together and it create a better feel. It would be old school but at least a better old school.I am only glad that for the money your going to get all the chapters and not have to fork over more each time. That would end things right there for me.			"

												I have a great expectation with this game, I played The Longest Journey and the Dreamfall: The Longest Journey after I played the first book of the Dreamfall Chapters. The game, in my opinion, is very unique, the Red Thread had a great ability to develop an engaging and at the same time very deep narrative storyline. The description of the game as a game that marries ""cyberpunk universe with medieval fantasy"" very unfair. He is more than that. I try to set it in a nutshell as a game that provokes reflection on the notion of each person on their commitment to society. And does it with elements - for me - other than the ""blockbusters"": empowered women characters and protagonists in the unfolding of the story enventos. Let's see how the story ends..			"

												After so many years of believing that I'd never see a true sequel to The Longest Journey/Dreamfall, I was very excited to see this long-awaited new chapter emerge! I 've always felt that the conclusion to Dreamfall left so many unanswered questions so when Chapters came along, I had to jump right back in and see where the story would take me.Thumbs Up:- A well written continuation of the events in the previous game. Zoe feels very authentic regardless of the decisions she's faced with making. I can only assume that Kian will be given the same kind of development as the additional Chapters are released.- A fully realized environment. The layout of Propast feels filled in and lively.- Interaction with almost everything in the enviroment. Even if Zoe or Kian can't touch or use something directly, they will have thoughts and feelings to share with the player.- Continuity and nostalgia. So many story elements from the previous games are faithfully touched on and added to. There are a number of little tributes to Dreamfall and The Longest Journey if you know where to look!- Every decision counts. I particularly like this feature. It makes doing multiple playthroughs worthwhile.- An AMAZING soundtrack. So much of the score is just brilliantly done and it does a great job of conveying the story without being overbearing.- Driven by narrative. Chapters definitely covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time. It feels like a really good book or TV show. However, as it does not feature combat (so far), this may not be everyone's cup of tea.Thumbs Down:- Some of the voice acting is a little hard to listen to. Additionally, the amount vulgar language just seems to be overkill. A little bit can add spice and depth to a character. Too much just makes them uninteresting.- Some of the puzzles and goals could stand to have a bit more explanation to them. I'm not talking outright hand-holding, but a gentle nudge or exposition could go a long way. Especially if you're negotiating between two people...- Many of the NPC are too identical. Repitions in hairstyle and clothing tend to break up the immersion, unfortunately.- Optmization issues. Even with settings at the lowest, this game could suffer from framerate issues on some machines. The is VERY noticeable in Propast.Overall:This is a worthy sequel. It feels finished and fully fleshed out. I'm enjoying it immensely and I cannot wait to see what happens next.			"

												Iv'e been waiting for Dreamfall Chapters to come out since the last game ended on a cliff hanger. and so far it does not dissapoint!. (there thats for fans of the series)For newcommers, Dreamfall Chapters is a 3D adventure game in the manner of Walking Dead and many of the old point and click games from the early years of video games on PC.Now Ill say this now. you should play The Longest Journey: Dreamfall before you play this game (you do not have to play The Longest Journey but its got some usefull backstory and can help expand your appreciation of the world) now you do not have to in order to enjoy the game but it will have that much more meaning and you will really understand the characters and events at the start of the game if you have finished the earlier game.on with the rest of the review:What sets this game apart from its forebears is that it has a tree based structure to its storyline. so for each choice you make there is a real consequence. Now thats the claim from Red Thread the studio responsible for the game. As there is only the first part of the game available, it remains to be seen how extensive this system of choices is, but after some time playing the first book and trying every choice I could make. I am fairly confident that the game will deliver in its promises with upcomming episodes.The game uses two choice systems, one is the Balance system a set of events that have a coinflip answer, where the resulting choice greatly effects future outcomes for the character. the other is a walking dead esque system where characters remember your reactions to various events and these are taken into account with future conversations and events.while many of the choices and events presented provided numerous choices and possibilities, there were very few choices available that had immediate results. I am greatly looking forward to the second book to see how these choices pan out. Now, it would be remiss of me to not mention some current issues with the game:It has some known graphical bugs and issues with resource usage they are working on fixes for.( they fixed the large framerate drop happening in Europolis and other areas)Some people are having crashes and freezes (not me but some people are)The save game system needs work because it just makes a ton of autosave files without any sensible naming system or organisation.(only an issue if you want to try a different response or load a non current game)The game is mainly about making choices and solving puzzles, this in future will include things like stealth and probably some light combat. but it will be unlikely that combat will be particularly reflex intensive or action oriented.Characters in the dream world seem to have various powers so a kind of magic is also featured in the game in certain areas.Will you enjoy this game?If you liked games like myst, the stanley parable, any older point and click adventure  you will love this game.if your into combat and violence, you may still enjoy it but it will feel slow and boring due to long heavy dialogue sequences and alot of travelling.I love what they have done with dreamfall chapters and am looking forward to the next chapter to see how far they will go.

												I've really enjoyed this game so far, having completed the four episodes currently released. While Dreamfall Chapters is very much a slow-boil of a story, I also enjoy the amount of time I got to spend in the locales, just soaking in the lushly designed ambience. This is a great looking game. That said, the story is perhaps a little out of balance, with the game and puzzle moments often feeling detached from the ongoing narrative. That said, once you get to the Third and Fourth episodes (Books), the pace really picks up, creating a feleing of greater eveness between game and story. The decision making moments are really the highlight of the game for me, though - there's a feel of ongoing consequence to the choices you make. Perhaps the story always ends up in a similar place, regardless, but the game does a much better job of integrating your choices into the ongoing narrative than something like The Walking Dead, where your decisions often feel peripheral and meaningless to the story. For anyone who likes a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' Dreamfall Chapters can't come more highly recommended.For non-adventure gamers I would recommend the game with a few caveats. Obviously it's a beautiful production, but the mechanics of the game offer little flexibility in terms of exploration. Yes, the worlds can be big, but there's ultimately little to do in them besides complete tasks associated with story progression.			"

												I've played The Longest Journey, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters 1-4 and I'm highly anticipating book 5.  The story is rich and the characters well acted, well rounded and interesting.  If you haven't played The Longest Journey or Dreamfall: TLJ then I highly suggest you do.  These games are well deserved of their status.  The story is original and engrossing, and something I'd never seen before.  The first and second game are quite different in mechanics.  In the second you are able to fight and there are things you can't miss.  In the first pick up everything even if you've placed it somewhere, as you may need it in the future.  Dreamfall Chapters is incredible.  The graphics are a wonderful improvement, the story is still amazing and the characters are what those who have played the first two games have come to love.  The worlds are in peril and I'm still not sure what role Zoe plays in everything but her story is intriguing.  While the first and the second didn't have much choice, the third takes your choices into account and molds the story in regards to your choices.  I reccommend playing the first two before you embark on your journey into Dreamfall:Chapters. If you don't, you'll have a lot of questions and you'll be missing out on the wonders of Arcadia and Stark you've missed by opting out on TLJ and Dreamfall TLJ.			"

												(No spoilers)Narratively this is a real joy to play. There are not many games like this out there.One minute you're saving people from nightmares, the next you're arguing with your loved one about the dishes.The story is rich and complex.It was recently updated to the Unity 5 engine, and it looks beautiful. The developers have created excellent aesthetics that fit the stories well.An important thing to know is: it's a kind of interactive story, with puzzles, and choices - that actually matter in this game. So don't expect 'traditional' gameplay.Also, if you're stuck, try out every option possible, literally. Examine everything!A few points of criticism:- The solution to some puzzles require very specific ways to use the UI.(E.g. at one point I accidentally apprehended the wrong person because I didn't know what a symbol meant.)- The animations could be better. It's sad because everything else looks fine.- Quite a few objects could use proper collision meshes. It's a detail but walking through objects breaks immersion.(E.g. in the Pandemonium the robots on the wall have no collision at all.)All in all, one of my favourite games. Wholeheartedly recommended!

												Love this game. The trilogy in all is amazing, and Dreamfall Chapters doesn't disappoint. I feel like I have been waiting for this to come out forever. Very story-rich told by two characters. Zoe Castillo from ""the real world"" (although far more advanced than our word) is a complex character from the previous game, growing and dealing with difficult worlds. Kian Alvane, (also from the previous game) from the magical world, is also a deep, strong charcter. This game is not just for looks, although it definately looks beautiful. Your choices in the story actually mean something and change the story for better or for worse.  This game and the characters in it are like a good book you can't put down. You should play the previous games or at least Dreamfall before playing this.			"

												This is a continuation of the adventures of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. This game does live up to the previous two in being story rich and submersive. You can't help but submerse yourself into the story and feel for each of the charaters. The choices do not have major impact in some aspects, but do in others. Ultimately the story end is pretty much the same. Speaking of the end, it was definitely unexpected, a bit far out, however I will  continue to follow this series in hopes of getting more of my questions answered! If there is no other game, I will live because this was an amazing 'end' to a beautifully woven story that I have fallen in love with over the years.			"

												There is no denying it, Dreamfall: Chapters looks spectacular. A lot of attention has been given to character design and fashion. From the city of Propast's Blade Runner motifs, to the fantastical vistas of the Purple Mountains, to giant Arcadian steampunk contraptions — all rendered with Unity 5's physically-based shading, the game is a memorable visual experience. For me, the eye candy alone is enough to not regret playing the game, but others might be disappointed that there is little else to enjoy.Uncharacteristically for Red Thread Games, Dreamfall: Chapters is poorly written. It starts out feeling iffy in the first two books, and then takes a dive in the third. The story is unremarkable, and many threads are left dangling, even as this final game in the series runs to an end. Most jarring are the inane dialogues that leave one incredulous they could have been written by an adult.Gameplay pacing is uneven, and every book includes an aggressively boring Saga ""baby minigame."" Much-criticized stealth sections from Dreamfall are back, and the puzzles are bad even by the series' standards.All in all, I recommend playing The Longest Journey and Dreamfall if you haven't. Only play Chapters for the graphics or if you absolutely have to have closure on the Undreaming story thread.			"

												The game is a bit clunky and hard to figure out where you are headed at first. It seems really complete for the first few chapters and then seems to fill everything in at the end very quickly without you being able to do much about it. Choices per usual do not really seem to matter, to me at least. If there are different endings I do not think that I would spend the time to find them as the story is a bit slow and you seem to be doing things that are not all that intersting for the most part. With all of that said the game does have an interesting story and is worth a play. IMHO it was worth the money and wait for the additional chapters.			"

												Good:Characters 10/10. Design, voice acting, personality depth - great work!Story 8/10. Good, with many interesting twists... but not quite up to original TLJ level (well, maybe its just nostalgia).Neutral:Gameplay 7/10. Your typical quest, sometime fun, sometime tedious.Bad:Optimization 3/10  - Sometimes FPS drops below comfortable level even on new hardware. For this level of graphics it's intolerable. Wither 3 runs much faster on ULTRA with better graphics.Summary:If you played and liked The Longest Journey and original Dreamfall, i recommend this game as well. For those  who dint play previous games i'd recommend to play them before this one.			"

												It's so hard to know where to start about a game that spanned 17 years and countless characters, every one of them memorable. I played The Longest Journey when I was a child and I remember sinking 30 to 40 hours into it and when it was finally over I did nothing but think about the game and the story for more than a week. Very few games can do that. Dreamfall brought more questions than answers and although it had a lot of lackluster mechanics it was an amazing game. I waited for years for the story to end and now when it finally did, I feel both elated and sad. Although I would love to see a fourt game I don't think it will happen and all the major plot points were explained and the stories of all the major characters were brought to an end. But make no mistake, countless questions keep swirling both in my mind in discussion forums but it's unreasonable for any game to explain every question when it has a story that spanned 3 games and 17 years. The ending doesn't explain everything, it's bittersweet and it leaves you wanting for more but it's also satisfying. There enough closure and a whole lot of melancholy and reminiscence.Years from now, I will look back and between the hundreds -maybe thosands- of games TLJ saga will shine like a beacon along with a few other brilliant titles amonst a sea of decent games. That's when you know you've witnessed a timeless piece of art.			"

												Trying to run this with an older PC, but within the min. requirements - Book One runs (mostly) okay but Book Two crashes all over the place with 32-bit Windows, to the point where I can't get through it, even with the graphics settings completely dumbed down.   Too bad, it's very good and lives up to the original TLJ.Recommended for fans of the series with at least the minimum system requirements and probably 64-bit version of Windows for PC users.  UPDATE: Reinstalling Windows as 64-bit helped a lot.  Runs OK even on medium quality.  First time I had to do that with a recent game, though.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters in my opinion is a nice game and I would recommend it. 16 years after the first part ""the longest journey"" this is a decent and worthy sequel.Its worth a playthrough and if you are a fan of the series even more.Some of my experiences:- Controls are better with a controler then with keyboard.- The graphics and models are not really up to date for a modern graphic novel game. Thats one of the few negative parts of this game. But like (for example) Life is strange, wich also lacks with better graphics, the story is the more important part and you have to focus on that. - The Character impression sometimes feels like controlling a robot talking to other robots. No Lip sync at all, and almost no facial expressions of any character. Thats really annoying in times of good graphic engines and little unhyped games doing a better job. Feels like playing a 10years old game with better graphics. So almost every dialog you have to watch looks like this: Robot1: BaBaBa Ba Ba, Robot2: Ba BaBa BaBa Ba- Sometimes models look like they've seen a scary ghost, but convulsive try to follow their role. That really ruins the atmosphere sometimes, but all in all it is negligible.- Some of the city areals are some kind of sterile and you have to overlook that sometimes.All in all, after some playing time, all this little flaws feel a little bit annoying, but when you concentrate on the story its ok and the game is nice.

												        I can write endless amounts of text glorifying this piece of extraordinary artwork and yet I'll feel like I haven't said enough... enough at all! There are certain things born in the world of media which don't just fall under the boundaries of a certain genre. Many of us have this one movie, this one book or song - this one single solitary special thing in life which makes the very fabric of our own universe to twitch with excitement & joy. And for me - this thing in my entire life is The Longest Journey Saga. I know that most people just go through the game reviews to decide if a game is either good or suited for them, but here I am & I reach out to All of You - This game is a story like any other You've ever heard & told in a new & incredible way!        I'm one of the Dreamfall Chapters Kickstarter Backers. I am a serious competitive gamer. I remember how I used to craw & try to walk in order to reach the computer while I still weared diapers & I was too small to climb up on the chair only by myself. I've played many many games in my life, I've conquered several gaming world records during those years & I hope that I'll be able to conquer even more. I've played every single genre & numerous games - from some of the worst to surely the best. And not just on the PC.  But  The Longest Journey Saga  became from my very first playthrough many many years ago probably the most important game in my life, because it's not just a game. The developers didn't just created it in order to make the next gen game or to cash in some quick bucks - no. The people who made this are hard working, dedicated & give themselves fully in what they're doing. They worked their asses off to create the absolute masterpiece when it comes to a way to tell a story. And their work influences the minds of people all around the globe. I've shown the previous two games to many, many people through out the past couple of years - half my life actually - and I was amazed to find out that every single one of them got touched by those games and his life changed for the better in some aspect. And all the people who come in contact with anyone who has played the Saga will be affected by those changes. And no - I don't know any on the developer team neither am I a fan boy - I simply appreciate their work for what it is & say a heartly ""Thank You!"" for turning our dreams into a reality by making this huge leap of faith & creating Dreamfall Chapters! At the time I write this - Dreamfall Chapters has the perfect 100% positive review rating. It's the first time I see this & yet I find this to be perfectly normal. I only hope that one day I'll create something which can affect people like The Longest Journey Saga is.         So in the end I guess that I still wrote a whole bunch of things. For finishing words I just want to link to all of You the post I wrote a while ago while I was still waiting for this gem to come out (I'm not sure if it will require You to register to the forums in order to read it but it will be worth it - I promise): http://redthreadgames.com/forum/topic/215-a-dreamer-living-the-dream/         The Longest Journey Saga literally changes our whole world - the real one - for the better. And I perfectly realize that I sound way overdramatic to some people but the simple fact is - if those games made me say all those things I wish to say a thousand more - can You follow my path by playing through all of them & not agree with me on the end?        They say that every story has a beginning & an end. And I'm literally shaking with enthusiasm to delve deeper into the story of Dreamfall Chapters! "

												A fine ending to the series begun with the Longest Journey. I've logged about 44 hours, which I think included about two playthroughs of at least chapters 1-3, so I'd estimate all 5 chapters take about 20-25 hours to play through. Although the story is engrossing and the artwork is beautiful, it is a little buggy, and the gameplay is a little thin, leaving it more like a lightly interactive TV series than a game. If you liked the Longest Journey or Dreamfall, it is worth picking Dreamfall Chapters up.			"

												I've been a very big fan of any decision making game. Life is Strange, Heavy Rain, etc. I even loved how your choices throughout the Dragon Age series effects the future games in a way. But I feel this game takes it to a whole new level. In many choice based games you end up feeling that the final decision makes all the choices in between fell pointless. So not to spoil the game, I will leave out the name, but one has a final decision of saving one or sacrificing that one to save everyone else, and despite the toughness of the decision, you may or may not feel like being nice to everyone else, or mean, or accusatory, was completely trivial since they're just dead.However, in Dreamfall, you feel like every decision will not only effect you, but a person you care about too. And the effect of some decisions will make you think ""Did I just trade a good friend's life for a good friend's life?"" Rather than choosing a lesser of two evils, you feel you need to pick between two equally bad decisions that can put people in jeopardy. You end up feeling like if you reload and change your decision, you might hurt someone else just as badly. So rather than a traditional ""choice based"" game it in turn seems to be more of a ""punishment for your actions"" most of the time. Even ordering the lunch in episode one seemed to have more of a consequence and visible change in the relationship between your character and other characters, even though you look at it and think ""ordering lunch is such a trivial decision, why did they add it?"" But it has a lasting effect. I'd compare this to watering your plant in Life is Strange, correct me if I'm wrong please, but that action seemed to be pointless. I don't remember in my few playthroughs of that having an actual effect, other than the plant sprouting, but I could be wrong.Now I understand the premise of those other games I mentioned, listed and left out, are different, but I just feel like this is a game where you feel like every decision actually has a lasting effect. Not just on the lives of others, but relationships too. Sometimes you feel like ""I'm making progress with this character, he/she is starting to like me"" but unfortunate circumstances rip them out of your character's life. And other decisions you made that didn't seem like the; lets call it a line of cause and effect, I'll refer to it as a line, so think of it like a string, it doesn't seem like that line of decision making would matter with other lines, but suddenly, those lines intertwined and start having an effect on one another.The game makes you realize something that's not just true in some games, but is true in everyday life, things you say and do, no matter how trivial it may seem, mayeffect the people around you, not always physically, but how they look at you or your relationship with them, whether a friendship or otherwise.Now as for the game's premise. I played the first two games as well, and despite everyone's *****ing and moaning about the second game in the series, I've enjoyed the whole series and world. I feel since the first game, it's gotten deeper with more of a depiction of social issues but in the past and present. And that makes it feel that much more realistic. I never could've imagined just how interesting a story about ""dreaming"" could be until I found these games. The rivalry of ""science and faith"" that is ever so present in modern culture. The ""crusades"" that are talked about and in motion in the final game. And a very ""1984"" type feel to it at times. The list could continue for the points of the game that could relate to history or the present, but some of those would spoil, so I won't continue.I know that people were upset with the structure of the second game, ""the story"" was not good enough, ""not the same gameplay style"" I've seen somewhere about it. I think that one may refer to it not being point and click. Yes, it's too bad that now you have to use TWO HANDS to play a game. Partially. However I thought it was a great lead in to this game. And you have to realize, the first was made in 1999, the second in 2006 (correct me if either years are wrong) as technology advances, the game does too or it could get left behind. I hope everyone one who plays the game judges the whole series rather than individual parts, as I think it's a masterpiece when played. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes story, choices and some puzzles to be predominant in a game.I am ecstatic for the last book and eagerly await.If I made an error with the information of something I mentioned. Correct me please.			"

												Let's get this out of the way, you won't be satisfied with what this game has to offer if you're looking for some hardcore puzzles and amazing gameplay, but what it offers has heart.I personally enjoy going through this game so far and I would wholeheartedly recommend it, however it is far from perfect.The characters actually have character and are memorable, the story and script is fun and interesting, especially if you've played or at least have knowledge about the previous games in the series. There are some technical issues once in a while such as playable character disappearing if you skip dialogues too fast, or wonky camera in some parts, and the puzzles may be too simple for those looking for a real brain-twister, but I do find that most of them ""make sense"" for the presented situations you're supposed to solve, and I personally prefer my puzzle being accessible than having to look up a guide for it after 3 hours of trial and error.

												This game. I had high hopes and expectations for. There were some serious red flags early in the game's release. Incredibly long times between book releases. Atrociously bad optimization and graphics even on the highest settings. The writing is good in some spots but overall ham-fisted. The writers insert an agenda into the story, quite alarmingly. In book 3 a character is given a choice that if they refuse makes them gay. I don't take issue with gay characters. But the way this was done, and the irrelevance to the character's CHARACTER. Is ham-fisted and ideologically motivated. There was a thread where the devs told those concerned that this perception of ""now your character is gay"" was dissuaded. But in the most recent release [book 5]. It turns out the devs straight up lied. This is the most damning part of this game. I supported the kickstarter. Because I really liked TLJ and TLJ; Dreamfalls. I expected so much more than what this game delivered.I can not in good faith recommend this game to anyone. Due to a lack of content, poor optimizations, and developers who will insert their ideology into a game. And then lie to the consumers about it. It's ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting, and if I could get my money back I most certainly would. On the plus side, if you're social justice minded and want to support devs who force a character to be gay. This game is for you. Because refusing to kiss strange women who literally pop out from the shadows and seem sketchy as ♥♥♥♥. MAKES A MAN GAY.			"

												It's been a long, painful, difficult road for Dreamfall Chapters, much like it has been for the characters in the story, very much like it has been for the TLJ series in general. Reading up some forums posts from the past year, it seems there are a lot of people who expected Chapters to be something it isn't. Maybe the developer had bigger plans that ended up never happening, maybe they simply marketed in a way it shouldn't have been marketed.I've owned The Longest Journey and Dreamfall for ages now and backed Chapters for its Kickstarter but never actually got around to playing them until just last week. Obviously, I don't have the weight of waiting for years and years for a continuation of the story, something that I imagine made Dreamfall originally as painful (and disappointing) at the time as something like Halo 2's ending when it came out. I also didn't go through waiting months or even years between Books with Chapters, didn't have to experience the bugs and engine pains that seemed to happen early on. I'm sure my enjoyment benefited greatly.TLJ and Dreamfall are rough. They have not aged gracefully. But they are absolutely crucial parts of this grand journey, and they make Dreamfall Chapters so much more rewarding, much like Chapters ends up making Dreamfall much, much more enjoyable. The stories the games tell and the characters you get to know will live on in your minds, and they make the events in Chapters matter that much more.Chapters has choices and there are consequences, but ultimately this is a small part in a larger set of events that have already been predetermined. You are along for the ride, and what a ride it is. This is a strong, beautiful, narrative-focused adventure to follow, and a wonderful continuation of a rich, engaging, magical story, filled with imagination and a love for the mysterious, something just beyond our understanding. Much like the previous two games, it has problems and odd moments, but the broad strokes form a satisfying journey you want to see through to the end. Your enjoyment is very dependant on your emotional investment in the characters and their fates, and I absolutely loved it. It goes places and I was thrilled to see it all the way through. The Epilogue is moving and beautifully put together. I look forward to what Red Thread will do with their next games, as they've grown a lot over the years.Did I mention Enu is adorable? Enu is adorable.9/10			"

												Quick summary:  save your money.I'm highly polarized on this game so far (through book 3).  I really appreciate the episodic installments as an idea but don't believe the creators have hit their stride just yet (the pacing is slow and at times the material is trivial).  In general, I'm not a point-n-click fan but this story is rather epic and I love that.  Is the story enough tho?  The answer is no.  The game-play is laborious.  I almost feel as if it would be better without the puzzles as the pacing is rather slow and with the puzzles added in I feel like I'm lagging behind.  This is a negative impact on enjoyment obviously.  Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that I prefer RPG's but this game is not satisfying for me.  And this is where I'm polarized; I love the ever-evolving story but hate playing through it.  Cycling through the past two games (via walkthroughs) did add an appreciation for the entire story arc and helped to draw me in.  But this is a case where the amazing writing is overshadowed by the Gumby game mechanics.  I feel that perhaps just leaving this one as a QTE game would benefit it as less time would be spent on slow environmental interactions and more time on the part I love.  In fact I'm wondering if they should even bother with the pretense of a game on this one and instead simply allow the audience to click through the chapters like a DVD book.I hate to say it, as I really want to support this team, but this one is probably best experienced through walkthroughs with the current going rate of $30 USD.  Knock that price down to half and it's still better through walkthroughs.  Yeah, the gameplay is really not enjoyable for me.  :/  As refreshing as the ""Books"" idea is, I just can't ignore the gameplay.  It really makes this experience not fun.  Who want's to run back and forth or around in circles multiple times for a triviality?  Nobody a**holes.  Nobody. "

												This Zoe's butt game is very good. I can see some Zoe's butt nuances, which are mostly Zoe's butt technical, and the Zoe's butt aniamtion is a bit too stoff for Zoe's butt me, but it's not a problem. The Zoe's butt game follows Zoe's butt traditions of the previous ones, as well as Zoe's butt the story (obviously). It's ok if you're Zoe's butt unfamiliar with The Longest Zoe's butt Journey, but Dreamfall: The Longest Zoe's butt Journey is very recommedned to play to be more in the Zoe's butt know. Or you can wait for the Zoe's butt recap, which is promissed to be relased as a Zoe's butt patch or something.Zoe's butt Graphics are nice. Not the best you can see out there, but good. The Zoe's butt story has a bit more psycological approach than before, which is good. It provies you Zoe's butt some choices. So far only Zoe's butt one of them seem to bare any actual consequences and it's taken early in the Zoe's butt game. It affects the gameplay and some minor Zoe's butt details in the 3rd part of the game. Including Zoe's butt which bot you will be playing with. And even though Zoe's butt Kidbot does make you smile from its cuteness, only S.hitbot will make you laugh as Zoe's butt crazy. Although you can hear him, while Zoe's butt playing with Kidbot as well. For a short period.So I recommend this Zoe's butt one and am waiting for further chapters. Do not regret my Zoe's butt $215 I pledged on Zoe's butt Kickstarter.And yes: Zoe's butt is even more awesome than in Dreamfall: TLJ			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a game that can be apreciated for what it sets out to do. It was successfully funded on Kickstarter, and it is clear that the team at Red Thread Games is passionate about the Dreamfall franchise. This however, does not change the fact that Chapters (atleast in it's current state) is a bad game.So what exactly do i mean by this? Well to start off with, the game runs like crap, and without the graphics to back its poor performance. Despite the game having recently been upgraded from Unity version 4.x to 5.2.3, I still struggle to maintain 60 FPS on my current rig(i7 2600K/GTX 780sc). But what about the game itself? Well. To be fair. It's also very weak. Chapters LOVES to waste your time. It contains tons of illogical puzzles, and pixel hunt-like item scavenging. And when you aren't walking around a large level looking for pointless items, you're likely walking from point A to point B, just to be sent back to A again. Overall the game manages to drag out what could've been a nicely paced 2 hour per episode experince, into a tedious 5 hour walkathon, with very little exposition.As such, I really cannot recommend Dreamfall Chapters, as it is simply a bad game. I will however recommend the previous title in the series, known simply as Dreamfall, as it is arguably a much better game.			"

												Can you stop pushing social justice issues into the game so hard, the game is literally a tumblrinas wet-dream at the moment. I understand with a female protagonist you attract that kinda vibe (also, Kian is homosexual??really??)  but could you tone it down a little, the politcal agenda is blatant and almost cringe worthy.  I waited years for this♥♥♥♥♥♥and all it does is make me want to play the first two games again. Seems like you're trying too hard to incorporate these societal issues to appeal to a whole new market since being present on the steam store and not trying to maintain the same feel (or storyline) the previous games possessed.  This isn't the direction I saw dreamfall taking. I really hope the ending makes me cry like 1 and 2 did.			"

												Very clumpsy game.It's comfy and neat, with lots of warm memories connected with previous games in this Longest Journey series. It's an ending of the story, and the ending itself is a decent one.However, now I realize, how many cons every game had. From absurd puzzles from the first game (admit, many of us loved that game mostly for story and the world but probably less for gameplay itself); boring fighting system, long runs from one location to another, too simplistic stealth and cliffhanger in the end of the second one; to mostly meaningless choices, mostly too easy or sometimes too hard-to-spot puzzles, and even longer runs from one location to other of this last one installation.Ok, gameplay wasn't the best part of all the series, but the world and dialogues... Nah, dialogues are cheasy and very fanservise-oriented in Dreamfall Chapters. Characters are often dull. And dialogue camera is made with super lazy approach.Unique world - thats the best part here.If you were here before in previous games of this series, then you're already into here.If not - well, think twice.If I were me from the future talking to me from the past, I'd advise me not to play Dreamfall Chapters - better watch letsplays or smth. But I probably wouldn't listen :)			"

												Adored The Longest Journey, loved Dreamfall but this is just awful.  Like much of the fan-sponsored games and movies, it's super predictable and consequently dull beyond belief. Good voice acting but disappointing graphics quality. The adolescent freshness of the first games is completely gone, replaced by humorless uninspiring cliché politic and moral stereotypes set in your standard new age gaming environment. It's just too painful to finish.			"

												Between cringeworthy writing and stiff animations there's a half-baked adventure game with silly puzzles, wonky controls, inconsistent characters and a somewhat ambitious story that feels poorly executed.

												Not what it advertises! Amazing detailed locations, great voice acting, nice character variety but no real options. Major flaw for a game that makes you think you can choose what the outcome of the story would be. All options are an illusion. Small things change but no effect on the story whatsoever. And the worst is that they could so easily have those options included. Many of the descisions you have to make have the ability to change the story dramatically but for some reason the developers decided not to allow that. Instead they find a way to bring the story back to the same result. Most of the time your choices will just determine which person will die. So it is a great story, just dont buy this expecting a choose your own adventure or even a point and click adventure. Its an interactive linear-ish fairytale.			"

												I really would liked to appreciate this game. Unfortunately, it's plagued with technical issues and I found the story got on my nerves at times.Graphically, Dreamfall Chapters is absolutely gorgeous, the character models, the environment, it's pretty amazing. Unfortunately, even with v-sync enabled, the character models tore all over the place, making it extremely irritating to my eyes and spoiling its beauty. Also, performance was a bit of an issue. I would have expected this game to perform more consistently that it did. Sometimes, I'd have sudden low FPS indoors for no reason. But since it's just walking around, it's not a major issue. I noticed a bunch of annoyances, some probably bugs, others due to bad design. Character models going through one another because they're too close. My character's head getting stuck in weird angles and staying that way unless I changed areas or reloaded a save. The gamepad and the kb+m control can't be used at the same time, meaning that if I decide to use my mouse to do something, suddenly, my gamepad analog buttons won't get the character moving. Another major error in design is those bloody stupid maps. They create nice beautiful cities and make you run around them while only giving us maps located in the city that you have to find if you get lost. For Europolis, it made no sense. You've got futuristic communicators but no integrated mapping technology? It caused me to get lost trying to figure out where to go.  And on top of their poor implementation, the maps were terrible at helping you find your way. Puzzles were also barely there and you sometimes had to scour the city to find one stupid item.I have to give the dev credit for its choice-consequences system though. It was crafted beautifully and you had to think carefully which option to pick. Unlike Telltale's joke system that changes nothing in the story, there are major consequences to your actions. I just wish the story would have been as inspired as that system. It worked best when it focused on what made this series great, fantasy, conspiracy, etc... Instead, the devs seemed more interested in pushing a political agenda regarding race, sexual orientation and gender. The writing gave us your typical mustache twirling villains and not the funny kind. No greys in this story, no sir. It ended up feeling extremely hamfisted. They even mislead you into thinking you could build a romance with one character only to rob that away just so they can make make a point about homosexuality and how it should be accepted. No♥♥♥♥♥♥ it should but giving a fake choice that gave me false hope really annoyed me. It gets even worse in the later chapters where those villains end up become a farce. Their motives are never properly explained so they're evil just because. They were unintentionally comical. The story seemed crafted to make points about inclusivity rather than tell a tale of adventure through fascinating worlds.With such technical issues, a poorly thought out design and a disappointing plot, I can't in good conscience recommend Dreamfall Chapters. And I won't be backing further games from Red Thread Games. What a let down! "

												I don´t know how to put my first impressions except: I want Book Two released right now! I still remember coming across the Longest Journey as a demo version on a CD of a gaming magazine. It took my heart right away and so I of course had to get the game. The characters, the idea of two parallel worlds being connected by dreams and the whole story swallowed me completely. And, of course, when Dreamfall - The Longest Journey was released, I needed to know, how the story went on and was hoping all my questions would be answerde. Well, a lot were but the most important ones, that keep the whole world together, were still left open, though loads of hints were given. Well and now, there is the third part Dreamfall Chapters. I just played through Book One and am flashed. It starts of as intriguing as Dreamfall - The Longest Journey ended. The gameplay is pretty intuitive, not much of a tutorial needed, everything just flows. Yes, there are still some graphic bugs but honestly, I so don´t care. I got so wrapped up into the story, that I mainly just got glimpses of the bugs I read later about. They don´t have any effect on the story itself. So, well, here I am, left with a lot of ideas and hints (and still missing Crow, though I am kind of wondering why the maps are all shown by ""Crowboy"" - reminds me of The Longest Journey and April meeting Crow the first time) and just can´t wait for the rest of the episodes to be released. Though I fear a bit, that a great and awesome story will come to an end at the end of this journey I am still looking forward to it. What I also love very much is making choices having an effect on the story, relationships and so on. I am really curious for the outcomes of my decisions. And, if I don´t like them, I will replay the game and re-live the story for a different turn. For anyone knowing the other two games a must have. For any other interested in a new innovative story, also a must have (though a bit lore research would be needed).			"

												I think the developers would have been better off if they had made a movie instead of a game. This game is indeed an interactive movie and only hardly a game.The gameplay mainly consists of- making decisions, the decisions feel important and you notice consequences but if you want to replay to try another decision then there a lot of cutscenes and conversations you can't skip- running around, even with the maps you sometimes don't know where you have to go which wouldn't be a bad thing if there was anything to discover- 3 dimensional wimmelbook, sometimes you think you looked everywhere but realize after a bit frustation you have to look at whatever thing you're looking for in a specific angle. If you're in for the story (of the prequels) then buy this game. If not then don't.			"

												Very mixed feelings.The story is clever and so strong, as expected. But the realization sucks so much. The 3D totally killed it. There are on average three puzzles in each book and a bit of running. Few decisions with very little repercussions had to be tried to know what not to do again. The 3D is unfinished and I'm not surprised. So much work on locations where you just run through.The original TLJ is so much more.Broken Sword returned to hand-drawn point and click adventure in fifth episode and it was a big success. Deponia is hand-drawn and you have puzzles wherever you look. I hope the next longest journey will take a step back too.			"

												If you actually like playing your games, this is not the game for you. It starts out decent but with every book you do less and less as a player. Your main job it to move Zoe or Kian to their next conversation. By book 5 it practically felt like watching a movie. Occassionally turning a page when it was time to move. What is left of the puzzles are also very simple. If you're not being told exactly what to do, it basically boils down to just needing to find the 1 or 2 things in the environment that you can actually interactive with. A very far cry from The Longest Journey. I'm not saying Chapters needed another rubber ducky/subway/electic box key puzzle but a middle ground would have been nice. And they actually removed a couple of the more challenging puzzles that were in the very beginning of book 1. Instead now of learning how to control Zoe's abilities and help people, you simply walk down a path and they literally solve themselves.This game was released in episodes and it took well over a year for the full game to be created and released. Then the very week after it's fully released, it hits the summer sale at $10. Seems a pretty big middle finger to anyone who bought this game before book 5 and has been waiting this entire time. Certainly taught me to pay more attention to descriptions and never purchase a game still under construction.The only reason I have so many play hours because of how long it took this game to become fully available. By the time I finished book 3 I realized how long it was really taking. So I dropped the game until book 5 was available and started over from the beginning. Since there was enough time to forget practically everything. But then I started finding it boring and would alt-tab out for other things while the game clock kept ticking. I probably only completed it for stubbornness. I waited this long to see the end, they already had my money, I was going to finish. And now I can uninstall it.			"

												The Story had potential. A shame that the gameplay is uninspiring, clunky, and you won't actually play very much at all, except running around for the next item to find or person to speak. It's way to scripted and linear. The last chapter is absolutely the worst. You just click a button, walk a bit, flick a switch, and now and then choose somthing uninspiring to say. That's it. No puzzles, no choises, no nothing. Just listen to fragments of the the story, each time interupted by a load screen and the occasional button to click. Especially the end is boring and a total anticlimax.Dreamfall, the longest journey was quite good. This one just isn't. The graphics and animations would have been nice more than a decade ago. Not today though. So that couln't make up for the rest as well.A shame.It had potential.			"

I know there are many good reviews but com'on... you can't sell it as game because you can move around. all you do is just walking around and click and click, try to fine where develper hide objects. I mean it shouldnt take hours to find one object and solve the problem. unfriendly user interface, no storyline, and why the hell walking and running speed is so slow? and why do I have to fine the map to see where I'm going. can't you just add into the userinterface?you have nothing to do while you are running around. you can't jump, you have nothing to collect, you can't fight, you have to listen all conversations to understand what you need or have to do even though you don't want to.don't get me wrong. I love story driven game. It just not an enjoyable story driven game. if you are considering to buy this game. please don't wast your time and money, just go youtube and watch other people playing.  trust me it is not worth a money.

												It starts like The Longest Journey with mildly eccentric, charming, point-and-click style puzzles and a bunch of witty comments about random things surrounding our protagonist, but gradually turns into Dreamfall, where 90% of dialogues are exposition, puzzles are absent and the player has to run from point A to a character in point B who tells him that character in point C has an item that given to a character in point D advances the plot.The first and a half episode is quite well made, having a little bit of the magical atmosphere of the first game. Unfortunately the plot kicks in, and it turns out to be the same one as in Dreamfall. WATI wants to build a bio-engineered device that shapes reality with dreams only this time not to sell it to millions and brainwash them, but... to conquer the world (and reshape it a bit). On the other side Azadi are doing the same thing but with steampunky thingies. It's basically Dreamfall only this time without a cliffhanger (yet, if you played TLJ, you already know the ending anyway).I was disappointed about what Dreamfall did with ""heritage"" of TLJ, but it had some really well made elements, one of them being the, as I call it, ""Azadi dychotomy"" (ok, a little far-fetched name, but you get the point). Azadi freed Marcuria from Tyrens who were bloodthirsty, barbaric, murderous invaders, but afterwards started an occupation of their own. They imposed their religion on Marcurians, built a ghetto for magicals, but on the other hand saved the land, brought technology and advanced civilization, gave home and a warm meal to many. They discriminated magicals, but they didn't close them in labour camps or exterminate them. It was a really nice conflict of views best shown in a memorable talk between Kian and April. In Dreamfall Chapters however (a little spoiler) the Azadi are steampunk nazis, who start a genocide and want to rule the world as one pure race. There goes the subtlety...There is some good stuff in Dreamfall Chapters (the second Saga interlude, Kian's first mission, Enu!), but there is a lot more bad. Hours of aimless wandering around Europolis, tons of exposition that is not only heavy-handed, but is a repetition of exposition form previous game, really (really, really) bad optimization and lags, maximally simplified plot and characters towards the end. Even Crow is not that clever and funny anymore (ok, now I'm just being grumpy).In the end, the TLJ trilogy is like the Matrix trilogy. The first movie was great, but... No, wait. It's more like like Star Wars prequels. You are happy about a new adventure set in your favourite universe, but when you finally get there to experience it... (""Walking and talking, sitting and talking, sitting on a couch and talking"").If you played first two games, I would recommend to buy this one during a sale for a low price just to get (mostly) disappointed by yourself and reassure yourself that the only good game set in this universe is the original The Longest Journey. Playing it's sequels only makes one appreciate it more and more.			"

												This instalment of the Longest Journey saga is pretty fantastic. If you're a fan of the series, you will not be disappointed.However, fair warning should be given: The developer does not plan to continue with the Longest Journey series after Chapters. Go ahead and play this most excellent game, but do so with the foreknowledge that you will never get to see the ending of the over-arching plot that was started as far back as The Longest Journey.

												If you like The Longest Journey and Dreamfall then you probably already have it.If you're new I can't recommend this game from what is released so far:- The recap is a mess, you will be lost- Very little happens in the first Episode (all that is released so far)- There are almost no puzzles yetAs someone who backed this game $500+ I’m eagerly awaiting more but there is nothing here for newcomers.Update for Book 2: Not much happens again, apart from very slowly walking around on pointless ""side quests""I'm really hoping the story picks up soon.

												LIKED: loved,  loved this game, very story rich, which kept me intested and waiting for next chaptershowever.....DISLIKED:  the frame rate issues were horrendous for me, the first chapter was not too bad but the 2nd 3rd and 4th were. Iam seriously thinking about getting the ps4 version to play this game as I'm pretty sure the FR will be much much better on platform, that being said...I would still recommend this game , maybe your PC  is much better than mine			"

												I bought this when it had a lot of negative reviews, and boy am i glad i did !This turned out to be one of the most awesome games i have ever played and truely in the spirit of the TLJ and DF:TLJ.The game is very beautiful visually and is very story rich. Music is really awesome but i have mixed feelings about the voice acting since in some cases like zoe its really good and in some others... well it isnt.The change of scenery in the game is really great and very much like the original games. You will experience all sorts of environment from the typical dystopian steam punk to a narnia like land of magic and more (i dont wanna spoil anything).My only suggestion to you is that if you like adventure, or if you liked the original series go and get this game. Dont pay attention to the negative reviews. This game is an EXTREMELY satisfactory answer regarding the many many unanswered questions that you might have had in the previous games and the answers are not half baked or shallow.Thank you red thread. but be aware that ""one"" book is not going to cut it. we want more !

												I held off for a long time on buying this game because I just didn't know if it was for me.  Then I saw that The Longest Journey, and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey were on sale and just decided to hell with it.  I have to mention that I'm a stickler for details, so the first game kind of annoyed me, but the story was great which in turn made me want to find out what happens to April and the rest. Second game introduced me to Zoe (took me a while to warm up to her) but then within minutes I was once again captured and played the game all the way through. Now, Dreamfall Chapters comes along and just rocks my world, I love the choices and concequences you have to live with and the story once again is riveting, I can only recommend this game and the first two, especially if you love a good story.  I know this turned into a rant, but hell, it's worth it, trust me.  AMAZING GAME, graphically as well as Gameplay :)			"

												I can't recommend this game highly enough.  I'm an avid gamer and trend toward games with a rich storyline.  This is the most awe-inspiring, emotional, story-driven game I've played in a long time.  It's likely that people returning to the series will get the most out of it since it picks up where the others left off.  HOWEVER, I think that the game world is good about filling in the most relevant gaps (thanks to an optional recap at the beginning).  The game world is magical, and the characters are so three-dimensional that it inspires you to laugh and cry right along with them.I cannot WAIT for the next chapter.  10/10**MINOR SPOILER with no specifics**:Just as a heads-up, it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger.

												Dreamfall Chapters, simply put, is the BEST episodic game I've played. Lush, wonderful story and characters, lengthy and meaty episodes, and rewarding and fullfilling. Dreamfall Chapters presents worlds you will want to explore long after the game is finished. As a plus, the developers are actually open about release date timings for future episodes. If you were a fan of Dreamfall or The Longest Journey, you are in familiar territory in Chapters. My personal favorite game so far this year.			"

												I love this whole series, and I find the Chapters installment to be quite engaging. It makes you think and care about the characters you're interacting with, and it makes you question whether or not you made the right choices. I seriously recommend the entire The Longest Journey series, and especially Chapters. But don't try to play Chapters without the first two. You won't really get it.			"

												Boy, oh boy, do I LOVE this game!If you loved the Choose Your Own Adventure books as a kid, this game is for you! Dreamfall Chapters is the third in a series of games (including The Longest Journey and Dreamfall The Longest Journey). After playing and really liking the first two games, I was excited to try this latest addition to the trilogy. The graphics of this game are so beautiful, and the story is so compelling, playing truly takes you into another world. You really end up caring about the characters in the game (you play as two different people, switching as the game goes on). But my favorite part is that throughout the game, you're faced with a decision that will change your character's circumstances, as well as the hearts and opinions of the others you encounter. Buy it, play it, love it! P.S.--In case you haven't played either of the two previous games, there's a quick video in the game which can get you up to speed with the story :) "

												Thus far Dreamfall Chapters is a thoroughly enjoyable adventure title with a choice and consequence style gameplay and stunning visuals. It stands as the third in a series of story rich games and benefits from the player having experienced those adventures. (The Longest Journey & Dreamfall: The Longest Journey)The story telling in this and the previous games are second to none, with the developers going to great lengths to provide a strong history and back story to the characters and worlds they have created. This series really draws you in, and the choice and consequence element to this game ensures that the player truly feels involved with the actions of the protagonists. The Story telling in Dreamfall Chapters is wonderfully enhanced by the quality of the visual representation of two unique worlds, and a solid soundtrack.I highly recommend this game to everyone, but the players who will get the most out of this title are Adventurers who enjoy playing games driven by an original and compelling plot, involving genuinely likeable and relatable characters!Although the series is not complete, this game sets the stage for an intense crescendo of an incredible journey.I can only hope people enjoy playing this as much as I am.

												Ok, what can I tell about this game... It has a very complex story and that's a good thing. But complex stories must be effective, and unfortunatly Dreamfall Chapters goes to something really bad. I was really waiting for a great game, but after playing the final book, I decided to give only 3 stars for this game. The final book it's really short and the gameplay is almost nonexistent. I'm really sad for that, because I played all the chapters waiting for a very well developed conclusion inside the storie of all characters but it was too much marketing for nothing... The graphics are really nice, the songs are amazing, but if a storie is very complex, it has to be well told or it will become nonsense.  I expected more for this game...			"

												I wanted to give this game thumbs up, but after I finished it and compared it to the original Longest Journey (1999) I simply cannot do that.While the original game is the best adventure game I have played so far, this installment cannot keep up in anything. The adventure and puzzles are too simplified and the transition to 3D which felt awkward in previous Dreamfall feels the same way in Dreamfall Chapters. Missing facial expressions of characters add even more frustration to the story moments. Cutting the whole story into books was fine but problem is that the books were not even remotely equal quality-wise. I remember mostly book 1 and 4, the other ones do not contain any memorable moments. The closure of the story also felt odd - leaving out some moments that would be interesting for the story (like return to Azadir, what happened to Saga after her shift at the end of book 4 and between the book 5?). Instead player is forced to live some boring moments which could have been left out.Thumbs down and I would rather recommend everyone to play the original Longest Journey and forget that those 2 installments even exist.

												Beautiful game with an engrossing story and interesting characters. Gameplay is fun but minimal, especially in the fifth book  which is very much a visual novel type experience.  I especially liked the choices and consequences summary at the end of each book.I enjoyed the first game, couldn't get on with the second (due to controls) but I thoroughly enjoyed this for around 50 hours and would happily recommend.The only real negatives I found we're the slow movement speed, which could have done with being just a bit speedier; I also found the inability to jump a little strange and was still pressing speace to no avail towards the end of the game.

												I've been a long time fan of this series and this game stays true to it adding tons of wonderful backstory and both old and new characters. The only downfall was the large worlds to explore without easy access to a map, it is quite easy to get lost in a few sections. This in no way dulls the game itself though.			"

												After playing The longest journey, Dreamfall and Dreamfall chapters I have made up my mind on this game. Although I generally do not recommend it, there are plenty of good parts and it's a decent story. However, be aware that it's highly advised you play TLJ and Dreamfall before playing Dreamfall chapters. PROS------------ Decent and (sometimes too) expansive story.- Probably the only game out there whose single story was told over 3 games and over 15 years to tell.- Voice acting is pretty good and the characters are interesting.- SOME good jokes.- Crow.CONS-------------- In the end, choices don't seem to matter much and don't affect the main story.- Good number of lose ends left unexplained. The devs seem perfectly fine with that and acknowledging the fact that stuff needs to be explained. For example one of the most mysterious characters tells that he/she will explain everything but the player never gets to hear any of it. With Book 5 being very very likely the last entry for The longest journey series, they could've used this to tell and explain everything. Yet, they choose to end the game like they did. With even more questions...That's fine with some people I guess, but not for me.  If I wanted to guess, then I wouldn't need to even listen to the story.- Devs did a poor job at reminding everyone about the story so far. Sure we have a recap now,  but it's far from perfect (and doesn't recap TLJ). A lot of times you will need to remember stuff from 1999 and 2006 to fully get what's going on.- Some attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. Especially the sex related jokes.- Book 5 has no gameplay. You just walk and talk, with a wild puzzle here and there. This would be fine, plenty of games have only that and they're pretty good. However, since choices don't matter much and Dreamfall: TLJ had simple combat mechanics, it feels like shame not placing them in (especially since you control a strong warrior character).- Some characters seem very bland and one-dimensional. Also there are times when characters say something that doesn't really seem in line with their persona (sometimes for joke purposes)The game has  a lot of merits I guess and a very good basis for storytelling. However, the execution could've been done a lot better and the bad sides really stand out and sometimes overshadow everything else. Dev's expectation that we remember most of the story so far didn't help the story telling aspect at all.			"

												I played Longest Journey and Dreamfall, I loved them! This one is no exception.A rich story, which left me wanting more after each book. I cannot wait to see how the story will unfold. I'm really excited to be reunited with characters from the previous games as well. Abnaxus! Crow <310/10Also Kian... what a dish!			"

												I like this game, and its pretty good for the story. But its really hard finding things, or finding puzzles when the game doesn't tell you much. I had no idea I had to like get a robot to block a cop's view from seeing me without just looking it up on google. XD It's an interesting story, and you get to pick and choose what you want your character's to do. The chapters are all pretty long and worth it. You can play this game before playing the others or do what I did. Play this game in for 4 chapters and then play and finish number two  and only play about 3 mins of one. It makes your love for the game even stronger. Thanks for creating this game			"

												I admit I'm a huge fan of the previous two games, but even discarding that, the plot, music, and voice acting are absolutely engrossing in this game. Throw away the usual two dimensional decisions you usually get presented with in this style of game; you'll make decisions that although you know are right will cause a lot of problems down the line and have repercussions you can't imagine. The worst thing I can bring up is that I'll never be able to say ""welding"" without splitting the syllables ""I like Wel-ding!"". It'll make sense when you get there, honest!Give it a go, you won't be disappointed!			"

												This is the Longest Journey. I mean, need I say more? The narrative is excellent, the gameplay is enjoyable, but a bit quirky, but like I said, the narrative is so great, you're going to forgive the gameplay quirks if you have a  love of great characters and writing. With that said, I'm now concluding my run-on sentence.  "

Great story, great characters and great emotions.If you like games like ""Live is strange"" this game is for you. The persons and the diaolgs are well written, Ragnar Tørnquist wanted to know if he can do the magic trick again with ""his"" universe (""The longest journey"")And he can.You can play the game short or poke around in every corner and play all possible different storylines. (I spent 50 hours for 2 chapters to see all dialogs...)Cost benefit ratio of the game: high!			"

												Although I can't see this game getting mass market appeal It was my best game of 2014 and I would recommend it to anyone. Also just the first chapter provides a ton of gameplay and is longer than the first chapters of many other episodic games, a.k.a. the walking dead games and so on. The game is packed with unique features and has AAA voice acting that is crazy good. The writing is quite possibly some of the best in any game ever. It is very much a story driven game however; the game is in your choices, although it does have some little puzzles that were fun. I've heard people complain about the lack of challenge to I’d say: you're missing the point entirely. Just think of it as a really detailed interactive film and you're closer to understanding what the game is about. I can't wait to play the next episodes; I've played through book 1 twice. It has some replayability but like I said before that's not really what this type of game is about. Fantastic game, I'm predicting that it will be one of my top 10 games of all time upon the release of all the episodes. 10/10 would buy.			"

												Book One of the dreamfall chapters is wonderful reintroduction to the worlds of Stark and Arcadia. Although you might think there is not much to be done and the chapter is quite short it prepares ground for the future events really well. I became soon again interested in game characters and I´m looking forward to the next chapters. The visuals are nice and although not necessarily next-gen the presentation is rich with an attention to detail. I really think the Unity gave developers a lot of hard times and the performance varies from machine to machine. RTG is trying really hard to squash the bugs and my gameplay was pretty much bug free. Also I must compliment the voice actors. I played Dreamfall right before chapters to recap the events and I must say that I missed the original cast a lot. It took some time to get used to the new voices, but I must admit they did terrific job. As a long fan of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall I´m very happy.My thoughts after finishing the gameI waited two years for the final chapter of the game. And it´s been about ten years since I watched ending credits of Dreamfall : The Longest Yourney with my mouth wide open, desperately wanting to know what happens next. It was a long wait but I daresay well worth it. Ragnar Torquist and his team shaped a magical world with many likeable characters and Dreamfall Chapters conlude their story well. At least for most of them.If you are a fan of The Longest Journey and it´s sequel the this game is a must. For others - well, be warned that this game is not for everybody. If you want action, cutting edge graphics and lengthy cutscenes and dialogues bore you then this game is not for you. If you enjoy a good story then give Dreamfall Chapters a chance. Also you should get previous two games too.I must commend RTG that they were able to put this off.  As a small and independent game studio that picked up things as they went - each chapter in the game is getting better and better. After the book four I simply couldn´t stop playing and mind you, being ten years older now, this is a very rare for me. This story and it´s characters will always have a special place in my heart.

												My rating for Dreamfall Chapters, Book One - Reborn: 85/100This title promised us amazing mixture of medieval fantasy world and dark cyberpunk sci-fi reality set in year 2220. Also it was about to show various choices and everywhere-present consequences. Three worlds, two stories, one destiny. Lets see the realisation in detail.Story is pretty rich, even more due to two main characters - Zoë Maya Castillo and Kian Alvane. Their choices and decisions are shapng the world around them and even himself/herself and also other main character. There is also a possibility to remind you what happened in previous games, so you can be well informed. There are a lot of aspects to solve, with the dark feeling, that something is coming. Joy and happines is well balanced with sadness and despair, even anger and revenge. For every choice, there is a consqeuence, you just have to find out.Characters are strong and abundant in their personalities. Zoë is changing from scared and happy-go-lucky teenager to a responsible and courageous woman, what brings here one of most positive elements. Strong female protagonist. Also Kian is transformed from zealous religious fighter to the defender of weak and opressed. Episodic chracters are helpful and specific. For me, the strongest one was Teta Queenie (czech word for aunt), who forced us to make very serious statement.Visuals are nice and realistic, art is catching and graphic is set to support the story and background in the game. Moods  and acts are reflected very accurately. However, there were some funny glitches, but it nothing disrupting the gameplay.Soundtrack is composed by Simon Poole and truly said, it is a masterpiece. Piano, reasonable amount of remix and other instruments with dramatical choirs are goind right under the skin and makes you feel like you were in another world. Exactly there this game takes you.Gameplay was heartwarming, it is mostly adventure with puzzles to solve. Quests are not easy, but solvable, you have to earn your success and sometimes try a bit harder. Game provides you a huge number of various interactions, commented with thougts of main characters. By the way, you can even control a baby here! Choices are differed to lesser and main, second one have ""balance"" symbol next to them, so you can see, how your friends and rest of the world decided. In the end, all your decisions will be sum up with commentary what you can expect in the following episode.To sum it up, Dreamfall Chapters, Book One - Reborn, is a decent and proud member of the Dreamfall Saga and all, what they promised, they fullfilled, sometimes even overcame. I am glad, this was picked up from the Steam Greenlight, it is an exact sequel, how it should be.Recommended and I can not wait for book two.			"

												This game is fantastic, a great game to play with your girlfriend or wife.The developers were able to take all the loose ends (and there were many) from the previous game and somehow tie them all up into a coherent storyline.  If you've played the previous games, don't hesitate to purchase this one.  Pros:  Girl/Guy friendly.  Two stories entertwined, one with a girl protagonist and one with a guy protagonist, one in the past, one in the future.  There's a little bit of everything here for most individuals.  Book 1 was slow getting started, but Book 2 is much better.  Highly recommend you play this with somebody!Note:  The game is somewhat demanding of system resources and if you are not over the minimum system specs you might not be able to play.  If that's the case, feel free to watch our let's play

												This is breathtaking. I haven't been so wowed by a city since Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Europolis, like Newport, pulses with a life that makes you wish you could explore forever. I spent a couple of hours just wandering around. Even with my tablet struggling to maintain 800x600 resolution it was a stunning experience. One of my favorite parts of this series is the ""real life"" pacing of the opening chapters; it is so refreshing to just be able to talk and eavesdrop and quietly enjoy such a rich world that subtly feeds your curiosity. The German translation is pretty good, though there is one conversation where the subtitles and speech are completely messed up. Other than that, and the lack of proper save games, I have nothing to complain about. It could be a little confusing if you haven't played the first games, but if you have? Man oh man. What a beautiful and compelling continuation to the story. Can't wait for the next chapters to be released. Great work.			"

												At long last, the continuation of the Dreamfall story which left us all hanging for nearly a decade.I am truly enjoying the exceptional storytelling offered by this Adventure game and it's gameplay mechanics.I'm quite glad that the frivolous and immersion-breaking combat of the original Dreamfall is not making a return from Dreamfall Chapters.Was able to play through Book 1 with a mid-range 4-year old GPU and a first-gen Intel i5 CPU. With the latest patches that give us better graphical quality control, you can disable shadows and a few other settings to make it playable on even less powerful platforms. I was able to run the game on a Surface Pro 1st-gen (Intel Integrated GPU); albeit there were some problems with the lens-flare effect blocking out the screen (I think the latest patch allows you to disable lens-flares though).Anxiously awaiting Book 2 and beyond~			"

												Here we have the character from the second game with the vibe of the first game, which had a lot more cyber punk theme going on.Might be the best game as far as decision making goes. Reminds me of The Witcher, in a sense that you do feel like every decision is very important and does really make a difference, unlike mass effect, for instance. Of course, we will have to wait and see how the other parts of the game ends, but so far, the game does it even better with the dialog and the way it presents the choices and making you feel the responsible for them.Reload? Funny.. there's no saving around, you do stuff and live with it.Feels kinda buggy sometimes. If you click around too much it'll play many recordings at the same time making it impossible to understand and thus annoying once in a while. It's minor though.All in all, maybe it needs a little polishing, but so far it exceeds expectation for someone who has been waiting for a sequel for years. "

												First, it's beautiful. Second, in 20 years that I'm playing adventure games, not once have the internal dialogues made complete sense in the flow of events. There was always something off, feeling unnatural. But here, somehow, they managed to avoid this. Amazing.The only thing that I truly hated was playing as a f-ing baby. I absolutely hate when games make me do that.			"

												If you have any fondness at all for the TLJ franchise, tis is a must-buy. If not, please know that this game and its franchise is the home of some of the best writing in video games. The story is epic, and the character writing is on par with the best of Bioware. Dreamfall Chapters is a gorgeous game that goes to unexpected places and spins a captivating yarn there. I would suggest playing Dreamfall first, which is another game well worth your time, because a prior investment into the story elevates Dreamfall Chapters from a good time at the games to a great time at the games, but if you enjoy getting to know deeply sympathetic characters in a vibrant world (two vibrant worlds, actually), this is a game for you.

												Been waiting for this, for an eternity finally it came and it delivered already finished book 1, can't wait for book 2. i might even go back and complete it several times before it comes out, just don't really know if it messes with my save file. but if you love adventure games, TLJ series is in my opinion the best out there, and in several others i know its top 3.if you are looking for a great story, but don't want to read a book great all three games The Longest Journey, The Longest Journey: Dreamfall and Dreamfall: Chapters. it will be well worth your time, but most likely only if you love stories, a great universe and mind blowing theories about how maybe our universe could be setup, feel free to call me crazy but in a way i do wish Stark and Arcadia would be the real universe, they might be violent but so is our world it resembles Stark quite a bit, and then Arcadia still a harsh and violent place but with magic and no tech, at least to begin with.any who, i love this series and if you are open minded and want to have a good experience while getting a great story told to you, while you puzzle around fixing problems, this this is most likely for you.

												If you enjoyed Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, then like me, you have been waiting for this game for years.  It is finally here!  Well... Book One (of 5) at least.  As I write this, Book Two is in production, and I expect we won't have to wait too long.  Before starting Chapters, my daughter and I played through the Longest Journey and Dreamfall: TLJ .  It was her first time playing the games, and a good refresher for me on everything that has happened.  It really got us pumped for Chapters, so we dove right in.First of all, the game is gorgeous, at least on Awesome settings (I'm running a Geforce 680 and performance was good).  Maybe this is the first game I've played with ""next-gen"" graphics, but I am in awe.  Book One starts off strong, then slows down a bit before an interesting ending.  There is an emphasis on choice, borrowing some concepts from The Walking Dead games, and this makes the game stronger and more replayable.  The series has an intentional mundaneness in the beginning to help players connect with the characters.  In the context of one book, it feels a little slow, but as the other books come along, I expect things will pick up.Definitely recommended.  If you haven't played Dreamfall: TLJ, you would probably want to play it first.  The Longest Journey (the first game) is probably less of a requirement to understand this one, but it is one of the all-time greats, so you should play it anyway. :)-------------------Book Two is bigger and better than the introductory episode.  It doesn't necessarily pick up the pace, because it is a longer book and is still building intrigue.  There are plenty of good conversations and puzzles, mixed in with a few slow parts.  You spend more time in Arcadia this time around, but it doesn't neglect time with Zoe in Stark.  By the end, plenty has happened and you will have made many decisions.  The cliffhanger ending will leave you scatching your head a bit, and wondering what is going to happen next.  Can't wait for Book Three.-------------------Things kick up a notch in Book Three.  It doesn't take as long to complete as Book Two, but things move along at a faster pace. There is good character development, and you'll start to see the impact of previous decisions.  At the same time, it is decidedly ""the middle of the story"" and continues to setup for subsequent chapters.-------------------Book Four is the best so far and reminded why I fell in love with The Longest Journey series in the first place. On the critical side, this is the first time I felt the game really suffered from being released in episodes rather than all at once.  This was compounded by a long delay between books due to a game engine upgrade that affected all previous books.  My memory sucks, but my daughter also forgot a major character and plot point from previous books.  We had to go back to YouTube to refresh our memories on something that happened in Book 2.  Besides that, things are coming together.  This is the most engrossing so far, while still having a head-scratcher ending.  I'm looking forward to the final book.-------------------There were tears in my eyes as my daughter and I finished Book Five. This book wraps up Dreamfall Chapters, Zoe's story, and an entire saga that started 17 years ago.  Indeed, The Longest Journey has finally come to an end. I find myself simultaneously satisfied, nostalgiac, and sad that it's over. It isn't often a game engenders this strong of a response, but Ragnar Tornquist and his team at Red Thread have pulled it off.  Taken as a whole with The Longest Journey and the first Dreamfall, I believe we have a true masterpiece.  Book Five is light on gameplay, but this is the payoff for all the decisions you've made in the first four books.  Sit back, take it all in, and enjoy.  The devs did a fine job dividing the game into five books, but there is no doubt it will be best experienced all played together.  I plan to do just that.  This was my daughter's playthrough, so I want to play again making my own choices.  I'll play through the first two games as well to experience the complete journey one more time.			"

												Book One of the dreamfall chapters is wonderful reintroduction to the worlds of Stark and Arcadia. Although you might think there is not much to be done and the chapter is quite short it prepares ground for the future events really well. I became soon again interested in game characters and I´m looking forward to the next chapters. The visuals are nice and although not necessarily next-gen the presentation is rich with an attention to detail. I really think the Unity gave developers a lot of hard times and the performance varies from machine to machine. RTG is trying really hard to squash the bugs and my gameplay was pretty much bug free. Also I must compliment the voice actors. I played Dreamfall right before chapters to recap the events and I must say that I missed the original cast a lot. It took some time to get used to the new voices, but I must admit they did terrific job. As a long fan of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall I´m very happy.My thoughts after finishing the gameI waited two years for the final chapter of the game. And it´s been about ten years since I watched ending credits of Dreamfall : The Longest Yourney with my mouth wide open, desperately wanting to know what happens next. It was a long wait but I daresay well worth it. Ragnar Torquist and his team shaped a magical world with many likeable characters and Dreamfall Chapters conlude their story well. At least for most of them.If you are a fan of The Longest Journey and it´s sequel the this game is a must. For others - well, be warned that this game is not for everybody. If you want action, cutting edge graphics and lengthy cutscenes and dialogues bore you then this game is not for you. If you enjoy a good story then give Dreamfall Chapters a chance. Also you should get previous two games too.I must commend RTG that they were able to put this off.  As a small and independent game studio that picked up things as they went - each chapter in the game is getting better and better. After the book four I simply couldn´t stop playing and mind you, being ten years older now, this is a very rare for me. This story and it´s characters will always have a special place in my heart.

												Amazing start to the new Dreamfall series, but geez, is it ever short. If you liked the Longest Journey and Dreamfall, you'll like chapters. You'll like it briefly. Even getting stuck at one point and generally taking my time exploring and examining everything, I still managed to finish the game in only a handful of hours. It feels more like a prologue to a longer game, which it is, so hopefully the next installment has a bit more meat.			"

												Although I can't see this game getting mass market appeal It was my best game of 2014 and I would recommend it to anyone. Also just the first chapter provides a ton of gameplay and is longer than the first chapters of many other episodic games, a.k.a. the walking dead games and so on. The game is packed with unique features and has AAA voice acting that is crazy good. The writing is quite possibly some of the best in any game ever. It is very much a story driven game however; the game is in your choices, although it does have some little puzzles that were fun. I've heard people complain about the lack of challenge to I’d say: you're missing the point entirely. Just think of it as a really detailed interactive film and you're closer to understanding what the game is about. I can't wait to play the next episodes; I've played through book 1 twice. It has some replayability but like I said before that's not really what this type of game is about. Fantastic game, I'm predicting that it will be one of my top 10 games of all time upon the release of all the episodes. 10/10 would buy.			"

												I shall have to lend credence to the game's subtle homage to such books as ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and ""A Wind in the Door"". The concept of a hidden dream universe within a Eutopian/Dystopian universe lends an ominous aire of mystery to the first person adventure genre. The atmosphere of these games paints a beautiful, disturbing and haunting picture of the possibilities of alternate universes. One must stretch their imagination somewhat to fully appreciate this franchise. Especially if one is not particular to the heavily story and dialogue driven adventure genre. If you are a fan of the adventure ga me genre, and are more interested in story than action, then this game will tickle your fancy on a deep and moving level. I would only recommend this game to someone who accepts story over action. However, if you are willing to accept these gaming parameters, you are in for one hell of a moving story. Unfortunately, to get the full emotional and psychological effect of this franchise, it is highly recommended you play all 3 games. My biggest problem with the new entry into this franchise is that the game is being released in overly expensive ""chapters"", rather than one solid sequel. As solid as this release is, I still feel the chapters are NOT worth nearly 30 dollars per chapter. A few hours of gameplay for 30 dollars economically just does not cut it for me. This sequel should have been released as one 20 or so hour game...a full game for 60 dollars or so. As it stands we will be paying at least 100 dollars to see this story to it's fruition.I have to recommend this sequel ONLY to those who have played the previous Dreamfall games. To anyone else? Save your money. These chapter released titles are only worthy of the most die-hard fans of this franchise. If you are a fan of the Dreamfall games and you want to see the story come to a possible fruition, if you are okay with story over action, then I highly recommend you invest in these chapters. If you love adventure games, and you've yet to play any other Dreamfall games, then forgo spending 30 dollars on each short adventure of the sequels. Summary, if you aren't a HUGE fan of the Dreamfall series, then wait until the company releases the entire series as a bundle on sale...you've been warned.			"

												My rating for Dreamfall Chapters, Book One - Reborn: 85/100This title promised us amazing mixture of medieval fantasy world and dark cyberpunk sci-fi reality set in year 2220. Also it was about to show various choices and everywhere-present consequences. Three worlds, two stories, one destiny. Lets see the realisation in detail.Story is pretty rich, even more due to two main characters - Zoë Maya Castillo and Kian Alvane. Their choices and decisions are shapng the world around them and even himself/herself and also other main character. There is also a possibility to remind you what happened in previous games, so you can be well informed. There are a lot of aspects to solve, with the dark feeling, that something is coming. Joy and happines is well balanced with sadness and despair, even anger and revenge. For every choice, there is a consqeuence, you just have to find out.Characters are strong and abundant in their personalities. Zoë is changing from scared and happy-go-lucky teenager to a responsible and courageous woman, what brings here one of most positive elements. Strong female protagonist. Also Kian is transformed from zealous religious fighter to the defender of weak and opressed. Episodic chracters are helpful and specific. For me, the strongest one was Teta Queenie (czech word for aunt), who forced us to make very serious statement.Visuals are nice and realistic, art is catching and graphic is set to support the story and background in the game. Moods  and acts are reflected very accurately. However, there were some funny glitches, but it nothing disrupting the gameplay.Soundtrack is composed by Simon Poole and truly said, it is a masterpiece. Piano, reasonable amount of remix and other instruments with dramatical choirs are goind right under the skin and makes you feel like you were in another world. Exactly there this game takes you.Gameplay was heartwarming, it is mostly adventure with puzzles to solve. Quests are not easy, but solvable, you have to earn your success and sometimes try a bit harder. Game provides you a huge number of various interactions, commented with thougts of main characters. By the way, you can even control a baby here! Choices are differed to lesser and main, second one have ""balance"" symbol next to them, so you can see, how your friends and rest of the world decided. In the end, all your decisions will be sum up with commentary what you can expect in the following episode.To sum it up, Dreamfall Chapters, Book One - Reborn, is a decent and proud member of the Dreamfall Saga and all, what they promised, they fullfilled, sometimes even overcame. I am glad, this was picked up from the Steam Greenlight, it is an exact sequel, how it should be.Recommended and I can not wait for book two.			"

												A really good story riched game, I must say. It takes Science Fiction and Fantasy together. Cyberpunk and Steampunk. Like in all story games, most choices you make will change the story in the future. Luckily there's a load option to go back and make the alternate choice to see if it's better or not.The environment and cityscapes is amazing. Truly defines the cyberpunk genre to its purest.			"

												This is breathtaking. I haven't been so wowed by a city since Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Europolis, like Newport, pulses with a life that makes you wish you could explore forever. I spent a couple of hours just wandering around. Even with my tablet struggling to maintain 800x600 resolution it was a stunning experience. One of my favorite parts of this series is the ""real life"" pacing of the opening chapters; it is so refreshing to just be able to talk and eavesdrop and quietly enjoy such a rich world that subtly feeds your curiosity. The German translation is pretty good, though there is one conversation where the subtitles and speech are completely messed up. Other than that, and the lack of proper save games, I have nothing to complain about. It could be a little confusing if you haven't played the first games, but if you have? Man oh man. What a beautiful and compelling continuation to the story. Can't wait for the next chapters to be released. Great work.			"

												This game is fantastic, a great game to play with your girlfriend or wife.The developers were able to take all the loose ends (and there were many) from the previous game and somehow tie them all up into a coherent storyline.  If you've played the previous games, don't hesitate to purchase this one.  Pros:  Girl/Guy friendly.  Two stories entertwined, one with a girl protagonist and one with a guy protagonist, one in the past, one in the future.  There's a little bit of everything here for most individuals.  Book 1 was slow getting started, but Book 2 is much better.  Highly recommend you play this with somebody!Note:  The game is somewhat demanding of system resources and if you are not over the minimum system specs you might not be able to play.  If that's the case, feel free to watch our let's play

Posted: December 25, 2014
												I am a big fan of the series, however after the 1st chapter I am not impressed. I only recommend this game because it is promising so much, but the first chapter is quite short (4 hours) and unconvincing.I remember how after minutes of the Longest Journey demo (back in 2000) I was totally absorbed by the game, it grabbed me from the beginning - the talking tree, April, everything made you care or curious right from the start.In Chapter 1 we start where Dreamfall ended, which is good, because I always felt that Dreamfall ended abruptly. However, I found the politics plot of this Chapter quite boring. In April's times, Stark had also funny parts (remember the detective or the rubber ducky), but this time it is just dark, dystopian and dull, it doesn't surprise with anything.I am sorry to say but after the 1st chapter I don't feel anything for the characters, which is a big letdown, TLJ series made you feel involved. Even the choice/consequence system, which is a great feature, doesn't make me feel more involved. The story so far is thin and the characters sketchy. The only character I liked on Stark in this chapter, worthy of the series, was the lady on the boat.I also don't like the fact that most characters swear a lot, unnecessary a lot.The part that I liked was the Arcadia bit. That's the world I want to see more, that's the place that made me love the series, not the dull slums of Stark. So I am hoping to see more of it.The graphics are quite good, but the drawback is that you need good hardware to play this game which started as a point and click adventure. Also, I don't like the interaction system, it reminds me of action games and it just gets in the way of exploring the details in an area. Which brings me to the quest/goals system.The action is linear, you get a quest (goal) like in an role playing game and you go from here to there like an errand boy (girl). So much for exploring. You don't need to explore and interact when everything points you towards your goal. The 1st chapter ended much to quickly. I finished the game after four hours, and my reaction was like ""come on, that was all""?I know that more and more games are using episodes to deliver the game, but in Dreamfall's case it is a bad idea. The time between episodes will just disconnect me from the story, it feels like spliting a movie in 5 and watching a bit every month.			"

The launch could have been better; there were a few technical problems, but those have been fixed in later patches, so I have no real complaints except that I wish they were all released so I  could play them through in one go.

												Pros: Great story and atmosphere, beautiful visual and audio design (including the music), returning characters from previous games in the series and there are consequences for the choices you makeCons: Episodic, quite a long wait between each episode so I recommend you wait until all are available. Also, the performance isn't great - lots of stutter and lag even on a GeForce 960 4GB card, probably related to the fact that this is a Unity Engine game and Unity is not known for semi-open world third person adventures.

Dreamfall Chapters is darker but not as suspenseful as Dreamfall. The choice and consequence element is very interesting. I like that there are consequences for your choices and actions although it does get old at times. Also, I couldn't tell what effect some choices had. I think the end of the game was not as good as the beginning, perhaps not flowing as well. I didn't quite feel like it brought full closure to the series but it did bring an end.			"

												An amazing story-based adventure game.If, like me, you missed the previous games (that would be: ""The longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall: the Longest Journey"") then play them. Together these games form one of the best stories in video-game history.If you do not wish to play these slightly older games... you see ""The Logest Journey"", which is the first game, is very old... 1999 old. Still playable, but you really don't ""have"" to play it. You can either watch a Lets-Play of it, or skip it all together.""Dreamfall: the Longest Journey"" on the other hand, is not skippable. Though you can definitly watch a Lets-Play of it (persoanlly I really liked Cryaotic's lets-play on youtube).DO IT. It's AMAZING.			"

												As a fan of the series, I am disappointed to write that I have been less than thrilled by Dreamfall Chapters. Apart from the obvious bugs and other problems following the first chapter's launch, the overall feeling of the game remains unpolished and, in some areas, downright sloppy. While the environments, character models, and animations are visually stunning, there are several moments throughout the first two chapters that weren't given the attention they deserved. For instance, there are many dialogue sequences throughout the game that feel unnatural or devote camera focus solely to a single character. It's possible that this is because the developers did not have enough time to fully animate the other characters in the conversation. This sort of oversight removes the player from the immersion they would otherwise feel while living through each character. In summary, the game looks great but feels tragically rushed. The complete lack of challenging puzzles makes the game feel more like a piece of interactive fiction than it's adventure-oriented predecessors. I would still (cautiously) recommend this title to any fan of the previous games.			"

												I have been waiting, just like other fans, years for this game. The game itself is absolutely brilliant, I love it. There is a whole world inside the game to play in and so much to see and do. But... This is just book one and it won't take you that much time to finish it. After all these years of waiting I'm wondering if I should have waited a bit longer untill all 5 episodes are released. But hey, I just couldn't wait anymore!Edit: finished the game and.... well... dissapointed actually.I see it more and more, brilliant adventure games that come out that are no longer advantures but more interactive movies. The storie is still brilliant. There is so much to see that I have spent hours on this game, but.... no objects you carry around without knowing what to do with it, not having 5 different ways to get to the same objective. There is just one way, yes, you get choices (in what you say or do) but that is just to make you feel like you have some influence on the game. Next time, just bring out the movie, I don't have to click with my mouse per se, I just wanted to know how the story ended....			"

												I've now played 1 to 4 and I have to say I'm waiting on 5. However, this game is not without its issues. It almost kills its playability with the rabbit warren city levels - making you run round seemingly just to pad out playing time and with no effective maps or directions to help (trust me they are not worth using). That aside, the plot is engaging the dialogue is good and retains the feel of the previous adventures. So, it did enough to get me through the dross and found the game they want you to play. Some fine tuning would make this game great as it is it's still good.			"

												Did you play ""The Longest Journey"" yet?DId you then play ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey?""If not, go play those two games first or the story won't make much sense to you.If you played those two games and did not like them, well then you should stay away from this one because it is a sequel.This game picks up a little while after the end of ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" which I will not spoil for those who haven't played it.  Let's just say it was a surprise to me when I played it.  You are still tasked with saving the world (or two worlds, depending how you look at it) and someone is still using people's dreams for evil purposes.  But in this game, you get to make choices along the way that change the way the story plays out.  There are several branching paths you might follow, but each choice is permanent!  Some changes are small, others have big impacts on the events around you.  It is a little bit like a ""choose your own adventure"" story in that sense.Bottom line:  this game is a bit different from its predecessors.  In some ways it is better, in other ways I personally prefer one of the other two in teh series.  Do you like adventure games?  Do you like some suspense - rarely knowing how your choices will play out in the long run?  Do you like solving puzzles with seemingly random (and sometimes borderline insane) item combinations?  Do you want to be a super-hero who can walk in and out of other people's dreams?  If you said yes to those questions AND you enjoyed the first two games in this series, then you need to play this game.  I'm not sure what they're charging for it these days but I got it on sale.  Totally worth $15 or $20 I think.			"

												I've always enjoyed point n click adventure games of old.  The classic Lucas Arts and Sierra ""Quest"" games are great examples of the best in the genre.  These classics we're the inspiration for the future games like The Longest Journey (TLJ), which is my all time personal favorite of the genre.Dreamfall Chapters is the 3rd game in the saga, and as of now the conclusion to the series.  There are rumors about a 4th game, but unfortunately it appears our time in Arcadia & Stark and places in between have come to it end.  This saddens me because these worlds, characters, and stories they tell are so beautiful told I'm always left wanting more at the end.  However, if there isn't another TLJ game in our future this episodic conclusion to the franchise is a beautiful swansong.  While it leaves a few questions unanswered for potential sequel opportunities, it suffices to bring closure to major plotlines introduced in the 2nd game of the franchise.  Let's hope they try another kickstarter for a 4th game.  I'm not ready to leave these worlds behind to memories.  I want to revisit them in the future and see what our familiar friends are up to.We can dream for a continuation of this story, and if it's one thing this game has taught us it's... dreams can change the world.

												Short Version: If you still need closure from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, buy this game on sale but don't expect much in the way of gameplay. If you've never played Dreamfall or the original Longest Journey, play them first. Chapters won't make much sense without them.Longer Version: I loved the first two games, but I'm so very disappointed in Chapters.Everything I loved about the first two games feels like it's missing. The characters are bland, the puzzles are a joke and practically nonexistent, the environments feel strangely empty, the dialogue is sooo awkward (seemed quirky/funny at first, but now just annoying), and the story has become dull and lost all momentum.There is finally a bit of closure for Dreamfall fans out there at the end of Book 5, but it doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess of a game.

												Great voiceacting and a lot of visual attention to detail, lots of polish and memorable characters - Dreamfall Chapters delivers where other adventures often fall short. Add a lot of choice moments with permanent consequences to this great fantasy game and you have a lot of replay-value on top of all that. Dreamfall is one of the best games in the ""Longest Journey"" series. This game is quite literally ""long"" as well, as each individual chapter of the 5 books gives you a lot of game to chew on.However - same as me - you'll often find yourself hard-pressed to play the precesessors (""The Longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall : The longest Journey"") in order to get all the references, of which this game has a plenty. That said you can enjoy this game without any knowledge of its predecessors, but you might miss out on some subtle details and reoccuring characters.But still: When it comes to good adventures this is one of the best to mention. Most definitely amongst my Top 10, right up there with Monkey Island and Full Throttle in terms of memorable quality. If you haven't played ""The Longest Journey"" (part 1) yet, I'd highly recommend to do so. Part 2 can be skipped, as it was considered one of the weakest. But whatever you do: If you love adventures, don't skip out on this one!			"

												I've got to know Dreamfall Chapters because I had interest in playing The Longest Journey adventure game, so I got it and its sequels (Dreamfall: TLJ and Chapters) as well during a Steam's sale.The game follows up the events of Dreamfall: TLJ, expanding Zöe Castillo's  and Kian Alvane's stories, divided into 5 books (episodes), leading to a invevitable conclusion of the TLJ saga as a whole.Chapters mantains a similar gameplay style as its immediate predecessor (Dreamfall: TLJ) but with significant improvements (no more awful fighting engines) while adopting the modern interactive episodic adventure style. In this aspect, what the game offers is not new at all: make decisions which might or might not affect your way forward and lead to different conclusions. As all this kind of games, they focus strength on the plot, the setting and how both develop during gameplay.I liked the game but I would recommed it mostly to people who have played previous installments on the TLJ saga as it seats solidly on its backgroud story. If you are a modern episodic adventure game fan, I'm sure you will enjoy it as well, but not certainly in the same way if you've followed the complete story, or at least played the previous Dreamfall game.For those of you expecting to get a closure or explanation of events on The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: TLJ games, Chapters will give you what you want and well delivered, in my opinion.

												The developers cared more about stuffing the game with leftist propaganda, than making it an enjoyable gaming experience or telling a good story.- The baffling design choice of making the player walk so much through a city before reaching a location, where the story progresses is supposed to happen might be relevant in an open-world RPG/sandbox game, and here it just wastes your time.- The devs decided that dull puzzles are supposed to make you enjoy the game more. However, I didn't feel proud of myself figuring out, that I should ""pick up that thingy and using it on that thingy"", I felt like I'd rather be playing a TellTale game instead and play a proper puzzle game when I'll want to solve puzzles and not be bored to death while at it.- The characters just stand there blankly staring forward during dialogues, even when voice overs are dramatic and believable, their poker-face and default idle pose just kills it. Character animations are only done in segments, when the scene wouldn't make sense at all otherwise.- The game looks slightly better than its decade-old prequel, yet the performance is quite poor.- The story is stuffed with heavily biased toward left political statements, while hardly gave me a reason to care about things that are going on, may the people who wrote it be haunted by Pepe.Avoid this game if you value your time and money, go play something made by Telltale, Microids or Harvester Games, you'll have a good time, better time for certain anyway. This mind-numbing abomination should've never been made.			"

												Gameplay-wise, it’s a point-and-click interactive movie thing with shallow and predictable characters. Think 3D visual novel, complete with writing that would only appeal to 13-year-olds, but without the frustrating story flags that end up killing you and all your loved ones because you made the wrong choice somewhere back in the second chapter. There are very few ways to really screw up in this game. It has very few puzzles (if you could call them that), and they mostly consist of finding and combining items or putting things in the right order. On the positive side, it still manages to make me curious about how things are going to play out, and there’s a little value in replaying the game to see how your choices influence what happens to individual characters (they generally make no difference in the grand scheme of things). The voice acting is quite good.I give it a 3.5/5 there. Entertaining, but far from a masterpiece.Where things really start to crumble though is the technical side. I’m not going to beat around the bush here, this thing’s a MESS and it tends to absolutely ruin the immersion. Graphically, the game looks comparable to titles released in 2006, only with slightly higher texture resolution, a lot of post processing, awful lighting, beginner mistakes (depth/alpha testing failure and z-fighting for instance), distance popping, broken shaders, and rigid, almost robotic character animations that are not timed or positioned correctly most of the time. But it needs a very high-end CPU and gigabytes of RAM to pull this off at acceptable framerates. And even if you have lots of RAM, at some point (roughly 4 GB), performance just falls off a cliff as the garbage collector struggles to deal with all the memory fragmentation because someone thought they didn’t have to care about memory management with a game written using .NET. Nothing could be further from the truth. This seems to happen with a lot of Unity-based titles, so future gamedevs take note—GC’d languages are not a silver bullet. VSync is dysfunctional (probably due the unstable framerate; didn’t attempt to pin down the cause), mouse grabbing does not work properly (cursor leaves the window if you move it too quickly). The list goes on and on. In two hours of gameplay, I hit the “Report Bug” button about a dozen times (as of version 4.1.1). It’s frustrating, to say the least.I still give it 2/5 points here because at least it hasn’t crashed so far, so it’s not totally unplayable.Overall, I don’t think I can recommend this game as it is. I might have reconsidered if the developers had fixed some of the major technical flaws (instead of just the symptoms, like Propast completely wrecking performance in earlier versions), but apparently that is either not very high up on their list of priorities, or they simply lack the expertise to do so.

												It is a shame that Steam only offers a binary choice for recommending a game, which means that it's not possible to distinguish between ""a bit on the boring side"" and ""completely unplayable trash"". This game is more on that former side. On a scale from 0 to 10 (where 0 is absolutely horrendous unplayable utterly broken, and 10 is one of the best and most enjoyable games I have played in my life), I would give this a 4. Because it falls just a bit under that ""completely average"" line, I have to give it a negative vote.The major problem I have with this game is that the tasks and puzzles are simplistic, even trivial, and completely unimaginative and outright lazy. It's like no effort whatsoever was put into them, and they were slapped onto the game with no thought or inspiration or effort put into them.What is worse, it seems that no playtesting whatsoever was done on some of the puzzles because, while trivial and unimaginative, some of them can still make you run around for an hour and just not find what you are looking for, for the simple reason that the game literally gives you zero hints of where you have to go or what you have to do. For example, one of the tasks is finding an NPC who is normally at a vending cart, but is not there anymore. No hints whatsoever are given where exactly you should be looking. You can run around the city for hours, looking in every single corner and every single place, and the NPC will be nowhere to be found. Then you look at an online guide and it turns out that you had to check a box behind the vending cart, which contains some receipt, and by taking the receipt that NPC suddenly appears at a location somewhere else in the city... a location you probably checked three times already. The NPC now just magically appears there after you take the receipt. That box is inconspicuous, and unless you happen to stumble across it by chance, chances are that you are going to miss it and waste hours in a wild goose chase. And the ""solution"" is completely nonsensical. (It may have a semblance of sense in terms of storytelling, but as a puzzle it's nonsensical, trivial, needlessly hard with no actual rewarding challenge, and just bad. It's simply a question of whether you happen to check that one box or not.)And that's just one example.The story is also trying really hard to be deep and immersive, but ends up being quite shallow, slow-paced (which isn't helped by the wild goose chase ""puzzles"" you have to ""solve"") and a bit boring.At points I was tempted to just stop playing the game altogether (especially on that ""puzzle"" I described above). I don't find this game all that interesting. The story advances too slowly, and the ""puzzles"" are too trivial, lazy and uninteresting. There is no thought put into them at all.That being said, it's not a horrible game. That's why I'm giving it a 4 out of 10, rather than somehing less.			"

												It is a shame that Steam only offers a binary choice for recommending a game, which means that it's not possible to distinguish between ""a bit on the boring side"" and ""completely unplayable trash"". This game is more on that former side. On a scale from 0 to 10 (where 0 is absolutely horrendous unplayable utterly broken, and 10 is one of the best and most enjoyable games I have played in my life), I would give this a 4.

												Dreamfall Chapters is a great dystopian story-based game where choices really matter.  This game is similar to games like Life is Strange.  The choices you make will determine the outcomes of events or relationships with other characters.  Sometimes a walkthough is helpful.  In one part of the story you're in a futuristic city.  In the other part of the story you're in a medieval town.  If you've played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (which I advise you play first) you'll know what I'm talking about.  If you're into adventure and trying to figure out what a shadow corrupt government is up to you will love this game.Pros- Very story rich.- Choices determine game events.- Gives you a choice to see what other gamers chose on important choices.- There are several ""books"" to this game, hence the name.- Futuristic and medieval environments.- Go against a shadow government.Cons- Bad language.  This isn't the only game I have that has foul language but it's plentiful in this game.  Very unnecessary toward the storyline.- Lense flares.  You can turn it on/off but I had to turn it off.  The lense flare visuals are very annoying.			"

												A quiet relaxed puzzle & consequence game. Hoever, I feel as though they've just tried to hard. The graphics is good great and glitchy, the voice acting and scripting is poor. The problem when developers strive into this area, is that I expect them to allow me to interact with everything, but you can't, so it just gets frustrating.Life is Strange, is much better and has a great story.

												The story may be rich, but many of the missions/puzzles are designed in such a silly way that they ruin all the fun of the game. For example, in Book Two, when Zoe walked out from the home, she was stopped by a robotcop, asking her who and where she was going to meet. If Zoe selects to resist, then most of the streets will be locked down. As the map system is terrible and I was not familiar with the streets, I spent two hours trying to find a route to get to the mission location (i.e., Dr. Roman's apartment) but just in vein. Eventually I had to give up and restart the mission all over again and change my response to the robotcop so that there would be less streets being locked down and so I could find the way to Dr. Roman's apartment. I was really pis*ed off by this ""route-finding"" mission.Furthermore, at the beginning of Book Three, what's the point to ask the player to collect the 9 drawings hidden everywhere in the house? What's the fun about it? Has anyone really enjoyed spending a couple of hours wandering around every room of the house for I-don't-know-how-many-times just to search for those well-hidden pieces of paper? Stupid things/missions like these keep making me to think whether I should continue to waste my life on this not-fun-at-all game. At the moment, I barely found all the 9 drawings by following the hints given in the Boork Three Walkthrough. I have a feeling that I will quit playing this game very soon.---I just realized that after finding all the 9 drawings, the next mission is to attach them on the wall in the ""right order"". How the hell can I know what is the ""right order"" when no hint at all is provided in the conversation? The design of the missions/puzzles really drives me crazy! Not recommend this game at all. 3/10, that's how I will rate this game.			"

												I was a fan of the original Longest Journey and (to a lesser extent) Dreamfall.  This game is a long-awaited finish to what is am amazing story.  I've finished it, and found that they did a great job painting the atmosphere and story.  This game is all about the story.  The graphics were good and the voice acting was top-notch.  I'm very curious to see where it goes from here.  If you would like a unique story and don't mind a game that isn't button-mashing, you should like this.The only complaints I have is that it's terribly short.  I finished the first book in under 5 hours.  I know it's episodic, but I really exptected more to start.  Also, the animations are a bit stiff.  Character movmement just doesn't look quite right.  The last thing remains to be seen.  I'm not sure if buying in gets you all of the episodes or if they will be charging for the rest of the game.  $30 is way too much if this is all you get, and you have to buy the others.  If you get at least 2 or 3 more books, then the prices is about right.			"

												So far, this is a wonderful experience. The graphics aren't exactly up to par with current PC and console games, but for me it's the story, seemingly forever unfinished and constantly unfolding, that keeps me coming back to the bridged worlds of Arcadia and Stark. After eight years of waiting for a cliffhanger to be resolved, it really feels like things are finally coming together. Even though only Chapter 1 has been released at the time of this review (and I admittedly seemed to whisk right through it, but I just couldn't stop playing) I cannot WAIT for the rest of the story. I'm so happy this was made, and I remain a fan of this series who finds themself immersed in the story, environments, and characters and I just want more and more.Bring it on~			"

												If you are a fan of the TLJ and it's sequel Dreamfall chapters but still somehow haven't bought this game... don't. Trust me this is an awful game I have ever played. For the following reasons: 1. It resolves nothing. And I mean nothing. In fact, it just adds characters and story elements which are never explained, and in the last episode we get 3, and I mean three very very obvious deus ex machina events to make sure our characters get some resolution, which is not a resolution cause nothing is actually explained. We have no clue who the Undreaming is, what is brian's goal, how did the prophet connect with the warticorp what is the connection of white dragon and April nothing. 2. The gameplay is utterly boring. And I mean boring! The puzzles are either too annoying or too easy. The maps are convoluted for no good reasons and aren't even that interesting and there is unnecessary politics added just to give the world more flesh, but it just makes it more frustrating and uninteresting. 3. The game is not that long and not at all worth the 30$ and is way overpriced. Overall. This was a terrible choice. I should have just let go of Dreamfall chapters and pretended like it will never be resolved. Instead, I got this. I have never been more disappointed.			"

												The animations on the characters are really really poor. Personally, it just takes me out of the experience. It seems like they have invested a huge amount of effort in creating lush environments and really refined characters and effects, then gave them to really inexperienced animators. The characters look awkward all of the time, and for a game with so much talking, it just becomes distracting... Which is a shame as I really enjoyed the original two games when I was much younger. Need to invest better resources in the animation for their next game.			"

												I never write reviews, but as a big fan of this series it seemed fitting this be my first review. The game honestly starts out strong reintroducing you to all the characters, but then it slows down and turns into a run here do this type of ""mission"" system. The various characters you run into along the way are defintely unique and interesting to interact with, but it does feel like unecessary deviations from the main story, almost like they are forcing you to do side missions you don't really want to do. I am in no way saying this game is bad, I defintely enjoyed revisiting this series but it's a slow start that hopefully escalates into an amazing story. The setting is there now just execute it and let's finish this amazing story that alot of us have waited years for.  "

This game is a true continuation of the longest journey series, and it brings out the best of it. The wit and humour even in the face of ominous circumstances and mysteries. The minutely conceived environments, where every poster on a street corner reveals something interesting about the characters and their world. The great voice acting! And most of all, the respect the game pays to the players' intelligence - that you're part of the game, and that the game is a story or a movie: entertaining, but not overly pretentious.I highly recommend this game if you want to experience a world and a story that you will remember forever.

												I'm totally stunned. I've found Dreamfall : The longest Journey 2013 in steam summer sale, and thought I should get it and have a try, could be nice - within 10 minutes I was totally fallen in love with the game. this year I bought and played The longest Journey (14 years old, pixelated graphics, but such an epic story, I couldn't stop ^^ ) and I literally screamed of joy when I saw Dreamfall Chapters was available to buy (after a long wait on my wish list) and I was so happy to finally start playing.Those graphics feel so epic, in my very own opinion, they can surely be a patch on other AAA Games released in this year (Despite some little bugs, which are in EVERY game !)Right at the beginning you're fully pulled into the story, you feel along with the characters, it feels for me as I would be in this world by myself.Still, it's just the first book with two chapters, but I knew from the first minute (as I am such a big fan of Zoe), that I love this game, and yes, I do. I'm really curious about how it goes on.For everyone, who likes the first and / or the second title of the series it is a 100% must.For all others, who like adventures, there is no way around this game - but I still recommend the first and the second title, first to know the story ( otherwise you'd be having some big question marks in your head) and second, they are fun too, doesn't matter how old they are.I rate this game 10/10 and it is my personal Game of the year 2014			"

												It took around 5 hours of my time, all I can say is it was well worth the wait, it bodes well for the comming books as in the last two games this is as enjoyable and simply a stunning game to look at and hear, good story in these games well written and spoken throughout.If you've never played them before pick up all three and await the coming books, this series is a hidden gem and I am really looking forward to how my choices will affect the story to come, just hope the devs put as much time and effort and love into them as they have the rest of the game series, truely a masterclass in story in the making.An easy 9.7/10 and that is me holding back.

												The story and voice work is good as ever although the pacing is painfully slow.  The quicktime event interactions can leave you pixel hunting at times to find the next interaction to move the story along.  Whether or not something has collision detection seems to be random, you will get caught up on one bucket or chair but not another, or walk right through a stack of boxes, and many invisble walls block movement.  I do not like 'open' worlds with invisble walls.Story, good, 9/10Textures and enviroment are nice, 9/10Voice acting good but super slow, 8/10Animation/graphics, low poly count hidden by textures, buggy movement, arbitrary/invisible movement barriers, 6/10Value,  (edit removed value concerns)edit: I am an animation coder so the twitches are not going to bother most people as much as me.

												So dreamy I almost fell asleep... Seriously I hope it gets better it is literally the most boring game I have played in ages. Stupid puzzles that don't make sense. One task was to find someone within propast with no clue as to where they might be, I literally ran around for an hour before finding them in a side street, that's not game play that's idiotic.... Even though I am a big fan of the originals I can't recommend this game.			"

												This game is still very much a graphical adventure game.  The multipath aspects of the game play add to the fun of choosing the path you believe in.  Still wondering what I did is going to effect the game in latter installments.The artwork is great, some very talented people worked on this game and it show.  Who knew you could have so much fun welding!Please remember that this game is getting released in episode format.  This first book is about a 4 - 5 hour play-though.  All the episodes are included for the one price.			"

												I never write reviews, but as a big fan of this series it seemed fitting this be my first review. The game honestly starts out strong reintroducing you to all the characters, but then it slows down and turns into a run here do this type of ""mission"" system. The various characters you run into along the way are defintely unique and interesting to interact with, but it does feel like unecessary deviations from the main story, almost like they are forcing you to do side missions you don't really want to do. I am in no way saying this game is bad, I defintely enjoyed revisiting this series but it's a slow start that hopefully escalates into an amazing story. The setting is there now just execute it and let's finish this amazing story that alot of us have waited years for.  "

												A beautiful storyline, gorgeous and immersive environments and great artwork at every corner. This game is a true continuation of the longest journey series, and it brings out the best of it. The wit and humour even in the face of ominous circumstances and mysteries. The minutely conceived environments, where every poster on a street corner reveals something interesting about the characters and their world. The great voice acting! And most of all, the respect the game pays to the players' intelligence - that you're part of the game, and that the game is a story or a movie: entertaining, but not overly pretentious.I highly recommend this game if you want to experience a world and a story that you will remember forever.

												I'm totally stunned. I've found Dreamfall : The longest Journey 2013 in steam summer sale, and thought I should get it and have a try, could be nice - within 10 minutes I was totally fallen in love with the game. this year I bought and played The longest Journey (14 years old, pixelated graphics, but such an epic story, I couldn't stop ^^ ) and I literally screamed of joy when I saw Dreamfall Chapters was available to buy (after a long wait on my wish list) and I was so happy to finally start playing.Those graphics feel so epic, in my very own opinion, they can surely be a patch on other AAA Games released in this year (Despite some little bugs, which are in EVERY game !)Right at the beginning you're fully pulled into the story, you feel along with the characters, it feels for me as I would be in this world by myself.Still, it's just the first book with two chapters, but I knew from the first minute (as I am such a big fan of Zoe), that I love this game, and yes, I do. I'm really curious about how it goes on.For everyone, who likes the first and / or the second title of the series it is a 100% must.For all others, who like adventures, there is no way around this game - but I still recommend the first and the second title, first to know the story ( otherwise you'd be having some big question marks in your head) and second, they are fun too, doesn't matter how old they are.I rate this game 10/10 and it is my personal Game of the year 2014			"

												Fantastic follow up to the previous games, very excited for upcoming chapters. The characters are interesting and well developed and each choice to be made makes the player think. Most impressive of all is the world, Prospast is a fascinating totalitarian regime city and feels like the kind of place that could exist. Mercuria was interesting and look foward to learning more lore as the game progresses. My one gripe is that the larger maps can sometimes be confusing to remember and on occasion I did find myself having to rely on guides or wandering aimlessly to discover my goal.

												Friend, do not give up at the start. If you are looking for an impressive hook, it fails completely at it. Do you recall Zoë? If you do not, many things in this segment will confuse and potentially upset you, as they did me. I took the time, after understanding just about nothing, to play Dreamfall:TLJ. I had played the original eons before, sparking my interest in this little thing, but I never got around to playing its sequel. To get a good grasp of Zoë's story, I'm afraid you need to. And if you have played the game, as I did, it will still frustrate you, as it should. Dreamfall: TLJ is perhaps the greatest example of blueballs I have ever seen immortalized in video games. The first half of the story establishes the character and the story, the next fourth sets the stage for the climax, and then... the final fourth of the game shows you just how horrifically rushed the game was. We rush through so much character development, so much of the climax (we effectively end on it), and the denouement is nonexistent: perhaps one story thread finds an actual resolution in the game, while many--such as Zoë's depression and feelings of aimlessness--are left open in the air. Completely unanswered, without so much as an indication of left or right. Here is where Chapters enters in and leads us on our journey. We meet Zoë again, and we expect the same old girl. And we do get it, in terms of the voice acting: the delivery of the lines is close, as well as her actual diction. She sounds like the same character, and certainly seems to see the world similar to her earlier version. Of course, she also suddenly has MAGIC DREAM POWERS to give the player something to do through our first chapter... because it, in itself, spends a lot of time TELLING US the resolutions to last game's questions. The dream sequence is not too terrible of an offender, beyond that it introduces us to a 'past Zoë' that never existed. Perhaps there were dialogue paths in the predecessor that I missed, but at no point was she a conceited, self-absorbed ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm not really sure why the first chapter ends with us 'accepting' this old Zoë that was just have to accept exists. Maybe she was a jerk before she quite her studies. Maybe the developers totally weren't trying to introduce some canned drama to the mix of an otherwise completely boring chapter. Kian Alvane is the other focal character of the game, and he is something of a tabula rasa. Let's be real, for a second: his character was an expense they just had to let go of in D:TLJ. All of his development was clearly supposed to come in the rising action and climax of the game where YOU KNOW WHO gets the spear, but it is so horribly rushed and his character shifts his ideologies so radically and so unrealistically... does a word of what he said in that game matter? The only thing of real importance would maybe be his affection for YOU KNOW WHO, but in this game he has deer girl. So really, nothing again. Here's the thing, though: this is good. In fact, this is great. Not at all understanding who Kian was from the predecessor did not really impact his story in the least, and I was so much more drawn in by it than Zoë's. Kian's story, in the first and the second book, is comprised of many different tropes all strung together in the unique canon of TLJ. It is, however, done -well-. The characters are fun and interesting, and though Kian is a fairly predictable character, that does not really matter. Honestly, his voice actor carries the role. The dilemmas he is put into are interesting, and the character's responses feel believable. Unfortunately, the first chapter rushes you into this dilemmas and spoon-feeds you tension, giving you only a few points at which to get a feel for the world or for however you would prefer to play Kian. While I was much more interested in his story than Zoë's at this point in the game (and playing D:TLJ does not change this), I still found it incredibly boring and insultingly similar to the telltale games formula. And there's no escaping this: every time you see 'CHARACTER WILL REMEMBER YOUR ACTIONS' flash atop the screen, you should be mildly frustrated at how horribly lazy that approach is.That is, of course, until the final chapter of book one. Its introduction is fairly bad, I will admit. A cutscene that would make metal gear solid rolls across, that TELLS THE PLAYER DIRECTLY THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THOSE PLOTHOOKS THAT WERE LEFT HANGING. This enraged me so much that I put the game down for a couple days--it is downright lazy storytelling. Zoë speaks to a counselor about what's happened to her, what she recalls, and what she does not recall--as well as the effect of her lengthy coma on her personal life and beliefs. Honestly, the consequences of that are fairly interesting--especially how her relationship with her father becomes more muddled (and this is one of the few instances where playing the earlier game changes something's impact). The problem is that we see none of them, and we are told absolutely every last one of them. Her therapist's office is also terribly boring, really emphasizing just how incredibly boring all of the talking angles are: someone stands in perspective, their head sometimes moving to 3/4ths as their eyes move around randomly. Sometimes they show emotion, but honestly the voice acting carries this♥♥♥♥♥♥ So. Hard. Think Bioware level of 'model behaves awkwardly,' and tone it down just a little and you're here. This all changes the instant you talk with the doctor or head out onto the street, and I mean this to the depths of my heart. The dialogue with the doctor is fun, believable, and Zoë's thoughts, presented to you before you make a decision, are honestly entertaining. The worldbuilding of Stark is incredibly visual, with a definite cyberpunk aesethetic revealed. And when the characters are used as tools to further the worldbuilding--describing, for example, the role of the EYE--it's done in a completely believable way. The characters are not looking at the camera and winking with a grin; they're living out their days. You are allowed to roam around a city's section and get acquainted for yourself with the nuances of the future. Given how closely the game modelled the incredibly restrictive and boring TTG model to this point, this caught me completely off-guard. And I almost had a heart attack when my seemingly inconsequential choices--you know, beyond the incredibly tacky YOUR CHOICE HERE WILL MATTER sign--actually altered the way that the plot progressed. This is perhaps what won me over the most at this point. Little details have considerable impacts. Yes, the direction of the overarching story does not change, but the stuff inbetween is altered. Characters take notice of your actions, and there are consequences in how they regard you. They also have different value systems--some prefer being lied to, while the others enjoy a brutal, hard truth. It's a refreshing touch to a genre that increasingly takes every effort not to create branching dialogue trees. My one complaint with the Stark sections is the journal: it tells you important things about what's going on in Zoë's life, and while they are interesting... they are also not really in line with Zoë. It's pretty obvious that somehow April Ryan is writing your notes, because they're written in the same eccentric way. April's diary in TLJ made sense and fit her character; Zoë's sortof sticks out like a sore thumb.Book two really won me over. Chapter 3, that last bit with Zoë, showed me potential: cool worldbuilding and realistic dialogue. When we start book three, we start with Kian. And this is really all I need to talk about: Kian's shot at a nonlinear environment. It's great. Characters are tropes, but excellently done tropes. I am out of space. Give this game time, and you will not be disappointed. It has flaws, but  weather the storm and you can be sure to be entertained by your choices' consequences.			"

												Let me review this with as much variety in dialogue as the game has.Tedious.Tedious.Tedious.Tedious.I'm sure there is an interesting story under it all but my lord it is so unbelievably repetitive, tired trope that are beaten like a dead horse, making your character an idiot just so the other character have to say things that are not remotely needed to be said (and never things that do). Making you pick a choice 4 times to just listen to dialogue for no reason. Some of the tropes like having a nervous girl repeating ""hello"" 50 times might have been cute, if it was already so overused by the second book you just want everyone to shut up and let you find the actual game to play under all this tedious dialogue and overly meticulous exposition.Disclaimer:  I am only in book two and I wonder if I'll bother to finish this, but I had bought this game only because I heard it was brave enough to have a gay main character...then again when they even write such a character from what I've heard there is nothing of it and you only get a choice to kiss the opposite sex multiple times, whats the point, if that's true then it's inclusivity to use for advertisement, without risk and should not have been rewarded, especially if other reviews are to be believe, that they flipped flopped on this character so much...maybe we'll see and I'll update this but frankly I'm regretting purchasing this game right now and potentially rewarding such cheap exploitation, and not quite sure I could stomach more of the tedious dialogue to possible discover an interesting written gay character, if what I have seen so far holds true, then that will not be the case anyway Also note: And I just left a positive review on The Technomancer after finishing it in 50 hours which everyone else calls tedious, when this managed to feel unbearably so in 8 hours.

												Dreamfall Chapters is a great continuation of an immersive story. It's the type of game that puts characters and plot points first. The dialogue and character interactions rivals that of top name games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. One of the strongest points of the game are the choices that players make. Choices by the player affect the gameworld and have far reaching consequences on characters in the game. Gamers interested in story driven sci fi and fantasy should definitely check out Dreamfall Chapters.			"

												I wrote a rather critical, reactionary review to Dreamfall Chapters having had early problems with the game, and  to say that was an over-reactio would be an understatement, so here is a proper review of the game.At the time of typing this review I have only clocked up five hours in-game, I say only because honestly with the very minor problems I experienced early on, exploring, getting it wrong and trying to work out the minor puzzles I've probably taken a little longer than most, and you know what, ignoring those minor problem, the early and unnecesary complaints, I have had a hell of a lot of fun playing this Dreamfall Chapters. Having not played any of the previous games in the series I was a little unsure what to expect but when I truly got into the game, after a couple of chapters, not only was I deeply enamoured with the story, characters, humor and story but the gameplay too, it isn't something I would normally enjoy this much but honestly it's one of the best games I have played in a long while, it seems to have that 'it' that can make a game your not expecting much from stand out, that is to say it surprizes you by just how good it  is.Now if you have played previous games in this series you will probably already know what to expect and so will have bought this game on the strength of just how good the previous games were but for anyone that has never played one of the Dreamfall related games before I can't recommend this game enough, it is not just well worth the money but well worth the time you will spend playing this and no doubt re-playing it to see where the different decisions you can make in game take you.5/5 - well worth buying.

												Another pretentious and ""progressive"" game that focuses on pushing developer's political and social agenda instead of fixing basic issues such as:Terrible and unstable framerateAtrocious draw distancesTextures flickeringCringeworthy animationsOverall poor performance on my modern rigThe lack of facial animationMediocre voiceactingBoring and easy puzzlesRecycling of same locations up to 3 timesUnremarkable charactersVery poor pacing, nothing could happen literally for hoursThe fact that your choices does not matter at allLong development cycles (4-6 months between episodes)Some parts of the story contradict The Longest Journey and DreamfallOverall, very mediocre game that wasted couple of hours of my time. This is in no way a worthy successor to The Longest Journey or Dreamfall.			"

												Maybe it will get better in later books, maybe I've just grown older, maybe it's just plain bad...The first ""book"" is full of extremely tedious exposition.  Zoe's musings are interesting but the whole thing ultimately feels childish and boring.  Characters drone on and on about boring political nonsense, and nothing interesting happens.  The graphics are unbelievably bad -- it looks worse than the first Dreamfall, all things considered.  The subject matter is too ""serious"" to match the primitive puzzles, aesthetic designs, etc.  Zoe runs too slow.  The episodic format is inherently bad.I could go on, but what's the point... this series has fallen a LONG way from The Longest Journey.  The first Dreamfall was still pretty good; this one is just tiresome.			"

												I was hoping for more.  The language in this game really bothered me....and to use the ""c"" word?  Really?  Too much swearing.  Too much dialogue.  Needs an interactive map (not one you talk to, but can click on and it takes you there).  I think I spent a total of 1.5 hours in game time running trying to find people and getting lost.  And even tho they have a ""map"" you can consult, it is still difficult to determine which level something is on, the map does not show 3 levels.  Also, the journal will flash alerting you to consult it, but when you do, nothing new is there, so I don't know the point of that.  If it's meant for you to go back to previous entries to find something related, when you open the journal, it should take you to the page they want you to read.This is no ""Longest Journey"" unfortunately.  These things and the fact that you have to wait for the rest of the game leaves me not so enthusiastic.  I wanted to like it, I really did.			"

												Loved it so far and I am waiting to see where it goes next, but it's incredibly frustrating to understand that between this ""book"" and the logical end - there is like a year of waiting time. And I seriously think it's not cool at all. I think this system of gated story release didn't really work on the walking dead and it works even less here, because the books do not seem at all as self-contained bits of story. The first 'book' actually is more like a 3-4 hour prologue to the story where we meet and establish some characters, scenes and basic understanding of what's going on. I really like what I see, but I kind of expect to be able to see what's next. And I am not able to.It's frustrating because the choice system seems extremely cool, but two months from now I am not sure I am going to be as invested in  the choices I made today during the session. And a year from now I might not even remember what I've chosen.I kickstarted the game and I still don't regret my decision, but I do not recommend buying and playing this game until it's 100% out. And that is supposed to happen in Sept 2015.edited due to developer response and fixed a typo.			"

												So far, I'm struggling. Even with the video turned down to low specs, it's very slow and there are a lot of scenes to sit through. The saved points are too far apart, and I'm going to have to redo the first puzzle yet again when and if I decide the second puzzle is worth trying again. I'm not keen on the interface. You don't have any use of a cursor to move around - you can only use the mouse/trackpad for viewing. If you're lucky, you'll find something to click on. Movement using the WASD keys will take you in the direction you're looking at.The music, sound effects and voices are good but I haven't reached any pretty parts yet, still being stuck at the beginning.I enjoyed The Longest Journey and I was hoping for something on those lines. I guess I'm just stuck in the past, wanting more games like The Dig, The Longest Journey, Loom, and Broken Sword. I'm disappointed. I'm hoping that some walkthroughs will come out that use words, not video, so I can flick through quickly and find what I need. Until then, this much awaited game is on hold.			"

												I have finished this game so spoilers obviously.I want to recommend this game to you. The settings and world are beautiful, you will spent hours just admiring both Propast and Marcuria. You will be highly invested in the character and there stories. It manages to cobine old-fashioned point and click adventure puzzles and choice based story telling. The music is beautiful. It's will make you laugh, it will make you cry. Whether you've played the two previous games or are a new comer to the game you will love this game if you enjoy Deep storytelling, interesting settings and complex characters.But this game let me down hard.One of the great things about this game is it's diverse cast of characters who are all fleshed out and charming (or hateable) This is what got me to play the game. One of the games protagonists (they are three, just like D:TLJ) is Kian, in book 3 it's revealed he's gay. This is important to me as a Pansexual Woman. Very rarely do games give you Queer protsgonists unless it's a dating sim or RPG with LIs. It's normally something you opt into. You cannot opt in Kian's gayness. A straight gamer cannot deny Kian is gay no matter how hard they try. (For some of you this may be a detractor  but this is my steam review, write your own if you're that homophobic) Should the player want to, you can get close to Lihko (voice wonderfully by Dave Fennoy) The relationship between these two can build from distrust and hatred to grudging respect to admiration and friends. I did. I was interested to see where Kian and Lihko's relationship would go. Lihko reveals he's gay in chapter 4 and we leave Kian and Lihko trusting and caring about eachother deeply.There was the undeniable undercurrent of romantic interest. I was exicted. Even with big name games like Dragon Age and Fallout 4 it's still very rare to see Same gender romances in games. Lets talk about Anna, Anna is brought into chapter 2 as a sort of love interest for Kian, obviously this cannot happen. He's gay. He states this quite a few times (earlier on subltly, later on more obviously) Anna is revealed to be more in love with the idea of Kian than anything else. But you can kiss her. Three times. (one is forced on you which, ugh)So what of Lihko? Kian's actual love interest? Well I got him (and Enu!) in chapter 5 alive and well. So, Kian goes to talk to Lihko and...bro-zones him. Yes all that romantic buildup and it ends in queerbaiting.Never thought I'd be queerbaiting by two canonically gay characters but. Here we are.Then Lihko ♥♥♥♥s off 3 hours only returning in the end and epilogue but you get to spent time with the unlikable Anna, even though Lihko is more trusted and a bigger character.Dreamfall Chapters fails at the last hurdle as a choice based game, just like Life is Strange and every TellTale game before it makes your choices meaningless?Save Falk Friedman's life? You get a throwaway line. Break up with Reza? He's there for you anyway. Avoid releasing too much information to your therapist? Doesn't matter. Keep Anna at an arms length? She still won't take a hint. Keep Lihko and Enu alive? They are they sure, but Anna replaces Lihko's role regardless.♥♥♥♥♥♥Enu off bigtime? She'll still tearfully hug you goodbye. Pursue your relationship with Lihko? Not even a chaste kiss.I want to recomend this game. But I feel let down and badly hurt.tl;dr If you don't mind being queerbaited for 20+ hours give it a go.			"

												Before buying this product, I suggest filling entirely the following checklist.Do you like Telltale games?Have you played the prequels?Don't you mind if the whole story is at the verge of propaganda concerning progressivism, activism and far-left ideals?Don't you mind if the characters are a bit bland, and do not fit the characters that you met in the prequels?Aren't you inconvenienced by plotholes and bad lipsync? Subtitles that do not match with what the characters say?The best point of this created universe is the fantasy world and the dystopian environment that is truly astounding. But for me, that doesn't cover the fact that the game is constantly trying to push progressivism propaganda down your throat.			"

												Chapters is certainly a logical continuation of The Longest Journey. All the effort and love that's gone into bringing the world to life would be hard to miss. The shamelessly colourful storybook artwork is as great as ever at setting the atmosphere. It seems nice to have some closure after Dreamfall's abrupt cliffhanger. I felt a slight giddyness starting the game up for the first time.But it doesn't take long for it to get back to the old tricks. The puzzles are simple but tedious, usually taking you on pointless jogs from one edge of the map to the other, or relying on you to catch that one hint buried in the awkward and long-winded dialogue. Other times it's just about finding the exactly right sequence of messed-up dream logic so you can do the bleeding obvious. All business as usual to those who played adventure games in the 90s, but unfortunately the world has moved on and the design feels decidedly out of place with the otherwise very decent production values.All in all, I'm not sure that I can honestly recommend buying Dreamfall Chapters unless you have a high tolerance for frustration or a positive outlook on the previous parts in the series. Maybe grab it from a sale, and take the experience as it is, and you may find yourself enjoying the good parts.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Longest Journey series. I've played through the first two games multiple times. I love those games- that's why it was such a shock to me when I started playing Dreamfall: Chapters and discovered how mediocre its story is, how extremely slow paced its narrative is AND the fact that it was written and directed by the same guy.I've played the first four, of what I believe, is a planned five part series and so far the story hasn't really gone much of anywhere. Those first four ""books"" just feel like they're nothing but build up for whatever happens in book five. And if the story keeps moving the way it has been, the ending is most likely going to be pretty disappointing.Development has been slow as well. It's been over a year since the first book was released and Book 4 only came out recently. If it keeps up like this, we probably won't see book 5 until spring of 2016.I paid 40 bucks for this game before even the first book was released because I had faith in the team that was working on it. I was mistaken, and this will be the last episodic game I pay for before all the episodes (or books, or whatever) are released. I'm not recommending this game for the price that they're asking. If you see it marked down to 10 bucks (and you're a big Longest Journey fan), give it a shot. Otherwise, there are much better adventure games out there...like ""The Longest Journey"", for example.

												I loved Dreamfall: Longest Journey. Not only because of it's beautifully told and truly epic story, but because the way it was told. I've never had a reason to look for a guide in this game, every action was logical to me and every puzzle was intrically woven into the game, it all felt natural.Sadly, i can't tell the same about Dreamfall: Chapters, ""What the hell they were thinking""-syndrome is here, when you have to trace designer's train of thought and you terribly fail at it, succeding only by blind ""click everything"" or reading guides.I won't be playing this game anymore.

												I’m so horribly disappointed by how this game doesn’t even come close to the excellence and the magical otherworldly atmosphere of The Longest Journey. This is something that Dreamfall:TLJ, the second game, suffered from, but not to such an extent; and at least, it didn’t suffer from such weird pacing and writing issues.The Longest Journey sometimes frustrated me by how arbitrary the solutions to puzzles were. Dreamfall Chapters takes this annoyance and dials it up to 11. There is also no explanation for your powers in the Dreamtime world; they’re just there, they’re not explained, and the game has to point to you through dialogue in a really hamfisted way that you have to use this “slow time” power on characters before doing another action in order to progress.""Show, don’t tell"": the golden rule of narrative, and it was thrown away here.As a result, the game feels like it’s forcing you through itself, it just doesn’t have the Longest Journey spirit and atmosphere at all. Remember how outlandish and “out-there” the universe of the first game was? You got thrown by accident into this parallel universe with its huge city, full of unknown and not relying on any conventions. Dreamfall:TLJ slightly dialed that down (but it wasn’t that bad), and in Chapters, you’re pretty much ending up with a generic mashup of cultures.A good comparison for this is going from Morrowind to Oblivion; you go from something very original and unique to something you’ve seen in 50 other games already.Two technical things also bug me here; character animation is almost non-existent. They very rarely move while talking! And sometimes the game just fades to black for a second when a character performs an action instead of showing it through animation.There are also really big performance problems, even on a high-end GPU.As a long-time TLJ fan, and as someone who backed the Kickstarted for this game, I just can’t recommend it… I’m just really hoping the other 4 books will raise the quality but this isn’t looking good so far :(			"

												As someone who enjoyed Dreamfall, I thought it would be a nice return to Arcadia and the inconsistent but overall fun world. Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥was I disappointed. Who on Earth thought it would be a good idea to let Red Thread design a game!? It starts off so painfully slow that you don't even feel like playing when you finally get to control your character. I can deal with slow paced games but this is too much. The worst part though is you get absolutely no help of ANY kind. I can't even get past the first ""puzzle"" where you have to catch the falling woman. Apparently I was supposed to notice how to pointer turned from one dot to three connected dots. Silly me. Not that that helps because for some reason I can't activate the three different options, do I use a cursor and hover over an option? Do I click the option? No clue! And no help whatsoever. If gameplay is king then ♥♥♥♥ing make a game that's playable - THEN focus on story.			"

												I would summarize Dreamfall Chapters (Book One) as: a series of boring scenes, all from different movies, cut together by a toddler who decided to urinate all over the film (graphical glitches) before rolling it up and playing it back to you at a tenth of the normal speed. Pointless.The previous game in the series has a spot on my top five favourite games ever list, but this has to be among the bottom five. The game doesn't even try to engage you in any way. There are no interesting characters (they even reverted Zôey back to her dull self from the beginning of the previous game), no interesting dialogue, plot or environment - nothing.			"

												The story and setting has a lot of potential, but the way it's told drags the game down. It's a series of cliffhangers and slow controls.I've glued my shift key down so the characters can run all the time. I've never found myself wishing they'd walk instead of run, but I certainly wished they ran with more spirit!It's not just the characters that are slow, it's the story too. We spent one full chapter in the daily life of Zoe, and how she buys dinner or prepares dinner, or gossips with some guy or another. Is this really the epic story we want to see? It's just fluff that could easily be removed or replaced with something a tad bit more interesting.As it is, most of the game is padded with fluff to make it take way more time than it needs to. Speed up the running, make the animations more fluid, clean up the boring story parts, don't force me to run from A to B to A to C, and the game will be a lot more enjoyable.			"

												So far my experience with this game has been more negative than positive (ch.2). I WILL finish it, because I loved TLJ (and Dreamfall to an extent) but it is NOT a good game, IMHO.Do you like fetchquests in hard-to-navigate cities? Do you like easy quests, where the difficulty comes from NAVIGATING THE DAMN MAP?The game works so much better when it's confined, but usually you're forced to wander in the big♥♥♥♥♥city, where there's hardly anyone to talk to, or anything else to do, really. It's a pretty prop, but it's so empty! You can visit places from TLJ, but there's nothing to gain, no new insights, nothing,As you can tell by my writing, I'm definitely not a critic, just a disappointed fan.			"

												If I have to sum up the game in one word that would be 'weak'. And I'm being generous here. This is not a review, it's just a personal opinion. I've never been more disappointed in the game. The plot is beyond weak. The writing is very bad. The voice acting is mediocre except for Crow and maybe Enu. The graphics are outdated yet the performance is quite bad, worse than many new games such as Witcher 3, Doom 2016, Rise of TR, etc. The character animations are abysmal by todays standards, the facial animations are nonexistent. It's a theater of mannequins, the shiny characters even look like plastic dolls. I do not expect mocap from low budget game but it's on par with Dreamfall and that game came out ten years ago. The story could have made up for all this but alas...Overall it was a cringeworthy experience for me and I'll try to pretend this game never existed.			"

												Overall it was a fantastic first book/episode. Voice-overs: Superb. Loved the VO for Zoe and the other main guy. Music: Gentle and emotional. Also liked that guitar guy song in the city very much. Art: Fantastic. Really beautiful and detailed Europolis city and Storytime + Character models. Story: Certainly Has a Soul. Also a lot of plot for just one of five books. If we get so much content with each book it will really be an epic saga. I like how it feels at the moment. Deep and complex. Dialogues: Really entertaining and witty, some bad language but it fits perfectly. Making decisions is fun and I like how you can hower above each option and hear character's inner voice. Also there is a lot of optional talking which is pretty awesome. Game-play: There are some puzzles but very easy to solve. The only strange one was one with the wine and I lost my sense of direction a few times in the city so thank god for the Crowboy. Setting: Full of life, almost each object has a story to tell. Bugs: None that I can see. They even postponed the release to squash some bugs to give us the perfect first experience. If you like Telltale games you will probably also like this one. Only this one have better graphics, art, more choices and a ton of other content to get immersed into. Maybe it lacks non-stop action and sense of anxiety but it possesses far better, more original, complex story and setting than those titles.			"

Yes, you make ""choices"" throughout the game, but honestly I don't see much of a difference between choices half the time. I just end up clicking through. So far, no combat of any sort.

If this was a book, the characters would talk a lot faster. But since this is a point-and-click adventure with pretty boring puzzles, so far all that's happened is some girl has been told to save the world and has talked extensively about an adventure she previously had which surely would have been more exciting than this, and some guy has walked to the top of a tower while holding conversations that hint cryptically at him having discovered a secret.

												I liked this first episode. My only criticism at this point is that it is a bit too dialogue heavy in some places. Though I do understand that they have to do a lot of background setting in this first episode.The game is visually gorgeus and the plot seems promising. Though the tutorial could have explained some of the controls in the beginning a bit better. All in all a promising start for Dreamfall Chapters.			"

												Full disclosure: Possible backer syndrome.That said, this is the way to make a modern adventure game.Funny, touching, beautiful, expansive. As others have said, if you're familiar with the previous games you'll be on board with this from the first seconds. Otherwise, if you've any interest in adventure games at all you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's only the first few chapters of the story so far, and it starts off slowly, but once it gets going you'll find yourself in the largest, most free form open world environment I've ever seen in an adventure game. This isn't the tiny rooms of the Walking Dead, we're talking huge cityscapes.You have the choice and consequence of modern adventure games, and the best of dialog and inventory puzzles from the classics. You won't be hauling masses of stuff around with you, but you will be combining items. And, while we've not seen the outcomes of many decisions as yet, there's at least one major character who you can entirely miss depending on your choices.And, most importantly, it absolutely lives up to the writing of the classics. There's more dialog then you'll ever hear in one play through, often with escalating jokes hidden away behind examining items multiple times, incidental background events and internal monologue. Zoe has matured into a witty and engaging heroine, and you will relate to her problems and struggles as you wander her world. It's a game that genuinely deserves to call itself mature, because of the themes it fearlessly explores, not the amount of blood it splashes around.Pleased to have backed it, and hope it sells a ton.

												Be advised o ye potential newcomers, there are four issues with this game as of October 2014. First, be advised that there is only one 'book' available in chapters, i.e. one episode, so you're only getting roughly 4 hours of gameplay out of this. Second, you're going to want to have played both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall completely before picking this up or you're going to feel like this game is an acid trip. (Frankly if you haven't, they're incredible games worth the money.) Third is that the graphics are a little unoptimized so it will make even some rigs capable of running Glorious Star Citizen cry in pain. Unfortunately, this is not helped by the fourth concern, that the character models animations are a little sub par and that does cheapen an otherwise brilliant and immersive experience.That said, there are a ton of positives. The setting is fantastically designed and believable. The writing, dialogue and choice system are on par with anything put out by Telltale. Zoe's internal monologues are plastered all over the game and are reflective of the choices she (ahem, YOU) will make, Effects on the storyline are VERY noticable and yet seamlessly woven into the game. It appears that quite a lot of effort was put into making the consequences of actions matter, at least in the short term with Zoe's attitude.TL;DR - I like where Tørnquist and RTG is going with this. This is what TLJ/Dreamfall fans -- as well as fans of the adventure games genre -- have been waiting for. I recommend a buy after more chapters have been put out there. (And FFS, if you haven't played TLJ and Dreamfall, drop everything and do that right now.)			"

												[I backed the game on kickstarter, which means I'm positive in advance]I always considered The Longest Journey and Dreamfall the work of art more than a game. Judging by the short 1st chapter that is available now, Ragnar and his team still have this narrative and artistic power over the game that most other developers lack.As with the previous game, most of the game you're looking for a way to find/hear/watch the next piece of the story. No you won't be shooting bad guys, you won't build tanks, but you'll experience a very beautiful story staged in a very exciting world.			"

 This Review is only about the First Episode / Book of Dreamfall Chapters, i will update and change it after the next Episode was released. Things and Thoughts about the Game might change, for now they only reflect my impression about this Single Episode. Thank you. 	 So. what can i say about Dreamfall Chapters? First of all, please be aware that you wont understand much of the Story and the Game without playing ""The longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall"" before.   ( Doublepack on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/320/ ) And then, well, i loved playing The longest Journey,  Dreamfall is one of my favorite Games and ive been excited and wait for a new Part for a long Time.Full of exitement i started playing and it at the Beginning you start to remember what happend before, you remember the wonderfull british accent voiceacting, and how ""Dreamfall"" ended.You see familiar Characters, you  and keep playing until you reach Europolis.There youll be stunned by amazing Visuals, Light effects and a sweet and detailed Leveldesign.You begin to explore... do  some tasks. Well so far so good, but without spoiling anything, there the Game begins to lack.NPS make a lot of immature jokes, many People talk rude and use a lot of swear words...It might be funny at first, but after that its on the low niveau of Sains Row IV. Every second word you hear is ""s**t"" or ""f**k"". you see a vagi** graffiti on an election poster, Im not prude or conservative, but it just doesnt fit in.It looks like Dreamfall, but it sounds like a Ghetto version of Dreamfall, that ruins the Atmosphere for me.I asked myself why they added this. well maybe to make the Game more hip and interesting for the younger Generation? I dont know. Personally i dont like that.At other Points, Dreamfall is also trying to leave the old Path and copying other Games. You will find an annoying Robot, that reminds you on Borderland's Claptrap somehow.  And the Episodes and choices thing, that some people already know from Telltales Games.Im not sure how to feel about Dreamfall Chapters, honestly it looks great, sounds great, they added some interesting Puzzles again. But for now it doesnt feel like the old Dreamfall anymore. too shallow and impersonal.Im looking forward to the Second Part / Episode and see if i have to change my Mind.  Pro and Contra, for the lazy Readers  + Great looking Graphics, Lighteffects, Reflections and Leveldesign.+ Good Sounds and atmospheric Music + Like at The longest Journey and Dreamfall: magnificent Voice acting, the british accents bring up a lot of Memories of the old Games. + The Game has some good Puzzles, even if they dont always seem logic, you got to think about what you have to do next.+ Its following the Storyline of the Prequels.● It might be only my personal perception, but the Controls feel a bit clumsy at first, especially the Mouse movement. But i got used to it after a short Time. ● There is no combat.● About 5 hours of Gameplay for the first Book / Episode.● Because of the strong language, this Game is not advisable for young Children. - The Game has a few Bugs, for example can you fall and get stuck in the Map which will prevent you from playing any further, so you have to reload the last Checkpoint, some graphically glitches.- The Visuals all together look great, sadly i cant say that about the Character Animation. Their movement looks unnatual and stutters from time to time. - A lot of unnecessary swear words and immature jokes.  Note: For now, the Game requires really strong Hardware to be able to play on highest settings, without lag. But according to the Forums, the Developers are working on a fix.  As i said before, i would strongly advise you to play ""The longest Journey"" and ""Dreamfall"", before you play ""Dreamfall Chapters"".All together, If you like profound adventure Games with a great Storyline, the Dreamfall Series is a must buy for you and i can recommend it.

												I've waited for this for so long! I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey back in 2009/2010 and I loved it, in the beginning I thought it was a standalone game, but found out later that it was a sequel to ""The Longest Journey"" from 1999. So I went on playing the first game. I really thought that it was an amazing game and when Ragner Thørnquist later stated that there would be a 3rd game I couldn't raise my arms high enough. I didn't really check up on Dreamfall Chapters to hype me up, as I do with every other game because I don't want to dissapoint myself. It totally paid off in the beginning, so I started playing Dreamfall Chapters.*FROM THIS POINT IT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*The game has a good start, picking up and giving us a small rewind on what has happened since we left Alvane arrested for treason and Zoë in a coma. High pace of events. But then it feels like the story falls off track, or at least in my opinion, I haven't got any answers on the questions I asked myself when i completed the second game. All we know is that April Ryan is dead, Kian Alvane got arrested and is now a free man, or at least what we think, Zoë is out of her coma and got sorta back on track again. It was 2 short chapters and an interlude with a baby we know nothing about? The gameplay is great, the graphics and characters are amazing, but I think that after 8 long years of waiting (4/5 years for me) we are owed a longer book with more explanation and a longer chapter than that, because the visit at Mira's shop and helping out testing Shitbot, doesn't say anything, and feels more like waste of time when the first book is so short. I really hope that book two is longer and let's us meet up with the old faces of Arcadia and Stark, such as Cortez and Westhouse. So we finally can put the pieces together and solve this mystery once and for all.			"

												Let me get the dislikes out of the way. Obviously, it was way too short. Maybe the next release will contain 2 Books? The only mechanical problem I had was that in the middle of the game the video went bonkers. All I could see was various shapes like rectangles, triangles,etc. I went for a lower setting on my Nvidia card and this solved the problem immediately. This I'm sure will be addressed with fixes.  I loved this game when the original Dreamfall came out and still do. The current story is a little harder to get into but it  has much promise. Like the idea that you can see what other people decide and if you agreed. Taking the robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, thats his name, out for a walk was really fun! The prison break made you think. All in all, not a bad game for starters. Anxious to know when the next part will come out.			"

												Let's start from the start. When after frist time when i reached the end - my feelings were confusing. On one side the story what i adore so much is finally here, but on other side it was too short, some frame rates issues, shortly not so much fun as i expected.  I soon in found out why it didn't work from first time.     when i replayed first 2 games (the longest journey, and dreamfall) and started to play chapters again i finally got my wonderful feelings about this universe again.  And mostly what i love, love, love in this game is atmosphere, graphic, MUSIC , AND FINALLY STORY.    after years i almost fogot how deepy it can touch.   I can say so far, in my opinion it is the one of the BEST story in the history of all advanture game.   This game is difficult to describe, it is better to feel it. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												I've always been a huge fan of ""The Longest Journey"" series since it started.  Each game significantly better than the last.  I was amazed when the sequel to Dreamfall was announced on Kickstarter and have been waiting for a sequel since the 2006 game.  This game is light on puzzles, but fantastic in story and has a wonderfully deep environment to explore.  There are few performance and graphical issues at launch but they are being ironed out quickly thanks to the developers.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves story-driven games such as ""The Walking Dead"", ""Heavy Rain"" and ""The Wolf Among Us"".  Can't wait for episode 2, and please note it took me about 5 hours to complete the first episode :)			"

Book 1 ReviewGraphics and user-interface are mostly the same as in Dreamfall, just with a few improvements here and there. The fight system seems to be gone. Sneaking is still present, but toned down and only used in a single situation. One new addition in Chapters is the choice&consequence system, similar to what Tell Tale is doing. Hard to tell how that will pan out, as so far there hasn't been much consequence for the choices you make.On the negative site, the performance is at the moment pretty bad, but patches for that are incoming. The choice&consequence system is also a little obnoxious, as it gives large on-screen indicators whenever there is a choice, this really should be toned down and be pretty much invisible. Animation are also a bit lacking, as it's still the old hand-animation stuff, not the fancy motion-capture that is used in most other bigger titles.As for story, not that much happens in the first book, a few new characters are introduced, you revisit a few old places, but nothing big is so far driving the plot. I personally like that, as it gives you time to familiarize yourself with the world and the world itself looks amazing. Chapters has easily one of the best representations of near-future sci-fi you'll find in gaming.Puzzles are, as in Dreamfall, still rather streamlined.Overall, this is the Dreamfall sequel I have been waiting for, it doesn't radically change the formula and continues right where it left of. If you liked Dreamfall, get this game. If you haven't played Dreamfall, play it before you dive into Chapters, as Chapters doesn't bother much with retelling what happened in Dreamfall. Playing The Longest Journey couldn't hurt either.Complete GameSo after having played through all five books the above review still mostly stands. Dreamfall Chapters manages to be a solid Dreamfall sequels, that fails to live up to the original The Longest Journey, just like Dreamfall before it. But it does make a good conclusion to Dreamfall itself.The puzzles in Dreamfall Chapters do actually get a little worse in succeeding books. A lot of the puzzles in the mid of the game are based on running around on a really large map and finding that single item that you can interact with or the place to go to. The game often fails to indicate what that item might be or where to find it. So you spend a lot of time just running around and there is nobody around you could talk to to get further hints. Overlapping puzzle sequences (i.e. Monkey Island style) that you can solve in parallel on that large map are pretty much non-existent, everything plays pretty linearly, just with a lot of walking in between. By book 5 the game ditches puzzles pretty much completely and just goes interactive-movie.The story also takes a long while to get going and you spend an frustratingly large amount of time backtracking through the same locations over and over again. It takes until book 4 for there to be something that feels like actual adventuring, before you get to see new locations and before the story starts kicking in, but once it gets going it's quite a tour de force until the end.The game also happens to be quite a nostalgia trip, as you end up revising many places from previous games or otherwise reference events that happened earlier.The choice and consequence system didn't end up bothering me all that much, as the consequences tend to be mostly minor.Overall I am quite happy with the game, it fails to correct the mistakes of the original Dreamfall and introduces a few faults of its own, but it answers a lot of questions that Dreamfall left open. The biggest problem with the game is how uneven the different plotlines are. You spend a lot of time with the rebellion against the Azadi and other side stuff, that ultimately feels almost irrelevant compared to the bigger picture. The game doesn't manage to have real driving force for most of the time, just stuff to do. Since the game wanders and revisits many places previously seen, it is also missing the adventuring and exploration aspects that TLJ had, since everything feels a little to familiar. But as said, as a Dreamfall sequel it gets the job done pretty well and it's quite a lengthy game as well, but it doesn't manage to reach the quality that TLJ had and the developers don't quite seem to have learned from the criticism that Dreamfall received.

												I absuletly loved the longest journey and really liked this one. One thing I find sad is that the longest journey was spread into more locations and this one mostly goes on only in a couple of locations. The fight system is completely removed, maybe it's because of the lower budget or other mechanic issues. Though I didn't find this problematic because it didn't really fit in with the rest of the game in longest journey either.			"

												This is a partial review written after finishing ""Book One"". I sincerely hope my verdict will change after the remaining episodes have released, but I currently cannot recommend this game...I have been looking forward to this for quite some time but the experience this far has disappointed me. There is little to no gameplay present save for the conversation wheel and navigating yourself through the city of Europolis. Sure, the game is focused on story and having multiple choices that may(?) change the world around you, but I feel that all the consequences are not clear enough yet. After these first 6 hours of gameplay I have yet to see more than one obvious consequence for an action I have taken. If there are any more actual twists present, they are not clear enough to be noticeable from a single play though.Additionally, I have played both of the previous games, but I feel left out on details from the past story as I can't remember them. The recap that is present is more like a trailer and doesn't really help me remember any details outside of the main plot of the previous game (Dreamfall). The original title - The Longest Journey - is not even mentioned. I can only hope this was a ""prologue"" episode and that the rest of the story will leave enough clues for us ""vets"" to remember exactly where they left us after Dreamfall.I will be waiting for the remaining episodes and update this review in the future.== Update ===It took me two years to get me to pick up this game again and finish it. Sadly, I still can't recommend it fully.The game brings beautiful graphics and art and the story does catch you from time to time, but it's riddled with clichés and bad sex jokes (just, why?) that kinda puts you off after a while. While the characters are likable there are basically three personality types: ""the bland NPC"", ""the bubbly and awkward girl/boy"", ""the angry and bossy man/woman"".However, regardless of the various drawbacks of the story I could see myself enjoying the game if it wasn't for its complete lack of (insteresting) gameplay. The so called puzzles are usually a hide and seek game through a level, and you're sometimes not even told what you are supposed to look for. I never felt I got to crack any actual puzzles. It was more like a mindless wandering and poking everything in my way.Any ""gameplay"" outside of the puzzles and conversations are poorly demonstrated and, dare I say it, completely pointless. At one time you're even placed in a rowing boat on a rail, forced to do nothing but click the left mose button for minutes for no other reason than to progress though the game.CONCLUSION:If you're only here to know what happens in the story of 'Dreamfall' and 'The Longest Journey' and don't care about gameplay at all, go ahead and play it. But if you in any way are an avid puzzle game player, like character development and deep storylines (like 'Mass Effect' or 'Dragon Age') or if you like any kind of gameplay overall; Stay away, this game is not for you.

												*Note: this is only a review of Chapter 1. To be updated*Summary: Dreamfall Chapters is a story and choice focused game with minor puzzle elements; heavily borrowing mechanics from The Walking Dead. It has a lot of great aspects, such as good atmosphere, interesting characters and great voice-acting. However, poorly designed puzzles, as well as a long and drawn out section towards the end of the game left me bored. The game has a lot of promise, but after playing the first Chapter I cannot recommend buying it yet. Long version: Dreamfall chapters is the sequel to The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. Like The Longest Journey it has a great setting and rich backstory in the technological world Stark and the magical world Arcadia. Unlike The Longest Journey however, the Dreamfall Chapters is NOT a puzzle game. Rather it is a story and choice focused game which happens to have some puzzles thrown in from time to time. Very much reminiscent of The Walking Dead in that respect. This move away from puzzles and focus on story is neither good nor bad, it just means it is a fundamentally different game from The Longest Journey and will appeal to different people. The Dreamfall Chapters offers up a wonderful world and good characters which are well-written and well-voiced. The choices are a fun aspect to the story, though I do not think they will make me want to replay it, and it is sometimes a bit unclear that you can actually make a choice (which made me accidently leave someone to get tortured… my bad!). My biggest problem with Dreamfall Chapters is pacing and the puzzles, however. The great thing about The Longest Journey was that it managed to combine intricate (sometimes ridiculously complex) puzzles with a good story and interesting characters. The puzzles here are very bare bones and feel disconnected from the rest of the game which focuses so intensely on the story. The puzzles, on the other hand, feel like they are getting in the way of the story, slowing it down rather than adding to it. And as soon as I was stuck on a puzzle the wonderful façade that the game had painted started to crack. What looked so good when I was exploring suddenly contained nothing to interact with, no people to talk to even in a crowded marketplace when the goal is to buy something, no hints as to how to progress. You eventually find the solution, more by the absence of alternatives rather than any brilliance on your part. In a real puzzle game the puzzles themselves are the point and there are usually other puzzles to solve if you are stuck. In the Dreamfall Chapters there is nothing but a story which is not progressing.This problem is compounded by the deliberately slow pacing of the later parts of the chapter. The city you find there is at first lovely and looks to contain endless details to explore. However, that quickly turns out not to be true. The number of things to interact with is incredibly limited and the snail pace movement of the main character and the absence of a fast-travel system, quickly turns moving around the city into a grind. As I was finally running Zoë home after a day in her life, I completely understood why she did not want to fight with her boyfriend. I was very bored of running back and forth on the map where I had already seen the sights and heard the conversations, watching Zoë awkwardly zigzag after my keyboard commands that obviously should have been controller commands.I was sure I would be recommending the Dreamfall Chapters after the first 1-2 hours, but after finishing the first chapter I am concerned. The lazy puzzle design and the dragged out city section really distracted from the story and left me feeling bored rather than interested in what will be coming next. It is a shame, because the game has a lot to offer and a lot of potential, but right now I cannot recommend buying this game.			"

												I played 'The longest Journey' a long time ago and I loved it. I also played 'Dreamfall' - not as good as 'The longest Journey' but I liked it. Thus I really was looking forward to play this game.Although there are things that left a good impression (I liked the dialogs) I completed book one less than four hours and the game (from my point of view at htat time) suddenly stopped, indicating that I need to wait for part two. This was both unexpected and realy disapointing. I agree that this information might have been provided somewhere (I haven't read the description before the purchase), so I dont' blame anyone for that - my fault. But honestly, book one is - from my personal point of view - not much more than the tutorial: there is not much development of the original story and the riddles are way to easy for an serious adventure game. Instead there is a strong focus on the decision making component of the game and on the introduction of the basic mechanics. I simply expected more.Although I decided that I won'trecomment this game at the moment (11.11.'14) , I will try out book two. If book two catches up with the intensity and the atmosphere of the predecessors, I will update my review.			"

												I honestly alt+F4'd out of the game after maybe 35 minutes. The writing is abysmal and the voice acting is incredibly sub-par. I'm so unimpressed with this, I don't know if it's just nostalgia talking but, The Longest Journey was so enjoyable and Dreamfall, while not as good was still fun. The presentation, the opening, everything just felt like a Golden Compass fanfic. Perhaps it's the translation, I don't know. What I do know, is I would reccomend you go play A Wolf Among Us to sate your storydriven, ""X chararcter will remember this"" needs. If you were playing this for the cross-over of cyberpunk and magic, go play Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall, the writing is a million times better.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is very rich in both atmosphere an storyline.  The enviroments such as the cyberpunk city and dreamtime have suprisingly good graphics. The storyline begins where dreamfall : the longest Journey left off and the plot begins to thicken an evolve as you play through the first book; Reborn.  The puzzles throughout the game are somewhat complicated and incorporates some adult psychology in order to help some of the dreamers escape their nightmares that have been induced by the dream machines.  The game is in its own class.  The length of the first book reborn is about 4-5 hours long.  Just as I was really starting to appreciate the game it ended and I was left very dissapointed.  However, there are 4 more books that come in the form of downloads in the upcoming months.  The budget for this game was limited given it was funded 1.5 million from kidkstarter.  I'm assuming that is why it has been broken into 5 books.  If I had known that I was only receiving around 4-5 hours of playtime I would have waited until the game was finished in it's entirety.  Overall, the game itself is one of a kind.  Although, I do feel I was ripped off given I paid full price 29.95 and recieved only 1/5 of the game.  I would only recommend this game to someone upon its full completion. I'd give this game a 3.5 out of 10.			"

EDIT: Before you even read this, note the kneejerk and attempted bullying in some of the 'developer responses.' That should tell you all you need to know. Ragnar has fallen so far, I don't even understand how it could've happened.This is going to be long, as I want you to understand, to see if you'll agree with me about this game.I'm not regularly critical about games, I like games, and I wanted to like this game. It began with The Longest Journey, which to me was a legendary affair, it still is. I remember so much about it, how it touched my imagination and inspired wanderlust. I recall much -- from the flying creatures that passed down stories in their own tongue, to the awakening of Venice. I approached it with wide-eyed wonder, it spoke to both the child and the adult in me.So it was with that wonder I looked onward. I recall, again, at the time when friends and I chittered excitedly about Dreamfall. What would it hold? We wanted to think that our Ragnar would be brave enough, bold enough, to let the barrier between worlds fall. And that the dragons themselves may realise their error, and allow this to pass. And what would follow? An amazing epic about the trials and tribulations of two worlds colliding, perhaps with chaos taken to the brink and then to become better than either had ever been.Dreamfall wasn't that. That was fine. It was okay. It was a little overwrought with awkward drama and unnecessary bouts of ennui to be edgy, but it was... all right. Of all the things it might have been, it wasn't memorable. It didn't leave a mark on me the way The Longest Journey did. It felt like Ragnar had left the child by the wayside, picking up an angsty teenager instead. One with dyed hair and a gruff attitude, a shallow, one-dimensional creature that was so desperate to be edgy, to be cool. The wonder had died. It was an intrigue, but it wasn't amazing.I'd hoped that Ragnar would turn to the child's wonder again. No such luck. The teenager was running rampant now, lots of new hormones as puberty set in. Rage against the machine, man! Stick it to the man, man! And it's a little embarrassing. The teenager holds the reigns, believing that ham-fisted writing, that beating you over the head with cheesy, kludged attempts at emotional manipulation, and overdone twists in an effort to be clever, and unnecessary amounts of Dark & Edgy...Now, you may play Dreamfall Chapters and disagree with me. Keep playing.The first episode is okay. It is merely okay, much like Dreamfall which preceded it. It's okay. It's not going to stir your spirit, it's not going to ease your soulsickness, awaken your wonder, or give you that pleasant sensation that runs down your spine as your jaw falls agape in appreciation for just how much raw creativity a person can have. The Longest Journey could do that. This won't. But that's not a crime, Something can be just okay. And being just okay may not be quite worth the lack of a recommendation. Okay is fine, right?Well, then the second episode hits. Ragnar gets bored and leaves the teenager at the typewriter. Suffice it to say? This goes about as well as you'd expect it to, and it ends about as well as you'd expect it to. It's trashy, embarrassing, silly, and edgy. It's the sort of thing you see when a teenager writes a fan-fiction about their favourite TV show, except they try to make it dark by having people die and/or suffer. You have to feel my pain, man! Do you feel my pain? DO YOU???? Do. You. Feel. My. Pain?!?Embarrassing.I felt genuinely awkward. I was worried someone would see me playing it. And this isn't a good thing. After the first episode, I was expecting better. I wanted better. I thought... okay, Ragnar is hitting his stride. The Longest Journey took a little bit to get off the ground, it had a slow start. Perhaps this does too? And that's about as far as my faith went. For all intents and purposes, I think it's fair to call Ragnar a one-trick pony. He had one trick -- The Longest Journey -- and he's been riding that wave ever since. Preying on nostalgia in the hopes that no one will notice that he's unable to actually write anything decent any more.He shouldn't have let his inner child grow up into that obnoxious teenager. He really shouldn't.And the thing is is that I can no longer trust him, nor can you. He hasn't written anything really good since The Longest Journey, I'm not sure why I was expecting him to start now. I gave him a chance. This was his last chance. If you're an intelligent, well read person with an appreciation for literature, this is so bad it'll make you want to go and find a corner to curl up foetal in. You'll want it to stop being so very bad. It doesn't stop being so very bad. It continues being so very bad until you can't take it any more and you crack. It's really very bad, then, yes. Very bad. In fact, at the risk of sounding like Sewer Urchin, I'd say it's very, very bad. Yeah.So bad. I need to stop writing those words, but I can't. Good grief. I've been exposed to an angsty teenager and I want to point you in a different direction so you won't have to sit awkwardly through what I did.Okay. Okay. I think I have what I need. There's a character in there who fires quick and fast ableist slurs at the mentally disabled. So edgy! The writer felt that that was necessary in order to create a shock response. It was exploitative, cheap, nasty, and as ham fisted as anything else in Chapters is what it was. If he'd had a black person being attacked by someone flinging ethnic slurs, he'd never have gone through with it. He played it safe, he chose a group who're regularly victimised and chose to pick on them. Sounds edgy, doesn't it? Picking on the easiest group like a giant yellow-bellied coward, I mean? He could only have sunk lower if his target had been furries.What, exactly, happened to you, Ragnar? I mean, what?? How do you go from The Longest Journey to... this pile of drivelling brain rot? Christ. So... don't buy this. Move on. Forget it exists. Just forget it exists. Go and play The Longest Journey again. You don't need this much angsty teenager in your life. You really don't. Off you go.			"

												Ok, here's the thing...I actually do recommend this game. It's wonderful, everything anyone ever could've wanted from the sequel. The story is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, the UI is a wonder of streamlining and intuition. The puzzles from the last two games are nonexistant, but that's ok.But the problem is, the distribution format, of releasing a 'chapter' at a time, is awful. I got through the first one in five hours (mostly because I suck at adventure games, normal players could probs do it in 2-3). I loved every second of it, but now I have to wait until the second chapter to see how many of my minute choices and actions unfold, half of which I've already forgotten, play out. And it's not like I can go back and play it again; i want to see how my choices from before played out, the ones I made in a split seconds decision before I had time to really think it out. The chapter format seriously interupts the storytelling.I understand the developers thought about this and were originally going to go with one big release, but they ran out of money and so had to go with the episodic format. So I'm not knocking them. But the chapters' release dates are spread so far apart (the second one might not even be released until next year) that it's basically pointless to play in such small measured doses, especially when the emphasis is on watching the story unfold and not gameplay. Basically, take away is wait until all the chapters are out before buying it. It's not worth the frustation.			"

												With a Nvidia 420 GTX card and a Nvidia 610 GT card I still cannot get this game to work, for some reason when I go to operate the game the borders for the game do not exist, I mean the ones that lock the mouse inside of the game itself, instead my mouse travels to my desktop even in full screen mode which makes gameplay impossible because you end up clicking outside of the game itself and minimize the whole thing on every action event. In my opinion this game was released buggy, still is buggy and unplayable... I don't know if anyone has had better luck but I'm giving this game a bad rating because I have not been able to play the game just because of that, there is no way for me to play the game without the game glitching out on me and from the looks of it, my cards should be able to run it.

												Loved The Longest Journey and Dreamfall and enjoyed the Dreamfall Chapters up to Book 4.This part of the series consists of 85% watching a story being told and 15% being able to actually particiate and interact. If I want to watch a movie, I can hire a DVD but  Book 4 was a huge let down. I feel the characters have been quickly and skimpily constructed this time and the game never gets a real grip. Just when it seems to be leading to something dramatic and action based , we are taken back to another scene . Kian does very little except push buttons .It is lacklustre, uninspiring and I finished it in a few hours of playing, unlike The Longest Journey nd Dream fall which kept me entertained and enthralled for days.I also found the colours to be very garish and odd in the first sections of playing. I couldn't get rid of bright orange and blue no matter how I calibrated.I hope Book 5 improves but I fear the chapters are  now being rushed for release and have lost the plot.			"

												Based solely on Book One: Reborn, I would not recommend this game to people unfamilar to the Dreamfall series' rich story. As a fan of the Dreamfall series, I find that Chapters, thus far, has created more questions than answered. Therefore, if you don't already know what the original questions left from the prequel, this game will appear confusing and perhaps unforgivingly tedious.However, if like the Dreamfall series or if you are patient and/or an optimistic gamer, I have a feeling you will see potential in this first episode.Regardless, I stand by my opinion, I would not casually recommend this game.

												Annoying ""choice"" system (I don't hate this style of game, but I loved this series for the story, not my ability to change the narrative), clunky, slow movement, and unintuitive controls (using a controller). Awkward preoccupation with sex, and weird dialogue revolving around it. Offensive characters that are offensive just for the sake of being offensive. Zoe is more than a bit boring (but she wasn't exactly the most interesting part of Dreamfall, either), and Reza... ugh. Even Kian seems less interesting, and his arc was my favorite part of Dreamfall.I don't hate the game, and I've only played the first chapter, but it is nowhere near as good as the Longest Journey. Even Dreamfall was more engrossing, and it had some major failings. And yes, I just replayed both games in the past month, so they are fresh in my mind.Totally not recc'd. And this is coming from someone who has been DYING for the series to be tied up.Positives: the art direction isn't terrible. Not digging the huge eyed girls, but whatever. The dystopian future is still interesting, but it's not quite as engrossing as it was in the Longest Journey.			"

												First thing first. I love playing The longest Journey and Dreamfall and I played them many times, but Dreamfall chapters is totaly diffrent story. The story is great, the graphics are beautiful, but is very poorly developed, puzzles are very basic, nothing special, many times frustrating and you don't known where to look. The cities are big and many times or all the times you just walking and running through the city like a naked chicken and you don't know where to go or where find this person. The game is very bugy and frustrating. I know that I will not playing the the game in the future, like I did with The longest Journey and Dreamfall. The worrst thing in the game is autosaves. WTF. I can't save at all, why RTG why.The game is basicaly role-playing without the battle system and not the classic point and click adventure game. When I finished the book 4, I tell myself, thank you that I don't need to play this game anymore. Thank you. Many hours playing for nothing. Thank you RTG for the worst adventure game I played last 25 years. Thank you.			"

												I really loved The Longest Journey but it ended so abruptly and took so many years for the company to release the Chapters that it's very disappointing. The try-hard ""funny"" dialogue seems very forced and over the top in Book One compared to TLJ. The small quests given are rather tedious and take longer than they should to be completed. Disappointing to say the least after waitiing YEARS for this release. I will write more as I complete more ""Books"" as I still have Book Two to complete. But so far this is a huge let-down and really makes me mad. This game has so much potential, I hope they don't f*#! it up a second time.			"

												Great return to the world and mythos. I very much enjoyed this. Why then did I give it a thumbs down? It is WAY too short. Like short short. You don't really get to experience ANY of the consequences of your actions yet and when you finish you will be going ""Well... ok... now what?"" I have a feeling by the time book two comes out, I will have forgotten much of this brief ""adventure"". Certainly not worth the money at this point. I would wait until they have many more chapters out before picking this up.Update: Now with 3 books, there may be enough content to warrant a purchase, however... I still cannot recommend. the story doesn't engage you quite as well as the original games and I just started book 3. Spent the first gods know how long on book 3 on a stupid search every nook and cranny for drawings really really annoying fetch quest. Will update again if anything changes.			"

												There are two very engaging plot structures at play in this game; a mystery construction of pipes in the magical realm and an epic political/corporate conspiracy in the technological one, and the desire to see where these went (coupled with some fond memories of The Longest Journey) was what kept me playing. And then it ended quite suddenly, without any form of denouement or resolution, which is solely the reason for my 'not recommended' -- the feeling that stuck with me as the credits rolled being ""was that it?"". The nature of episodic content is to string you out as long as possible so I wasn't expecting everything to be laid out in front of me, but I was expecting something.There are also a bunch of design decisions that didn't sit well with me. Zoe (one of the main protagonists) is an incredibly well rounded, emotional, likeable, believable character with some fantastic dialogue, and playing as her is fun, rewarding, and easily the high point of the game, and it's worth playing for this alone (though was it really necessary to see her in her underwear so prominently? Just because it was in the first game doesn't mean you've got to put it in the sequel). However, it causes a rather jarring discontinuity when you're presented the muscly hunk of the second protagonist Kian, who is as generic as they come and has all the personality and humour of a plank of wood with a serious face painted on it. If they were trying to make a point about the opposing nature of the two main characters then it is poorly made, as the opposite of an interesting character does not need to be a boring one. Playing as Kian was a deeply tedious experience.There are only two main environments (one per character) and while they look pretty nice at first, they're less appealing after the fifth time trudging through them, and it's a far cry from the feeling of adventure and discovery in the previous games. At one point a bunch of paths in the technological overworld get closed off, which serves no point other than to be annoying as you can still get everywhere, you just need to take an even longer route. The magical world's equivalent to this is to feature the most epically terrible stealth puzzle the world has ever seen -- something which the designers attempt to hang a lantern on with a 'so you thought there wouldn't be stealth, but there is and you suck at it' achievement, which is a joke in somewhat poor taste considering how badly the puzzle is designed, and how completely unecesscary it is.Sadly it's not the only bit of questionable design. There's a big thing about how your choices shape the story, but the choices you're presented with are so highly ambiguous that you might as well flip a coin for them, and then you're told in big letters THIS WAS IMPORTANT. THIS PERSON WILL REMEMBER. What, so all the other stuff I've been doing isn't important? The rest of my interactions are forgettable? The mechanic appears to be that these choices shift the gameplay in some manner, but they can't shift it too much as the story has to follow the same overall arc, so it comes across as kind of pointless. All it means is that you're guaranteed to be denied some content -- some of the walkthroughs I looked at referred to puzzles and sections that I never got to see. Adventure games don't have a terribly high replay value, so all this achieved was making me feel that I'd missed out. The choices feel very unsatisfying, and I think it's because they're trying to make them shape the story rather than the character. In Mass Effect (which I consider to be the gold standard for choice-based gameplay) the choices you make have little to no impact on the main story, but they have a massive effect on how you view your character, and while they may have had minor gameplay implications you didn't feel that you'd missed out on anything, but that's a roleplaying game where the development of your character is important to you. Here there aren't any roleplaying elements, and the choices you're forced to make don't develop your character in any way as the game will rationalise them so that the character you've been given remains consistent.And then there are bits where the illusion of choice comes crashing down -- there's one bit where you have to chase after a character, but you're not in time to catch them. Only this is in an overworld, so you have the option of buggering off somewhere else. It's okay, they'll wait for you. You can even work your way around and approach them from the front -- but the game then begins its cutscene with you running up behind them. There are some profoundly interminable cutscenes, invariably of people talking to each other - I was playing on a laptop and there were several times where the screensaver kicked in due to the lack of input, which made me wonder a bit if the creators would have preferred to make a film. It's also distinctly tonally inconsistent. Sometimes it's lighthearted and funny, sometimes it's serious and drab and sometimes there are bits that make me think 'really? was that entirely necessary?'.There are some interesting moments, and it's possible that once it's complete I'll revisit it with a different opinion, but as it stands I don't feel it a story worth the time it takes to tell.

												I really really WANT to like it. It does have some very good voice acting and a cool story. But there's some things driving me nuts about this game and if you're an impatient ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me they'll bug you too. Performance is crap first of all...sure we don't need 60+ FPS in an adventure game but I get insanely low framerates during certain scenes (Psychiatrists Office comes to mind about 15-20 FPS) which is rather unexplicable, it's not graphically intense, nor are there any crazy physics happenings.EDIT: The performance issues have been improved quite a bit with some patches. The animations / character movement have not improved one bit in the 10 years since Dreamfall: The longest Journey. Watch some youtube footage of cutscenes and you'll see what I mean here. Everyone is a robot. Lastly - and this is my BIGGEST gripe - at every single point in the game so far I've felt as if I'm just stumbling around completely lost until I somehow get lucky and trip over the thing I needed. There hasn't been any cool ""eureka"" moments with the puzzles / objectives...I've felt like just a LITTLE more direction would've been helpful at nearly every point. NPCS offer almost no help whatsoever as to how you're supposed to accomplish things.  And ""Oh, hey you finally figured your way around the city?

It's just annoying the hell out of me. I may yet change this review if the later books are less ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ shiting♥♥♥♥♥♥shit""EDIT: ""Puzzles"" in later books are just as bad if not worse (I.E. The Drawing puzzle, I didn't play the first game and the 2nd game was 10 years ago... You think I actually remember the plot Red Thread?). Would benefit madly from a hint system as really I just want the story dammit. None of the puzzles give you that clever eureka moment when you do solve them and I'm still left stumbling around searching every square inch of the map looking for what the hell I'm supposed to do severly hindering the pacing of the game.

												Shockingly bad performance still, although it's patched to playable levels by now, so there's that. I wouldn't call that a plus, but at least they tried.Much of the game feels very lifeless and artificial. Sure, many NPCs roam the streets, but they got no life to them, nowhere to go apart from walking the same old circles, or to stand around and repeat the same sound clips ad infinitum.On top of that it takes forever for them to release the episodes. So what little traction the story might have gotten, it's completely vaporized in the long downtime.The game does have its merits, it has some nice touches here and there, but they mainly stand out because it's not that hard to rise above the averageness of the experience.I might be revisiting my opinion once this is actually a complete product, and advise everyone who is still interested, in waiting till all episodes are released. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.			"

												As it stands, I cannot recommend this game.I was wary when I first heard Red Thread Games was releasing Chapters in installments rather than a full-fledged game. I had backed it on Kickstarter and at that point, they were talking about a single game, not vignettes. I wasn't particularly happy about it, but I put my faith in the team that had brought us TLJ and Dreamfall (though I felt much more strongly about the former compared to the latter) and decided to wait and see.The result is a 4 hour tutorial that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. Sure, we get to Europolis, but the sidequests there cannot be finished. That's right—you go through these tedious ""find this thing and bring it to this person"" quests, but there's no resolution. Each one is a dead end. You don't actually fulfill any of the quests you set out to complete.I felt like there was way too much fluff injected into this one, as well. Minus the opening sequences with Zoe and then with Kian, it's basically a lot of talking and not enough action. The entire segment with s***bot, as funny as it was, was completely unnecessary and did not contribute to the plot whatsoever.As far as design goes, I was very disappointed by Europolis. I literally saw the exact same character models standing next to each other sometimes, same clothes and all. This guy was everywhere I turned. It's like the city is populated strictly by clones. Moreover, you see basically nothing of Arcadia in this game, which was a huge disappointment to me, and I'm a bit put off by this ""Saga"" nonsense (if it's headed in the direction I think it is, which it appears to be).Ragnar and Red Thread Games gave us a beautiful backdrop and interesting NPCs, but nothing interesting to do. That's a big problem, and not what I paid $110 on Kickstarter for.EDIT: After playing Book Two, my opinion still stands. I actually can't play all of Book Two without restarting, because one of the quests at the beginning (getting a character to infiltrate a meeting) won't trigger properly no matter what I do. I also noticed the camera is somehow worse than it was before. No matter how many times I try to zoom out a little so I'm not directly over my character's shoulder, I'm pulled back in a few seconds later. It's disorienting and dizzying and I really don't enjoy being nauseous.I've also fallen through the streets of Marcuria twice, which means restarting from your last save. And just like in Stark, the models for people on the streets are reused to a laughable degree. The same dude with a really unmistakable hat appears in the same area three times. That's just lazy.I've already paid for all installments, but if I could, I'd cancel and ask for my money back. I am not happy with this game whatsoever.			"

												Beautiful, but boring. There isn´t a lot of ""game"" in this first chapter. No puzzels, only running from place a to place b. The writing is quite lackluster compared to the previous two instalments. Some of the characters are funny but not interesting enought for me to care. I found myself skipping lot of the meaningles dialog, when in the first game i would listen for every little piece of dialogue. I hope that the second chapter will be a lot better.			"

Point and click becomes boring, thedious and frustrating fast in this game. For the story, they claim that every decision has an impact on key moments, but in the end, I don't feel like I made a big impact.

Controls are a bit klunky and unpolished but definitely designed with controller input in mind. Can't move while interacting (which is frustrating with the ""go here"" interaction) and the walk/runspeed is way too slow for my tastes. Visuals are VERY pretty but character animations, particularly facial animations, are minimal. In some cases facial animations are practically absent, which gives a very creepy uncanny valley effect when combined with the fantastic voice acting. Not perfect, but absolutely worth the buy.			"

												It's an Adventure game in the classic tradition; heavy on the story, light on the gameplay, point and click. It's got all that and for a while it's actually pretty interesting. However, there aren't really any puzzles in the game, it's more errand running to move the story along - which is fine if you like the ambiance. One problem is the way developers sought to slow players progression. Repeatedly, the game will tell you a general goal (""get into X"" or ""find a Y"") and then nothing. Only 30 minutes later (or after checking a FAQ) do you find that the innocuous flavor NPC on a side street ACTUALLY has a new interaction that, when used in the right place, allows you to progress. Nothing will hint that this, you're just expected to click everything again to find it.What got me to uninstall this game though was the hamfisted moral choice-consequence system. Spoilers -- but there's a segment where you're given a choice to Torture or Blackmail a person. Despite the illusion of choice; TORTURE is considered CORRECT. If you don't torture a certain NPC, people will die and then blame you. They will then explain to you how torture is more reliable than blackmail / interrogation. (screenshot: http://nitecrew.biz/images/2015-08-08_00001.jpg )I don't care if there's supposed to be some long-haul lesson about complex morality; torture is always wrong and I can't recommend any media that argues otherwise.

												I was quite shocked that Book One ended so quickly, I was expecting a little bit more, especially from our beloved Arcadia. Don't get me wrong, the world is absolutely amazing, graphics is stunning and attention to detail is breathtaking. It shows where most of the work on the game was spent. Unfortunately this over-attention to detail also means that there is hardly any storyline and the puzzles were trivial and not very ingenious. For the future installments I'd appreciate if the team focused more on the actual gameplay rather than raw graphics (however impressive it is). I feel like the original spirit of TLJ is slowly disappearing.7/10			"

												I can't recommend this game at all. I played both of the previous titles, and they were great. This one is problematic, starting with the fact that I saved my game (caution: spoilers) at waking Zoe, then could not get back to that position in the game when I restarted and loaded the latest save. Considering how little there was to do, and how much dialog I had to just sit through, it didn't feel much like a game at all. It was boring, and sitting through another half hour of the exact same dialog, because the game didn't take me back to where I left off, completely soured me on the experience. Perhaps some day I'll return, but as it stands now, I'm very disappointed, even though I got it on sale.			"

												You start in some kind of dreamworld. Your comatoese self lying on a bed, the dreaming (?) you walking around. The game tells me that I can look at things by pressing A. So I look at the bed and some things around it. Several times. I can't leave the place. There is no telling what to do. After walking around in the very small area for twenty minutes I happen to move close enough to the border and I can see a ""trapped dreamer"" and is able to leave the bed scene. Now I am at a very small bridge. Someone falls past the bridge. Several times. The game tells me that I can track the falling person by pressing X. So I do that. The person keeps falling. I try to press A and the game tells me that the person falls to fast. No hint, no nothing. The person keeps falling and I keep tracking her. I am getting very anoyed so I press X and A repeatedly when the person falls past the bridge for like the hundreth time. That helps, a new menu appears and I am able to slow down time. Maybe the game should have told me that it is possible to get a new menu and not just tell med that I can press X?Well, it doesn't help much anyway. The controls are weird ant it takes med 10+ tries before I am able to catch the falling person. The trapped dreamer disappers, I on the other hand, is still trapped on the very small bridge. But I have learned that I should move close to the edges of scenes to get to new locations and I am able to move to a dreamer trapped in darkness. But it is too late. I am anoyed and bored. I try to help the dreamer for a few minutes but controls are not very helpful and the story fails to drag me in. I really liked the first two games and I was really hoping to get a conclusion to the story but I will probably never play the game again.			"

												I can't in good conscience give this a positive review for a few reasons:The second worst thing is that the items you can identify change. You can walk past something you'll need in a few seconds time and it won't even show. Then once you've done something else it will show, but by that time you've mentally discarded the place the object you'll need is in, considering it empty. That makes some of the puzzles annoying.There are also places where some of the characters involved with the puzzles suddenly become so stupid that they'll do something that you've ruled out as ""too stupid"". That also makes the game almost impossible in places. Once you solve those you'll want to reach through the screen and strangle the developers.Some of the items are a bit too difficult to find in the huge environments (compared to similar two dimensional games) – It's like they didn't adjust to the larger scale.Another thing I don't like is the lack of autorun. The jogging speed of the characters isn't fast and the maps are large and in places confusing, so it gets physically straining on my fingers to navigate. I must have covered miles by now, all of it straining to hold the mouse buttons down.However, the worst thing about the game is that it's a beautiful mess. The developers have barely tacked the 2.1 threads together and it's done very poorly. The end is probably the most disappointing end to a game I've ever seen. It shows an immense lack of imagination, not in the broad theme of what's going on, which is cool, but in translating that into integration between the threads. Given what is going on they could have had a lot more fun with it, but they didn't, so while the story goes from the banal to the sublime the gameplay remains 99% banal.The overall impression is of poor overall planning.It's so disappointing when the people with the funding to make a huge game like this, with such immense potential, manage to mess it up so badly.

												I recommend this game only because it's good.. not great.. but good. Also, because it's the first part in a series which will, hopefully, get better with subsequent chapters.I really wasn't blown away by Chapter I. I realize it's intended to set up the story and sorta introduce, or re-introduce different characters, but coming on the heels of TLJ and Dreamfall, it felt very uneven. Some really great moments, broken up by long, uninteresting ones. Really hoping this story takes off with Chapter 2.Edit: (updated 3/21/16)Coming back to the game after some time, with RTG having added more chapters to the game and, disappointingly, I have to change my review to Not Recommended.The last time I played, I got through a bit of Kian's story before I finally just got fed up and said forget it. I was in the middle of working through a to-do list for a NPC and it just bored me to death. Between that, and another puzzle type task I had just completed, whose solution was so arbitrary, with no logical train of thought leading to it, I decided to step away from the game for a while.I recently decided to play from the beginning again, having played through once before. Figured I'd start again, with a fresh perspective. I don't know if they changed the controls or what, but just getting past the first bit (with the falling girl) was a hair-ripping experience. After several unsuccessful attempts at  trying to slow them down, then grab them, I finally said ""Nope. Forget it"". I'd gotten through that bit with complete ease when the game was just released, and it was far more intuitive. So, I think they changed something with the controls or interaction since then, and not for the better.The storyline, dialog, voice acting, everything else is great. If this were an interactive story, my opinion would likely be quite different, as Ragnar Tornquist and co. consistently turn out brilliant work in that capacity. However, as this is a game and intended to be interactive, I feel it falls short.As much as I would have loved to, I can't recommend this.From now on, if I feel I want to visit Stark and Arcadia, I'll just play one of the first two games in the series.

												WARNING EXTREME RACIST AND SEXIST PROPAGANDA FOR SJWsI like a lot of people loved the longest journey and thought dreamfall was ok as a follow up. So it saddened me to learn that the developers of this game are renowned in the gaming community for their extremist views. I hoped the game wouldn't be too polluted with this... two hours in the female protagonist, after some oddly forced socialist propaganda, starts to insult characters, dismissing them as 'Boring and white conservative'. Were this any other race there is no way they would get away with it. Can you imagine the hero of a game dismissing a protester as dumb and black? So why it this ok? The game developers red thread games have demonstrated hardline sexism in their promotional campaign where they featured female only shots, and deliberately excluded as any male characters... calling this diversity. It is nauseating to pay money and find characters being insulted because they have the same skin colour as you, and this is depicted as being correct and morally superior. The whole game is a very thin empty piece of propaganda, with no real characters and appalling cringe worthy teenage dialogue and writing, it's a great shame as the longest journey was an absolute classic, but the developers have let their personal problems and need to push sinister Orwellian political messages ruin their franchise, In the longest journey we had a great female protagonist... she was great because she never went on or made a point about being female. Sadly, the protagonist here is nothing more than a crude mouthpiece for anti white racism and misandry, I have a refund and advise anyone who enjoys well written games, equality and not being told what to think to avoid. It is also an extremely technically poor game and would look rank average beside games 5 years ago.			"

												This is not so much ""Book 1"" as it is a playable demo. Even with me exploring and clicking on virtually everything, I finished in 6 hours. I still do not know what the story is about.Large chunks of that playtime, though, was listening to very long exposition, with no actual visual content—so long, in fact, that my controller kept turning off.There seems to be only the faintest link between the end of Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters. I don't even know who this Zoe is, which is compounded by the fact that she doesn't know who she is and I'm asked to figure that out. Then there's the boring guy from Dreamfall in Arcadia doing... something. All told, I think there were about 7 puzzles in all that time, and they were easy and uninspired. Not to mention the fact that the Mac version didn't play at all until the first patch, and I understand the Linux version suffered the same problem.Red Thread: If you needed another month, you should have just taken it.

												I want to play a point and click adventure game, not watch a soap opera.  I tried really hard to like this game because I liked the longest journey too much. This game is high on its self. Massive amounts of unskippable cutscenes, long winded dialog, and a choppy story line trying two converge two.  I found it, quite honestly, boring and hard to follow. I found myself alt tabbing away out of boredom. It's a beautiful game, very well made, but it's not for me.  "

												It pains me to say this, but this game is nothing short of terrible. I've been a devout fan of the Longest Journey Saga for agest, and Dreamfall (the old one that is) sits tall and proud in my favourite games list. However, Dreamfall Chapters is a resounding disappointment. In essence, it's a mere TellTale Games clone (pick any of those to compare it to, they are all boring in my opinion). You get to play as a semi-depressed / fully apathetic Zoë Castillo, who aimlessly walks around a metropolis doing mundane chores, such as following a silly (and awfully unfunny) robot around. When it comes to dialogue, it's all about the TellTale system, aka you have a number of options to choose from and an unimmersive and unnecessary HUD tells you that ""Character A will remember what you said"". There is also a section where you get to play as Kian Alvane, with an improbable prison break with run off the mill, uninteresting puzzles to solve while climbing a tower to the exit. There is one thing I enjoyed, and that is the research that went behind the lore of the game. For instance, at some point Zoë starts talking about visiting North-Eastern Italy, specifically Trieste, and she goes on a tangent describing this city's sunny horizon. To summarise, Dreamfall Chapters is charmless, slow, mundane, and insipid. Again, I cannot stress enough how much I'd rather this game be great. Fact is it is not. I haven't finished the first chapter, and I don't think I'll be buying the next ones (edit: as pointed out in the comments, I was not aware that buying one of the chapters lands you all of them, Thanks eye). Now where did I put my Xbox copy... Ah here, let me pop that in for a second...			"

												Based on the video, images, and reviews, I honestly thought I would love this game.  Ha, NOPE!Almost 60-minutes in and I am literally pulling my hair our ranting about this game to my boyfriend.  Not only is it extremely linear, but it is mind-numbing.  I have learned absolutely nothing about the game nor the characters.  All I do know is that it's very one-way.  Do this.  Do this.  Do this.  DON'T THINK ABOUT EXPLORING--It's not happening!  Or at least it hasn't yet.  Oh and tutorials?  What are is this thing you speak of?  They don't exist.  I have no idea what I'm doing to the point where I, in frustration, button mash with the hopes of magically clicking on or doing the right thing.Seriously though, it doesn't explain how to interact with the world.  Yes, in theory, it's straightforward.  But in reality?  It's harder than it looks.  For example, right off the bat, someone is falling.  There's no tutorial to show you how to use your powers.  There's nothing that says, ""HEY, LOOK AT HER AND CLICK A!""  No, that would make too sense.  It would rather have you frantically look around for a stick, rope, ladder--whatever to save this falling person's life.  Sadly, no such thing exists so you just feel like you've failed the world.When you eventually realize that A is the only button worth using (assuming you're using an Xbox controller), you think to yourself, ""God, I'm dumb.""  No, you're really not.  The game really just wants to make you figure everything out on your own.  Which is fine and dandy but... no.  I want to have fun.  Not throw my controller across the room because I failed to save the falling woman 20 times!  Yes, 20 times.  I swear, if we weren't in dreamworld, she would be dead.Mechanics aside, the main character is annoying.  WHY DO YOU USE THE SAME LINE 100 TIMES?!  Like, yes, we get it.  The dream machine is bad.  CAN YOU BE ORIGINAL!?  How old are you?  5?  Because you honestly sound 5.  Not only that, but she's extremely judgmental.  And, from the sounds of it, she's saved the world before.  SO WHY IS SHE BEING SO EDGY?!  Like, ooooh, the world is calling upon you to save them again.  Better be salty as f--- so everyone knows I'm really just a teenage girl who's useless.Long rant aside, I do not recommend this game.  Only buy it if it's like... $1.99.  Not worth a penny more.  So glad Steam decide to do this return policy.  I'm definitely getting my money back./END RANT/			"

												The Longuest Journey was one of the best games. Dreamfall was good but not as good.I wanted to love Dreamfall Chapters or at least like it, but besides from being very buggy (it crashes a lot, some strange things happen to people they get streched while talking to them or disappear), the running is annoyingly slow. The game itself is incredibly short, even for being just a part, I spent the most time running around.But worst of all there are no puzzles like in tlj or Dreamfall to solve, nothing, you just listen to dialogs and select some answers. It is very much too boring.Another thing that annoyed me, that the people on the street are having the same dialog all over again, you need to pass some spots quite often and you hear the same dialogs again and again. Also it feels like the poeple on the streets are just four different persons and all running around are just clones.I am sad now.			"

												I loved spending time in the worlds created in this game, especially Propast.  All the flavor dialogue when looking around was great.  A feature I havn't seen in many games which I really enjoyed here was the dialogue wheel actually had your characters thoughts voice acted to you before you chose.  I really felt they gave you a stronger attachment to each person as you get little bits of their reasoning and thought process.The game dragged a bit in spots and since you have multiple main characters and locations its easy to prefer one over the other as the game progresses.  Knowing the story of the previous games is highly recommended.Some puzzles left me aggrevated but perhaps I am just daft, mostly this is not an issue.  The graphics engine has some serious limitations especially with action scenes.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this game from the story to the world, characters and music.			"

												Made by hipsters for hipsters. The Longest Journey was good. Charming, full of character. Most importantly story and game complemented each other. These new games seem to borrow too many pages from Telltale, i.e. too much focus on character interaction and too little on world interaction.  Wasn't one likable character in chapter one, closest had to be the black guy with the funky getup.Too much politics in episode 1. Can't play the rest due to not meeting recommended specs.Whatever they do to April, they kind of ruined that character in the first Dreamfall so it doesn't matter.The controls takes some time getting used to and even then it's the opposite of effficient.Slow start. If you liked the first Dreamfall you'll probably like this. May get better eventually, not to me tho.			"

												Great game! Piece of art! One of the most beautiful and interesting games in the world!The new Unity engine made the game even more beautiful!Now a little bit of critic.1. The first thing that spoils the impression of the game, it's Kian Alvane ... Three times in the whole game, he honestly admits that he is gay. It's very sad. What for he did it? It would be better in such moments simply keep silent. Dear developers, the children will play this game! Don't forget.When Kian begins to worry about Bip, it seems that he is not only gay, but maybe also a pedophile?It would be even funnier if Kian would tempt each guard with magic spells and finally organize the gay parade...With the same success, Zoe would constantly grumble about her menstrual pain, Vamon would regularly drink viagra before visits to Sister Sahya and Enu would fight against castration of animals in Marcuria.2. Not much of beautiful clear epic backgrounds in a game. Stark is very beautiful and brutal. In the background there are beautiful futuristic buildings and flying cars, but they are very blurred. It seems that Zoe Castillo suffers from myopia.Some cars in the streets look like very ugly. It feels a strong contrast between the design of these vehicles and the environment. The design of these terrible cars must be looking like Lamborghini Centenario or at least like BMW Efficient Dynamics!Arcadia's architecture is very boring, it's haven't got self unique style. Buildings in Mercury monotonous and resemble a cheap medieval architecture.In a such perfect game player wants to see a better quality of locations, similar to Mass Effect and Dark Souls.3. The fifth book is extremely rich with different events. But all these events are very short. The whole fifth book very short compared to the others. It would be better to enjoy every moment of the last book a little longer. The final fight with the wizard Roper Klacks must be much longer.4. Brian Westhouse's face is so respectable and honest, that I was greatly surprised by the end of the game, that he would be the main villain. He has a simple motivation in the game. All the trouble that he did, was to get back home. Instead of him there must be a mad troll with an ugly face like a Freddy Krueger, with a voice like Yaga and a disgusting smell from the mouth! He became an evil because of magic inhabitants at the beginning of the game killed all of his friends and relatives. And he decided to take revenge on all magical beings of Arcadia!Maybe this would be a better motivation?5. I wish that the game had multiple endings. I wonder what would have happened if Zoe and Kian decided to combine the two worlds? Maybe it would be better for everyone?But the whole game is brilliant! No one has ever done anything like this in the adventure genre. Witty puzzles, favorite oldschool style of game. Dreamfall made a new era in the creation of quests and adventures! Bravo!Thank you! Good luck to developers!			"

												If you're a gamer that cares more about the story, and world-building, than triple A graphics; then I strongly recommend this saga. Start with the wonderfully crafted ""The Longest Journey"" (1999), be brave and play the awkward but intriguing Dreamfall (2006), and then buy this. The first kichstarter game that I can actually consider a succes. Or at least it's on the verge of being so, since we only have Book 1 till now.			"

												With only Book One out currently, I cannot recommend this game. The plot feels like it's only barely starting to go somewhere. That said, if you have not yet played Dreamfall, you MUST play it first. The enjoyment I drew from Book One came from knowing who these characters are and wondering where they will go. I don't see a player new to the series enjoying the game very much. Dreamfall is easily one of my favorite games, Yes, The Longest Journey comes before it, however if you play Dreamfall first, like I did, it still works well. The Longest Journey can be played as a pre-quel and there's enough separation between the two that you won't feel lost starting with Dreamfall instead of from the beginning.We'll have to wait for the rest of the game to be released to make a final recommendation, but this is an exellent time to pick up Dreamfall and play through it.

												As a huge fan of 'The longest journey' and Dreamfall I was really lookign forward for the release of this game. Unfortunately the game has one huge issue (which renders it unplayable for me):It is performing terribly even on recommended hardware. I own a i5 760 @ 3,6 Ghz and a GTX760, System runs at High Performance setting, so no throttling.  With this setup I am able to play most games at high settings in 1024p resolution. Bioshock Infinity, Tomb Raider, Watchdogs, Farcry, Shadow of Morder - no problem. This game though is very choppy. For instance the Title Screen is completely fine, intro is choppy, first area seems to run somewhat fine, then framerate crashes in second chapter. Inbetween massive framerate drops. Many users already reported that problem. Even after three patches it has not been resolved. Developer states that the game graphics are 'demanding' and they can't do much optimization as they are limited with the Unity engine. Sorry that is a poor excuse. FAQ in their forum to solve this problem doesn't help at all.As long as this has not been issued I strongly discourage you from purchasing this game. A pity because let's plays on this game look great! (Only way for me to enjoy the game.. by watching others play it)			"

												I played this game (book1) and remark there are still bugs in the game that forced you to do some interaction in a certain order, otherwise you are blocked. This game could be great, but I don't want to waste time to search for something that I can't found because of bugs. So I will not recommend this game, or then perhaps after some patches.			"

												The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are great games, they are pure rhodium in adventure game genre but I can't recommend remake of this game. Why? Because this game is very buggy and poor optimized therefore playing this game is a masochism. Game was made in Unity Engine but it does not mean that game must have poor performance. For example Anima Gate of Memories and Deus Ex The Fall also were made in Unity Engine but they work very good. This could be true masterpiece but with such poor optimization it is wasted potential because game works very slow and unstable. So Red Thread Games, let it be your lesson: FIRST LEARN HOW TO OPTIMIZE GAME AND THEN RELEASE IT TO SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you want to play these great games get classic versions The Longest Journey + Dreamfall (it is cheaper in bundle). This remake is not worth to buy for 30 euro/dollars.I'm really sorry that I had to write this review but it is really unforgivable to release such poor optimized game for horrendous price (there are many good games for lower prices).

												Worst in the series. Not because the game is bad itself, but because how the developers treat gamers.I have always been the biggest fan of the Longest Journey (the original). And I’m still. When I played Dreamfall in year of 2006, I was looking forward for the next game. When I saw developers were collecting money on Kickstarter, I immediately pledge at a word.But now, I am starting to hate Dreamfall the Chapters. This game is the only game which runs with artefacts on my computer (just imagine character’s eyes with laser beams like the Superman). What else? It took five months to release Book two. Chapter 5 in that is the shortest. And I have spent only a little time playing it from the beginning to the end. As one can see, the developer’s efficiency is questionable. In addition, I was heartily sick of the developer’s Tolstoy-like “novels” that I was getting every time before a release date by email explaining which event on Mars stops them from releasing. No one should play it until all the books has been released. Otherwise, keep something calmative nearby.			"

												Decisions you make in the game don't impact the storyline in any way(Feel free to correct me here). The most you get is to decide who lives or dies with your choices(all the main characters of course have invincible plot armors, so don't worry about them, its the secondary characters and occasional unnamed red shirts that can get hit by a truck), but *even these events* have little to no secondary repercussions. A series of tweets from the developer just before release of book 5 strongly implied that this game would have at least 2 different endings. Alas, no such thing. Made me seriously doubt the honesty of these guys, and if they ever release some other games, i would rather stay away from them.			"

												The game has been quite slow and lifeless compared to the previous titles I loved. But one thing was the nail in the coffin for me: You need to distract some guards to get into a house. There is hay is you could burn, and festive materials you could use, there is a child who has helped you before with distracting guards, there is a sleeping drug nearby, there are so many things you could use.But instead this game wants you to throw a living rat into some pipes to get shredded along the way and mess up the machinery. There's no reason for this. It's not like you are stuck in some dungeon with limited resources. This was stupid and unneccessary. They could have patched another option in, but one year later they haven't.			"

												I really want to like this game. It's beautiful, it's interesting, the plot is fantastic, the writing is great but... I basically have no idea where to go or what to do at any given point. I know what my objectives are but when I'm stuck in a futuristic city with no direction on WHERE to actually go at any given time, it is very frustrating. I got to the point where I was having to search online for where in the world to find X person or place at such a frequent rate that it became impossible to immerse myself within the game. Essentially this game is like being from a farm in Russia and being sent to New York City for the first time and being expected to find a single lady named Nela restocking her supplies somewhere in the city. Somewhere. That is your only hint. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!			"

												Forget everything good about the game, look, depth etc. because navigation is a nightmare.I can't find anyway to next part of mission, no maps, no direction compass, no guidence, no clues. Apparently you're expected to roam the city streets listening to conversations to help you find your way. This is a very strange decision to make as people have been using maps for thousands of years to find their way around the world and cities. Well I don't have hours to sit and listen to conversations to find clues to next location. Just a game destroyer which is so sad as the game looks like it'd a good one, especially judging by users who have the time to spend on the streets. If they ever add a map I'll give it another go but until then...Delete. Try and find another RPG where you can find loctations, missions and all that other game stuph.			"

It comes across as melodramatic one time too many.Compared to Dreamfall, the controls are slower and make me seasick.Compared to Dreamfall, the faces, the voice acting and anatomical proportions are less charismatic and somewhat off. Its short, so I cant say whats yet to follow, but all in all it felt a bit uneventful. Ive just finished the game and I feel kind of tired and slowed down.

												I enjoyed the story of TLJ/dreamfall and wanted to see where it went after the major cliffhanger. Thus far I have not been able to play this as, has been noted, the game has very high system requirements. Adjusting the settings makes very little difference. My primary interest is in the story and I'm not big a gamer and am not going to stay on the 'bleeding edge' of hardware just for one game. I'm very disappointed there is no option to make this playable on average hardware, even if it massively reduces the graphical quality. Dream fall don't look bad and doesn't have ridiculous system demands.I ended up watching a lets play on youtube and it was good at the start. What wrecks it is the amount of foul language which is thrown around without any regard. Now I'm not against swearing within reason. What bothers me is that it's so pronounced it looses any impact it would otherwise have, feeling like the developers had a bet to see who could cram in the most swear words.			"

												# This is version 2 of my review, covering episode 1/5Starting at the end, when ep. 1 was finally over, our (mine + my SOs) feelings were: ""It's a pitty about a legendary series"", ""Why did I back this [on Kickstarter]?"" and ""Is this supposed to be finished, it felt more like a tutorial / tech demo than an actual game?"". These feelings have not changed.However, it was brought to my attention that this game would get 5 episodes, not only 2 as I'd originally thought, which means that 5 hours play time is about par for the course. It still doesn't excuse the fact thata) there's hardly any actual gameplay. AFAIKR the original TLJ Dreamfall was criticised for being more of an interactive movie than a point-and-click, yet I never could see that and anyway, it worked. This time around it's justified and -- so far -- it doesn't. b) there's no developents to speak of, neither character- nor story-wise, no build-up of mystery, suspense ... anythingRunning around doing menial tasks following instructions (a lab assignment, f.i.) is all right for a tutorial and/or to give the player a feeling of normalcy before everything goes wrong, but one whole episode is too much, even if it's just 20% of the game.c) The controls concept is very nice in theory, but very finicky in practise, at least on PC. And yes, Europolis is beautyful and epic and all that, but the ""intelligent"" maps got on my nerves in no time and after a while you just want to get there the 2015 way, via some kind of fast-travel system.If I had to sum up the episode in one word it would be ""tedious"" and a game shouldn't ever be that. One can only hope that it get better -- the potential is there.			"

												I loved TLJ and Dreamfall.  This review is strictly for episode one as it's all that's out and all I've played.  The worst part about episode one is all the running around you do in the city.  You spend a good amount of time just running back and forth across the map (which I didn't find very intuitive to navigate).  I didn't find the dialogue to be as good or interesting as the previous two games either, there is nothing that hooks you from the beginning and makes you want to keep playing.  Lastly, the graphics can look good with the settings maxed out, however the animations are pretty bad.  The characters are stiff and there isn't much facial expression.  I know this was similar to the Dreamfall but it didn't bother me as much in that game.			"

												UPDATE POST-BOOK 5.Book 5 was, sadly, a disappointment. There was no ""game"" to the last chapter--mostly, the game element involved moving your character from point A or point B, with the occasional pixel-hunt thrown in for good measure.  There were so many long cut scenes with long dialogue explanations (also known as exposition) I started playing solitaire on my phone.  The various plot elements never really came together. It's like the various story threads got away from them, and they tried to wrap it up as best they could, but they bit off more than they could chew.  The character's movements were quite limited, and sometimes the need to search the screen for the ""hot point"" made me nauseous due to the rotating perspective.  This game just had too many characters and too much plot.  The whole tower/dream/etc. stuff never made any sense whatsoever.  Ambitious game, but it does not measure up to TLJ.Review of parts 1-4; *mild spoilers* (thematic, not plot or puzzle).I liked it...until it became about the Nazis.One of the things I loved about the Longest Journey series was its originality and unpredictability.  The stories were compelling, with interesting characters and good puzzles.  This game has some great visuals, and it's certainly a fun world to wander around in.  Some of the characters are boring/two-dimensional, though (Kian, I'm talking to you), and there isn't much to do besides find & fetch puzzles and wander around talking to people.It's the story I have a big problem with, however. How many games, TV shows, and movies have to be about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust? Doctor Who does it practically every season (exterminate!), Star Trek has done it (you will be assimilated), and pretty much every sci fi show has done it. I play these games to be transported, not massively bummed out and reminded (yet again!) of the deaths of 6 million Jewish people.  It's utterly disapponting.  I get it, it's important for people to learn the lessons of history, but this is like smashing people in the face with a history book (simply turning Jews into ""magicals"" does not conceal the heavy-handed message).  It isn't original, or even interesting.  It's supposed to be a game, not a history lesson.			"

What makes it even more annoying is that there is no clear explanation given on tasks. It would also be very nice to have a better hint on things you may interact with. I am totally upset and I can't believe I spent an hour and hadn't done much interesting throughout the gameplay.			"

												Disappointed.I've played both the predecessors, loved both, but this game wasn't the pickup right where the last game left off sequel I thought I was getting.The sequel portrays Zoe very differently from depressed undergraduate, to hero trapped in the dream realm saving people from dream machines gone haywire stuck in a coma. Now I actually liked this change in pase, although some of the nightmare puzzles were a little annoying, the classic dreamfalls humor and gorgeous artsy visuals made it enjoyable.I didn't mind the intro, but when they did a time lapse, gave the protagonist amnesia and briefly went over the fates of  some of the previous characters it really irked me; Cherry on top, you are put into a new city with no recollection, stuck in a game tutorial for the rest of the first installment. I had to drag myself through this gutt wrenching beginning missions hoping for some plot, but before I knew it the game had ended prematurely and on a cliff hanger. This was not the best foot forward. Not how I imagined TLJ series to make a comeback, but I really hope they bounce back with better installments, hopefully longer and with more substance.			"

												I'br always loved the games in this series, and was excited to when this one came out! Unfortunatley this game is horribly optimized, I am gettng like 15 - 20 fps on high on an r9 280x....Now I know I don't have the most powerful card but really?If I had known it was this bad I would have just skipped the game until it got fixed. There is no excuse for such horrible performance on a game with these visuals . I would not reccommend the game to anyone at this point, not until they fix it.Update: 10/31/2014They released their performance update, but it is still nowhere near ideal. I can get around 30 fps now but that is still really bad, and it's never very consistent. I might just be picky but I do not like playing a game that is really choppy.			"

												I am very sorry, but as a fan of 'The Longest Journey' and as a Kickstarter backer I can't  recommend this game for now. Yes, 'Dreamfall Chapters' does promise a great story - but those good sides are rather obscured by episodic releases, while all the bad sides are already clearly evident:- Bad language. Too much of it - 'DC' has more bad language per square millimeter of gameplay I have ever seen in a computer game. I have no idea what the developers wanted to say. Why, we have ladies present here! Wait... OK, those ARE the ladies who are using that much of bad language. Well, call me old-fashioned, but I prefer ladies who do not swear all the time for no apparent reason.- The graphics. It is not so bad, but even 'Dreamfall' of 2006 did not look much worse. Dark and gloomy Dreamworld, dark and gloomy prison, dark and gloomy Europolis city... And not a sight of the sunny Arcadia.- The bugs. The game is obviously not optimised - FPS is jumping back and forth, and even powerful PCs have some trouble running it without any crashes.So - there is not much sense in buying the game for now (if you do not already have a Kickstarter backer's code). And I still hope that I would be able to recommend this game after it will be released completely in a year or so!			"

												Unpolished, rushed, uninspired. By the ammount of pointless dialogs, should have been a book. 2/3's of the game is composed of filler dialogs that don't exapand on neither the story nor the characters.Extremely annoying is the lack of proofing for all texts in the game, as if translated from russian, dialogs are bland and empty. Ragnar Tørnquist tries to lead a game studio without the full power of Funcom, and by the look of things is over his head.The Longest Journey - 8/10Dreamfall: The Longest Journey - 10/10Dreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey - 2/10Kickstarter backer.Update:Hey guys, thanks for the response and the gift. Proofing wise the dialogs are fine, its the style I have the problem with. I have an example for you: re-read the Makoya harassment scene. An Asian man starts to tell a seeming beautiful tale that should be a lesson for the man they are harassing. It starts fine, goes on and on without any direction for a while and ends with ""You stupid ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. As part of an ancient tale of wisdom. This foreign injected cussing elements are littered throughout the dialogs and serve no purpose, but every time you hear them its like nails going over a chalkboard.I am a game developer working with translators all the time (10 languages per project). For some reason when the source material comes from Slavic countries, the texts are littered with ""emotional cussing"" whenever opportunity presents. Have a native English speaker go over those dialogs and see the cancerous bits cut out.You had an extremely polished first and last portion of the game, but the Europolis area looked like a rushed prototype. I'm sure you were not happy with it, but had to release it due to deadline pressure. Print a quote and put in somewhere visible: ""No one remembers the delays, everyone remembers the launched product"". In 1.5 years when you release your final episode, backers will be your least concern regarding deadlines. We can wait, you don't need to rush things. The vocal part of the community demanding a release is less than 3% as things usually go. Dont let those voices make you forfeit your principles towards a product you can be proud of.Only justifiable reason for this game to be released in current state I can think of is financial struggles. Which speaks volumes of unrealistic project scope vs available resources. You release it hoping to get some rocket fuel to go on, but realistically if you continue on this path, it will only get worse, tone it down and cut stuff out however painful. Be responsible to yourself. You can always release director's cut in a couple of years.The review will be updated as more episodes come out.			"

												The gameplay is mediocre at best and tedious at worst. But I don't care about that at all.The strong point of the series is the storytelling and the characters. For fans of the series, that is all that ultimately matters.If one hasn't played the prior games of the series, then start there first. Otherwise you will be missing parts of the the story, and that is like starting to read a book right in the middle - you start out without any emotional attachment to the characters and the events that happened before. And I don't think this series can be played in reversed chronological order either, you'd miss out bigtime.			"

												The third and [so far] final in The Longest Journey series, this game was absolutely phenomenal!First of all, I HIGHLY SUGGEST that potential players first play The Longest Journey, then Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, before playing this game to achieve a full understanding and appreciation for a lot of the lore and backlore that sits heavily upon this game in particular, being a story-driven, choices matter game.Personally, I have never been interested in wanting to try a choices matter game, being an old school gamer of point-and-clicks and like in classic Tomb Raider just shoot shoot to kill, but I am so happy that my first experience with one was Dreamfall Chapters! Maybe it had to do with my personal bias for the story itself, but the thing is that this game brought to life such a magical, futuristic, truly out of this world experience just like its predecessors, leaving nothing behind as many sequels do in entertainment. You can just feel yourself immersed in the surroundings, in the story, and even smaller characters you will find yourself caring for very much (Bip!!), and not many games these days can do that.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys beautiful, imaginative storylines of fantasy and sci-fi, though like I stated above, I would try to play the other games first to fully enjoy this game for what it is, though I'm sure you could enjoy it just the same if needed.*The only thing I need to say is there IS a technical issue/bug you MAY experience in which halfway through the game there is a bug in which the game freezes and will not continue, but there ARE fixes on it, for instance I just re-installed the game once and your game saves won't be harmed as this is a steam-cloud game.OVERALL I give Dreamfall Chapters 10/10.And the whole series? 200/10 for giving the little fantasy/sci-fi geeky girl in me wonderful places to escape to, and in which I have wonderful memories playing in! (The series overall spanned around 2 years of my life including during the birth of my daughter! hehe). So much love to this series <3			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is not perfect, but (together with the other two games in the series) still manages to be the most immersive and well-written game I've ever played. In terms of video game stories, there's nothing better. The blending of cyperpunk and fantasy makes for fantastic worldbuilding, and the depth, scope and humanity of the story are unparalleled in my own experience. I haven't been more invested in a game than I feel while playing (and for weeks afterward) Dreamfall Chapters.			"

												Everything in Dreamfall Chapters is tinged with sadness; there's a quietness to every interaction. Everyone speaks in whispers even when urgent events are occurring. No-one moves quickly and things unfold at their own pace, often separate to any agency provided by the player character. You feel the universe revolves around its own story, and your own stories may be essential to the universe, but they aren't necessarily the focus of the universe, the universe hasn't been holding its breath waiting for your arrival.I love this world, I love spending time in it. The game is good.			"

												I love both TLJ and Dreamfall: TLJ and have been waiting for the follow-up for a very very long time. Dreamfall Chapters, like its predecessor, is a heavily narrative-driven game. If you like games like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls like I do, I believe you are going to enjoy Dreamfall Chapters. All the endearing trademarks of the TLJ franchise are also back: funny, witty dialogue, interesting characters, exotic locales, fascinating but mind boggling mysteries :P, great soundtrack, and fantastic voice acting. I also love the new internal monologue game mechanic. It allows you to weigh conversation options in a more organic way because you get to literally hear what Zoey or Kian is thinking.  The choice and consequence mechanic is also pretty intriguing and adds replay value. Book 1 starts out slow but I actually love the pacing. It gives you time to get acquainted with Zoey and, to a lesser extent, Kian and their present situations. Book 2 moves into more traditional adventure gaming territory with more quests and puzzles. The story in Book 2 also picks up considerably and ends with an unexpected and surprising ""bang"".One gripe is that the game is really taking its time reintroducing our favorite characters from past games. The good news is that we'll be seeing Crow in Book 3. Another gripe of mine is that fairly prominent characters from the previous game seem to have been unceremoniously written off. After 8 or so years of waiting, that was a bummer :(. I am hoping that there will be lots of surprises in store for us in the last 3 chapters.All in all, if story matters to you, then I highly recommend Dreamfall Chapters.			"

That's the Unity engine I presume.But that being said. It's very short. I took my time and it only took 4.5 hours to finish. I... must have missed something... I must have. I will still recommend this game, giving the history of this game. But 4.5 hours is a little disappointing. It will potentially have great replay value. Once you get the complete game.

												First off, DO NOT play this game if you haven't played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. There are many elements in this game pointing to the TLJ and DF; you will miss on much enjoyable nostalgia if you do. As with TLJ and DF, the story starts pretty slow; in fact, I was put off by the first chapter, as there is no significant developments in story. It is in the second chapter that the story takes turns and from then on, it's a rollercoaster. Full of jaw-dropping developments triggered by the most trivial of choices you have made through out the game. There are few puzzles in the game, however those aren't very enjoyable. I was annoyed by few of the puzzles, because the game hardly provides you with any leads/hints. However, I don't take this game for much of a puzzle solving kind; I take it for a story-rich game where choices matter a lot than you can imagine. I have fell in love with the characters, just like I did with DF. Wonderful game and highlly recommend for the fans of the series.			"

												I haven't played the other Longest Journey games but this does a good job at recapping what happens in the previous games. A lot of choice and little things can change the game, not on the level of Until Dawn but on the levels of a bioware game. This is easily my second favorite episodic game and one of the best in terms of story telling. Even with only 3 episodes available it's worth the purchase. Pros:Amazing storyCaptivating NarrativeGreat Voice actingPro LGBTFun PuzzlesCool Outfits (sadly can't choose at will)Two worlds to explore with different themes one fantasy the other sci fi (Not very big but decent)Eye Candy in both protagonists Cons:Some Puzzles were difficult for me (May not be a con for you if you're good at Puzzles) "

												""Dreamfall Chapters"" is the 3rd part of the story which was began in the game ""The Longest Journey"" (which I loved) and followed by ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" (which was a sort of a disappointment to me). The original game TJL has an absolutely unique strange atmosphere, and in my opinion it was lost in its sequel. In Dreamfall Chapters the stunning futuristic atmosphere comes back and I just cannot express how happy I am about that. Also, after all I am glad that I played ""Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"" because the story told in The Chapters  wouldn't be clear without it.			"

												If you are a fan of the Original Longest Journey or Dreamfall, this return to the franchise will not dissapoint. Dreamfall Chapters has a lot to love and continues the wonderful and rich story of Zoe Castillo while bringing the franchise to modern times with a choice system similar to that of Telltale or Life is Strange. A great game for fans and not a bad starting place for people new to the franchise.			"

												This game... As someone who played the originals I was overjoyed to see they were able to fund the continuation. Insta buy. Having played it I can say that the art is great, story telling is great, setting, voice acting, script all great. Didn't have any crashes, some performance issues but nothing game breaking. That's the Unity engine I presume.But that being said. It's very short. I took my time and it only took 4.5 hours to finish. I... must have missed something... I must have. I will still recommend this game, giving the history of this game. But 4.5 hours is a little disappointing. It will potentially have great replay value. Once you get the complete game. EDIT:Can't seem to finsh chapter 2, it's just so boring...Guess I'll do a complete run when it's finsihed, for now I'm just going to shelf it.			"

												We've had a long sad history of waiting a decade for another instalment in a gaming franchise, only to see our hopes shattered by the unbelievable ♥♥♥♥♥iness of said instalments. However, Dreamfall is here to rectify that. Dreamfall Chapters fully lives up to the excitement of the first two games in the series, At the time of writing, only part 1 of the story has come out, and while it does not go particularly deep into the overall story, I have no doubts the rest of the parts will be equally enjoyable.A word of caution though: This game does offer a brief recap of the story so far, but that mostly serves as a reminder to those of us who haven't played the other games for many years. If you're new to this franchise, then this is probably not the game to start with. It will most likely leave you too confused about the story unless you play at least Dreamfall first, and preferably also The Longest Journey.			"

												As a big fan of the Longest Journey, I was so delighted to find out about Dreamfall chapters. I loved the story telling and the beautiful graphics of the original series. I still get the similar feeling from Dreamfall chapters. The graphics are not really top notch compared to the other blockbuster games but the scenery is there. Very creative places and settings. I also found it's even more focused on the story telling than the original series; which is not a bad thing. I feel like I am actually watching an interactive TV show. It still has puzzles and stuff but it's not as difficult. I remember the original series has so many tricky puzzles - or maybe I just grew old and the puzzles are not as difficult anymore. lolAnyhow, I am taking my time to play this game so I can enjoy it longer and manage my time as well since there are only two books out and it seems like there's a significant wait time for the next ones. The bottom line is I am so happy about this game and can't believe the sequel to the longest journey series is finally here. It's not a usual adventure game that you have to grind so much just to follow some silly story. This game is more philosophical and deeper than most of the games out there. Probably that's why there are so many people who have been longing for the sequels. I wish there were more than 5 eps. I actually hope it has ""seasons"" and come back again some day.  "

												I love both TLJ and Dreamfall: TLJ and have been waiting for the follow-up for a very very long time. Dreamfall Chapters, like its predecessor, is a heavily narrative-driven game. If you like games like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls like I do, I believe you are going to enjoy Dreamfall Chapters. All the endearing trademarks of the TLJ franchise are also back: funny, witty dialogue, interesting characters, exotic locales, fascinating but mind boggling mysteries :P, great soundtrack, and fantastic voice acting. I also love the new internal monologue game mechanic. It allows you to weigh conversation options in a more organic way because you get to literally hear what Zoey or Kian is thinking.  The choice and consequence mechanic is also pretty intriguing and adds replay value. Book 1 starts out slow but I actually love the pacing. It gives you time to get acquainted with Zoey and, to a lesser extent, Kian and their present situations. Book 2 moves into more traditional adventure gaming territory with more quests and puzzles. The story in Book 2 also picks up considerably and ends with an unexpected and surprising ""bang"".One gripe is that the game is really taking its time reintroducing our favorite characters from past games. The good news is that we'll be seeing Crow in Book 3. Another gripe of mine is that fairly prominent characters from the previous game seem to have been unceremoniously written off. After 8 or so years of waiting, that was a bummer :(. I am hoping that there will be lots of surprises in store for us in the last 3 chapters.All in all, if story matters to you, then I highly recommend Dreamfall Chapters.			"

Rewarding ExperienceThis game is awesome, but depending on what you’re expecting, you might be a little disappointed at first. There’s nothing wrong with the story, it’s just that the first two Books are a little different than the rest. If you start playing, but find yourself frustrated with all the puzzles, choices, and gameplay, I’d advise you to watch a playthrough and just follow along until Book Three.Book Three is where things really pick up. From here on out, the game has everything you could wish for:Annoyed by puzzles? Don’t worry, they’re kept to a minimum and shouldn’t slow you down.Like progressing the game by walking between points of interest? This game was made for you, W-key pro.Is there a particular character you wish would come out as gay? Well, I don’t want to spoil anything, but they all will.Excited by sitting through long-winded speeches? I hope you’re strapped in, because these will blow you away.Feel uneasy when you don’t know the political leanings of the developers? Prepare to get super-comfy, because they will not leave you hanging.Now, I’m not saying it’s all roses after Book Two. There will still be some harder puzzles. Occasionally you will have to follow directions that you just heard, or remember a four-digit code you just saw, or even walk back to a room you just left to find something you need. Sometimes it might not be completely obvious that a character is a Bad Guy, because they weren’t completely obnoxious, stupid, or ugly. Still, it wouldn’t really be a game without any challenges (or would it?), and the story is worth these small trials.100% Buy "

Speaking of Story, this game has a fantastic one.The plot doesn't try to be TOO complex. It has just enough twist and turns, but depending on options you chose you'll get different outcomes. For the most part the characters will be ones that you love as well as love to hate. Although there were some characters I couldn't give a ratsus's ace about. Good game, check it out c;			"

												I thought this was a lot better than the previous game of the series. and I thought it as a lot more faithfull to the feel of the original Longest Journey in terms of writing and charm. There were some points made by some people on how this had some problematic elements in terms of respecting the lore, leaving plot holes open and having it too political. I didn't think that the parts that were ""wrong"" in terms of lore were too important in the overall theme, and didn't even see them happening when I played this. I thought that this game did pretty good job on continuing the previous Dreamfall so that we got some kind of a conclusion. I'm one of those nerds that think that there can't be anything ""too political"", so that wasn't an issue to me. I thought it was great that the politics of Europolis resembled well of how the politics actually are in Europe. I thought this game was amazing and it got me hooked from the start. Last book is not as great as the previous ones, but I still enjoyed it. I would never say that it was better than the original ""The Longest Journey"", but I don't think it ever could have been.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Longest Journey series and waited very long to finally get some kind of closure. Though there are certainly some plotholes and storylines which deserved more space, I liked this game a lot and understand that there are limitations for what you can tell in one game. The graphics are beautifull, and make the breathtaking world of Arcadia and Stark even more unique. Lot of people don`t like how it ended, I think that`s just personal taste, I was ok with how things went down, and recommend it for everyone who played the previous two games. There are moments which would surely stay with you long after you finished the game.			"

												happy that this game happened at all. It left a lot of question open but at least it answers the fate of most protagonists of the series.dont bother playing it if you didnt played the previous 2 games. even if you did, might want to refresh your memories beforehand or u will miss most if not 90% of the references.

Slightly lacks some of the feeling i got from Dreamfall: The longest Journey but still follows the same characters and story and is really great anyway. I loved almost evrything about this. Hoping they can branch out and make a game based in the same world with new characters but have cameos of older characters and things like that. It was sad when this ended, i couldn't believe it was over after all this time. Certainly recommend playing if you love a great story.			"

Pro's include: good graphics, engrossing storyline, interesting characters, decent length for an episodic game. Con's: some optimisation issues, Xbox One controller bug means you can't use it to open inventory, limited number of environments.Overall, the game is worth playing (especially if you played the previous games in the series) and is definitely worth buying in a Steam sale.

												Finally finding out how this story ends is so cathartic.  Its a bit shy on the whimsy of the earlier games and the settings are limited, but that's probably an issue with production costs.  This is where the divide will be for most people.  It obviously limits the game's ability to fully tell the story, but the heart of the story gets told.  April Ryan does get left aside, due to the writers wanting her to have a seperate episode for herself, but again not being able to afford it.The character decisions only really affect the fringes of the end game story, and while impactful for their part, not a crucial element.Gameplay is about as limited as Dreamfall was, but smoother in its limitations.Sound and Voice acting are both excellent.Graphics are pretty on par with that generation, and the asthetics a wonderful.

												I recommend Dreamfall Chapters, but to get the full experience, the player should seek out the first two games that this one has followed: 'The Longest Journey' (1) and 'Dreamfall: The Longest Journey' (2). The experience won't be as rich without them.Setting and artwork are glorious, though character movement and visuals are not a match for other games. However, the plot and storyline depth are so complex that player immersion is complete. All characters have their quirks and motivations - even the minor ones. Voice acting is impeccable. Every character is a hero of their own story, and we get to control two of them: Zoe and Kian, two characters from two worlds working towards a common goal.Some of the side missions feel a little bit like filler, but I personally didn't mind. There are multiple ways to solve a problem and different solutions attract different outcomes and reactions. The choices within are immense, and even though the storyline is forced, the paths taken to get there are so different that this game can be played again.There aren't many games out there like this, which is a shame.

												The story is interesting but the puzzles can be painfully boring at times as most to me feel completely random and leave you in the dark for the most part on purpose so you end up sinking hours searching around the map for any hint or clue on what to do.After finally finishing the game, it just felt too lazy to recommend anymore. There were times where a cutscene was playing and a fight would ensue, but instead of animating all that, the camera would jjust pan away and you would hear cartoon effect sounds of fighting, for the camera to pan right back and you would see all the enemies down on the floor.Honestly I lost interest in the fairly boring and uneventful story by Book 3. It started out promising, but then went downhill from there.			"

												I haven't tried EVERY SINGLE possibility yet, but I will! It was fun using Kian for a good guy first, then re-loading the chapter to use him as a bad guy some times, heheh, but all in all I've played through one timeline of the game, and I'm sure if I made bigger changes (like the very first choice that will change the shift,) I could have ended up differently in a lot of places. That's what I love about these games, that even when you're at ""Thanks for playing!"", it's not really over. You can always go back and try out all these different things for THEN to achieve the full achievements, and then be 100% through the game. I played through the first two first, and then kicked my own♥♥♥♥♥to do this. It was so AWESOME! And so much FUN !!! Absolutely LOVED IT !!! .... But, (there's always a but..) I did get a little dissapointed at the end, becuase the game builds up so damn much tension and story, and all of a sudden it's at an end :/ unfortunately, but that's why I'll play through different choices to see if I can get more interesting endings :) Would reccomend to play through the first two before this, especially at the last visit to the Eather ;) ♥			"

												Having been part of The Longest Journey since the beginning, where all stories start and end, I can say.... I'm extremelp impressed with the final installment of the series. Before I begin spoilers, I will admit, this game is NOT a standalone game, It will make no sense to anyone who hasn't played at least the 2nd game, Dreamfall:The Longest Journey. *Spoilers ahead*There were many MANY loose threads created in Dreamfall that DF Chpaters stiched up nicely. Many are still open for interpretation which in my opinion, is the best kind of storytelling. The graphics are a huge improvement. I literally spent far too much time simply enjoying my envronment, the ambience, the music... Oh the music. I will say now, the music is simply divine. But back to the review.There's (thankfully) no more direct combat instances. The entire combat system is no more, and for good!. There are still plenty of points in the game where you have to be stelthy (walk outside of npc's direct line of sight for instance) but they do not interfere with the gameplay in any huge way. The characters are amazing. My only gripe is that Kian's selectional dialogue in later stages doesn't reflect the characters motivations, even if you were RP'ing him as a hardcore Azadian. It seems certain parts of Chapter 5 were rushed and things 'just happened' without you having any input or direction.I must say I loved loved loved Saga **** EVEN MORE SPOILERS***I guessed Saga was the 'reincarnation' of April since the first Interlude. Her story was so fascinating... And it was a massive surprise to find out that she would become Lady Kian through adoption!*** Spoiler END **This is not a game for anyone new to the series. You NEED to play Dreamfall: The Longest Journey at least, even if you don't play the original TLJ. Otherwise the story, chracters, world will go over your head and you wont appreciate any of it. However, if you've played the previous games, I highly recommend buying this game, replaying the first two games back-to-back then sitting in a dark room, headphones on, enjoy the ambience, outstanding voice acting, beautiful music and let yourself get carried away on the longest journey			"

												UPDATE W/ NEW RATING:Now that I have played the entire game, I can say that I truly enjoyed the rest of it a lot more than I did the first chapter. While I still found navigating the town of Propast irritating, the action picked up, the game play became very enjoyable, and the story unfolded beatifully. They made me nervous with chapter 1, but I fell back to love with the series!**********Original Review***************As a huge fan of the Dreamfall series I have been really looking forward to playing the newest installment.  The beginning of the game allows you to watch a recap of what happened in the last game, which was a really great refresher. The first hour of this game is great! It’s fascinating and fun, and it made me even more excited about seeing this story unfold….. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the rest of the chapter (about 6 hours worth).Chapter 1 disappointments:Graphics:  The lighting/reflections in the town of Propast are driving me insane! My eyes actually hurt while playing because what should be a subtle reflection from a red light is a glaring big red box through parts of the city.  I have a screenshot saved on my profile for an example.Menial tasks: I know it's the standard for a point and click adventure, but I'm really tired of running around the city grabbing my boyfriend’s lunch, buying wine, etc. I've been expecting this rich dramatic story like the earlier games...and it started off great but the last few hours of this chapter were pretty dull.The MAP:  I LOATH THIS MAP WITH A PASSION.   It’s pretty easy to get lost in the beginning, so you’ll definitely need a map to help you. You don’t get a “use anytime” map, you have to use map stations around this city.  I would have preferred it differently, but that’s okay.  The thing I HATE is the “rootin’ tootin’ cowboy map is extremely annoying. Every single time you use one you have to let it finish its little speech. That’s bad enough, but trying to navigate using the map is even worse! It's just of couple of various colored blocks...looks like it was made in MS paint. It's hard to read and rarely helps you get around.  I suggest you just go online and print out a LABELED map to use. It's still akward to read, but you'll save yourself about an hour of mindlessly running around trying to find your next destination.I do have hope for this game. I'm not giving up on it...but until I play a chapter that offers more story and less aggravation, I cannot recommend it.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is a third person adventure game that follows the modern Telltale adventure game format quite closely, down to the episodic format and certain key player decisions affecting the story.The Longest Journey was one of my favorite adventure games of all time. I didn't enjoy the original Dreamfall nearly as much, but it still had a decent story. Unfortunately the Dreamfall Chapters has very little of what made the first two game enjoyable.The writing quality has taken a big hit and this is probably Ragnar Tørnquist's weakest work. There are some moments of brilliance here, but in general the story is rather boring and the game is chock full of poorly written and uninteresting characters. Kian's chapters in particular are pretty atrocious.The gameplay has some big issues too. The developer decided to follow the Telltale adventure game format quite closely (thankfully skipping the QTEs) and this feels like an extremely poor fit here. Most of the provided choices end up just hurting the overall storytelling. In this case a predetermined story would have been far preferable to the pretty pointless choices and consequences.The puzzles are extremely simple as well and there's only a few usable items per chapter. And to make it worse, the game often makes you hunt for those few items while aimlessly wandering around big and empty maps.To add insult to injury, the game also suffers from some rather serious performance issues. This is simply unacceptable in adventure game with rather average visuals. Apart from poor optimization, there's no reason why this game should be so resource intensive.Dreamfall Chapters is not the worst game I have played in 2016 but it's certainly the most disappointing. I'd only recommend it to people who really want to see the conclusion to Zoë Castillo's story. Anyone else should avoid this one.The good:- Good voice acting- Storytime sections, unfortunately they are only a small part of the game- No more horrible combat sequences that plagued the original DreamfallThe bad:- Telltale style choice-based storytelling is a poor fit here- Full of poorly written characters- Extremely simple puzzles- Tedious hunting for items- Annoying save system based on checkpoints- Final book feels rushed and disjointed- Terrible stealth sequences, at least there's only a few of them- We may never see a proper sequel to the original Longest JourneyThe ugly:- Poor animations- Poorly optimized and bad performance			"

												Overall a great adventure game and a valid sequel to the previous games. The story is really good and thought-out and the game has easy game controls. The graphics have been updated, but still feels dated. This is because of the animation of the different characters, which sort of falls into the uncanny valley. Still, I recommend this game because of the story and the design of the different storylines which connect well to the previous games. Suddenly some things made sense to me. I think I will play through this game again in the future.			"

												Part of one of the best adventure game series of all time, Dreamfall Chapters shows just what the genre would have been capable of evolving into, if given just a little more love by developers.I can't wait to see what Red Thread Games come up with next.			"

												Well worth the price!This is a lengthy narrative experience that fleshes out and concludes the Longest Journey story. Pro's include: good graphics, engrossing storyline, interesting characters, decent length for an episodic game. Con's: some optimisation issues, Xbox One controller bug means you can't use it to open inventory, limited number of environments.Overall, the game is worth playing (especially if you played the previous games in the series) and is definitely worth buying in a Steam sale.

												I'm not one to write long reviews, but I feel like this game absolutely deserves one, so here we go;If someone told me that when I got this game that'd I will cry (a lot), scream at characters, feel emotionally attacted to a talking bird, get mind♥♥♥♥ed the hell out of, get lost in the story, and fall in love with multiple characters, I honestly wouldn't believe them with the first glance I gave this game. However, it did exactly that. Zoe Castillo is an amazing, bright character who breaks the mold not just of usual protags, but also female ones. She isn't some ""I have a quest"" hero, she doesn't know what she's doing just as much as you. She's resourceful, cunning, and absolutely beautiful. Also her fashion is on point, man. Kian Alvane is just the same, he breaks the standard mold in more ways than one, is labeled a traitor against his people, and completely accepts his death, until he is given a new purpose to live. He fights against the very people he used to fight for, with the people he used to kill. It's an amazing character developement that only this game, in my opinion, has perfected.In short, this is an amazing game, with an amazing crew behind it.  I am still super ♥♥♥♥ing upset they killed Crow like whO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT 10/10 - IGN(P.s., Chapter 3 came out on my birthday! Absolutely best chapter ;) )			"

												If you always wanted to know how Dreafall: The Longest Journey ends don't hesitate to pick up this game :)The story is up to par with the previous game. The eding was... good enough. Can't say it worked 100% for me but it didn't leave a bad aftertaste either.Performance warning:For the most part the game manages 60 fps v-synch in 1440p max settings on i7 6600K & GTX 1070.However, I had some significant fps drops (to about 30-40 fps) in Marcuria (especially the market area). Lowering the resolution to 1080p didn't get me stable 60 fps.That was unfortunate but not as unfortunate as the next point.Animal abuse warningThere's a segment in the game where you're required to brutally murder a harmless and totally innocent animal to get through a door. I couldn't beleive the was no other way to get through that door. I looked up this quest on the internet and sure enough it wasn't just me who was upset about it.			"

												A beautiful, epic adventure through different worlds. I hadnt played the previous games before this, but catching up the story was no problem whatsoever.  After playing The Longest Journey, some things made a bit more sense and I could see the root of the origins now, but it is no means necessary to play them to enjoy the story this game has to offer.What is quite remarkable in the game, how ambitious it is. It is developed by a small developer and small budget, but they havent cut corners and made a small game because of this. No, the game is pretty huge for adventure game standards, and the environments vary a lot. There is easily a tripl AAA ammount of environments and graphics in this game, albeit not of that high standard except at some points. The graphics are still good enough imo.Story starts a bit slow, but starts to build up after a few chapters... which is kind of slow, and I can see some people stop playing this because of the slow start. It pays in the end though, and journey reached peaks I didnt imagine it could.Biggest problem beside the slow start is somewhat boring puzzles. You merely run from place to place to find objects from the environments, making most of the puzzles feel like taxi missions in RPGs. Well, at least you dont get stuck. In its way, this game feels like an RPG like Mass Effect or Dragon Age...except that there is no combat or dungeons, only the city parts! Not every game needs to have action sequences, but I couldnt help but feeling that something is missing here... Imagine playing Mass Effect which only has cities and no combat at all, and this game feels like that. It is a bit boring due to this at times, especially in the beginning, but when the story gets more compelling, I stopped caring about that aspect.Well, if you want an epic adventure journey with interesting worlds, characters and settings, and an excellent, excellent animal companion who travels with you through all it, this is a good pick.

												Dreamfall is very rich in story and keeps you entertained as you mostly play two different individuals on the path to a single moment in time. It isn't fast paced as such yet its story, the characters and rich visual content will keep you following along simply to see how it ends. Every decision you make in this tale has a consequence and the clues to tasks can be so bare of hints you need to really think upon them to find the answers and meet the challenge. Maybe not everyone's type of game but i personally enjoyed it right to the end.			"

												Well after waiting for years to play the game I finally got it.  It's hard to say if this game is worth it.   It would depend if your invested in the story or not.   I find the game plays too much like a story with some things to push.  I played the previous games and love the series and dont regret backing them at all.  Although I got a game breaking bug and I wasnt able to finish past the 4th book.   I tried everything uninstalling drivers etc. etc. so i watched a lets play for the end. im going to give it a recommend for the fact that it finishes up a great series. Also for fans there is a few really great moments.			"

												As someone who just finished this game, I'm writing this review for you as much as I am for me:TL;DR: Most spectacular adventure game you will play. Don't start on Chapters. The Longest Journey => Dreamfall:TLJ => Dreamfall Chapters. Pros:Epic adventure story, sci fi AND fantasy setting, music, voice acting, and visualsCons: Empty large environments (fixed in later chapters).Choppy AnimationsSome don't think the choices affect the game enough.For some of us, this was the longest journey. As a boy, my first adventure game was The Longest Journey and although I didn't understand all of it, it left me mystified. In 2006, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey cast my world asunder my childhood memories of April Ryan's incredible adventures were left on the ultimate cliffhanger and then there was the longest wait. Dreamfall Chapters and 2016 concluded this long painstaking wait and what a build up...Let me tell you, if you start from the beginning, you will be rewarded. This story does not disappoint in any form. It flawlessly combines science fiction and fantasy into a truly unique setting. Stark. Arcadia..If you are picking up this game and expecting a TellTale Games Walking Dead choices, this game was written with an ending in mind. It's been building towards finally connecting all the peices. You can make choices and they are going to make you cringe or worry or your characters might have regrets later in the game, but you're not going to alter the entire game. At times, the visuals are breath-taking. Although, when Red Thread Games started, I believed they were too beautiful. I would have prefered the point and click format of The Longest Journey with more things to interact with. Sometimes the areas are confusing the navigate and there are only a few things to interact with. You're supposed to only go one place but you can travel the whole length of the area with little to do. It is annoying and wastes your time. But this problem resolved in the later episodes. The animations are also stiff and choppy at times. However they accomplish the job of telling the story which is really all this game is about. I didn't mind using my imagination though. Fortunately, the voice acting really makes up for anything lost in the animation.The music is amazing and gives me shivers every time I load up the game.Right next to Life is Strange, this is my favorite interactive movie I have ever watched. It breaks your heart and swaddles it next to a cozy fire, simultanously.  I will never forget you April, Zoe, Kian, Saga, and Crow. Crow, thank you Red Thread Games for the best side kick that ever existed. I don't know how you pulled off such a satisfying ending. The wait was worth it. Every second.			"

												By far one of the greatest stories to experience.When I came across this game I was unaware of what to expect since I had no idea about any of the previous games in the trilogy, I bought the game only on the basis of the type of game the discription and screenshots told it to be and I was more than willing to go through the story.upon completing the first few chapters I decided to read up some reviews which highly emphasized on playing the prior games (mainly Dreamfall: The longest journey) before I gave this one a try. It disheartened me since I was already invested in the story. I decided to continue on with the story till completion and I was not disappointed.The Gameplay is amazingThe story is amazingThe puzzels are niceTotally worth your time if you've not experienced any game in the trilogy but do play the privous games the story gets richer as the games progresses.

												The gameplay is mediocre at best and tedious at worst. But I don't care about that at all.The strong point of the series is the storytelling and the characters. For fans of the series, that is all that ultimately matters.If one hasn't played the prior games of the series, then start there first. Otherwise you will be missing parts of the the story, and that is like starting to read a book right in the middle - you start out without any emotional attachment to the characters and the events that happened before. And I don't think this series can be played in reversed chronological order either, you'd miss out bigtime.			"

												*** UPDATE through Book 5 - SPOILER-FREE ***Finished the game!  Final verdict:  The team at Red Thread Games delivered on all fronts.  As an original Kickstarter backer, I don't see how this final product could have been better than my expectations way back then.  I'm ready for them to go back and remaster the first two now, after some well-deserved rest... The technical issues were ironed out over time, the choice system actually mattered (in good ways) and most importantly, the story began in The Longest Journey and continued in Dreamfall concluded meaningfully.  Rich depth was added throughout and made returning and new characters more interesting and complex.  *** ORIGINAL REVIEW - SPOILER-FREE   ***  (through book 3)For those who have played The Longest Journey AND Dreamfall, this is a must-play.It's hard to write a comprehensive review for a game that is not finished, but I applaud the work that has gone into the game so far and the responsiveness of Red Thread Games (RTG).  As an immediate Kickstarter backer, very excited for a conclusion to the trilogy, I was initially disappointed with Chapters.  It wasn't clear from the outset when you are making critical choices, and I wish there was an easier way to replay specific scenarios instead of entire chapters to see the branching impact on the story.   Book 1 started strong, 2 slumped a bit for my taste, and 3 kicked it off again with major plot developments.  The story overall is a familiar continuation to Dreamfall, which itself was a strong thematic sequel to The Longest Journey (TLJ), one of the best adventure games of all time.  Dreamfall was plagued with some questionable technical decisions in gameplay, and unfortunately, that extends into Dreamfall Chapters.  The game is pretty in still shots, but runs horribly on many PCs.  I've been fortunate - running a Core i5 with a recent midrange GeForce, it runs acceptably.  It has gotten better since the launch of Book 1 and may be dramatically better by the end of Book 5.I've heard that RTG is getting a lot of bad press after book 3, but it was my absolute favorite so far.   It seriously advanced the story beyond 1 and 2, and was also in many ways a return to form of the original Dreamfall and TLJ.   It is much better than the overly-long book 2 that feels padded with fetch quests and spends too much time in Propast, the dystopian future city that has a lot of atmosphere and yet manages to be boring beyond a few memorable characters.  I much prefer time spent in Marcuria, although I would like to see more of Arcadia overall.  Sometimes the downside to making a modern game is the sheer amount of work to pull of any new environment -- this makes me wonder if we will ever truly see an updated version of TLJ due to the insanely larger scale of that game.** SPOILERS BELOW **  (through book 3)I want more magic!  I hope that Zoe in Marcuria/Arcadia is used beyond where she was in book 3 as a stranger in a strange land.  She's been there before, and I'm sure she can be of use to the resistance.  I wish Kian had shared about the purpose of the pipes and tower (maybe he did, but it wasn't discussed on camera) so that Zoe can go to the magical hub under the city (from previous games) and we can hear more of her story.   I really don't care if Kian is gay, the writers can do what they want with that, but I'm disappointed that he has the potential for two love interests and the player can't choose either to pursue.  Yes, my Kian kissed Anna.  And her revelations at the end of Book 3 were good at establishing her character.   Enu is much more interesting overall, but is likely too young for Kian anyway.  I'm very excited to see Ge'en finally, and am crossing my fingers that Captain Nebevay (TLJ) survived the Chaos Storm and will be there!I'm not giving up on April Ryan either.  Ragnar seemed pretty certain she was dead, but Dreamfall Chapters has already established that dreams can be used to shape reality.  It's a longshot that she'll return, but Saga's story recap of TLJ through her illustrations drove home that the authors want us to remember April.			"

												I first saw the video to this a while ago and being a sucker for a good story bought the game...I was not disappointed.The story is engaging, emotional and exceptionally well put together.Needless to say I was hooked from the get word go and worked my way through to the end.Some of the puzzles take a little while to work out, but it was lots of fun trying to see what worked and what doesn't.Even failing to complete some puzzles affects the story.I would higly recommend this game to anyone who loves an immersive story and it's left me wanting more.When do we get the film?Epic!

												Excellent game... not only beautiful to watch, but play is seemless and voice acting is believable.  My only wish would be there were more side adventures to get into, the game only has one straight path, thought it says, like the TellTale Games, you can make choices that affect later decisions.Even if you have not played the Longest journey as April Ryan, or played Dreamfall, it honestly does not matter that much, you can watch a short video (tab choice) that explains the past two stories and how you have come to this point.  But, of course, both prior games were also a lot of fun, just be prepared for the very low texture characters and scenes from the very old The Longest Journey game, I believe the game came out a decade ago.The designers of Dreamfall Chapters did an amazing job of bringing the game into the 2015's and it is so beautiful, so is the soundtrack and the puzzles, though pretty easy, are not so bad as to be was too easy.  Keep in mind that just like TellTale Games Dreamfall Chapters is just that, only the first chapter has been released and will last you about 5 hours if you take your time.  Can't wait for the 2nd chapter to come out tomorrow.Thanks for reading the review, definetely a 8 out of 10.			"

												I LOVE the story telling in this game and how you can hear what they would be thinking behind a certain dialogue option! I think this is the perfect mix of Book, Movie, and game! I thnk it's brilliant and should be the future for more story driven RPGs. However, (uh oh) the fact that book one is so short is not good. Book one should be much longer. It should be the foundation for the other books! Especially considering that most of us players (I am assuming) have not played the first game. I ended up playing this game for about 7 hours, but I explored EVERYTHING so another players play through could be different. Somewhere I read that for most it was about 4 but that seems fast.The story is so good though, it really grabs your attention. It's also obvious that they put alot of thought into the future of this game considering some of the dialogue loves to give little hints atwhat the game makers have in mind.So overall yes buy this game, if only to see how story driven games should be. With more story on the way.. (March 10th) this game is and should be one heck of a ride.			"

												I've been waiting for a squeal for years. It was apparently crowd funded and I'm sorry that I missed it. As with the ones before, this adventure game's charm comes from the dialog and settings more than the puzzles. One of my favorite lines of dialog comes when the main character is speaking about checkpoints where passes are only issued on the other side, ""Kefka would be proud.""The puzzles are native to the story and generally non-intrusive. They tend to be difficult to get on the first try. Through penalty-free trial and error, none of the puzzles take too long to solve.It is worth warning that this game is ""Book 1"" of a longer series. Expect about 5 hours of game play to hit all the achievements and not much longer than that to have seen everything. I've played other games (I'm looking at you FPS) that were shorter, less entertaining, and cost me more money. The take home message here is that the story isn't complete and you should expect DLC. I look forward to the next release.			"

												There has only been one chapter released so far but that's enough for me to pass judgement! This long awaited sequel seems like it will live up to expectations! If you're unfamiliar with the series allow me to direct you attention to 'The Longest Journey' first. It's a classic point and click adventure game (roughly 15 years old now I think) and it's one of my absolute favorite games of all time. You can jump into this game before playing 'TLJ' (and its sequel 'Dreamfall') but you would be doing HUMANITY a great DISSERVICE. PLAY PLAY PLAY!			"

												Pretty much everything a Dreamfall fan ever wanted; engrossing plot spanning the two worlds of Arcadia and Stark, facinating main leads of Zoe and Alvanna that drives the game forward during the slower moments, and choices and consequences mechanics popularised by Tell tall games implemented effectively so far. Between this and life is stange, episodic gaming is here to stay.			"

												This is my first taste of this game series and undoubtedly I was attached.It's a unique journey,a mysterious fancy,and a magic and attractive world.Compared with some AAA games with the highest level picture quality,Dreamfall Chapters's world is rather dreamy than realistic.But still,you'll be amazed by the colorful,fascinating world.There are tow worlds in this game:a magic one, and a near future city,which has reminded me of Transistor.Both of them are full of surprises.Since I'm addicted to voice performance in games,I can't help but want to praise the voice acting,especially Zoë's.Through all those characters's voices you can feel their emotions and thoughts.What's more,when you click something more than once,Zoë won't repeat only one sentence----much better than some other games.In this game,you'll have to make choices,as the brief introduction says.But I'd like to say that this kind of choosing not only concludes talking chioces,but also includes actions which may bring total different consequences.So think twice before you step out.Just finished Book one.And can't wait to play the next book.

												I thouroughly enjoyed this game; it kept my interest with stunning graphics & character development, all while not being too difficult to complete. While I cannot comment on it's relevance and/or follow-up to the previous games, I can say that I am very impressed and excited for the second book to be released.			"

												If you are a fan of the Original Longest Journey or Dreamfall, this return to the franchise will not dissapoint. Dreamfall Chapters has a lot to love and continues the wonderful and rich story of Zoe Castillo while bringing the franchise to modern times with a choice system similar to that of Telltale or Life is Strange. A great game for fans and not a bad starting place for people new to the franchise.			"

												Finally finding out how this story ends is so cathartic.  Its a bit shy on the whimsy of the earlier games and the settings are limited, but that's probably an issue with production costs.  This is where the divide will be for most people.  It obviously limits the game's ability to fully tell the story, but the heart of the story gets told.  April Ryan does get left aside, due to the writers wanting her to have a seperate episode for herself, but again not being able to afford it.The character decisions only really affect the fringes of the end game story, and while impactful for their part, not a crucial element.Gameplay is about as limited as Dreamfall was, but smoother in its limitations.Sound and Voice acting are both excellent.Graphics are pretty on par with that generation, and the asthetics a wonderful.

												Not gonna lie, it has completely different feel than the other two games. The gameplay was a bit... frustrating at certain parts especially Propast. However, I wasn't expecting the same experience as I got before and it was good thing to do. I enjoyed this game a lot, it was amazing and long jorney. The ending was pretty cool and totally deserved for this trilogy. One of the most amazing games I have played in my life (all three together of course).However, there are certaing things I hated about it. ONE: As I said, it was frustrating at certain parts which is something I don't enjoy in this type of game. TWO: Performance issues. It is terribly optimized, especially in Marcuira (which is where I had the highest FPS drops even tho I can run pretty much every game at 60 FPS). That is basically all for me...So... Yes I recommend this game, it is worth your time.			"

												Dreamfall is very rich in story and keeps you entertained as you mostly play two different individuals on the path to a single moment in time. It isn't fast paced as such yet its story, the characters and rich visual content will keep you following along simply to see how it ends. Every decision you make in this tale has a consequence and the clues to tasks can be so bare of hints you need to really think upon them to find the answers and meet the challenge. Maybe not everyone's type of game but i personally enjoyed it right to the end.			"

Weirdly enough, there doesn't seem to be any performance impact from increasing it further, it runs just as bad.Aside from that, it's a great game.			"

												I'm going to try not to dissolve into a puddle of tears and hyperbole while describing my love for this game. But I flippin' love this game! First, I'll just get out of the way the fact that I waited 10 years for it to come out. I played Dreamfall when it came out on XBox and was devastated that it ended the way it did with no new development in sight. The world building was rich, I love playing as Zoe, and the story was great. Solid writing, fantastic voice acting, and a female protagonist with agency. I'm a long time PC adventure gamer, and I felt like I'd been waiting for this game all my life. I went back and played The Longest Journey and loved that too. Then I played Dreamfall again just to appreciate how well the fleshed out the world, and how aware you are of the passage of time and it's affect on both places and people. There was also always wonderful diversity in the characters, and I don't just mean the magical races. This series was hitting all the right spots for me.When they announced the Kickstarted for Chapters, I flipped my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't back it fast enough. But of course I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if it would be worth the wait? What if I waited all this time and it was a total disappointment?Having finished Book 3, I can say emphatically that this game is excellent. Zoe has deepened as a character. The changes that have happened in the world between games have deep impact. This game is taking on huge themes - militarization and fascism, racism, politics, revolution. But it all feels very personal as you get to know the characters living through all this. My heart has broken over the people and places that have been wiped away by the conflicts (no spoilers, but there are some deaths that happened between games that I found profoundly tragic). With all this going on, I'm delighted that the quirky, meta, snarky sense of humor that has run through this series has remained. It feels well balanced, and never takes itself too seriously, which I really enjoy. Especially when they make nods to previous PC adventure games, or lampshade a particularly obvious trope.TL;DR if you like PC adventure games ala Monkey Island and old Sierra stuff, but you want something a little deeper and more conscious (cheesy as that sounds, I mean it) you have to check out this series. Start from the beginning and work your way through. You will be rewarded for your exploration. It's just lovely.			"

												Great game! At least, I think so. Just as advertised by the devs and the players. If you like a story rich and interactive gameplay, you might want to give this a try, but don't expect much from combat. The closest thing you'll get will be in cinematics, or the character doing the sleeper hold. There's action, but you won't be doing barrel rolls or button mashing. Some of the puzzles are pretty easy, while others might have you saying, ""Wait... what?"" Just make sure to look at everything! Seriously. If you see something at a distance, but you don't see a marker, approach it and verify, or you might find yourself walking around aimlessly. The cast did a great job with the voice acting. Kudos to them! Some of the jokes are cheesy, but they make it work. Both Kian and Zoe have a great story and background, though at times I feel that Kian looks a little too much like some sort of Assassin's Creed knockoff. Still, he's a badass! All the NPCs know it and you will too. He's a badass not because he can kill you in probably a second, but because he's sharp and can think his way through problems (although if the devs decided to make some sort of combat mechanic then I'm sure he'll be even more of a badass). Zoe... I love her. She's sexy, funny and walks around in her pantsu!! Okay, just in her apartment, but she looks good doing so! The one thing I found kinda funny is that some of the animations, specially the action cinematics, feel a little robotic. Regardless, the world looks gorgeous and the story, though it may seem slow to start, got me pretty hooked. The decisions you make leave you wondering, and sometimes dreading the outcome. If you enjoyed Mass Effect's decision making gameplay, this game takes it and expands on it, and well... pretty much makes it one of their key aspects of gameplay. Never played the previous games? Me either! That's okay, there's a quick recap at the beginning which will give you the gist of what transpired. The rest is pretty easy to fill in, though I'm pretty convinced that I'll be playing them soon. Also, I want to take the time to say thank you to the 21,858 backers who pledged $1,538,425 to make sure TLJ saga continued. You guys are awesome!			"

												Dreamfall Chapters is pretty much a point-and-click adventure. You still move with WASD keys, but everything else is mouse interactive. It crosses a lot of genres, like sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, open-world, and more. You play as both Zoe Castillo in futuristic Propast and Kian Alvane in magical Arcadia. Both characters have complicated scenarios that they must try to figure out. Honestly, I had to look up some sections because I was lazy, but it could be figured out if you looked hard enough.8.5/10			"

												Note: This review is for Book One to ThreeI recommend this game to anyone who's into beautifully crafted stories and characters, and who enjoys diving into a detailed, fantastic world once in a while. DFC does everything right on these parts. I fell in love again with some characters I've been missing since TLJ Dreamfall and I'm thrilled to finally learn about the countless complex mysteries of both worlds, Stark and Arcadia. The only major downside at this point is that you have to wait quite a bit for the next Book. And the one after that. And the... ugh. This is an exercise in patience.Some more detailed notes/impressions: - DFC is not an Action Adventure. It's not fast-paced. You don't run around guns blazing or jumping from roof to roof. Thankfully you also don't have to endure wacky stealth sequences anymore, or actively punch the bad guys on the nose (like in the predecessor). What you do is solving puzzles, exploring, making decisions, and watching a lot of cutscenes and dialogue while the story unfolds and things get complicated. If the latter's your thing, this game is for you. - The tone swings between drama, suspense, and sometimes totally unexpected comedy. It's all there. There's a lot of lighthearted stuff going on while drama and mystery keep you hooked at the same time. Great mix.- The game starts out quite slow, linear, and even depressing in Book One. Personally I came to a point when I got pretty bored. Just play through the first 2-3 hours and there's a good chance you'll get into it. Book Two and Three became real page-turners quickly. Book Three especially.- While I enjoyed most of the puzzles, this game also made me pull out my hair from time to time. Excessively running around in a fairly big open world just because you've overlooked that one darn item that isn't even hinted at isn't always fun. Oh well. There have to be these parts in any game, I guess.- KB+M controls sometimes feel a bit clunky. I have to get accustomed to them anew every time a new book is released.- DFC has a keen eye on diversity and tries to be as inclusive as possible. This is a good thing.Conclusion: Great game with minor flaws. Recommended for everyone who's all about story and characters!			"

												Pretty awesome game, to compare with Telltale Games (I haven't got around to playing much other than the first chapter of GoT) the graphics are much better, the story is much better, and the choices feel like they matter a lot more.I never played the previous dreamfall/TLC games (although I'm now conidering it), but this one is engrossing, even with two worlds and two main characters. I like that the game tells you when choices have affected an outcome you're currently experiencing, it reinforces the idea that choice matter for more than just short term dialogue.One con: Sometimes it doesn't feel quite as open ended as I would like. There are usually a good variety of responses, but sometimes there's a nuance that I'd love to be able to express. I hardly feel like I can blame the game for this though,  just an unrealistic wish.			"

Of course there are some elements that I didn't expect after having played TLJ and Dreamfall: TLJ, but all in all, expectations are made to be shattered in good ways in this latest iteration of TLJ's journey.I often hear that it's the journey that counts and not the destination. This series of video games has lead me on quite the journey, and I hope that it will never end.			"

												I enjoyed the story and this game would be great if it wasnt for constant performance issues and ocasional crashing. I'm not running this on potato hardware either (i5-3570K @ 4.4 GHz - R9 280X - 8 GB RAM - SSD). If you spend almost as much time paying attention to how poorly the game performs, trying to fix it and getting irritated when it crashes as actually playing becomes clear why I cant recommend it. I really want to but I just cant.I'v read that some people dont have problems running this so you could buy it and try if it works well and if it doesnt then refund it. There is some cons other than performance issues but those are rather minor compared although the gameplay does kinda fall flat most of the time. If the game worked well I'd recommend it just for the story.EDIT: In book 5 game crashes in the same spot always and causes my entire computer to shut down... WTF!? also it crashed multiple times before also but never shut down my computer before and I got past those points. CRASH / 10EDIT 2: So I bought NVIDIA GTX 1070, replaced my AMD R9 280X with it and the game works well now. Good fps, no crashes etc. So I guess the issues I talked about earlier are related to AMD graphics cards (or R9 280X atleast) and/or drivers. I managed to finally finish book 5 and I do think the game is pretty good when it works well but only IF it works.			"

												Dreamfall Chapters concludes the epic tale of Arcadia and Stark. I cannot recommend the Longest Journey series enough. Even the first game, created almost 20 years ago, is still a joy to play (although some walkthrough help here and there is recommended to stay sane). I consider all three games among the best games I have ever played. And surely among the best voice acted games ever.  If I should say anything negative at all, it would be that Dreamfall Chapters is arguably more an interactive story than a game. Cutscenes fill a large majority of the time spent in the game. However, to me it works out fine 90% of the time, as the story is what makes me play the game anyway.			"

												My journey with this game started 10+ years ago when I received the second game of the trilogy as a part of a gaming magazine's promotion. I immediately got hooked to the story, and I  remember staring at the screen blankly with a knot in my throat, going through all sorts of emotions at the end of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. That's when I started frantically searching for the next game in the series - I mean there had to be another one right?- that ending wasn't enough - I needed closure, I needed to know what happened next! Fast forward to 2013 - I was ecstatic to learn that there was a Kickstarter campaign to make the 3rd game happen. I immediately backed the game and the waiting game began. At the end of the day, I am glad the developers waited for the right circumstances and took their time, in their own terms to make this game happen. Because it is a piece of art. It is one of the best - if not the best- game I have ever played in this genre and it is one of my all time favorites. TL:DR if you are looking for an amazing story/gameplay/atmosphere buy this game. Multiple stories unlocked by individual decisions add to the replay value of the game, and the ending does not disappoint. - Though playing the previous games in the trilogy is not absolutely necessary to enjoy this game, it is recommended to enjoy this game to its fullest.

												One of the very best story driven games I have ever played. The game allow for the player to make meaningful decisions that will have consequences during the playthrough (instead of just changing the ending of the game, as most do and not in a meaningful way).However the game have it's own deal of bad puzzles that remind me from the old point-and-click games (but certainly not nearly as bad as those). They are quite scattered, and most of the times you won't find this issue.			"

It is terribly optimized and frame drops are common, there's a weird bug that makes your head stuck turned to the side on occasion, but aside from those flaws It is worth the price of admission. I'm through chapter 4 out of 5 on my first playthrough, and I may play it again to see what would happen should I make different choices.			"

												Even though I never played the prequels, I decided to pick this one up and see how it went.  I've been looking for a game with a good story that doesn't have all the fight scenes in between (basically a Mass Effect game without all the shooting) for when I just wanted to wind down.Pros: At less than 20 hours for a full playthrough (17 was what I hit; I assume it'll be quicker next time with knowing the town layouts and puzzles), it is worth a playthrough.  There's some good character development over the game, and you do have a feeling of your choices mattering and changing things well into the future - it's a good mix of immediate and far reaching effects.  Book end caps showing how many people chose a specific ""big choice"" was a neat feature and was always fun to see.  The plot is actually a lot deeper than you'd think for what is essentially a point and click puzzle game, and it does a fair job of explaining what's going on without beating you over the head with it.  There are some scenes that did feel like tear jerkers which was quite surprising to me.Cons: The mechanics are confusing at the start with no guidance, and some of the puzzles require you to stand very close to things to interact (way closer than you'd think), meaning if you're running through town you'll probably miss them the first time around.  The backstory of the first games is not well explained at all and it's give a lot of frustration later on when people show up and you're apparently supposed to know them.  Some puzzles seem to be intentionally daft, with only one correct answer when you can immediately think of three other things that should work just as well.  The ending felt a bit rushed and a bit forced, though there were enough surprises and turns to not make it a total wash.Overall, good for at least one playthrough if you like story rich games, but get it on sale.

												TLDR: The is my favorite story-driven, decision making game by far. It's easy to connect with the characters and become attatched. Choices feel like they have actual consquences and there are so many different ways you can end the game. The animation is iffy most of the time, very clunky, but the voice acting was so good I was perfectly immersed. The play time is sufficent for me, got 20 hrs out of it. IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE PREVIOUS GAMES, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE LORE. PLAY THE GAMES, WATCH WALKTHROUGHS, READ ON EVENTS BEFORE THIS GAME. It will help a lot, I would of been lost if I didn't.This game is probably the best story-driven game I've played in a very long time, and I am honestly so happy I ended up purchasing this. I, unfortunately, have not played the previous two games but I did watch full play throughs of the events as well as reading up on the lore prior to this game. I now wish I had played the previous two prior to playing this, and I only didn't because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend money on two games not knowing what to expect.After finding all the knowledge I needed to play the game, I dived right in and the story, to me, was very compelling and the universe in place is so fantastical. I was initially drawn in by the screen caps in on this page because it seemed to have this whimsical world and it did, it was a universe that was right up my ally. I'm a sucker for eutopias that are the exact opposite. I found myself quickly engrossed in the story, the characters, what motivates them and the choices I was able to pick. I am a huge fan of the way the cause/effect system works in this game because it isn't just: Choice A = Choice A ending, Choice B = Choice B ending.  While the end results could always be the same, I love that each decision can effect something in the future, and it does. Most other games I've played will say things like ""They will remember that,"" but they never do, it holds no real consequence. You can pick various different choices and they will  have an effect even to the end of the game.The animation is clunky, I will admit that, and I am usually someone who prefers to be immersed and a person doing a smooth 180 degree turn to turn around is very unimmersive. Despite this, I was so immersed because of how great the voice acting is, the characters feel real and you get their emoitions instead of terrible voice acting. I am someone who doesn't cry when someone dies in movies or games ever, and this game is probably the first in my life to ever make my cry at a character death. Even though the scene of it might not be smooth and realistic looking, it was the voice acting, the script, the character that moved me.The game lasts far more than other story-based decision games that I've played, this took me 20 hours to complete, while the others would be 4 hours or so. I was extremely happy with the play time and how the game kept me motivated and interested in playing.I can't find an honest complaint while playing the game, I am in love with the series and I'll just keep my fingers crossed for more!

												Great game really! it is! Well, It's good. theres a lot of work it looks like into making this game but I got stuck a lot... Because i can't read the game's subtle hints... So it was very frustrating trying to play this and getting stuck every time I progress.  Thats a me issue I know. But they don't do a very good job saying where i need to go.  I've been amilessly wandering Provost for hours and now i am done with this game and i havent even gotten far i dont think. I really like this game... I really want to but i am done with it.			"

												I totally recommend this game for people who love a good story.I played The longest journey and Dreamfall and this is what i love about these games.The story is great. You immediately sink in the story and care about the characters and whant to know what's going to happen to them. I finished the story for the first time and i'm going to play it all over again to make diffrent choices and see what happens. Bravo to the developpers this is an amazing series.			"

												One of the best games I have played in a long time. If you enjoy games that really get you involved in the story and make you think about your choices, this is it. It's a beautiful  game and I'm shocked that I don't see more about it. 10/10, if you are thinking about playing this you should play at least Dreamfall:The Longest Journey first or watch someone play it on youtube, but seriously this series is amazing.

												Not knowing what the ""Final Cut"" of this game will change, I would only recommend it in its current state to those who have already played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall.  Dreamfall Chapters wraps up the story started in its prequels and -- curious retcon decisions aside -- does so in a satisfying way.  It looks beautiful, to boot.However, had I not already been familiar with the world and its characters, I'm not sure I would have made it past the first chapter.  All three playable characters run incredibly slowly, most ""puzzles"" essentially boil down to running around the same three maps trying to find which object became interactive since the last time you visited, and the stealth sections are so terrible that the game actually rewards you with an achievement for being seen too many times.My advice: wait for the final cut, and pick it up on sale.

												The third and [so far] final in The Longest Journey series, this game was absolutely phenomenal!First of all, I HIGHLY SUGGEST that potential players first play The Longest Journey, then Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, before playing this game to achieve a full understanding and appreciation for a lot of the lore and backlore that sits heavily upon this game in particular, being a story-driven, choices matter game.Personally, I have never been interested in wanting to try a choices matter game, being an old school gamer of point-and-clicks and like in classic Tomb Raider just shoot shoot to kill, but I am so happy that my first experience with one was Dreamfall Chapters! Maybe it had to do with my personal bias for the story itself, but the thing is that this game brought to life such a magical, futuristic, truly out of this world experience just like its predecessors, leaving nothing behind as many sequels do in entertainment. You can just feel yourself immersed in the surroundings, in the story, and even smaller characters you will find yourself caring for very much (Bip!!), and not many games these days can do that.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys beautiful, imaginative storylines of fantasy and sci-fi, though like I stated above, I would try to play the other games first to fully enjoy this game for what it is, though I'm sure you could enjoy it just the same if needed.*The only thing I need to say is there IS a technical issue/bug you MAY experience in which halfway through the game there is a bug in which the game freezes and will not continue, but there ARE fixes on it, for instance I just re-installed the game once and your game saves won't be harmed as this is a steam-cloud game.OVERALL I give Dreamfall Chapters 10/10.And the whole series? 200/10 for giving the little fantasy/sci-fi geeky girl in me wonderful places to escape to, and in which I have wonderful memories playing in! (The series overall spanned around 2 years of my life including during the birth of my daughter! hehe). So much love to this series <3			"

												I enjoyed the story and this game would be great if it wasnt for constant performance issues and ocasional crashing. I'm not running this on potato hardware either (i5-3570K @ 4.4 GHz - R9 280X - 8 GB RAM - SSD). If you spend almost as much time paying attention to how poorly the game performs, trying to fix it and getting irritated when it crashes as actually playing becomes clear why I cant recommend it. I really want to but I just cant.I'v read that some people dont have problems running this so you could buy it and try if it works well and if it doesnt then refund it. There is some cons other than performance issues but those are rather minor compared although the gameplay does kinda fall flat most of the time. If the game worked well I'd recommend it just for the story.EDIT: In book 5 game crashes in the same spot always and causes my entire computer to shut down... WTF!? also it crashed multiple times before also but never shut down my computer before and I got past those points. CRASH / 10EDIT 2: So I bought NVIDIA GTX 1070, replaced my AMD R9 280X with it and the game works well now. Good fps, no crashes etc. So I guess the issues I talked about earlier are related to AMD graphics cards (or R9 280X atleast) and/or drivers. I managed to finally finish book 5 and I do think the game is pretty good when it works well but only IF it works.			"

												Gameplay: 2/5Story: 5/5 Feels: 99999/5Great story. Okay game. Much feels. Play it for the story! Best played in chronological order, with the memories of the previous games still fresh in your mind. I bought all 3 games during a steam sale and I blazed through them like how I would a novel and let me tell you the only thing good is the story. I have no regrets going through some frustrating moments in game just to learn the story. Use walkthroughs if necessary. As a game I wouldn't reccomend it highly in terms of puzzle solving from TLJ (It takes years just to walk from one end to the other) and D:TLJ was actually more inituitive than Chapters. But now i'm just wallowing in so much feels.			"

												As someone who just finished this game, I'm writing this review for you as much as I am for me:TL;DR: Most spectacular adventure game you will play. Don't start on Chapters. The Longest Journey => Dreamfall:TLJ => Dreamfall Chapters. Pros:Epic adventure story, sci fi AND fantasy setting, music, voice acting, and visualsCons: Empty large environments (fixed in later chapters).Choppy AnimationsSome don't think the choices affect the game enough.For some of us, this was the longest journey. As a boy, my first adventure game was The Longest Journey and although I didn't understand all of it, it left me mystified. In 2006, Dreamfall: The Longest Journey cast my world asunder my childhood memories of April Ryan's incredible adventures were left on the ultimate cliffhanger and then there was the longest wait. Dreamfall Chapters and 2016 concluded this long painstaking wait and what a build up...Let me tell you, if you start from the beginning, you will be rewarded. This story does not disappoint in any form. It flawlessly combines science fiction and fantasy into a truly unique setting. Stark. Arcadia..If you are picking up this game and expecting a TellTale Games Walking Dead choices, this game was written with an ending in mind. It's been building towards finally connecting all the peices. You can make choices and they are going to make you cringe or worry or your characters might have regrets later in the game, but you're not going to alter the entire game. At times, the visuals are breath-taking. Although, when Red Thread Games started, I believed they were too beautiful. I would have prefered the point and click format of The Longest Journey with more things to interact with. Sometimes the areas are confusing the navigate and there are only a few things to interact with. You're supposed to only go one place but you can travel the whole length of the area with little to do. It is annoying and wastes your time. But this problem resolved in the later episodes. The animations are also stiff and choppy at times. However they accomplish the job of telling the story which is really all this game is about. I didn't mind using my imagination though. Fortunately, the voice acting really makes up for anything lost in the animation.The music is amazing and gives me shivers every time I load up the game.Right next to Life is Strange, this is my favorite interactive movie I have ever watched. It breaks your heart and swaddles it next to a cozy fire, simultanously.  I will never forget you April, Zoe, Kian, Saga, and Crow. Crow, thank you Red Thread Games for the best side kick that ever existed. I don't know how you pulled off such a satisfying ending. The wait was worth it. Every second.			"

												Just awesome, like the rest of the series. Of course it is not perfect and has a few flaws, but the story is amazing and the worlds are beautiful. And the choice system is very good, and if some consequences are quite predictable, others are very surprising, and more often than not there is no ""right"" choice, you just make a decision and live with the consequences. If you don't like watching cinematics though, you should probably stay away, because this game has a lot of them, and some very long ones.			"

												Well after waiting for years to play the game I finally got it.  It's hard to say if this game is worth it.   It would depend if your invested in the story or not.   I find the game plays too much like a story with some things to push.  I played the previous games and love the series and dont regret backing them at all.  Although I got a game breaking bug and I wasnt able to finish past the 4th book.   I tried everything uninstalling drivers etc. etc. so i watched a lets play for the end. im going to give it a recommend for the fact that it finishes up a great series. Also for fans there is a few really great moments.			"

												     I have played the very first The longest Journey game back when i was a lil' one discovering world of games , bought it alongside another great masterpiece which if you haven't played , check out Syberia, if you enjoyed the longest journey ...ahem..back on track , first game amazed me ,  a world of magic,speampunk ,tehnology,old and new , misteries and science that come together in a world yet in the same time divided ,              *While the fist Journey puts you into a literally looong , amazing,confusing journey where you chase rubber ducky and mithical creatures,have adventures at sea and visit art galleries  , first journey raises lots.. and i mean lots of questions so if you still haven't played the game make sure you have your patience ,disposition and time to proprely enjoy the game, it's worth it ( don't mind the dated grphics and long dialogue , the game will absorb you into the world of marcuria in no time ...it's magical you could say) .             *Later at given point in time , the second game comes out , The Longest Journey: Dreamfall Now this game while was not bad , lots of radical changes and a total brand new direction , sometimes it felt out of track , it didn't felt like The longest journey no more ..but it was still that , just different. This game didn't answered many questions but it did answered some...and raised many more . Not my favourite game of the 3 to be honest , but it's a good add up to the journey and can't lie that I wasn't all over the place with joy finding out there was a new game, that meant the jouney continues !             *And..now finally getting to Dreamfall : Chapters ...if anyone mannaged to keep reading my whole blabbering till now ,well damnFinding out about Dreaamfall Chapters as the third game made me so hyped , happy and.... internal explosion?of joy? guess tht's a weirdly accurte description . But in the same time , previous game left me a bit dissapointed, just a bit so i didn't really knew what to expect As i rencently only managed to finish the game , I have to say the game, despite choppy controlls and some puzzles that leave you hanging in confusion (nothing too buggy still)  this game , have accomplished to bring the first and second game to a total new level , a visual masterpiece , amazing character development ,old and new reunited , the world(s) feel so alive , characters are speaking to you more than dialougue , worlds get connected , questions are indeed answered , choices are made ..  Dreamfall: Chapters made the best of both first game , improved it and brings a whole universe to life .             I recommend playing all 3 games in order of appearance , for full experience . Big thank you for anhyone involed in making the third game possible .			"

												The Good:-Graphics. While the game isn't the next Crysis it looks quite nice. Most of the game takes in places with limited lightning. This allows for two things. First it allows to somewhat enrich the graphics with nice use of lightning and shadows. Second, as I said this ain't Crysis, so this allows to mask many graphics deficiencies.-Sound, nothing great but it definitely fits the game atmosphere.-Solid voice acting.-Interesting, funny main characters and few minor characters (Kian, Zoe, Crow, Enu, Mira, Bip).The Bad:-Absurd system requirements. You think that your high-end desktop will run 1080p+maxed everything without any sweat because this is a adventure game? Think again! -Numerous awkward animations.-Issues with plot. Let's be cryptic! Because.-Outside of cutscenes the player characters will say numerous things but his/her lips won't move a muscle during that time.-This game features the worst ending I've ever witnessed in a story heavy game.-Bad ""puzzles"", some are simply ""try everything, because"" and some ""navigate the whole map, because"".-Your characters move slow. They can't run, they only jog. You waste large amount of time because of this.-In many games the creators advertise how the choices in the game matter sooo much. It is similar in this game, no It's even worse, you're reminded after each episode about you're decisions, during gameplay it's similar, big text with big words, I would say it's even insulting to the player, especially considering the fact that your choices don't matter that much.-Some talk you can skip, some you can't. Because.-The game is now finished but you have to remember this was and episodic game. The episodes unfortunately weren't the same length. So this has lead to a situation where you got a fairly long episode, expected that another will be the same length but in the end another episode was shorter.-The political message. LGBT, left vs right, misogyny, racism. Lets face this, this will always be a touchy subject, but it can be done in a convincing way. In this game it's done in ham-fisted way. Protip: If you can't do it right don't do it at all. In the end, despite it's flaws the journey was interesting and worth playing. It's sad that the same can't be said about the ending.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Longest Journey series and waited very long to finally get some kind of closure. Though there are certainly some plotholes and storylines which deserved more space, I liked this game a lot and understand that there are limitations for what you can tell in one game. The graphics are beautifull, and make the breathtaking world of Arcadia and Stark even more unique. Lot of people don`t like how it ended, I think that`s just personal taste, I was ok with how things went down, and recommend it for everyone who played the previous two games. There are moments which would surely stay with you long after you finished the game.			"

												I thought this was a lot better than the previous game of the series. and I thought it as a lot more faithfull to the feel of the original Longest Journey in terms of writing and charm. There were some points made by some people on how this had some problematic elements in terms of respecting the lore, leaving plot holes open and having it too political. I didn't think that the parts that were ""wrong"" in terms of lore were too important in the overall theme, and didn't even see them happening when I played this. I thought that this game did pretty good job on continuing the previous Dreamfall so that we got some kind of a conclusion. I'm one of those nerds that think that there can't be anything ""too political"", so that wasn't an issue to me. I thought it was great that the politics of Europolis resembled well of how the politics actually are in Europe. I thought this game was amazing and it got me hooked from the start. Last book is not as great as the previous ones, but I still enjoyed it. I would never say that it was better than the original ""The Longest Journey"", but I don't think it ever could have been.			"

Speaking of Story, this game has a fantastic one.The plot doesn't try to be TOO complex. It has just enough twist and turns, but depending on options you chose you'll get different outcomes. For the most part the characters will be ones that you love as well as love to hate. Although there were some characters I couldn't give a ratsus's ace about. Good game, check it out c;			"
