												Do you remember that feeling you had as you cowered in the closet, hiding from the monstrosities in Amnesia?  Or when you tiptoed along a dimly lit hallway, hoping the monster ahead wouldn't see you in Outlast?  You won't be able to find anything of the sort here.  Eleusis attempts to emulate the successful horror formula of its' predecessors, but falls flat on its' face.  The game manages to take the most annoying tropes of the adventure and horror genres and mash them together to create this mess of a game.When I say ""adventure"", I use the term very loosely.  The puzzles themselves are few and far between, sandwiched between hours upon hours of endless backtracking between different points in the village.  You find a key in a drawer?  Better check every single door on the map, because you have no clue which building is what.  Oh, you have to collect the ingredients to make a mysterious potion?  They are located at points A, B, C and D, at different corners of the map.  Have fun walking around at an excruciatingly slow pace.  The next stage then makes you visit all of the areas all over again.  Even with the additional, and completely unnecessary, padding, I only managed to squeeze about 4 hours of playtime out of the game (Steam says 2 hours, but I first played on Desura).  Of course, backtracking in itself does not destroy a game.  I've certainly played other titles that were overly reliant on this concept (Dreamfall, anyone?), but most manage to make up the shortcomings with an excellent storyline or logical and engaging puzzles.  Eleusis isn't able to cover either category well.  The storyline is nothing special - some mysterious cult trying to raise an evil god - and the twists and turns can be seen from a mile away.  The puzzles are drab and uninspiring.  Most of them involve searching for keys and the doors they go to.  Those scavenger hunts aren't entirely too bad, but there are far too many logical shortcoming throughout.  Near the start of the game, the protagonist picks up a wood axe.  You'd think the axe would be able to chop through all of the locked wooden doors, wouldn't you?  Nope, it's only used for shimmying a hose off a faucet.  Eventually, the main character creates a pair of lockpicks, using on the simple tools at hand.   The problem?  You guessed it.  The lockpicks only work on a single door in the entire game.  The game is also plagued with knee-high gates, but, being locked, somehow create a infinitely tall boundaries that magically prevents the protagonist from even thinking about walking over.   I have to admit that not everything about Eleusis is terrible.  The overall lighting, with the exception of the overly reflective rocks in several areas (thanks to the UDK engine), is certainly reminiscent of other survival horror games.  The spooky ambient noises are fitting and the great graphics in general work well to establish a creepy atmosphere.  Unfortunately, those two points are essentially the only highlights to this dull and predictable adventure, I agree with one of the other reviewers here.  This game just feels like some kind of tech demo or portfolio project.  It just doesn't feel like the developer made an honest effort to create a full fledged game.  As such, I would advise to stay far, far away from this game.			"

												I was really excited to play this game, long time ago I read about the Eleusinian Mysteries, and seeing this is based on that, it peaked my interest.Once I started the game, I thought 'wow, this actually looks good, compared to other games in this genre'. And it does, the graphics are really nice and detailed. Same goes for the sound and music, there's not too much distracting music playing, on the few occasions it does, it is very fitting. Other than that you hear your footsteps and the enviroment around you, i.e. water, etc., big plus on atmosphere.However, once I advanced a bit in Chapter one, I started to get annoyed. The fov is horrible. Paths are barely visible, even with a flashlight.After solving my first puzzle, I thought it can't get much worse. Wrong. Throughout the game there's no innovative new puzzles, it's always the same. The most annoying part is the running around back and forth (yes, through the whole map) you HAVE to do. It gets really, really frustrating after a while. Imagine finding a key and having to try pretty much every single door to find the lock it fits in.When I started I checked the NPC thread option, the first time something pops up, sure it was a bit freaky, but that's it. After that the ecounters became predictable and annoying. Now comes one of the worst things about Eleusis: no manual saves, so enjoy running back and forth again if you go game over.The game lenght is decent, it takes about four hours to finish it. Without the useless backtracking you could easily complete it in less than half of that time. So keep that in mind. There's nothing exciting about 'exploring', in Eleusis it feels like your wife or mother telling you to take out the trash a hundred times a day. So, in the end the story didn't intrigue me in the way I was expecting. Eleusis was predictable, boring and very, very annoying. I am glad I didn't buy this full price, and neither should you.			"

												I hate walking. No I don't mean that in the lazy, ""I'd rather sit on my bum and play video games all day"" sort of way, but the act of slowly moving your legs instead of opting to run when the situation demands it. So it would stand to reason that I sort of hate Eleusis, a game that consists of 80% mundanely walking at the speed of a crippled elderly person to various points on your map, with the rest being filled in with so many terrible design decisions that I struggled to remember them all.Eleusis opens with your character being summoned by his mother to visit his hometown. On the way there his car is struck by a cascading boulder, and he has no choice but to leave his vehicle and explore the area around him, which soon leads him to a creepy abandoned village, where everything is miles apart and key objects scattered around in the most convoluted of places.And this is where you come in, being the newly appointed hidden object finder, tasked with searching what remains of the village to find various tools and keys and use them to make your way past so many locked doors in order to find more doodads and unlock more doors. It's essentially an adventure game, but the puzzles are so obtuse and confusing that it feels like little more than one tedious fetch quest. Only minutes into the game I was already reaching for a guide, as absolutely nothing is done to direct the player, and progression often depends on clicking on the one item out of a dozen that is usable as opposed to needlessly moved around (which even then is restricted to certain items, making it an even more baffling inclusion that is never used for anything meaningful). And of course, all of this sends you walking back and forth across the map, often requiring repeat trips and trial and error as so little is labeled meaningfully, and getting lost is incredibly easy with how little you can see and how tangled the maze of trails becomes.This might not be nearly as dull as it is though if Eleusis's world wasn't at least three times larger than it needs to be and filled so sparingly with anything consequential. The size of the map might also be connected to the horrendous performance I received on a PC that is more than capable of running the game, which graphically consists of little more than bland textures, pop-in prone foliage, and embarrassing particle effects. There are moments when the darkness almost makes everything look decent, but it's merely an illusion quickly discarded when a light is passed over whatever you may be viewing.I don't feel the need to delve much into the narrative, as it's so sparse and comprised of so many disconnected strands that you'd almost forget it was there, if not for the requirement to read through long passages of text in find the clue not so subtlety hidden among the rambles. Your character's motivations are never explained, the plot is paper thin, and the ending notable only for the reprieve it gives you from such a horrendous experience.If you are expecting a horror game, clever puzzles, a decent narrative, or even just some decent eye candy, you will find none of it here. Eleusis is a failure of a game that I can only recommend as an example for aspiring developers at how badly you can screw up a first person adventure game. For everyone else, be glad you have yet to take part in this experience, and for those who already have you have my sympathy.			"

												The most boring game ever. Everything is slow and there is no excitement to anything. Make sure to turn ""NPC Threats"" off, because the only enemies are wolves that spawn when you pick up key items, and walking away from these wolves is pretty much the game forcing you to backtrack in order to despawn them which makes them just a waste of time. The setting is really dull too and moving around in it is clunky due to the bad controls. The worst part about the game is the gameplay itself, which is nothing but walking around in a large but empty world at a very slow pace. This makes finding items for puzzles and then bringing them to where you think they would work a major pain.About the puzzles: They are garbage. The game's progression is tied to you picking up one specific item after another, you pick an item up just to use it on the next item which will then let you do something to get another item. Missed an item? Better search everywhere while moving like a snail. Most of your time will be spent walking around an empty area clicking on everything to find that one item you need. Also, good luck finding the matches. Putting them inside a 80% opacity glass case on top of a grave was not the best idea. By the way, the game is not scary.EDIT: I read the Steam Store page for this game and got angry, so I'm gonna pick apart each point.--High detailed realistic graphics.Not really. The village itself is very boring and weird-looking (many of the houses are one room for some reason), and the forest area is plagued by bad pop-in problems with shadows. The same 3 moveable rocks are repeated throughout the whole game. The lighting is alright.--Explore open environment with realistic physics in the Greek countryside.""Realistic physics""? You mean like how you can put a chair through a solid wall if you move quick enough? How about whenever something moves along the floor or touches the floor, it makes the same sound at the same volume like 20 times in a row really fast and sounds like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The rocks are easier to throw than a glass jar in this game. Also, can you really call it an ""open environment"" when 90% of all the houses and buildings are locked?--Use stealth tactics and agility to survive. ""Stealth tactics"" is wrong, it is a blatant lie. There is no stealth in this game, enemies show up out of nowhere and you'll never see them before they see you and start chasing you. And there is no running in this game, you walk and enemies walk at about the same speed. They chase you at a walking pace until the game decides to give up and despawn the enemy. --Use physics-based objects to defend yourself.This statement is solely meant to cover for the lies of the previous statement since running away and stealth are not an option to anyone who doesn't want to backtrack even more than they have to. --Challenging item–based Puzzles with simple interface.I already discussed the puzzles and why they suck, but the interface is also bad. You get like 12 item slots but you'll never come close to filling that since you use items after getting them. It looks and feels ugly and rushed. --Dark atmosphere with eerie sounds.What ""eerie sounds""? That doesn't even make sense because there are no eerie sounds at all, or anything close to that description. Also the dark atmosphere is not something to be proud of since it makes no sense either. The moonlight is so strong that it creates lightrays around every object, but  everything on the ground is still pitch-black???--Original storylineSonic fanfictions are also ""original storylines"", this is yet another meaningless statement.Don't buy it, not even on sale.

												So, seeing that the game had been Greenlit and fairly well acclaimed, I thought I'd give it a try. The story was pretty promising, as someone who's into Mythology, and it game would revolve around it. So, le'ts get on with it! It's advertised as ""a story-driven game with emphasis on exploration, information gathering and also includes horror-survival elements"". Let's just get the ""horror-survival elements"" out of the way. It is in no way, a survival horror game, that must have been what they've stuck to it since every youtuber and their dog screamed whenever they stepped on a stick. They give you a flashlight. With batteries. Hmmm, surely, I must scavenge for more batteries after these are over. Well... not really. They feel like it's a good idea to give you an unlimited lantern, that lights waaaay more than the said ""essential"" flashlight. Seriously, if you're going to give us a better lighting tool, don't give us the flashlight at all, it makes no freaking sense! Oh, and I've only found one pack of flashlight batteries anyway, which, of course, I didn't use... it's pointless, really.Onwards to the ""exploration, information gathering"": Well, since the whole game is set at night, you can't really see much, which makes for a monotous walk through the forest, and that's your exploration. I'll admit I liked the artstyle, and the village, but there's virtually nothing to explore in the game. You have a semi open-world, but it's essentially a forest, and there's no point to explore on your own, since you'll go everywhere along with the story. I'd have loved to do some exploration, but there was no point, there was nothing to explore.""story-driven""... this one hurts, I'm sorry to say, but it really does. There's almost no story presented through gameplay... which, well, find it on youtube. As you go from place to place looking for items (I'll get there in a minute), there's no story to be told. Until you reach an house, that is, in which you'll get the feel for the story through some notes, and that alone. Almost every bit of story in this games, is given to you through text. It just feels out of place, and that text is always next to the item you need to progress the game, so there goes exploration, right? Look at Bioshock! The world itself tells the overall story, and those audiologs, just give us the background and some interesting details to complete the world. Now... the gameplay. This is essentially a First Person Point n' Click game! The puzzles are just ""Go there a get this, then come back and use that with this..."" and so on and so forth. And they feel like they're designed to extend the game's longevity, since you're constantly walking back and forth from one place to the one on the other edge of the map. And it's not fun. It's simply NOT fun... and neither is it scary, there's nothing scary about the game, unless you're afraid of the dark.I could say a lot about how senseless some ""puzzles"" were, but I feel like I'm going too hard at the game.The supposedly scary/stealthy part would be when you have to run from wolves (which appear out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere whenever you pick a piece of the final puzzle) or from a patroling cultist. Aaaand it's awkward. Painfully so. Now, the only praise I can give to this game, is its looks, and the story potential (maybe?). To the developpers: if you're making a game and you CAN'T do something right, don't do it at all. Do something else. Because, what we get here, is a game that could be so much better than what it is, but it falls flat on its face because of badly implemented features!Maybe in future titles Nocturnal Nights will shine, and I'll give them another chance. It's just that this game in particular was really bad in my opinion. Full of bad design choices, seemingly to jump on the ""survival horror"" bandwagon that's been going on lately. "

												Firstly, I tried to remember where I got this game from. At first I thought I might have grabbed it during the Halloween Sale, but no... no I hadn't. Instead, I purchased this game in the Be Mine 8 Indy Bundle several months ago.Seemingly they added Steam keys to that bundle, and I had redeemed it blidnly and totally forgot about the game until Steam Roulette picked it for the next game in the Backlog Blitz. So, that's the backstory into why I have this in my Steam Library. It also helps set the scene for the review.This game is pretty awful.I don't want to be harsh, but there's no real positive to this game. The story is disjointed and paper thin - and you'll see whatever surprise it suggets it might have coming a mile away.The controls are OK, but they're basic WSAD controls and mouse look. I guess it uses the Unreal Development Kit nicely, as at times the game does look nice. However, that's probably it. Everything about this game screams 'portfolio project' - a game that was made in an attempt to showcase talent in an attempt to get a job with a studio in the future. If I had made this game, I'd be somewhat happy with it... but I'd never try to sell it to people as a game. It's just not engaging enough. You'd probably be able to finish this game in 2 hours, if it wasn't for the horrible back and forth backtracking the game MAKES you do, and the frustratingly placed enemies that suddenly appear out of nowhere and hunt you down. Overall just avoid this game, don't even buy it as a temptation to see how terrible it is. Just avoid.			"

												I blew through this in less then 4 hours, so not a lot of play time designed into it.  The graphics were stunning, the story was inventive if far too short, if you can find this on sale, I'd say the 4 hours of game play is worth the 10 dollars, but not much more.   The game was a bit too linear for an adventure and the clues left in game, made it almost too easy to progress through.  It could have been better with more content in it, some of which could have made the main story line a bit less easy to follow to quickly through.   There were a ton of unexplored houses left by the end, so over all why I liked it for a short diversionary game, it felt a bit more like a 3d based short story book, and less like a puzzeling adventure game.

The plot is cliche, empty and rather approching to stuipidty. 80%+ of the whole game is jogging around the landscape, with a dog and a robed figure randomly jumping out and surprising you. I love AVG and played more than 30+ AVG. I can say with confidence that this game is one of the lousiest I have ever played. I don't recommend it at all.

												I'm in a problem with the recommendation, since I've got mixed feelings. So I just do a basic pro-con match.PRO:+ Very athmospheric, interesting lore and start+ Great visuals and audio, that sucks you in+ Runs on older configs (my playtime was on an AMD Athlon64, 2 GB DDR1 RAM with an Asus Radeon EAH5670) smoothly with minor FPS drops+ Puzzles and avoiding confrontationsCON:- the story is pretty generic, the endings are vague and rough-and-ready, which is a huge problem since this gives motivation to finish... yet, you get a Lovecraftish and underwhelming ending, without real twists and turns, either way you choose to finish- letting the threats being turned off impacts too much on the game experience to the negative side, makes it booooring- all the puzzles and going from one place to another because of some items throws you out quickly- everything else, that can throw you out: continuing after a while or a single disturbance from anyone/anything (e.g. Steam Chat)Basically, if I have to compare to something, I would name Penumbra, Amnesia, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, but neither a direct one, more like a mixture of these. So would I recommend it? Yeah, it's worth a while to play, but don't expect much.			"

												The fact that this game was made by just 3 people is amazing. It stands up to par with Outlast and Amnesia. It matches the level of Amnesia's atmosphere and has a much better script than Outlast. It spits right in the face of Daylight. If you want to live a mystery in a secluded, mountainous, greek village, definetely check it out. If you are experienced in this genre, you will oversee its flaws more easily and its looks are gonna help you do that. It didn't look very promising at first, but delivered quite much.It certainly has its flaws, but it stands above mediocrity with a well thought story and excellent atmosphere. The action isn't good and the AI is terrible, but you can switch it off. It has excellent audio and quite nice level design. Kudos to the team behind it. Give us a sequel.			"

												Okay.... Quick warning.  Spoiler ahead.  Don't read this if you plan on playing it.  And take the advice of others here, turn NPC threat off.  Its unecessary and just adds annoyance.I love games like this.  I've been playing them since Myst all those years ago.  I enjoyed this one to a point.  Its definitely atmospheric and all.  Everything can be figured out without the use of any walkthrough unlike alot of these kinds of games.  BUT, the end was beyond disappointing.  It was sudden, predictable and frankly when the character we are playing says ""I have to make a choice"" there is no choice to make.  I wanted to NOT do what the game forced me to do.   I'm gonna go back in there and look again to make sure, but I really did not see where my other ""choices"" were.  And another thing I really did not like about this game....  Save points.  Why in the world would you make a game like this and not allow a player to save the game when they need to?Bottom line is, I would recommend it if its on sale for very cheap.  It was fun figuring everything out and again, as I said it's one that you can piece together without a walkthrough or hints which is nice.  I just wish it had more of a story and a less predictable/forced ending and allowed you to save at will.			"

												First off, you are better off trying a good mod for Amnesia.If you do play the game, turn NPC Threat off; wolves are OP and annoying.Eleusis does a few things right, but a lot of things wrong. The story is decent and original, and the game is pretty being built with the Unreal Development Kit. Everything else is horrible though. The controls are tank controls. The movement speed of the main character needs to be fixed; running actually feels like walking, and walking actually feels like crawling. NPCs in this game are just there to annoy you and really don't feel like a threat. If you don't have a rock on you at all times, expect to die alot, so just turn NPC combat off. Puzzles are either clear and easy or unclear and just difficult. It would have been nice if they would have put more thought into them.Overall, avoid buying this game. Save your money, go download a decent Amenesia mod and have fun with that.			"

												Like so many horror games and movies Eleusis delivers a very exciting beginning but a horribly clichéd ending. I don't mind slow paced exploration in this game that many people have adressed in their reviews. What is annoying is the lack of guidance (not even the books you might find in the game help you find those buried missing pieces). Trying to throw rocks at the enemies didn't feel rewarding part of the game. Because of these flaws, after a frustrating couple hours, I ended up playing the game through using a walkthrough NPC enemies turned off (excellent decision to have a button for that in launcher). Graphics are mostly well done and create eerie atmosphere, on the other hand awful character animation and skinning totally destroy it. In sound design there seems to be many glitches left (try to open a cupboard with spoons inside and you know what I mean). Level design could have been improved by highlighting points of interests with different textures and lighting. The mythology used in the game is interesting but could have been explored more thoroughly.			"

												I got this game for 5 bucks and I regret buying it. The story is predictable and the gameplay is not smooth at all and it is over all a pretty boring experience. It’s too easy to miss important items that you will need. The only thing that’s somewhat good is the atmosphere and graphics. I highly recommend you DON’T buy this game, but if you really want it, get it on a sale when it’s like 3 bucks. 5/10			"

												This game is one of my favourite of the last 2 years. The atmosphere around the map is awesome especially with a good headset to fully enjoy the sounds of the game. Furthermore, the graphics of the game are pretty good with good lights.Last but not least, its a really fun game that will need you to search and think in order to finish it. Really good game!			"

												If you buy this game looking for excitement and mystery... You're going to feel short changed. The only mystery I came across was why I was still playing this game. Let's first talk about the excitement factor. There is none. While failing to capture the atmosphere of similar games of this genre, it also manages to be painfully uninteresting. I don't have much to comment on the story because I didn't make it that far. Now, let's talk about the graphics. To my surprise, they are solid. Made my computer work quite hard. The graphics also found a way to annoy me though, so it didn't save my experience. I will give it a positive though... The controls felt pretty nice. I can see where the developers wanted this game to go. Sadly, it missed.. By a long shot. If this game is full priced, don't even think about buying it. You'll hate yourself for it. I bought it while on sale and I still feel angered. 3/10			"

												First off, I will say that Eleusis has some nice graphic design and a nicely spooky atmosphere. It was a project with potential, but I sadly cannot recommend it. I completed the game in six hours, and a good portion of that was spent wandering around trying to figure out what to do next. A lack of hand holding is one thing, but providing little to no direction is quite another. But the big thing is that for me at least, Eleusis just isn't scary. And that's a pretty big failing for a horror game. Nearly all hostile encounters are scripted and you can clearly tell when you're in danger and when you're not. The plot is pretty thin and I saw the big twist at the end coming from a mile away. Maybe if the devs had had more time, money and/or staff, this could have been better, but as is I can't give it my seal of approval.			"

												WHEEEERE'S THE BLAAAAACKSMIITH??If seriously - the game is very beautiful, dark and atmospheric, but the puzzle logic is sometimes... sometimes there's no logic:) The other flow is that there's too mutch walking around. Sometimes it's very hard to find something (wheeere's the blacksmith? Wheeere's the dirt pile?). The other flow is that the game is buggy (at least for me), it freezes to often.But I like the story it's self - greek myfology, secret cult, ancient rituals.... and finally the option to  be the part of it, not to ruin everuthing :) - almost nothing new, but I like this stuff.I think Eleusis is worth at least the sale price and a few hours of your life, if you like old-school point'n'klick games with dark occult atmosphere!

Well, at least one thing finally makes sense... I took one thing away from this game -I now know where that fan in-joke of Markiplier running around trying to find an apparently nonexistent Blacksmith comes from.I couldn't find the Blacksmith either. They appear to have vanished into the void, beyond the realms of my PC's feeble human mind. Clearly, that was the real conspiracy in this village -a bunch of cultists who just aren't very good at killing trespassers and covering up the evidence (the coffin wasn't even NAILED SHUT PROPERLY, guys!) trying to figure out where om earth this mythical blacksmith was supposed to be. This game has the rather dubious honour of being the first one I've ever refunded on steam. It had potential  -a horror game based in Europe, on an urban legend? Yes please, that sounds right up my alley! But this fell unfortunately short.Several of the games primary mechanics glitched for me -the torch never appeared in my trunk or inventory and the oil can got jammed in the river. I was unable to locate certain areas that should have been easy to find -specifically, the infamous blacksmith- my character continually got stuck on the geometry, puzzles were unintuitive, and the story, what little of it I saw, felt hackneyed. For the positives, the game did have a good atmosphere when it worked. The character models were not particularly stunning, but the setting was creepy and moody.  The game looks fine -the graphics are decent, if rather samey, and the experience is somewhat improved if you play with NPC encounters turned on. Though that said, these NPC's are ugly, badly animated, and encounters rarely add to the horror of the situation. They are more of an annoyance than a credible threatUnder other circumstances, and with fewer bugs, this could've been a game I found entertaining, if not memorable, but the bugs simply pushed it over the edge for me.

												The game starts off with the main character driving to his mother after recieving a letter from her regarding your father.But suddenly, a rock rolls down from a hill and crashes into your car. You survived, but now you're alone in a dark eerie forest with only a flashlight and a journal.The creepy looking visuals and ambient atmosphere gave off a nice unsettling mood that looked very promising.And as you wander through the forest, you come across a seemingly empty village. And find a woman locked into a small cabin and asked you to let her out. You decide to help her and as you explore the village after something of use, mysterious people in robes, belonging to some cult, seemed to inhabit the village. They even managed to capture you and was about to bury you alive in a coffin, until you lifted off the lid and scared off the little guy.The rest of the story pretty much involves you chasing after the mysterious woman and uncovering the story behind the village.Too bad the developers thought that it would be a good idea to give us a HUGE area with random items scattered around, that happens to be vital for progressing the game, without no sense of direction.The first problem you will come across is that you find a dark room and your flashlight doesn't work because it ran out of batteries after 5-10 minutes of use. Fortunatley, you find a generator... with no gas in it.So in order to refill it, you need to find: A small hose stuck on a tap, that can easily be overlooked. And a jerrycan, that is stuck on a branch in a small river.In order to extract the gas from a parked Vespa that is parked next to a staircase, that could also be easily overlooked.Remember that, these items are scattered in this big forest and you have no idea were to find these items. And did i mention that you also run VERY slow. Discuraging any kind of exploration, which is something that you have to do constantly.And after you've progressed through a certain point, f..king wolfs will start chasing you and kill you as soon as they touch you. They are also extremely hard to avoid because your character is as slow as a turtle. And they also appear in the worst possible occasion, like blocking a small path from a dead end. And even if you manage to pass it, the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keeps chasing you until you reach a safe heaven like in a house or village.Something that also bothers me is that there is no appearent motive as to why we're able to pick up random items that doesn't seem to contain any appearent purpose. I mean, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO PICK UP SOME ASHES!?!??!The story is also bland and unfulfilling. Although the little voice-acting that we got from from all the characters is also quite descent.This game had potential, but wasn't executed very well.If you are looking for a descent horror game, then this game is not for you.I would recommend you to buy either Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast or a ""free to play"" game called Spookys House of Jumpscares.

												It seemed good at first. An adventure and mystery game. Then I realized it was meant to scare you with really subpar scares with wolves. It seems disappointing now. Not really worth a playthrough since the movements are buggy and long. Unlike Amnesia, the game takes you back through the same boring paths whereas Amnesia would allow quicker travels if you need to backtrack, taking a simple door or even a cave that would teleport you. This game really needs something like that.			"

												Even though this game seemed quite short, I had a great time playing it. Straight away, I was thrown into a situation in the middle of no where. I did not know my way around, I did not know where to go. But the more I played, the more I began to learn routes and figure parts out. It is like a puzzle horror game, with a strange story. I did not expect the ending which I faced. While I am not really into many with magical, fantasy rubbish, this game seemed alright. I do not think this is a game which everyone will be rushing to purchase but if you are ever bored and want a little game to try out, I would recommend this. Sure, it was a little short, but I had fun playing it. The game has been made on Unity I believe and the game makers have done a fantastic job!			"

												Gonna say up front while I don't really recommend this, it wasn't entirely awful. Eleusis just felt like more of the same in regards to first person horror, albeit reasonably crafted more of the same. Car breakdown? Check. Disempowerment early on? Check. Mysterious supernatural weirdness going on? Check and double check.To its credit, Eleusis looks pretty good visually. The environments feel natural enough as well, if a bit spread out. Thing is, the aimlessness of a lot of your searching, coupled with the cheapness of the things that -can- end your run once they start showing up, makes the whole struggle feel not all that worthwhile.  And struggle you will, as it takes a bit to get a feel for the map, and again, those cheap spawns of critters (and at least one dude) who feel like they have way more reach than they should.Once you get used to running like hell and whatnot, however, it's not too much of a hassle aside from finding some of the last items you need in the game. Expect to look down a lot, and have fun randomly slamming items together to get to that point in the first place. Things start getting unclear once you're in the second chapter, to put it kindly.If you've got a few bucks and want a slightly interesting story, maybe give Eleusis a chance, but it's not something very high-priority, whether or not you're a horror fan.

												This is one of those game which I started playing so long after buying it that I had completely forgotten anything about it or why I bought it. Going into it blind it starts very well exploring a dark sinister environment however I very quickly got bored with it. The enemies in this game are incredibly annoying these encounters end up like slowed down versions of a Benny Hill sketch, until you just give up and accept your death. However there is the option to turn off the enemies which is an improvement but at that point the game just become a 1st person point and click adventure. There is a reason that point and click adventures are not usually 1st person, it is one thing attempting to use every item in your inventory with every object in a couple of screens it is quite another to do the same wandering through an entire village and surrounding forest. That is the defining characteristic of this game: the aimlessly wandering about. Oh and if you get bored of wandering about and want to take a break there is no manual save. The amount of playtime you will get out of this game will very upon on how much tolerance you have for this aimlessly meandering about before you look for a walkthrough; I had little patience for this game so only got 2 and a half hours out of this game.

												First off, I'm not a fan of adventure games that require lots of back-tracking.. and... this game does just that.  I'd much rather this have been more linear with a more interesting story as I get very bored with the back and forth walking (running) aspects.  To be fair, I didn't finish the game and just played long enough to get my trading cards. Graphics were nice and I did enjoy walking off path for a little bit, but everything is so dark even that didn't hold my interest (and I sometimes like walking-simulator type games that ARE interesting).  I didn't hate my time with this game, but I have no desire to go back to it.			"

Most of the game is spent running around the forests of a small greek village on a foggy night wondering what the heck you're supposed to be looking for. The areas are all so similar when you find yourself realizing you need to go back to an earlier area (and this will happen very often) you will end up scratching your head and wondering where exactly it was. They added enemies in 1.3 which will insta-gib you and there is no manual save. Just pass this one by, seriously move along, nothing to see here.			"

												A meandering and unfocused point and click in the form of a first person exploration game.At the game's first puzzle (fill the generator with gas) I spent 20 minutes trying to find a vessel for transporting liquid - who knows why the game's universe contains bottles, bowls, and buckets, because in this universe they do jack sh*t - before deciding against wasting my time any longer and quitting the game.On the plus side, the environment and art assets are competently formed and quite pretty, though good luck seeing them in the game's pitch darkness.

												Just trash. The game wasn't at all scary and getting away from those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wolves was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There was an unhealthy amount of backtracking and some of the items (the box of matches and the lockpick wire) were hidden in stupidly obscure areas.**SPOILERS** Concerning the ending, if the cultists needed the protagonist to channel Typhoeus, why were there cultists trying to kill him for most of the game? I don't buy the 'test' excuse as having the main character dead would prevent the resurecction. This means that for the game to make sence, the NPC threats option in the menu has to be turned off, which is not the way the game is supposed to be played!With the indie market flooded with cheap horror titles, it's starting to get very difficult to choose which ones are worth your time. This unfortunately isn't one that will scare and enthrall players and I feel bad that I contributed towards getting this greenlit when it clearly wasn't something that gamers wanted or needed. I can reccomend Amnesia, Doorways and Metro 2033 instead.			"

												Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law he does meditate day and night.And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.For the Lord knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

												Eleusis is a 3d first-person adventure game for Windows developed by Nocturnal Works using the technology of the unreal engine. It takes place in a seemingly abandoned village in Greece where the player character, while trying to seek refuge, finds himself in the center of a whirlwind of mysterious events.As the plot unfolds he finds clues that indicate that the village is a nest of a cult which plans to revive a dark force through an ancient ritual and harness its power. The player character faces the challenge of unlocking the forgotten knowledge of the ancient mysteries in order to stop the cult from accomplishing their goal. It is a story-driven game with emphasis on exploration, information gathering and also includes horror-survival elements. The player is called to solve inventory item based puzzles in order to proceed to unlock new areas and solve the mystery. The game’s puzzles are made to challenge the player and are based on actual history, mythology and technology of ancient Greece. The player also needs to be cautious and use stealth tactics and agility to survive the threats looming the area.			"

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) and I'm the writer of a game review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. This is my review for indie adventure game Eleusis. The game is a rather boring experience in all honesty. I normally love adventure games but I couldn't really get into this one, not a whole lot really happens story wise and when something does happen it's been so long in between that it feels drawn out and boring. The graphics look nice but its gameplay is mediocre. Thanks for reading folks, happy gaming!You can read the full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/11/eleusis-overview-review/ "

												More a walking simulation adventure game than a horror with some bugs and problems (I triggered the first enemy before the tutorial). I have some tolerance and not displeased so do not try if you do not.			"
