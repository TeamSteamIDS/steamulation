												Beautiful graphics, and interesting premise but the game itself is extremely frustrating.  The puzzles themselves are pretty simple, but in addition to the old pixel hunt style, the game doesn't enable the hotspots for items or usable scenery until specific times.    Then, just to ramp up the frustration, there are timed puzzles, with the same constraints.   Suddenly scenery and items become arbitrarily active or inactive, with little time to experiment and search.   Feels like a serving of frustration with a side of screw you from the author.   Having a walkthrough helps, but it'll just ♥♥♥♥ you off when you see that your solution was correct -- you just weren't doing it the way the designer wanted you to, and at the right time that the designer wanted you to.

												Recommended for fans of this genre, but not for the typical gamer.It's a short, weird, artsy game with both easy and annyoingly hard puzzles. Play if for the atmosphere, the (weird) story and the rather varied and imaginative puzzles. If you are openminded you can experience a relly unique story and a very immersive game that keeps on giving you another surprise. The game and story is weird but I think it acutually makes sense within its own parameters.NEGATIVE- Short game (4 hours unless you get stuck)- Possibility of getting stuck if you can't figure out one clue or if you miss a clickable pixel- A little bit dated on the vide side (but still looks good)- Too weird for most gamersPOSITIVE- Very unique game and story- Immersive and almost interfaceless- Inventive and surprising tasks- Some puzzles are unique and really makes you think- Nice shifts between puzzles, storytelling and short action sequences- Artistic visuals and sound- You've never seen anything like this before			"

Disclaimer: I haven't read the book or watched the movie. This is a review based solely on my game experience.Short Verdict: A nice, short adventure game with a decent story going on. While it was a fun experience, it's too short and not that awesome to be worth its full price, which is low, by the way--US$ 4.36 (R$ 10,49) on Steam. If you have it already and you wanna play a quick adventure game, by all means, go for it. If you don't have it, I wouldn't spend much money on it. It's good, but nothing special. But don't play it for the story--do it only for the puzzles.Pros: The story is decent enough for the length of the game Good graphics if you consider when it was released (but nothing special, either) I enjoyed how the first-person view was implemented and how it makes you interact with the environment in this game The timed scenes are really thrilling Most puzzles were nice and set to a decent level of difficulty The world is fairly well-developed and so are the charactersCons: Way too short--beat it in less than 4 hours The story is a bit all over the place for those don't know anything about Nikopol Some puzzles are frustrating, especially the first timed ones, when you're still getting used to the game There are some illogical things in the game, like a barred door being magically opened minutes later (close to the end of the game) Some plot holes and weird things, like why would a dictator hold elections? Why is everyone doing what they're doing? Nothing makes much senseBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$ 0.36 (R$ 0,89). For this price, yeah, I'd probably buy it as a single game.			"

												Well, Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals is a short adventure game based on The Carnival of Immortals - or La Foire aux immortels, the first book of Enki Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy, a series of graphics novels that illustrates 2023 Paris as an incredibly dark political dystopia with science fiction elements. Aside Enki Bilal's genius in depicting the surreal and the grotesque in Nikopol series, this game is a heavily watered down version of the first book, from Nikopol Jr.'s perspective.It's year 2023. After two nuclear wars, countless political confrontations and casual genetic mutations, the world has become disease-ridden and post-apocalyptic. We take the silent, oblivious artist Nikopol Jr.'s perspective as puppeteered elections for the nation of Paris approaches. He is a silent romantic in a degenerate era. With the appearance of an odd spaceship in the form of an Egyptian pyramid on Paris astroport, Alcide Nikopol's life is about to change drastically.Before continuing with my review, I have to warn you: if you are to only play this game, without reading comics first, I suspect that you would be capable of understanding anything. As a stand-alone game, story presentation is mismatched and rushed. It is more than likely to complete the whole game without understanding anything about the affairs going around. The setting is not well-presented enough to capture the grotesque genius of the series and a great amount of characters, events, explanations are completely skipped in this bland interpretation. So if you've found the concept to your liking and got curious, drop the game and get yourself Nikopol Trilogy to enjoy an A+ quality creepy dystopia.Okay, now we've established the quality difference between graphic novels and the game, I'll focus on the game. Graphics might be considered beautiful in their own displays, and character animations are quite elegant. I especially liked the character designs for Egyptian characters - Horus and Anubis. Voice acting isn't marvelous, and the subtitles being nonexistent doesn't stand in the favor of the game either though.Well, when we talk about the gameplay, Nikopol has its list of downsides. Without the usage of a walkthrough, it is possible to miss an item and keep playing only to find that you cannot progress anymore due to the item not being available for you to grab anymore. On that department, I suggest saving a lot - which is another issue, with only 10 save slots given. Also, you are capable of dying in a handful of imaginative ways, considering that you are treated as a terrorist by the government from the start of your game. In that sense, no, this is not your casual point and click adventure. Puzzles are usually interesting and imaginative, and they demand prior attention to the storyline, so you have to keep certain facts at mind before trying to handle a puzzle. With the slightest mistake, you are prone to alarming security and getting shot down. Luckily, game restores your position before being shut down every time.As an adventure game, Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals isn't anything unique or even interesting, with its grander equivalents around. As an Enki Bilal interpretation, it could present you a brief smile if you are already familiar with his work. If not, go fetch the comic book. Only after reading the original work, if you could say that you are still curious, yeah, go ahead. Otherwise, the game won't mean anything to you.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												This game is based on a graphic novel, or a series of 3 graphic novels that later got compiled into one book called ""The Nikopol Trilogy""  written and illiustrated by a great French author named Enki Bilal. The art in the novel is what stands out the most and is a very dark, gritty,  and , industrial, steam-punk(architectural not the lame club scene), and is set in an alternate dystopian future where religions are now all powerful government parties and the ancient Egyptian gods themselves have returned to earth from space in a hovering pyramid spaceship. Despite being gods, with powers seemingly limited only by the imagination, they are still quite flawed sentient beings, who aregue and bicker and play board games to pass the time. They also require fossil fuels to power their spaceship and are stuck hovering over Paris. That is a basic run down of the story line for all you haters out there who ""don't get the story line.""         Secondly, there is also a pretty popular Sci-Fi film based on the Nikopol story called ""Immortal"" that came out in 2004. I remember watching it on the Sci-Fi channel a couple times and you can currently watch the full movie on YouTube. I highly recommend it. The movie was directed by the author of the graphic novel Enki Bilal and is actually quite a ground breaking movie in its own right. It revolutionized the art of mixing computer animation with live action. In this dystopian future there is heavy polution, and many people have become sick and prosthetic artificial body parts are not only required for most people, but it is a huge fad like plastic surgery gone haywire, and has become all the rage. So you see these real actors with computer generated parts and they had to film every scene twice exactly the same way. There are also aliens, who are ironically enough, treated just like illegal aliens and have to go through customs and immigration lol.       OK, so , on to the game. This was the first ""point and click adventure"" game I've ever really played, so it took some getting used to. The fact that this game is pretty closley based on the book and not the movie kept me pretty interested the whole time as it is stuff that happens to Nikopol inbetween the books. Yes the game is hard as hell and I did need a walkthrough on certain puzzles, but honestly, in a world where half the modern games are designed so  that a baboon could beat it on hard, it was a welcomed challenge. If you are used to point and click than you know what to expect. This game actually got me into more point and click adventure games such as Myst and a few others. If you are a fan of the movie Immortal(ad vitam) or the Nikopol Trilogy books than this game will blow your shorts off. If not and you kinda liked the crazy dark sci fi storyline, I highly recommend you check out all three.			"

												The game was... interesting. The story wasn't exactly bad, but i think you need to read the trilogy to fully understand it. I personally haven't and the story didn't make any sense at the start. The game has quite a lot of action for a point & click adventure game. With action i mean that someone might be following you etc. and you need to do bunch of puzzles or move around really quickly so they won't catch you. Puzzles were quite easy and the game was pretty short (Around 4-5 hours, probably a bit longer if you're new to the genre).			"

Some puzzles makes no sense, like it is hard to spot a piece of rock on the floor, while it is least obvious thing to look for to make progress.Game is short. It only makes longer if the player stuck at some puzzle for long hours. Luckily there are walkthrough videos on the net. If every puzzle in the head, i doubt the game lasts longer than 1 hour.Graphics are nice, music is awesome.Overall, buying it on discount makes worth playing it.			"

												I played it through the end, but I can't recommend it for everyone. Nikopol is an point and click adventure with prerendered backgrounds based on the Nikopol story by Enki Bilal. And to be honest that is it greatest plus, so if you've never heard of any of those two then you probably want to skip this game.<tl;dr>Pro:+ Nice Artwork, inspired by Enki Bilal+ References to his works+ Can be beaten in one evening (might want to consult a guide)Con:- Some very difficult puzzles- Timed events that result in your death if you're not quick enough- Generally not much instructions, more of a trial and error approach- Though this has not happend to me, players in the forum complained about situations where you run into a dead end, without the game telling you that.- No movement. You're in a fixed position, where you can rotate 360° and can interact with things and/or travel to the next screen.- No hotspots, making some things difficult to find (e.g. projector start button)Two final statements: Go read the comics/graphic novels and consider using a guide to play this game.

												Nikopol is just a weird point-and-click adventure. It was over before I could even wrap my head around what was going on, which was primarily the result of its bad story telling. It could have actually been something quite interesting, but it fails to deliver the necessary background and plot to offer it a fighting chance.Most of the puzzles are very simple. Some sequences must be completed within a certain amount of time so it's not a traditional casual adventure. Frequent deaths were annoying, but the well placed automatic save points didn't kill the overall enjoyment.The gameplay is fundamentally sound. Graphics are decent although it does only support letterbox aspect ratios so widescreen monitors end up displaying black borders on the sides. Overall, Nikopol is a mediocre adventure game, one I'd recommend passing up.			"

												Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals could've been a much better game if certain parts of it were changed.  The setting is pretty cool, a sci-fi version of Paris that is controlled by a dictator, but the story suffers due to the game's brevity.  It feels like one of those movies made from novels and ton of detail are left out in order to fit into a time constraint.  Additionally, while many of the puzzles are interesting, they also suffer from unnecessary object hunting that makes them more difficult then they have to be. Overall, the game is recommended only if you are interested in the setting and puzzles, but expect there to be a bit of frustration over game mechanics and a lot of head scratching over the sparse plot.

												I highly enjoyed Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals. The story, the atmosphere, the characters and the unique puzzles make it a few marks above your average point-and-click adventure game.I was lucky enough to have watched the movie (Immortal 2004) before playing, so I could appreciate the plot of this game. If you didn't like it, I would suggest that you rent (or likely buy it from your local bargain bin) and take an afternoon to watch it before trying to play this game to fully appreciate it.			"

												The secret is you need to read the comic or see the movie to have a clue what is going on.  The story in the game is not well told on its own, leaving a lot of questions and confusion by the end with half-told tales and rushed through reveals.  This isn't helped by the brevity of the game, which is going to be 4-5 hours for the average gamer.  For the gameplay itself, the core is made up around point-and-click puzzles to solve.  Some of these puzzles are frustrating pixel hunts that may depend on mousing over something near a corner of the floor rather than on being cleverly designed.  However, it isn't all bad.  Some of the puzzles do work well and make sense, even if they are overshadowed by the more frustrating experiences.  Also, the game looks great (for its time) and I especially appreciated the style of the cinematics which emulated the graphic novel (comic book) origins of the story / game.  On that note, while the game almost requires you to have read the comic or seen the movie to really understand everything going on, it does work well if you do have that knowledge and, especially, if you were a fan of that source material.  Overall, I would say that this game should be skipped by most, but if you are a diehard fan of point-and-clicks...especially futuristic, dystopian ones...or if you really enjoyed the source material (The Carnival of Immortals comic, or Immortal the movie) and wanted to play a sort of video game companion, then this actually may do just fine for you.

												First off, this is more about a 6 or 7 out of 10 and not a straight thumbs up.  Again, only play if you like the theme or Adventure games.The premise of this game is quite neat.  A dystopian Paris mixed with Blade Runner, Ancient Egypt, weird meta religions, totalitarism, and some old school 70s style flying vehicles.  Theme-wise this is my kind of game.  The story is based on the French graphic novel ""La Foire aux immortels"" [1980], which I have not read.At heart, it is a traditional FPS rails adventure game.  There is not a ton of pixel hunting (but there are couple hidden ones that are beyond aggravating).  Most of the puzzles are straightforward and not too difficult.  I would have loved to explore the areas in full 3D rather than being stuck to rails.  This was a failing ingredient that the studio White Birds (founded by Benoît Sokal) seemed to stick with for some reason.  There was plenty of 3D modeling in the game and it wasn't half bad but doing a rails adventure game in 2008 is such a bad idea and limits the potential of the title.The other negative was the voice acting.  The main character was fine but every single other voice was horrendous....detracted very much from the unique/weird story and presentation.  This was probably in part to the translation and inability of the studio to hire good English actors.Also, the game is way too short for a story that is so strange...it at least needs to be episodic.White Birds became defunct in 2011.  I think if they had adapted with the community, and market by leveraging existing 3D engines/tools and changed their delivery platform (e.g. episodes or parts) I think this could have been really awesome.  Otherwise, this is just a pretty good attempt but still misses the mark.			"

												Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals is definitely more enjoyable and understandable for those who are familiar with the graphic novels by Enki Bilal (The Nikopol Trilogy) and/or at least the movie (Immortal, 2004), because the game leaves a lot of things unexplained. However it brings to life quite interesting and gritty sci-fi world. Besides classic puzzles and pixel hunting adventure games are known for the game utilises timed sequences, where you need to think and act swiftly or face consequences (as to be killed or captured which ends the game). It features several cutscenes done in a style close to comic book storytelling - with bordered images, different angles of view and focuses. Music is quite good, voiceacting not as much and the game can be finished in like four hours, making it really a narrative quickie but still... it's nice. I would recommend it for fans or as an experiment for those who are not familiar with the source material but are curious enough and really likes adventures (grab it when discounted). Maybe you will get interested in the movie or books afterwards.			"

												Nikopol is another interesting title from Benoit Sokal creator of Amerzone and Syberia. This game is a first person point and click adventure done in the same style as Amerzone. Set in Paris of 2023 A.D. where the city is under marshal law and is being ""watched"" by a mysterious pyramid that floats above the sky. The length of the game isn't as long as the Syberia games, but you do get enjoyment out of the plot and the presence of the Egpytian gods. If you like the movies Brazil, Blade Runner, 1984, or Fifth Element, then this game is worth your time.			"

												This is a very, very short experience. Considering its point-and-click nature, I'd generally expect more out of an adventure game, an interesting story at the very least. Yet the most interesting parts of Nikopol are, a) the cinematography used in the cutscenes, and, b) the menu screen, one of the more unique implementations I've seen in recent memory.Few of the puzzles present in Nikopol are some of the most illogical I have come across, often requiring you to complete a sequence in a very specific way or you will either be forced to repeat the sequence from the beginning, or you will die.Yes, you can die in this game but there are no consequences, you will simply be placed back where you were before you made your mistake, with the protagonist remarking on the methods of their death at the continue screen, providing little clues. I died no less than five times within the first 30 minutes of play. I do not enjoy being thrust into an action sequence when I'm searching for the smallest, insignificant of clues to progress forward.Even though I'm fairly adept at puzzle games I did require a fair amount of assistance to complete certain ""logic"" puzzles. It really ruined the immersion.There's a myriad of typos and grammatical errors throughout the subtitles and in-game flyers. The voice acting was uninspiring and lacking any semblance of enthusiasm, although the original French version of the game may be more thrilling. The story was intriguing but the abrupt ending left me longing for more, I really wanted to know more about this alternate reality in which humanity exists oppressed in a Blade Runner-esque world.Actually, the ending felt extremely abrupt, there were many questions left unanswered by an unsatisfying and cheap conclusion. Apparently this game is based on a French film with a similar premise, I suppose I'll have to search for it to understand whatever little subtext was offered in Nikopol.			"

												Great game!  Story was real strange, and I like that, but it definitely felt like there was a lot more that went untold.  Makes me wan to buy the graphic novel!  The art in this game is unique in the best way.  I think I enjoyed looking at the scenery and the environments more than anything.  The puzzles were sometimes a bit crazy.  Not so illogical as sort of...hard to make sense of.  But it really forced you to put yourself in his shoes which is not the case in most adventure games I play.  You get the sense that you really are there.  Highly recommend, especially since it's just 5 bucks now!!			"

												Nikopol - SF Noir brimming with lifeFrom the creator of Syberia comes a darker but equally rewarding tale, based on the graphic novels trilogy by Enki Bilal. Visually, it is very atmospheric and convincing - a lot of creepy/scary moments fill this 5-6 hours long, unique dystopian vision of the future. The world and plot itself are very memorable, filled with interesting characters and immersive details.While being an adventure game, it is by no means a relaxing point & click experience. The player is constantly made aware of an imminent danger, be it an enemy lurking behind a corner, time running short or sheer ignorance of what is behind closed doors. Story-wise, be prepared for a bit of a supernatural deus ex machina. 'A bit' might be an understatement :)Definitely recommended if you like SF and mystery!V e r d i c t : GREAT, with some room for improvement			"

												Weird ♥♥♥♥. I'm not a fan of the first person perspective for point and click adventures if I can't move around freely. The character moves a screen at a time and then you click around on the still image. I guess it's like Myst in that regard. The story is just plain bizarre. Mutant alien cops chase you down. There's only a few locations total in the whole game and some of the solutions just make no sense at all. This one is for genre fans only, but might be worth the cost if you can get it on sale.			"

												A nice, if a bit short, adventure game. Based on Enki Bilal's Nikopol trilogy of graphic novels, the game focuses on Alcide Nikopol Jr in a sort of ""behind the scenes"" way. That is, the story of the game is intertwined with the story of the 1st GN and completes it in some ways. Also, you'll get the most out of the game if you read the GNs. The puzzles are mostly logical, if sometimes a bit complicated or less intuitive, but nothing you can't get past. And the whole environtment is well accomplished.

												Truely a wonderful ""point and click"" game, something most people do not take into acount. Of corse you can only compare this game to games like it, otherwise your critiquing is flawed. That idea should apply to all games and their respective genre. This game though had quality graphics, appropriate music, a very nice voicing, a nice detailed map, and a generalistic gameplay; not confusing at all. Above all I really enjoyed the story, i especially found it to be intersting anyways. The puzzles were very perplexing to me, but in the best way. I had to look up on some of them, but most enjoyably difficult, something hard to incoorperate sometimes in games. Overall i found this game very worth the $0.99 I payed for it and surely would have payed the $4.99 too. I recomend you get over the 68 metascore if that is conscerning you, sometimes peoples or critics opinions can be snide and uneducated.			"

												This game has decent graphics and good atmospherics, but that is all it has going for it. I am a big adventure game devotee, but this is among the worst games I have played in that genre.The puzzles are highly counter-intuitive and often require you to die before getting a hint of what you're supposed to do. Lethal trial and error may sound like impatience, but you have only seconds to figure it out before dying again, and again, and again... That could be excusable if the puzzles where enjoyable, but none of them where.There is an excessive amount of pixel hunting (that accounts for most of my playtime), further complicated by the fact that many object are only usable if you are holding an item, and some objects are only usable after a specific sequence of events, meaning you could have already gone over the area with a fine tooth comb and still missed the necessary object to escape.I can not recommend this game under any circumstances.

												Point-and-click adventure games and having to do things extremely quicky does not a good game make. Rather, it just makes it intensely frustrating because the idea of the genre is to explore and solve puzzles and that sort of thing, while this game decides instead to have some segment where you complete a repetitive series of click various objects right in front of you and if you don't do it fast enough you die and have to start the whole sequence again. That doesn't sound like the most horrible thing ever when I describe it, but it basically ends up being so annoying rather than fun that I just gave up there. And before that, the attempted puzzles are rather unintuitive. Use object A to do B before you can use object C to do D even though when you first encountered object C you can easily tell you're supposed to do D with it but it just arbitrarily stops you from doing that until you do B first and stuff like that also does not a good game make. Again, I probably misworded this review in a way that it doesn't sound like the worst adventure game ever, but it quite possibly is one of them.</rage>			"

They are rich in content, realistic, and set in the near future.  Progressing in this game - may it be frustrating at times - is addicting. To puzzle your way through that next barrier or console is such a rewarding task in itself, that this alone made the game worth playing through.

												This game is fairly short which is normally not a good thing.  However at the end of this game, I merely felt relief that it was over along with a small wtf at the bizarre closing soliloquy.  I found the puzzles to be mostly annoying:  trying to pixel hunt the one element in the room you can use while guards are beating down a door isn't much fun imho.  Most times I wound up replaying the scene over and over to try different combinations of inventory items or to find the interactive object in the room.  At least the game autosaves constantly so you don't have to re-do the entire level when you fail a puzzle.The story was ok, though by the end I didn't really care what happened-- I just wanted it to end.

												Sometimes you really want to give a game the benefit of the doubt. Created by the same company behind Syberia, this game is certainly style over substance, The presentation is certainly pleasing, with nice visuals, voice acting and music but the core of the game is lacklustre. Some puzzles lack any hint on how to complete them, and your left randomly trying things untill you eventually get the right answer.The main gripe however, must be directed at the story. If you have read the orignal Nikopol graphic novel, or have seen the movie based on it, then youll probably be ok here. If you havnt however, then you will be lost pretty fast in whats going on. There was something going on with your father, Egyptian gods, a floating pyramid and giant jellyfish.Answers on a postcard, avoid.			"

												Interesting scifi story, reminds Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ works, but sadly the game design has lot's of flaws, there are no hotspots for objects that you can use and sometimes they look like being part of the backround, so you have to do lot's of pixel hunting. There are lot's of timed puzzles and the game let's you continue to play even if you forgot to take or do something important, so that it will lead to dead end later on, so you need to save often, just like in the old Sierra adventure games. Soundtrack is good ambient that fits to the game, it's like Deus Ex's soundtrack.If it was designed little better I would reccommend this, it's enjoyable if you use little bit walkthrough here and there, but without walkthrough it's just frustrating pixel hunting.

												The overall graphical presentation, general environment, and artwork are very well done and interesting to look at. The plot and storyline are intriguing and engaging, set in a dystopian science fiction far future. Even the voice acting is okay. Sadly, those are the only positive aspects of Nikopol. In this point and click adventure game, you should expect terrible pixel hunting, as well as puzzles that are quite unintuitive and will certainly require hints or walkthroughs to make any progress. Worst of all, is that if you do not pick up certain items in various rooms in order, or perform certain actions in a specific order, you will need to reload a saved game and do many portions of the game over. The focus on tiny details and prearranged orderly functions make for an irrational, boring, and forcefully repetitive experience that was not even present during the late 80s and early 90s of the genre's era. In order for you to understand which action takes precedence over others requires a walkthrough. It is a must. There is no other way to approach this game whatsoever. For the developers to think that this game design decision was appropriate is an absolute disaster, and should serve as an example for others to never follow. In addition, there are several events that are timed, and require the player to perform some actions quickly, and if they do not possess certain items that were left behind in other rooms, there is simply nothing that could be done except for reloading and starting over. The save system is another serious stumbling block. You are not allowed to quick save. Instead, ""saving"" only saves your last checkpoint. This means that because of how flawed the overall design is, if you miss an item in a previous room, and find yourself farther in an area without it, there is nothing you could do except restart from the last checkpoint. You cannot walk back and correct the problem. You must restart and do it all over again. Needless to say, the only way you will know that you are stuck besides not being able to execute any useful actions for a prolonged period of time, is a walkthrough. There are no other options. The game fails horribly at providing hints, or doing anything remotely resembling intuitive reasoning. It is a truly broken point and click adventure game that has no place in the genre, or in the professional field of game design. Nikopol is an enormous waste of beautiful artwork and a riveting storyline. It is a technical and developmental malpractice of the worst kind.Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals is awful.			"

												Nikopol feels more like a demo than an actual finished game. I can just imagine someone using this to get funding for further development from a publisher ...The premise was nice enough: A theocratic dictatorship (based in Paris?!?), aliens, a conspiracy, a sprincle of Ancient Egyptian mythology, what's not to like?Graphics & sound are mediocre at best and a bit amateurish at worst, the fixed points-of-view feel dated.The puzzles are computerised versions of what you might find in a monthly puzzle magazine.There's lots of short time-limited sequences where you can die and do them all over again. Not fun.This is one short game, I clocked in at 4.5 hours, apparently and that's with all the dying and fiddling to get Steam streaming to work. This in itself isn't the problem, it's the fact that it doesn't have an ending or even a middle. It just begins ... and then it's over and you sit there wondering what the point was.As a completionist pack-rat point-and-click fan, I still wouldn't recommend this if you got it for free.			"

Nothing made any sense, and not in a fun, quirky way.Gameplay was loaded with odd puzzles and ""pixel ♥♥♥♥♥ing"" searches.Overall, not an enjoyable story or game.			"

												The main problem with Nikopol is its puzzles: many problems are either illogical (film cannot be projected onto a white wall, only onto a screen), or require the player to find a needle in a haystack (or rather a particular small rock in a pile of other identical looking rocks). While the first is merely frustrating, the later requires scanning the environment pixel by pixel for no good reason. The story makes equally little sense and makes you feel like you started playing from the middle. The game’s graphics, sound, and controls were decent, at least, so it is not all bad.			"

												It's quite short and the ending doesn't really wrap up anything. The gameplay wasn't too bad, a lot of people who played the game felt the action moments were stupid, but I didn't mind them. Though it was a bit tedious (not only because the mouse was twitchy at times) because of some rather ridiculous puzzles. Some neat ideas though. 6/10			"

												I bought this game because I am a big fan of the movie, as well as Egyptian mythology. I was able to play this with no problems using my 360 controller and Controller Companion. The graphics are excellent, I love how you can look 360 degrees in any direction, the environments are very detailed and imaginative, and the story kept with the original tone of the movie. I did find the game to be a bit short, I completed it over the course of 2 days, and the ending was slightly dissatisfying, however, all in all, a well made game with a lot to offer! I hope that we can look forweard to more along the same lines from this studio!			"

												The story just makes no sense, because there is not really a story. You have to do some things and have to go somewhere, but even without really knowing why. The puzzles are seomtimes really hard, because there is no logic, or maybe it is the wrong translation. For example the puzzle with the stones on the ground and the pictures on the wall. The hint says, the serpent has to be on the far away left wall. But it has to be on the nearest left wall. Some puzzles are just some ""random-and-wild-klick"" - puzzles and I really don't like them. I am glad, that I bought that game in a package with Syberia and Nostradamus for about 8 bugs, because the other games are very good and really worth the money. But Nikopol: SOTI is just crap. I don't want to get this for a gift. I am glad, that I just need about 4 hours to play through this.			"

												It's okay. It's not a great adventure game but it's not horrible either. I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit too short.

												This game is good...but too short. I enjoyed the graphics and the controls were good...the puzzles were logical and fun...no major complaints other than I felt the game's storyline was lacking depth, and as a result that contributed to the shortness of the game. This game could've, and should've been more in depth and longer...the weak ending came too fast and was somewhat abrupt. Having said that...all in all, I was satified with it...to be quite honest that was due to the fact I got the game for under $2...I would be extremely disappointed had I spent more than that for such a short game.

												This game is probably the most accessible adaptation plot-wise, between itself, the film, and the original graphic novel. Heck, if you can ignore the other works and just ""roll with it"" when the plot unfolds, you'll be in for an interesting time. It's a short game, but doesn't overstay its welcome. It has the usual problems most P&C adventure games to where, the puzzles range anywhere between ""dead simple"" to ""pretty tough"" to ""how the hell does this even make any sense?"" Most importantly, this game frequently goes on sale during the Steam Sales, and frequently for around a dollar. If you're itching for a new adventure, give this one a try.			"
