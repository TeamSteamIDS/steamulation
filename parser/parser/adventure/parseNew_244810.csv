												TL;DR: Fun co-op, great presentation, but shallow gameplay and a short campaign not worth multiple playthroughs.The presentation of the game is without a doubt its best feature: the backgrounds are shifted by stage hands, extras in costume pretend to be werewolves, and every object earned or lore page unlocked has flavorful text included.  The set pieces are wonderful, and you'll find yourself chuckling at the background gags or soaking in the atmospheric cutouts of spooky castles and ancient pyramids.It's a pretty standard beat-em-up with a token leveling system in place that grants you more moves, though you might not find the advanced skills as useful as your basic starting countestrikes.  This game's mastery is based around countering your enemy's moves when they telegraph them, and its very satisfying to contunually float when you are able to chain multiple air grabs off of different enemies.Unfortunately strategies for the levels and bosses are pretty basic, and when you've seen the same lines of text many times in order to get a level's achievements, the story's charm starts wearing thin.  Co-op mode is definitely the way to go, as single player becomes repetitive quickly.  The game is great for a playthrough with a buddy, but is probably too shallow to make getting all of the achievements much fun.			"

												The brawler genre, simple as it may be, is one of my very favorites -- I include Scott Pilgrim and Castle Crashers when discussing my favorites games. So, I was predictably excited to pick up Foul Play upon its release. The art style looks fantastic and the presentation (while gimmicky at first) is fresh and creative.Unfortunately, the gameplay is pretty shallow. Granted, the brawler genre is not known for its depth of gameplay, but, after running through the first few levels, I can legitimately say that simply mashing buttons is a viable, if not more effective strategy to defeating enemies. While it's amusing enough to try to string together juggles and combos, knowing that I could be blindly smashing keys to accomplish the very same thing diminishes any sense of reward or accomplishment I could have attained.I really wanted to like this game; it's cool looking, kitchsy, and charming. Ultimately, though, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Maybe when it drops to around $2.50, it might be worth purchasing. At the time of writing, however, it's sitting at $7.49 during the 2013 Winter Sale. So, this brawler fan must give Foul Play a thumbs down.			"

												This game is just awesome. Amazing hand crafted art, a large variety of combos, and a main character who looks just like the Pringles guy. The game play is fast, intuitive and never really gets boring.The idea of an on-stage brawler alone is pretty genius, seeing the audiences reaction to your on-screen action is bloody awesome. The game is quite easy since I only actually ran into trouble on the last boss of episode 5, I hadn't ""died"" before then.The time it takes to finish is probably just about right for a game of this style, I wasn't getting bored towards the end, I just think that one more episode would of been a bit too much.I'd definitely recommend anyone stick this one on their wish-list to pick up in the up coming sale.

												Foul Play.Let me tell you here and now, there's nothing foul about this title. In fact, it strenghtens my love for indie developers more than big publishers, developers, whatever. Devolver does it again. After Shadow Warrior being recommended by quite a few people and Serious Sam 3, which despite its flaws did provide me with quite some good entertainment, I got my hands on Foul Play.What I love about indie games is the fact that from time to time you get a game that may look like something familiar but then it throws a twist and after just a few minutes of game time you realize that there's nothing quite like it.On with the first impression shall we?Gameplay wise, despite it obviously being built with a controller in mind, keyboard works quite well. The controls are responsive and you really don't feel at a loss. That being said I don't doubt it's better with a controller.The game is presented as a standard side-scrolling brawler with combos, unlockables, skills, perks in the form of charms and so on. Nothing special about that you would think but you would be wrong.The art style is what sets it apart from any other game out there. The whole story unravels on stage. And no, I'm not kidding. You and your partner, the game featuring 2 player coop, are actors reenacting a story from a journal that you get to unlock page by page as the story progresses. As such, you always see the spectators, sometimes with a special request, the background scenery being changed and from time to time you catch the actors off-guard or even the janitor at his best.The point of each performance is to get the highest score by getting big combos, doing the above-mentioned special requests and of course by not getting hit. What's more interesting is the fact that you can't die. All you have to worry about is the quality of your performance, trying to fill the always present meter and amaze the crowd allowing you to do even more impressive stunts as a reward.I hate to finish in a negative manner but I do have some cons to point out. First off, the graphics settings are not there. That I didn't find too bad but, the game doesn't feature 16:10 resolutions. The second and last con would be the fact that the game being created with a controller in mind, all the instructions for let's say combos and controls are only pointed out for the controller even if you are using a keyboard. It's not big of a deal since the game uses 10-12 keys including WASD but a con is a con.At the end of this, the verdict would be a 9/10 the above mentioned not being able to affect my experience with the game so far in a such a manner that it fails to provide what you would expect from it. My advice? If you're into old-school sidescrolling brawlers bought into the 21st century this is a must. You could do far worse with 14.99,you could get Call of Duty: Ghosts...			"

												My my, glad I got this - a very funny platformer.If you have previously played Castle Crasher, this game is similar but more action-oriented.So what, we control a character that's supposed to perform a... foul play. While we're performing our play on the stages, we move forward, beating enemies and pleasing our audiences with good performance. The campaign is divided into five acts, each acts have five levels, each levels is approx ten-fifteen minutes long, a bit longer if you're into boss battles. The objective is simple, you just need to beat each enemy waves with style - be it by performing chain combos to fill and maintain the meter gauge (audiences' mood). Don't let it get too low or the curtain will close and game over. A bit lacking aspect, though, is that the campaign is incredibly linear - you have no option to do anything else and can only follow the direction the game wishes you to. You can, however, replay earlier stages from main menu to achieve higher scores.The combat mechanic is very simple, chaining normal and powerful attacks while deflecting the enemies or throw them against each others. And this what differentiates from Castle Crasher, it offers more lively battles and flexible ala Devil May Cry DMC but in 2D. By chaining you'll be increasing your scores and earns stars that'll be calculated at the end of each level. As you progress, you'll unlock more abilities/perks to use in game. Use these to... chain more enemies. Heh.And of course, playing coop is much more fun than alone. It's hilarious, really, to have a messed up battle on the stages.Graphic wise I'm incredibly amused. It really is that great - suitable for this game - colorful and innately bunch sense of humor drawn into the art and character designs. Special effects don't distract you from the battles and carefully blend with the stages, movement and attack animations are not sluggish and feel natural. FPS throughout the level is stable enough even during chaotic battle.  Some minus points though, there are no deep customizations like AA or refresh rate and some commonly supported resolutions are not supported. But overall, I'd say the job well done. And lastly, controller support is great - and I expect it so much because this is a platformer. I wouldn't even give the game a damn great review if it had poor support, but this Foul Play is just apt at adapting controller support. Dinput and Xinput are both supported, moreover each buttons can be customized in game. No complaints from me on this aspect really.Funny thing is, metacritic user score gives this 69/100. Don't listen - it deserves more. A recommended game from me.			"

We have a lot of fun doing our own voice acting for the scenes, really getting in to the spirit of the theme and experiencing it all play out. Fantastic fun game, buy it!

												Foul Play is an original beat 'em up game where you fight for an audience. The story is told like it's a play so you're actually fighting actors in suits. The better you fight the more impressed your audience will be. Impress them enough to gain more stars and to level up, unlocking charms (which grant bonuses) and new moves (those are also fun for replaying levels). It's a charming game, with pretty graphics and enough detail in the characters. Movements could use some work though. Sometimes they're a bit limited, so it makes the game look cheap. Voice overs are nowhere to be seen, except for a few 'hey's' and 'oh's', things like that.The music also didn't impress, because I can't remember if there even was music in it in the first place, and if so, if it was any good.Foul Play is an impressive little game nevertheless and should be played if you're into beat 'em ups or if you have a lot of time on your hands (in my opinion, it's more fun to play in 30 minute sessions).[Rating: 71/100]			"

												What you have stumbled upon, Gentlemen, is a most nefarious plot of chivalry and woe, fit only for a stage whose grandeur  and acoustics are rivaled only by the spectacle that will unfold within it. Speaking of spectacles, your monocle'd mainstay, Baron Dashforth, will awe you with athleticism, respire you with reveries, jaunt you with jocoseness...well you must understand by now, chap. The ballast of the Act teeters precariously, as unfathomable daemons, a clumsy custodian, and ghastly ghouls will relentlessly chase the utter annihilation of the prodigious protaginist.

The main campaign is short but fair for what you pay, and you always have the replay value of revisiting earlier levels to improve your scores and target missed objectives. Recommended. 7.5/10			"

												This game looked really fun. It was recommended because I was playing castle crashers and I love castle crashers. So I was kind of looking forward to playing this game. I played it with my best friend when he came over. We played around the first 2 missions trying to make it as fun as we can with combos and voicing over the characters but we both realized something after the 2nd mission. It was really repetitive. all you really do is go around the screen and punch people around in the same environment. No power ups, lives, extra moves  just punching the same people around the same environment for that level. This was a really big disappointment for me. The game play is there it's just I can't recomend it.			"

												I have a story about this game. Be kind and read it.Me and my friend bought it when it was on sale, 2 years ago, at a school night. We played it for 40 min or so and we had to go to sleep. We never played again until this day, but we never stopped making jokes related to the game and we never forgot about this awesome game. This game poped up to our minds every now and then but we didn't continue to play it, we just played it again after 2 whole YEARS not playing it, not only we remembered the story line, we had fun. We will never forget this game, it changed our lives.So you ask me if I recommend this game, I do, I do.Thank you developers, thank you...			"

												Foul Play is a very enjoyable beat 'em up side-scrolling game. You take control of baron Dashford, a daemon hunter, and are the lead character in a stage play. The story, in which you search for your long lost father, takes you to exotic places and confronts you with all kind of supernatural beings. Depending on your performance you receive direct feedback from the audience. A high number of combo hits will earn you enthusiastic applause while low combos and taking hits will lead to booing.Pros: - good story - simple but rewarding fight controls - few combos, so you don't have to memorize tons of key combinations - good music - strong British atmosphere of Victorian times - addictive - funny at times - coop - you can improve your fighting skills by collecting talismansCons: - some players report game crashes. After running fine for two weeks the game started crashing on me too. It took me a while to figure out that it was related to Plays.tv. The game has issues with some overlay programs.			"

												All the world's a stage...  In this frantic 2-d button-mashing-tastic brawler game with Mr. Pringle and his rogue-like sidekick with a black bandana you go around kick baddies' butts castle crasher style! It can indeed become very repetitive were it not for the clever yet amusing character dialogues/monologues plus ability to deck out your character with special charms unlocked only via challenges presented in most scenes per act.  The challenges themselves can be quite difficult to achieve ranging anywhere from as simple as perform a flawless scene to reaching as high as x200 hit combo in a scenario.  Charms equippe grant special abilities such as giving you extra combo stacks after a successful parry of enemy attack or increase duration until combo wears off under which you must start accumulating them all over again.  Grinding out high combo stack can boost audience mood drastically and also bring you high score multipliers--activating showstopper effect can accelerate this effect and help you reach high stacks faster but cannot be activated too frequently.  Efficiency requires timing the activation at favourable windows of opportunity to facilitate earning high combos and score.Very good game overall if you fancy castle crasher style gameplay, albeit solo most of the time--online multiplayer is dead.  Despite the lack of a live online community, you can always grab your trusty fellow sidekick to deliver the performance of a century in local co-op action.			"

												Foul play imo should be given 6 out of 10. I haven't complete it yet but basically I got the entire idea. It is classic beat'em style game and fun to play with firend online or locally. It is well done in visual aspect, the soundtracks are good, and the gameplay is decent. For 15 bucks, it may not be worth that much but with 75% off sale, I have to say, it is worth that price. However, being worth 3 or 4 bucks doesn't mean it is flawless. Here come the some flaw.1. Maybe or not, the later levels doesn't introduce many new features. It lacks variation. Sometimes you probably feel that enemies are just the same but with different apparences. That is not variation which needs new strategies. It becomes repetitive sooner or later. 2. Movement/action delay. You will feel sometimes character take too much time on one movement and you have to wait until the movement is finished. Otherwise, you can't do anything during that process. This concept is acceptable however, when you jump too high in the air doing combos, if you miss the target or enemies, they fall on the ground before you do, then your combos are simpy break because when you are doing combos in the air, you have 1. combo attack, 2. stay in the air process to finish. It takes too long for you to get back to ground to continue the combo. So to complete the challenges like 100 combos are really hard since it is easier that movement delay breaks combo. 3. I was really tired playing this game. Confronting multiple enemies, sometimes time limits, and movement delay as I said above are the reasons that you constantly typing buttons. It either kills your index and middle fingers when using a keyboard or kills your thumbs when using a controller. It becomes a button masher.4. I still don't understand how your health point is calculated...None of the indicators on the top screen are clear for me. I just don't get it... "

Other games are intelligent enough to list the moves in ""space"" ""shift"" etc.One major annoyance. In Play 3 game crashed to desktop and after I restarted it all my progress was wiped.

There is almost no problem with latency and the built in voice chat is a joy to play with, because you can laugh, joke and curse at your fellow player as you put the fear of Dashfort into your foes. Furthermore, the art style is absolutely marvelous, with a charm and humour that only heightened my enjoyment. The narrative ties it all together, with a nice build up throughout the story that is ended by a finale that is both awesome and funny.So in short, buy this game, if only for the amazing aesthetic.

The cheers and encouragements of the crowd encouraging you to preform well, and the comic and playful script always gave me a laugh, from Bearicons to automated messages this game was clever, original and perfect.

												Foul Play is a great brawler, best played in co-op mode, that takes about 4h to finish. There is no life bar, and you cannot die in this game, the player performs to amuse the audience and complete a different set of challenges each level, in order to unlock different abilities and charms (items that provide bonus stats).Sometimes, I encountered a few game breaking bugs(2-3 times), and had to restart the level, one such bug occurred during the final boss battle, right before the final hit.Even though the game has the already mentioned problems, it's still great and a lot of fun to play, especially in co-op mode.

A spirited performance, but a relatively short oneFoul Play is a side-scrolling brawler. Nothing very original there, but the charm of the game lies in its presentation. The game is presented as a recounting of the past exploits of its main character, Baron Sebastian Dashforth (aided by his plucky sidekick, Scampwick Steerpike), performed by the pair on a Victorian stage. The setting & overall presentation is one of the game’s two major strengths. Its other strength is the unique way Foul Play handles its gameplay; you don’t have a health bar. Instead, your goal is to please your audience, which you do by stringing together combos against your enemies, which range from frill-wearing vampires to robed cultists and many more besides. Take a hit or fail to land a blow against someone for a period of time and your audience’s mood will drop, as indicated by a meter at the top of the screen. If it hits rock bottom, you’ll have to start the act again. There’s also a level up system, which unlocks new fighting moves each time you reach a new level.Unfortunately, for all its neat presentation, Foul Play is still a beat em up, and is therefore subject to the same limitations as most of the other examples of the genre, namely repetitive action & a fairly short length. There are 4 ‘acts’ each containing four regular levels and a multi-phase boss fight, plus a final act featuring the last two stages, for a grand total of 22 levels, but even with all that content you should be able to finish the game in 5-6 hours, and that’s assuming you don’t have to replay any of the acts. The developers also included a number of challenges in each of the regular acts. These challenges can be anything from ‘Get a 50 hit combo during this battle’ to ‘stop the enemies from killing these innocent extras’ to ‘Use this move successfully x times during this act’. Completing all the challenges in a particular act rewards you with a Charm, which provides you with a boost of some kind. You can equip up to 2 Charms before tackling each act, and they prove to be quite handy, especially in the later parts of the game. The game also boasts a 2 player mode, with one person playing as Dashforth & the other taking control of Scampwick. Co-Op can be played both local & multi, but I cannot comment on whether co-op mode is any good or if the netplay was stable or not as this was purely a single player experience for me, so please bear that in mind.Overall, Foul Play is a good attempt to take a well-established genre and put its own stamp on it. I’d recommend this game to fans of the side-scrolling beat em up but given it’s short length it might be worth waiting for it to go on sale before you pull back the curtain.			"

												Foul Play...Right away I need to say that this game is just AMAZING!The objective of the game is to make the crowd happy, and while doing so you're fighting monsters/actors. Graphics of the game are really good. This game also has an option to play with a controller + co-op. I almost got every achievement available in 7H. Once I finished the game I was actually ready to continue, the lvl system makes it so even if you don't get all the stars in the specified lvl you can go back to and get them all.Here's my summary of it.Gameplay - 8/10 (Could have been longer, but still nontheless a good game)Story - 10/10 (While playing the story after every chapter it leaves you guessing what will be next)Graphics - 10/10 (For the content it offers it's really amazing)Controls - 6/10 (Even though it offers controller support, the buttons on the keyboard could have been placed better)Would I recommend this game? Yes, definitely. All in all I would give this game a 9/10!			"

This game is far more complex gaming and story wise than you would expect. The best aspect of this game is the co-op.

												Yeah the idea is fun and I am sure co-op is great (I have not tried co-op), but the core mechanic gets awfully boring after about an hour. I went about 2/3 of the way through the game by myself and refuse to continue on. The idea is great - having the audience and theatrical backgrounds, but this concept is not enough to carry the whole game alone. Fighting mecahnics are solid, but there is simply not enough variety here. This might be worth perhaps $5 at best.			"

												What a fun, creative way to take on the classic side-scrolling brawl fest! Love the design, with the stage-setting and the semi-Victorian motif the visuals are just absolutely my cup of tea. For me, the gameplay mostly involved lots of button-mashing which is how I play every fighting game ever, but the idea of your performance skills being the main criteria for success makes this game something unique. Co-op is entertaining, and each stage is short enough that you don't feel obligated to spend hours on a single session. All in all, a different and welcoming take on the genre.			"

												Hey!  You you like Castle Crashers?  Do you like games with really unique premises and art styles?  Then get Foul Play!Foul Play plays out like the best of the side-scrolling brawlers of yesterday and today.  Anyone who's played Castle Crashers or the Scott Pilgrim game will feel right at home.  The key difference here is the atmosphere and art style.The entire game plays out on one huge stage, with all of the characters being actors in a play.  When defeated, enemies will crawl offstage once the spotlight leaves them.  The scenery moves around between stages, complete with stage crew running back and forth.  The audience will respond to your performance, complete with heckling for poor fighting.  All in all, this is a solid game all-around, and highly recommended.			"

												This game's a good pallette cleanser. It's sharp, fun, and a somewhat unique brawler. It's not that challenging (unless you're going for 100% completion, in that case you have your work cut out for you) but still manages to be entertaining without feeling like a drag in the process. Plus you can play with a friend which is always a pleasure if you like that sort of thing, the game's entirely possible with just one person. Unfortunately it just manages to be slightly above average, there's only one real annoying segment in the game with the gargoyles, everything else plays well but doesn't bring home a lot to really brag to your friends about.If you're looking for a multiplayer brawler with an epic scale and some unpredictablity, Castle Crashers might be more your speed. If you're looking for something a little more dialed back but with more dynamic combos, Foul Play is certainly worth your time and money.			"

												While Foul Play is a fresh concept with some unique aspects, it fails to execute completely.  The first hour was fun, it initially drew me in with some cool artworks, funny moments, cheerful audience, and some nice combos, that was the only pros for this game, otherwise, it's painful.The gameplay is very repetitive and shallow, there is no progressive system unless you want to count some new useless new combos as progressive, I couldn’t feel rewarded at all.It’s extremely easy, you can beat the game without dying once, the difficulty comes from the three challenges each act gives you, most of them are tedious, you have to beat the three challenges to get some charm (useless perk), for example why can’t I be rewarded if let’s say I finished two out of the three challenges in each act?There is another major problem with this one, the enemies have a ridiculous amount of HP for no obvious benefit other than more button mashing, it seriously hurts my thumb, and there is no strategy in it, just to make a longer gameplay time but a very boring and annoying one.It took me around 4 hours to reach the final boss (which I didn’t bother to beat because of the ridiculous HP with no fun at all), I could have beaten this game in less than two hours if the HP was of a normal level, I don’t recommend this game, it’s at most a painful 3 out of 10.

												Beat it in one sitting with a friend, took about 4 hours. Really good game id say! Got it for 2$ on sale, and was definetly worth it. At the beginning it sort of feels just like a typical beat em up side scroller, but by the  end of the first act I found I started getting into the characters and plot. Its not to long, so definetly worth the time. Its a really good play, would be awesome if it were made into a real play somehow! But the show must go on, Scampwick!(Encore, encore!)Anyway, combat feels dull at first, but as you unlock more moves and attacks it becomes better. Definetly more fun with 2 people, although getting insane combos would be much easier solo. The levels are interesting and fun, game runs smooth, pick it up if you like this genre! Game could have benefitted from different weapons, something like castle crashers, but also isnt really long enough to require it.8/10			"

												Very boring beat-em-up. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like you can just lunge enemies in the air and combo them and that's the entire game. I'm not even sure if you can die, it hasn't happened yet and I'm not sure if I see a health bar.Go figure this is one of the beat-em-ups with online co-op.The graphics style is nice, reminds me of Paper Mario TTYD where you're infront of a stage. All the creatures are just costumed people. When you fight floating furnitures (Dracula style), it's just people wearing black moving the furnitures around. As nice as this is, it's really uninteresting.It's not a bad game, but just so boring.			"

The moves are fun to do. I take great joy in pretending to murder these bad men and creatures. A downside is, is that if you do not like to beat them up, then this would really be not a good game at all, but boy howdy I love to bring the pain. You can make really good combos and it's too easy to get a combo that is a higher number than the dollars in my bank account. 4/4, highly recommend.			"

												WARNING - I edited this review after it was pointed out that i missed some things in the game (I thought there was DLC, and didn't realize there was a leveling system). So consider this to be not a very accurate review, unless you are visually impared.So this is a side scrolling brawler, similar to castle crashers, with a fun combo mechanic. The art style is the most special thing about this game though, the whole game is presented like a play with an infinite stage. Also playing with a friend is alot more fun. Other than that though, there is a leveling up mechanic (that i missed completely), and the game is just a little too short. That said i did get it for like 90 cents, so its not bad if you just want to have a bit of mindless fun with someone. It will probably feel a little lacking if you spent more cash on this.NOTE - if you are visually impared, tracking your position in each level maybe a little tricky due to the art style and contrast. Also the story is told with text bubble dialogue, though you can take time to read  them (they require button prompts to progress). Also some things like the leveling system and level challenges maybe missed completely. Personally i did not know they existed until another user pointed it out to me.			"

												I wanted to like the game, as it looked unique and fun but still seemed to have that brawly aspect of so many games I love. However, the game is both tedious and shallow. As someone else said, you can just spam mash buttons and do just fine, and there really isn't a level above that. It looks cool, but thats all it has going for it. The tediousness comes in when you're getting a combo and an enemy randomly moves a pixel too far, and the combo drops from about 1 second of inactivity. Pretty irritating. The last of the game's issues that I noticed are that it thinks that 'difficult' means spamming even more enemies. Perhaps I treasure difficulty too much in games, but I think you should actually be able to die in a fighting game. The mechanic of pleasing the crowd is cute, but it also acts as your health bar in a way—which would be fine if you didn't have a near-constant free super-please steroid. It'd be nice if there was more variety of enemies and gameplay in the acts. In what I played, it was very repetetive.The game is 1-dimensional and its not even a good one.			"

												Oh England...... Honestly I haven't played much of this game but it has already won me over. This is the best side scrolling fighter I have played in a long time. Heck I'd say the last time I had this much fun with this kind of game was back when I was playing streets of rage 3 as a kid.			"

												<i>What is it and is it any good?<i>Foul Play is a classic sidescrolling brawler, where the life of Baron Dashforth is enacted by himself in a theatre by beating up actors, dressed as vampires and demons. It is a short, button-mashing quirky indie game, which I'd rate at <b>8/10</b>.<i> Music, sound, stuff you hear</i>Besides a few grunts, there isn't much voiceacting (this is no AAA title, if Sir or Madam would kindly remember). Sound effects are fitting. Yours truly really did find the music to be most fitting and rather pleasing.<i> Story, characters, setting, visual presentation</i>Baron Dashforth and his trusty sidekick/apprentice/coworker are demon hunters and real gentlemen in London around 1910. The game takes place in a theatre, where the Baron himself reenacts his life by beating up actors. Most stages feature some kind of visual theartre joke, like one of the stage hands forgetting to leave on time. Of course the Baron speaks like a real gentleman would (which I can not emulate, please accept my deepest apologies). It is drawn in an unique style. To sum it up: They have created an original setting, which fits the game very well and is enjoyable. The story even has a twist.<i> Controls, Gameplay </i>I played the game using the Xbox controller, and it worked perfectly. (I did not try anything else). You have to buttons to attack, one to jump, one to parry (more on that in a moment), one to dodge. A button is used to activate the combo-boost and one for special attacks you learn later.Parrying is a rather defining gameplay element besides the off-the-mill brawling. When enemies attack you, they do telegraph it, so you can parry by simply pressing one button, there is no tricky timing or anything fancy. This you can use to start your own attack and control the flow of the battle, so it is not reduced to button mashing. In the course of the game you learn different attacks, many tie into the parrying. The healthmeter is in fact the approval of the audience: They cheer if you beat up zombies and gargoyles, but boo when you get hit. Combos increase their approval and your score. Also there are charms you can equip, which make combos easier or dying more difficult etc.<i> Gamelength, replayability </i>If you would kindly remember, this is no AAA title. I played the game for about 8h, and have seen every stage, level, enemy and attack. There are special tasks to complete in every level, a couple charms and background story to unlock etc, so there is reason to come back - if beating actors dressed as gargoyles wearing a top hat is not enough for you.<i> Anything to add, before the final bow? </i>As I said in the beginning, I would rate the game at 8/10. It is fun, probably even funnier in multiplayer, and the setting is very well crafted. Also I'd like to compliment the fine ladies and gentlemen of Devolver on making a great game about beating up people, without blood, extreme violence or humor based on extreme violance. I am looking forward to an encore.			"

												I don't really enjoy this game. It's an interesting game, an original point of view of beat'em up.But I feel controls clunky and not responsive. It's hard to make combos because you must be exactly in line with enemies, by the time you reach another enemy the combo is gone. And it's very repetitive, it seems you are fighting the same guys over and over. Different sprites, but the same combat, slash slash, slash, vertical slash, stomp, and some counter grapples. "

												The story and art is neat and original, but unfortunately the most important part - the gameplay - is boring.  You basically move from screen-to-screen mashing buttons to beat up the same enemies over and over again.Even though we bought this game at full price (which usually means we'll force ourselves to play it longer than a game we got 90% off, just to justify the price), we couldn't play it for more than an hour.

												After 45 mins of gameplay all I can say is: ""I'M BLOODY BORED!""At first it's quite original, a theater setting, a cool combo system that makes you press buttons like mad. But... DAMN! all I've seen so far is 3 attack moves: A normal attack, a heavy attack and a counterattack. THAT'S IT! After knocking out the same enemies over and over with the same attacks for some time I couldn't take it anymore. There are way better (and cheaper) games of this genere *COUGH*CASTLECRASHERS*COUGH*.

												Looks like an interesting Castle Crashers clone from the outside, but realistically there's nothing inside. I played an hour or so offline and I can't bring myself to finish the game. I tried playing a multiplayer game but online doesn't work, or there isn't enough people playing. You just mindlessly mash buttons and sometimes switch to another button. I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of this genre, however I enjoyed Castle Crashers, I respected it's humour, and it has much more content and replayability, with up to 4 people. There is no humour in this game, other than the combat is a joke. I see no difference as I progress through the levels, and the enemies are pretty much the same everytime. I am fully aware of the genre, but even for the genre it's below average. I cannot recommend this game, especially when it's £10.The art style is cool, the music compliments the experience, and the idea that you're in a play/theatre is actually really interesting and unique. However, if I was in the audience, I would have left after the first 5 minutes.			"

												The combat feels rather bland compared to many beat-em-ups.Even with a parry system (awesome in beat-em-ups, more games should follow this example!) your attacks don't feel like they have much strategy or weight behind them.You just continually press X, Y and occasionally B until enemies die.

												okay, a little bit of background: i know of Mediatonic from when i had a PSP. very few games on that console held my attention (i only ever finished like one), but Mediatonic's PSP minis were a ton of fun. i played all of them: Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess, Who's That Flying & 1000 Tiny Claws (my personal favorite). they worked cause they had little to nothing to offer in the plot department, and why would it? those were fun arcade style games with good gameplay and very nice graphics.now, to move on to Foul Play. let me list pros and cons and explain, why i feel that way about this game.+ graphics.looks awfully nice. i must, simply must mention a graphic bug, when Player 2 character's (called Mr. Scampwick) sprite DISAPPEARS during final cutscene. unacceptable, this couldn't have splipped past proper bug test.+ writing/plot.was somewhat amusing. some puns there, some snappy comebacks there, worked fine for the kind of the game it is.+ controls.most of the part felt great.- mechanics.parry mechanic (or to put in another words, block) is used in half of the advanced moves. worst thing about it is it's terribly 1) unresponsive, and 2) unnecessary. all feedback you get from executing it half of the time is a darn DING sound, and usually, you can punch an enemy before it can strike you. it's terribly unexplored and not implemented nicely.- save system.Player 2's progress is not saved. i played with the 2nd controller and i usually kept ahead, unlocking new moves faster than my partner. it only keeps 1st controller's progress, so unlocking anything or simply doing fine is a complete waste of time, if you play as Player 2. note: i'm talking about local co-op.- length.3 to 4 hours to finish. for it's original price tag ($14.99/14,99€) unacceptable. you'd think it'd be saved by 100%-ing the game. let's move on to the next point.- flow.cutscenes are thrown around without proper pacing. sometimes you have to move into a spotlight to progress in a scene. sometimes it takes controls from you. it's a PAIN to try and complete the challenges and/or get 5 stars on levels. it's a PAIN to repeat a checkpoint, you have to go through a dialog that's full of pauses between prompts to skip it. it takes too long, and we had enough trying to go through the first level after beating the game.- variety of gameplay.eh, it's beat-em-up, sure. it could be better though. Castle Crashers had more variety in gameplay, it had a store, progression system and unlockable companions. it's gameplay was better. and it was spaced out pretty well.overall, i think that's enough negative aspects to base my opinion that after all you should skip this game, unless you can get the 2-pack for 75% off or more.5/10			"

												I would say this game was entertaining......If i could actually play it. With the constant crashing at the load screen of the First act and lack of help in fixing this problem, I think I've lost interest in this game. My 15 dollars radar told me not to do it.....should have listened.			"

												Buy? Maybe.-=TL;DR=-Foul Play is a very simple side-scrolling beat 'em up that plays much like Castle Crashers, in the vein of a stage play as acted by the players. Gameplay is focused on performing well by maintaining combos, avoiding hits and completing level based challenges, instead of survival and managing lives/continues/respawns. It's a clever take on the genre that makes for a somewhat interesting experience, but in spite of the description's ""rewards performance over pummeling"" the gameplay does get fairly repetitive and it's easy to loose interest after a few levels.-=Presentation=-Foul Play is easily comparable to Castle Crashers due to it's art style and simplistic combat - it looks and almost plays quite like a Flash game even though the game doesn't seem to be in Flash. Animation is fluid like Castle Crashers, but certainly won't win any awards. The old British comedy will probably put off some players, not because it's bad, but it's a style of comedy that won't make alot of people laugh. I never felt that any of the jokes were bad or purile, nor did it put me off at all, but I didn't laugh. The game is cartoonish, attacks have that ""PISH! POW"" as expected and enemies eyes turn into ""X's"" when they ""die"" (in which humorously, the enemy actors will be pulled off screen or sneak off screen"". Backgrounds gradually fall in the back, as if the props were being managed by an amateur. The director is often seen in the background even on the scene itself, as if he not aware how fast the play is moving. They're all nice touches. The soundtrack fits the theme very well and I do like the menu music, though it's nothing spectacular, it's just good and fits the game well. The game plays at 60FPS, though, doesn't reach my 2560x1080 resolution-=Gameplay=-The way to win is the complete the level without dropping the ""Mood-o""meter"" low, which is the visual metric of how well you are performing. You maintain and grow this meter by performing big combos, maintaining those combos, reversing attacks, avoid being hit and activating a ""special"" that doubles your combo count output. The gameplay is very forgiving: Combos allow a good 2-3 seconds after you last hit for you to continue hitting enemies (making managing the screenspace key), reversable attacks have a near infinite window for you to counter them and if you can't block it, you can easily dodge a good bit out of the way. Staying alive is extra easy and I'm honestly not sure you can die unless you simply don't perform well enough for the meter - you can usually spam a few attacks here and there to keep yourself in the game. There is still a challenge of keeping your combo going, as you can lose it from being hit or not keeping enemies near you to attack, and the game offer various combo, attack and time challenges. This style of gameplay makes the game potentially more valuable for the completionist.Combat does get a little boring fairly soon. While Foul Play gives the player new moves at a very reasonable pace, it's generally most effective to mash the attack button and/or spam reversals, as enemies constantly attack. There are moments where it's definitely handy to dodge whether to avoid damage or make it to an enemy fast enough to keep a combo going. Some moves are fun, like the Stunning Piledriver or multi-hit air attack, but the gameplay is very repetitive as you constantly slap enemies with your cane and throw them around with the same two slam attacks. There's a second uppercut style attack, but there is really no reason to use it as air combos aren't awarded more than normal combos and doing so can knock enemies out of your range, causing you to lose a combo.The game offers Local and Online co-op, though, finding a game seems impossible - I've only seen 0 games in the server browser and that was even when I played the game shortly after it came out. You will likely have to find somebody in the community hub or elsewhere to play with. -=Conclusion=-Foul Play offers a unique and lightly fun experience, allowing players to challenge themselves by completing goals, versus beating up and staying alive. The combat becomes dull fairly quickly and after a while, I became disinterested in finishing the game, even though I was halfway finish and trying judiciously to get this off my backlog. For most players, the $15 price point may be a bit too high for the repetitive gameplay, lack of online players, and potentially non-entertaining comedy. The price seems fair for somebody who would really enjoy this game and expect to beat all the challenges, as that is the arguably the best part of this game - seeing if you can complete them on a game that is very easy, though providing some challenges that might feel just slightly out of reach. This surely isn't a must-buy and you would be missing out on the performance based gameplay, though it's nothing revolutionary. However, the game is certainly not bad and there are many worse games you could buy, but you may feel the lack of value shortly after playing.			"

												I've only been able to play a little bit but this is a very good, solid beat em up game. The combat system feels very fluid and juggling between multiple enemies feels very satisfying. It's even better if you can get a friend to play. It's somewhat similar in style to Castle Crashers. I'd highly recommend to any fans of beat em up games.			"

												I'm usually not to much fond of bashers. They tend to be repetitive and quickly boring, but Foul Play builds on the genre and manages to avoid most of the things the annoy me with other titles. It's theatrical structure is a perfect options that allows for a lot of different monsters, settings and situations. The writing is full of humour and wits. The game avoids the too obvious ""save the princess"" goal, which is a very good point.The other thing I like about that theatrical structure is that it allows for a choice of gaming length depending on the time you have. Only a few minutes to play? Play an act and move on to other things. Wanna go for longer sessions? Do a full play in one run and you're good to go.Overall a nice game, great universe and graphic style, good gameplay with some twists in the genre. Clearly worth its price anytime, an absolute best buy when on sale. Go get it!			"

												So after checking the game and playing it completely,I think I can give a fair review of this game.First of all, what you should expect when you play Foul Play: You should like beat-em-ups with 2d sprites and all the cons that come with it (bad lineup,more ""That should have hit""-moments).You should like the general idea of a game having a theatre-like feeling.However, you should not expect a hard game when playing. Elaboration on why later on.Story: You control Sebastian Dashforth,who combined with his assistant Scampwick Steerpipe is presenting his life as a daemonologist on stage, re-enacting the main events of Dashforth's last 20 years. Not fearing to go into hand-on-hand combat he and Scampwick are fighting themselves through an lost city of egypt, cursed villages, underwater cities and a london in control of a cult.Fairly generous with the humor and honest (though you may not thank him for it) he will keep you interested to keep playing for a while.Gameplay: You got six buttons that are important for playing, a weak,but fast attack,a stronger, slower attack which can bring enemies into the air or down from it, a jump, a button for improved abilities (which you learn at a higher level),a Showstopper ability granting you double the combo and double the audience approval when you activate it for a certain amount of time, a dodge and a block. The block is the most important of them,since you automatically counter blocked attacks from weaker enemies, letting you combo into them and from them. The enemies attacks have a clear indicator and you have a longer time to block or dodge an attack. You can play with someone else in Co-op and the only downside is that you have a combined health bar but seperated combo meters. You even get some upsides like a combo bonus if you activate showstopper at the same time. Enemies differ from higher health and exclusive gimmicks, like binding you if they hit on mummys.At the end of a level,you can get a charm if you did the challenges and a diary page if you collected enough stars.Additional Pros:-Replay value to 100% the game and to experiment on different gamestyles-Unique Storyconcept and interesting Characters-Soundtrack available with the game for no additional cost-Attention to detailAdditional Cons:-Low Playtime(any% about 3 hours, 100% 14 hours)-Bugs like enemies thrown up into the air won't come down that easily at some points-No Wiki-No active lobby community,so no random multiplayerAll in all it is worth playing, and if you are a fan of unique concepts,than this game should be yours!

												A rollicking good time, especially if you make use of the Co-operative mode (Something I view as essential, and fundamental to one's enjoyment.) The gameplay seems to be a fairly standard beat-em up fare (Similar to Castle Crashers), but the story is entertaining so far, and the conceit that the gameplay is in fact a stage play is both amusing and an excellent justification for the star based rating system. Grab a friend and go on an adventure, you'll be glad you did!			"

												A quirky little side-scroller beat-'em-up with an awfully Pratchettesque feel of Victorian London surrounding it, Foul Play is quite the entertaining purchase and a worthwhile addition to the Dennaton stable. Certainly a game worth picking up if you have the spare cash knocking around and fancy something a bit different, bright and colourful with its tongue lodged firmly in its cheek with no hope of removal. Behind the toony (and gorgeous) visuals lies quite the complex combo-smash fest, with a difficulty curve more than enough to keep any arcade-style gamer or achievement hunter hooked.			"

												The game is enjoyable, but only get it if you have a controller to use for it.  Remembering which keys do what on the keyboard is difficult, at best.

Lining up to hit enemies is a little sketchy sometimes.That said, the story is solid, for a light sidescroller, and the narrative is unusual in a fun, innovative way.			"

												Updated review: I'm a little further into Foul Play with two acts under my belt, but I'm loving it.The first thing I thought upon playing was that Double Dragon, Final Fight, and the Batman: Arkham series had an awesome little spunky lovechild.  It's a side-scrolling beat 'em up with cute graphics, a funny plot, and simple-yet-pleasing mechanics.You play an intrepid  British adventurer and demon hunter and his scamp of a sidekick.  Gameplay focuses on parrying enemy attacks, situational awareness, and making magnificient combos.  As you advance through the retelling of Baron Dashforth's exploits, trials, and tribulations the scenery morphs at lightning speed to set each scene - the game is a play upon an everchanging stage.  The graphical style is reminiscient of Castle Crashers with a dash of Alien Hominid thrown towards enemy designs.Developed and published by Devolver Games, the same studio that published Hotline Miami, Foul Play brings more addicting albeit different strategic violence into the fold with a more chipper and humorous take on plot and design.The only downside comes from the combat mechanics getting a little bit stale - it is a beat 'em up, after all.  However, some of the repetitiveness is alleviated by the introduction of new combo moves and charms as you progress further into the game and complete various performance goals for each act.  Charms unlock abilities such as combo multipliers, lengtheners, and more exotic buffs and aids.I'd recommend this game with two tips for enjoyment:1.) Play with a friend - it makes it much more fun.2.) Play in half-hour to hour stretches - avoid burning out on the mechanics			"

												Foul Play, is very intresting game. Not because on the graphic or anything like that, but because of the gamplay comcept as well.The game does not really have a life bar, rather have a thing called ""Mood-o-meter"". It's basically beating people up, mood-o-meter fills, do nothing during combat and/or get hit bu an enemy, loses some mood-o-meter, more mood-o-meter, more points, meaning more stars (maximum 5), lose Mood-o-meter to 0%, Game Over and must try the act again.I love every second of this gameplay, espically with one of my budding who we Skype call and play together (He is playing the game first time, and I am playing it for 100% completion).The story mode, while simple, really does make it intresting. Sure, it might be just there for the sake of being there, but I still do like it.The graphic, while cartoony, fits the gameplay and the concept, FOUL PLAY, rather easily.However, I really do enjoy this game, not because of having fun only, but having fun with friends and finding things rather enjoyable, even if it wasn't intended, Example: Lag in cutscenes. Plus getting all achievement can be very rewarding (haven't 100% it, but got some and proud of it too!).So here's My Final verdict:Recommen: beat-em-up, fun with a friend and/or 100% the game with hard but (mostly) fair challange!Gameplay: Enjoyable, espically with friends during Skype calls!Graphic: Cartoony, but fits the game perfectly.Music: Really forgetful, but in a good way as you enjoy once listened to it!Rating (**The rating I gave**) :**Must Play**Very GoodGoodBarely GoodBadHorrible "

												This is a fun beat 'em up which I can probably compare to Castle crashers. So if you played those, you'll basically know the type.What makes this game stand out? It's the whole theatre concept. You are performing in a theather, and all your enemies are actors in costumes. This means that often you will see ""dead"" enemies looking left and right and then going back to backstage, or you'll see a prop guy or something similar, it is quite funny.Instead of a life bar there's a specific meter that measures the audience's mood. So, the more combos you get, the more will meter go up and the audience will chear, throw their hats, etc. If you get hit too much, the audience will start booing and eventually you will have to stop performing, meaning - you lost. Levels are divided in plays and acts, and the goal of every act is to get five stars (more combos - more points - more stars) and to fulfill certain requirements - there's three in every act (save at least one inocent person, get 100 combo and such, it varies). When you start playing you will get so addicted to chasing the stars, so you'll restart the acts and try to get all the stars and achievements. I really liked the artistic style, music and gameplay, and for me personally it was far better than Castle crashers. I liked the sounds Baron Dashforts and the actors make, basically never really pronouncing a word. This game is actually better than I expected after seeing the trailer, so I can recommend it to all the fans of beat 'em ups, and - because of its style - even to those who aren't fans of the genre, like me. Currently it's 15e on Steam, but you can probably get it on Humble or on some other sale for far less money.			"

												Very reminiscent of Castle Crashers. Foul Play is a side scroller beat ’em up from Mediatonic and Devolver Digital. Let’s get rocking.The GoodThe artwork is great. The characters, the enemies, even the environments. Everything, right down to the smallest detail, was wonderfully well done.The game has a campaign with a decent length. It’s not too long and it’s not too short.There is a pretty sizable amount of enemy variety. This is always a good thing as punching the same thing in the face repeatedly can grow monotonous. Having a variety of things to punch in the face repeatedly is much better. After all, variety is the spice of life (or, in this case, variety is the spice of face punching).If you’re like me, you hate desert themed levels in games with every fiber of your being. Foul Play gets their desert level out of the way first thing. The rest of the game has much less aggravating environments.The characters’ dialogue is quite entertaining. It’s always nice to have some comic relief amongst the thronging hordes of enemies.The block feature is, easily, the best feature. Not only can you block enemy melee attacks, you can also block projectiles, and send them straight back at the fool who sent it your way. Simply amazing.The BadI don’t really have anything for this category. Foul Play is genuinely enjoyable.The MehI felt like enemies were really hard to put down, where as the player character is relatively squishy. Maybe that’s just me, but I don’t know.As far as equipment customization goes, Foul Play doesn’t bring a whole lot to the table.Verdict: YeaAs I stated above, Foul Play is genuinely enjoyable. If you liked Castle Crashers or if you like games of that nature, you’ll definitely like this one. If you’ve been looking for something new, go check out FP in the Steam Store.

												One of my new favorite Beat Em Ups ever, this game features a unique health system which encourages you to find the best combos possible. The story is an original mix of various monsters of myths: while other games would be happy with just zombies, this one features mummies, gargoyels, vampires, werewolves, mermen and much more. Mix that all up with a tongue and cheek framing device and an animation style that compliments it, and you have a game you simply must play.			"

												This is a fun beat 'em up which I can probably compare to Castle crashers. So if you played those, you'll basically know the type.What makes this game stand out? It's the whole theatre concept. You are performing in a theather, and all your enemies are actors in costumes. This means that often you will see ""dead"" enemies looking left and right and then going back to backstage, or you'll see a prop guy or something similar, it is quite funny.Instead of a life bar there's a specific meter that measures the audience's mood. So, the more combos you get, the more will meter go up and the audience will chear, throw their hats, etc. If you get hit too much, the audience will start booing and eventually you will have to stop performing, meaning - you lost. Levels are divided in plays and acts, and the goal of every act is to get five stars (more combos - more points - more stars) and to fulfill certain requirements - there's three in every act (save at least one inocent person, get 100 combo and such, it varies). When you start playing you will get so addicted to chasing the stars, so you'll restart the acts and try to get all the stars and achievements. I really liked the artistic style, music and gameplay, and for me personally it was far better than Castle crashers. I liked the sounds Baron Dashforts and the actors make, basically never really pronouncing a word. This game is actually better than I expected after seeing the trailer, so I can recommend it to all the fans of beat 'em ups, and - because of its style - even to those who aren't fans of the genre, like me.

												I was really surprised by this game. I went into it basically blind not knowing what to expect but this game is really unique. For the most part is a standard beat ‘em up brawler but it has a few interesting twists. The premise of the game is that you’re preforming a show and you need to keep the crowd interested by keeping long strings of combos and getting a high score. This gives the game a large focus on points rather than a health bar. Speaking of health bars, this game doesn’t have one. The combo system is a perfect replacement for a health bar because it makes breaking your combo feel just as bad as losing some health. The rest of the gameplay is really solid with lots of unlockable moves and even an item system. Items provide passive buffs like +3 combo on successful parry and extending the time limit before a combo is lost. The co-op in this game doesn’t feel tacked on but doesn’t add anything either though, I still think it’s more fun to play with a friend. On to the aesthetic. The game has a stereotypical British theme that is hilarious. Even the tutorials for new moves use fancy rhetoric to describe things. For example the grab tutorial “When an unseemly fellow attacks hit B whilst he is signaling his intent. Successful executions should see you grabbing the fellow he the lapels (or whatever seems most convenient dependent on social class and/or species” Really funny stuff. The in game banter between Dashforth and Scampwick is also really hilarious. The art style in the game is really beautiful. Its cartoony with vibrant colors. Everything looks like a stage prop with you being able to see people inside monster costumes and backgrounds and props roll in between scenes. It’s really charming and gives the game a theater feel. The enemies are very diverse you’ll see everything from mummies to giant crab men, all well stylized of course. I really enjoyed Foul Play it was a fresh take on a genre I’m not usually all that into. It’s a charming game with a good story and some really funny humor I recommend it. 7/10			"

												Foul Play takes the limelight of a beat ‘em up and uses an interesting take of center stage on a Victorian theater. Rather than power ups and health, you chain together combos and multiple hits on opponents to win the crowd over to keep the show going. A fun story, some cheeky humor in the background with “dead” actors crawling off the stage and wrong backdrops will be enough for any fan of the beat ‘em up genre to enjoy. For those who find beat ‘em ups boring after a few stages, there’s not enough here to get a curtain call.http://iamericm.com/2014/03/foul-play-indie-game-review/ "

												The art and the funny dialogue was what draw me to this game. I was not disappointed in the art area, it has quite a lot of eye candy in it. Be it the janitor slacking off on stage, the guy stuck in a prop or the actors looking to see if anyone would notice if he crawled off the stage. The dialogue is very British and it’s not a bad thing. It kind of parodies Sherlock. The game play… I highly suggest you get a controller, I played it on a keyboard and my right hand is aching! It’s very retro/old school in terms of killing the bosses, it’s very Mario. You beat the boss using a pattern of moves and you stick to it until he dies. But The silver lining is the combinations and charge attacks you can do, it looks good and feels good!So in a nutshell, it's a gem if you don't mind the button mashing and the repetitiveness.  "

												♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING! That’s just one way I can describe this game and yet it’s still a VERY big understatement. The game play is fast and entertaining, the multiplayer works perfectly and this game's comedy constantly made me and my friend laugh with both the written and background jokes. The feeling of fighting on a stage to entertain a crowd just makes you want to do your very best! The combos are fast and satisfying to pull off and you feel amazing when you discover new moves for the first time and make great use of them to make that combo number rise. Finally we make it to the most amazing aspect of Foul Play, the story. I mean it this game's story made both me and my friend want to just keep going until we made it to the very end. I won’t go into detail to avoid spoilers but the story is just pure bliss. Both my friend and I bought this game while it was on sale but this game is still worth its full price. Buy this game you will NOT regret your choice. 10/10			"

Lining up to hit enemies is a little sketchy sometimes.That said, the story is solid, for a light sidescroller, and the narrative is unusual in a fun, innovative way.			"

												Foul play is a wonderful game following the adventures of Daemon hunter Baron Dashforth, and his assistant, Scampwick.It plays a lot lot like Castle Crashers, but mixes it up, and instead of health, you have a mechanic called the mood meter, the more you score hits and combos, the higher it rises, the more of a chance of survival you have. The graphics are more smooth than Castle Crashers, but still retains the same charm, with all the characters and enemies big enough so that you can see them, but that also sometimes makes it hard to know if you are in the same layer as the enemy. The bosses are both challenging and rewarding, each with their own special attacks. The story is very well thought out, with Scarmpwick acting as a great source of comic relief. The presentation of the game is wonderful, I couldn't find one glitch or error with the game. The music fits well, and perfectly suits the seriousness of some situations. Overall, Foul play is a wonderful game, and I would reccomend this game to anyone who has played Castle Crashers, and liked it, or someone who likes side scrolling beat-'em-ups. 9/10 "

The combat is center statge at it's just as good as Arkham, albeit less deep and minus the gadgets. Make no mistake this is a side scrolling button masher but the combat is much more fun than other button mashers since you can block and counter, and the game wasn't designed to eat quarters.The art direction and style is unique and cute as the entire game takes place on a stage with a Daemon hunter recounting his exploits to a crowd. The crowd's happiness/entertainment level is your life meter and the actors take on the roles of werewolves, mermaids, and giant crabs to name a few. The art direction doesn't go all the way though with flying enemies conspicuosly lack wires and some of the bosses are just monsters, but overall the concept works great.The game works best in small doses and actually isn't a drag in single player. Very much worth your time and money.			"

												A Unique beat em up like castle crashers, but it isnt as charming or fun i think. With castle crashers the game does a good job at making me want to finish it. This one nnot so much, also if it had additional player slots it would be cool but it only at the max a two player game while castle crashers is 4. So i'd honestly only recommend this game if you already have Castle Crashers and want to play something similiar but different. Still a worthy buy. Forgot to mention the whole life bar and game mechanic is very different as it is performance based in a way that plays really nice with the ""play theater"" vibe the game's story is based on.			"

												I've only been able to play a little bit but this is a very good, solid beat em up game. The combat system feels very fluid and juggling between multiple enemies feels very satisfying. It's even better if you can get a friend to play. It's somewhat similar in style to Castle Crashers. I'd highly recommend to any fans of beat em up games.			"

												Take charge of the Demon hunter Baron Dashforth and his faithful companion Mr. Scampwick in this 'Gaslight-Theatre themed brawler which is fast-paced, epic and amusing! The gameplay takes its cues from many modern hack-and-slask type games with the focus being on charging through waves of enemies focussing on combo building and style, but the progression through the game is reminiscent of the early brawler such as 'DoubleDragon' or 'Streets of Rage' as you defeat a wave of enemies and move to the right to face the next wave until you finish the ""act"". The combat is smooth (although occasionally a little hard to follow, especially in co-op) and the gradual character levelling up introduces new moves and techniques so that you can really dazzle the audience... oh yes! the audience! This is one of the more unique features of the game! The action take place on stage infront of a live audience, the principal being that you are recounting your adventures on stage. Much of the humour of the game comes from this; defeated enemies will crawl off into the wings after a few seconds, the sets and props will be wheeled into view and occasionally you catch the stage-hand taking to a breather or chatting to one of the 'actors' playing an enemy. This setup means that you don't have a health bar as you might in a traditional setting, instead you are given a gauge showing the excitement of the audience. Taking hits causes this level to drop and if you don't pull yourself together and get on with the show then the curtain will fall on that act.  Each play (of which there are 5) is split into several acts and the plays have a range of settings/themes although in essence the gameplay doesn't change hugely other than upping the difficultly and enemy count between each one. Each act has 3 challenges which, when completed, give you a charm which can be equipped for some extra combat bonus or ability.Overall this is simple but enjoyable and best enjoyed with someone on the couch in co-op mode.

												Buy? Maybe.-=TL;DR=-Foul Play is a very simple side-scrolling beat 'em up that plays much like Castle Crashers, in the vein of a stage play as acted by the players. Gameplay is focused on performing well by maintaining combos, avoiding hits and completing level based challenges, instead of survival and managing lives/continues/respawns. It's a clever take on the genre that makes for a somewhat interesting experience, but in spite of the description's ""rewards performance over pummeling"" the gameplay does get fairly repetitive and it's easy to loose interest after a few levels.-=Presentation=-Foul Play is easily comparable to Castle Crashers due to it's art style and simplistic combat - it looks and almost plays quite like a Flash game even though the game doesn't seem to be in Flash. Animation is fluid like Castle Crashers, but certainly won't win any awards. The old British comedy will probably put off some players, not because it's bad, but it's a style of comedy that won't make alot of people laugh. I never felt that any of the jokes were bad or purile, nor did it put me off at all, but I didn't laugh. The game is cartoonish, attacks have that ""PISH! POW"" as expected and enemies eyes turn into ""X's"" when they ""die"" (in which humorously, the enemy actors will be pulled off screen or sneak off screen"". Backgrounds gradually fall in the back, as if the props were being managed by an amateur. The director is often seen in the background even on the scene itself, as if he not aware how fast the play is moving. They're all nice touches. The soundtrack fits the theme very well and I do like the menu music, though it's nothing spectacular, it's just good and fits the game well. The game plays at 60FPS, though, doesn't reach my 2560x1080 resolution-=Gameplay=-The way to win is the complete the level without dropping the ""Mood-o""meter"" low, which is the visual metric of how well you are performing. You maintain and grow this meter by performing big combos, maintaining those combos, reversing attacks, avoid being hit and activating a ""special"" that doubles your combo count output. The gameplay is very forgiving: Combos allow a good 2-3 seconds after you last hit for you to continue hitting enemies (making managing the screenspace key), reversable attacks have a near infinite window for you to counter them and if you can't block it, you can easily dodge a good bit out of the way. Staying alive is extra easy and I'm honestly not sure you can die unless you simply don't perform well enough for the meter - you can usually spam a few attacks here and there to keep yourself in the game. There is still a challenge of keeping your combo going, as you can lose it from being hit or not keeping enemies near you to attack, and the game offer various combo, attack and time challenges. This style of gameplay makes the game potentially more valuable for the completionist.Combat does get a little boring fairly soon. While Foul Play gives the player new moves at a very reasonable pace, it's generally most effective to mash the attack button and/or spam reversals, as enemies constantly attack. There are moments where it's definitely handy to dodge whether to avoid damage or make it to an enemy fast enough to keep a combo going. Some moves are fun, like the Stunning Piledriver or multi-hit air attack, but the gameplay is very repetitive as you constantly slap enemies with your cane and throw them around with the same two slam attacks. There's a second uppercut style attack, but there is really no reason to use it as air combos aren't awarded more than normal combos and doing so can knock enemies out of your range, causing you to lose a combo.The game offers Local and Online co-op, though, finding a game seems impossible - I've only seen 0 games in the server browser and that was even when I played the game shortly after it came out. You will likely have to find somebody in the community hub or elsewhere to play with. -=Conclusion=-Foul Play offers a unique and lightly fun experience, allowing players to challenge themselves by completing goals, versus beating up and staying alive. The combat becomes dull fairly quickly and after a while, I became disinterested in finishing the game, even though I was halfway finish and trying judiciously to get this off my backlog. For most players, the $15 price point may be a bit too high for the repetitive gameplay, lack of online players, and potentially non-entertaining comedy. The price seems fair for somebody who would really enjoy this game and expect to beat all the challenges, as that is the arguably the best part of this game - seeing if you can complete them on a game that is very easy, though providing some challenges that might feel just slightly out of reach. This surely isn't a must-buy and you would be missing out on the performance based gameplay, though it's nothing revolutionary. However, the game is certainly not bad and there are many worse games you could buy, but you may feel the lack of value shortly after playing.			"

												Suprisingly easy, yet suprisingly fun!  Button-mashing in mid-air combos, perry-blocks turn into throws. This game is better than what I expected. For what it's worth I am not disappointed. I Imagined it beling like Castle Crashers, but with only 2 players. However, the crowd mechanics of the game plays a big role. keep the combos up or you will loose the audience's intrest, not to mention getting hit by an enemy is a no-no. You're supposed to be the hero that's naturally invincible; an unstoppble force to be admired. You'll have to wow the audience back from getting hit or you may risk failing the act. Then again combos are an easy pleasure to get that mood up. Enimies dont actually die (it's a play) but rather crawl off the stage after being knocked out. On occasion you see a backstage staff member doing something comedic, reminding you that in the end it's just a play. All-in-all Foul Play is a pretty good way to spend a little time playing a few acts, maybe get through a play in a day (there's more than one play). If I were to grade it I'd give it a B+ because i enjoyed it. But it really is a bunch of mayhem. The story developments (given that fact it is a play after all) don't really seem that much of an incentive to keep pressing onward. But it's good game.			"

												The cutesy cartoon graphics of Foul Play didn't do anything for me, but I'm sure it really appeals to children. The sinister occult theme of the game is wildly inappropriate for them.  At one point, the main character chants a demonic spell and opens a portal to hell. It's like a retelling of the life of  lunatic sociopath Aleister Crowley, in cartoon beat'em up form aimed at children. Foul, indeed. The actual game play kind of reminds me of a 2D Devil May Cry. Points are scored by stringing together long combos. At one point when the ability to reverse enemy attacks and throw them is unlocked, the game can be beaten by just continuous throwing one enemy at the rest of them until they're all dead. Until then, though, the game was seriously cramping my hand. This is a hardcore button-mashing game. The combat was kind of fun once better moves were unlocked. Other games have done this type of game play much better and didn't have the terrible story to go with it.			"

												I can honestly say that this is an amazing game. I picked this game up when it was on sale, but it is well worth the $15.00 full price. The best part of this game is the local multiplayer; I played this with my brother all morning. The combat doesn't take too much getting used too, but there is still a layer of depth when it comes to getting high combos. There are lots of chellenges that are keeping my brother and I engaged in the game. On a different note, there is actually a decnt story, filled with quirky brittish humor that pushes this game over the top.10 Top hats/10The Queen of England would be proud			"

												Foul Play... where do I start?Well for one, this game was a risk to release. Not that it's unfinished, but it would probably be disregarded as ""another  mindless brawler"". But it is not that. This game is amazing. It isn't perfect, but it is awesome when you play it right.Yes there is a right and wrong way to play this. Before I get to that though here are the pros and cons.PROSFantastic and humorous storyline.Believable characters who also have awesome dialogue.Original concept of the audience being your score, also you can't die on bosses that would be otherwise frustrating.Fair but challenging enemies. Co-Op actually has benifits other than playing with your friend.Awesome combos that are uniqueParrying is the best thing in brawlers since magic in Castle Crashers.Those 4th wall breaks do.Extremelly fluent combat that never cancels your moves unless you get hit.The art style is utterly beautiful and fits perfectly with the game.CONSSometimes the joke of being in a play is too forced.Getting high combos can be hard on large enemies when it doesn't tell you you can't parry them.The learning curve suddenly jolts up, although it smooths out later on.The crowd cares very little for a climax. Why can't you get bonus points for being in a tough spot then pulling through.By itself rating 8.5/10But there is a way to play the game that just makes your time with the game the best. Be immersed. It is hard since it constantly reminds you that it is a game. But once you feel like the character, the game truly feels like a hunt against daemons. Get a friend to play this. You two voice the characters like you really mean it. Once you feel like you are in the game, it feels like you are preforming for a live audience about YOUR adventures. This game will leave you wanting more.With friend and immersion 10/10			"

												One of my new favorite Beat Em Ups ever, this game features a unique health system which encourages you to find the best combos possible. The story is an original mix of various monsters of myths: while other games would be happy with just zombies, this one features mummies, gargoyels, vampires, werewolves, mermen and much more. Mix that all up with a tongue and cheek framing device and an animation style that compliments it, and you have a game you simply must play.			"

												Foul Play, is very intresting game. Not because on the graphic or anything like that, but because of the gamplay comcept as well.The game does not really have a life bar, rather have a thing called ""Mood-o-meter"". It's basically beating people up, mood-o-meter fills, do nothing during combat and/or get hit bu an enemy, loses some mood-o-meter, more mood-o-meter, more points, meaning more stars (maximum 5), lose Mood-o-meter to 0%, Game Over and must try the act again.I love every second of this gameplay, espically with one of my budding who we Skype call and play together (He is playing the game first time, and I am playing it for 100% completion).The story mode, while simple, really does make it intresting. Sure, it might be just there for the sake of being there, but I still do like it.The graphic, while cartoony, fits the gameplay and the concept, FOUL PLAY, rather easily.However, I really do enjoy this game, not because of having fun only, but having fun with friends and finding things rather enjoyable, even if it wasn't intended, Example: Lag in cutscenes. Plus getting all achievement can be very rewarding (haven't 100% it, but got some and proud of it too!).So here's My Final verdict:Recommen: beat-em-up, fun with a friend and/or 100% the game with hard but (mostly) fair challange!Gameplay: Enjoyable, espically with friends during Skype calls!Graphic: Cartoony, but fits the game perfectly.Music: Really forgetful, but in a good way as you enjoy once listened to it!Rating (**The rating I gave**) :**Must Play**Very GoodGoodBarely GoodBadHorrible "

IntroductionFoul Play is an action-packed, side-scroller game which I think everyone should try, just ignore the metacritic rating 69 that is stated down below, and just read on to know why it's much better than it is given credit for.To introduce you guys into this game, I would like to start by stating that this game has nothing foul about it at all despite the title of the game. At first glance it may seem like a poorly made game with terrible graphics from the developers “Mediatonic, The Irregular Corporation”. However, this is where the magic of the graphics come in, through the rough and casual graphics, the game let's you immersed in its theatrical and comical atmosphere with its very own audience and humour added in.ObjectivesYou are in a staged performance to keep your audience engaged and happy by acting out your adventure-filled stories of Baron Dashforth. The aim is to max out the pleasure bar of your audience by performing crazy combos. Through achieving high scores on the level, you can gain access to even more combos and skills your character can make use of, to help with future scenes and acts.FeaturesLet's start with the good points, shall we?1. This game is entertaining throughout the whole campaign, filled with creative ways to make players feel amused and interested. For example, the stage might be used as an advantage to bring out a cleaner who doesn't have any idea what is going on when stage crew suddenly drags him out of view.2. Bashing up baddies is always fun,isn't it? Well, you could say the same for this game as you get to destroy your opponents for the joy and pleasure of the audience as you try to keep the audience engaged through the system of completing combos on your enemies in order to prevent the curtains from closing down on the stage.3. Interesting and original way the story is told. As you play as Baron Dashforth, your goal is to tell you epic adventures to the audience while you are on stage. The adventures are usually told in an exciting and unique manner which got even myself feeling as if I was part of the Audience, waiting for the show to start4. Well this isn't really a good point for some, but I'll just say it. If you ever do play this with a good friend, you are guaranteed to have a COMPLETELY hilarious time with them. So yeah, go crazy.And…Here are the bad bits of the game, not that there is actually much to criticize this game for.1. This game was originally meant to be for controllers, so it WILL suck if you use the keyboard like I do, because when you play through the first few levels, you will be prompted to press some keys to perform a specific action, but you get confused because the keys are from controllers(like x and o).2. Without the story, the combat mechanism causes the gameplay to be very boring, as combat only comprises of 1 quick attack,1 heavy attack and 1 special attack, and your goal is to achieve combos with these little choices you have. So I wouldn't suggest any of you play this for hours on end to keep the experience fresh and decent.ConclusionWith those points being said, I will bring an end to this review after this summary of opinions and thoughts. Despite the combat being boring and repetitive, the story and atmosphere definitely manages to let the game be amazing. Additionally, Foul Play also has trading cards and achievements for those of you who are interested. The game itself costs around $15 and is released in 2013. Personally, I think that this game is a recommended to have in your library, just give it a try and you will see what I mean by saying that the game feels magical in its own way Thanks for Reading!

												This game reminds me of a bad castle crashers. It tried to be unique with your character's ""health"" but i think that was a pretty bad blunder. I think it may be impossible to ""die."" The combos are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ too. Like, I didn't find any that used the two buttons that didn't end up hitting the enemy across the screen before i could get a fat combo going. The parry button is easily spammable and I don't think I was punished for doing it once. There doesn't seem to be a reason not to unless your ""health"" meter is about to run out because the audience is bored.I didn't find this challenging in any way other than how much I could play this without falling asleep. I would not recommend this game, especially at $15. However, I think it is worth maybe $5 AND playing with a friend. I never got to try the co-op so that might elongate this game.			"
