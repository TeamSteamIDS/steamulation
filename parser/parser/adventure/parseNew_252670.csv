												Underrated magicThis game is amazing, really. It's a small life, which the player lives with the Born. A life full of danger, fear, regret and melancholy. When the game takes you by the hand the only thing you can say is ""WOW! this world is beautiful!"" And the game does not release you until the final credits. And the only thing you can say after all is ""What have I done, I have to fix it ...""			"

												I knew nothing about this game at the moment I bought it. Worth every penny, true hidden gem. If you like logic platformers which don`t require cat-like reflexes Nihilumbra is the game for you. Don`t play it when you are down, it`s a bit depressing.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games. Nihilumbra is a side-scrolling puzzle game, where you control the lone protoganist, Born, guiding him through five varied realms. Born is alone, too- aside from the enemies in the game, which are few and far between, every landscape you travel through seems abandoned, deserted. It adds an apocalyptic feel to an already stark and melancholy game.Born starts out with very few tricks up his sleeve- he can jump and move inexorably to the right, and the enemies he encounters are deadly. As you progress, though, you pick up new skills that allow you to alter the landscape around you- colors you can paint on the world to allow you to slide, bounce, stick, and more.There's really two parts to this game- the story mode, which is relatively straight-forward but still retains a challenge, and the mode you unlock after beating the story, which is devilishly hard. The controls seemed fluid to me, though they take some getting used to- one hand moves Born, while the mouse uses the various colors to guide him along. The game rarely rushes you, and when it does, it's considerate enough to provide enough checkpoints to prevent too much repetition. This seems to be Beautifun's Freshman game for the PC, and I am definitely looking forward to where they'll go from here.			"

												Puzzle platformer, slow-paced, not very difficult. Main mechanic (besides moving your character) is altering game physics by ""painting"" 5 different colours (with different abilities, which are unlocked during main campaign) on almost any platform.Campaign is short (~3 hours) which is basically a preparation for the harder mode (The Void, ~2x harder and longer), which is unlocked after beating the game for the first time. In this mode, you'll need to employ platforming skills and brain cells a bit more. Good thing is, almost any level can be finished with different approach (using different colours which adds to replayability). Beating the hard mode will unlock a change which will give you the reason to put few more hours into the main campaign from the beginning (this feature completely change the mood of the game, which is dark/depressing by its setting).Steam achievements are not very difficult, most of them will be unlocked naturally by going through both playthroughs. Some requires higher platforming skill and exploration, but nothing impossible for 100%.Fair price, decent length, good game. I was pleasantly surprised. Totally recommended!			"

												Escaping from the void, trying to become more than you are and risking the world you seek in order to do so. This is the story of Nihilumbra, a puzzle based 2D platformer from Beautifun Games.The game follows a vey narrative series of events travelling from the cold Icy hills through the forest, the desert, the volcano and finally to the city. Each location brings with it new challenges and a new skill to brave them. These skills come in the forms of colours, paints that can be spread around the environment at will. The first colour you obtain is blue, allowing the creation of ice. Then comes the green followed by the brown, creating bouncy and sticky surfaces respectively. From the volcano comes red, the ability to burn some things and  supercharge others. Finally there is yellow, the ability to create conductive lines to transfer power from energy sources to unpowered machines. It's the combination of all of these that will let you progress and aid in your escape from the void.The gameplay is well established as you play, with a ""tutorial"" for each new colour. The levels are relatively easy on the first play through but after finishing once there is a new ""Void"" version of the levels, being more difficult and involved. The controlling of the colours is intuitive and easy to do, and if you make a mistake it's just as easy to undo your moves.The visual style is fantastic with detailed painted backgrounds and foreground objects that have a parallax effect. When applying colours it is always easy to distinguish. The soundtrack is one that is extremely well fitting and only adds to the atmosphere. The voice over is a crucial part of the game and it wouldn't be the same without it. The tone of voice is one that makes the player feel safe while traveling and discovering.Overall the game is solid and everything seems to work as intended, some sections seem to be reliant on trial and error. There is a large difficulty curve between finishing the first playthrough and starting the second, it could have eased into it more.It's has a good bang for your buck and the only thing I would like to see is a level editor with steam workshop integration. Other than that it's a great game.			"

												Ideas+motivation=indie games.And Nihilumbra is a good way to prove indie games can have a space on the AAA games on the marketColors, unnending questions, and a desesperate pursuit to answer the most enigmatic question of yourself:""Why are you here?""Our journey begin with ""Born"" an unknown creature made by somehow on the Void, our character escape from it, after that you have to many question to face. To prove your existance.This being adapt himself with a family and preferably form. A""scarecrown"" (similar to a human form).The narrator is so amazing , i consider it like a character on the story, because he is always there, he is always saying something about you, your enemy, your background, questioning yourself or giving you clues, annnything.....The colors are an essential fact throught the story, a new color = a new power, a way to understand this new and strange world. Every single one has a purpose to help you. You would notice you eventually will need to mix them to get it done.The OST is well done, specially on the void pursuit.Negative things:-Short: 3 hours to complete the main storyline (but it have a void mode to replay the story)-The puzzles aren´t very convoluted, fews are going to stop you and make you think for a moment.This game has the word ""originality"" in every part of it, that is the most remarkable of the game. Is a philosophical game with a clearly message waiting in the end. Games like this makes you faith on indie games increases.			"

												“Ew, a mobile game getting a PC port? No thanks!” You might say. But wait! Not all portable titles are games with simple yet addictive mechanics looking to take your money. Nihilumbra is a neat little puzzle platformer from Spanish developer Beautifun Games. You take control of Born, a creature created by The Void, who escapes to the real world. Relentlessly pursued by that which created him, Born treks across new and strange environments, discovering what it truly means to be alive. He isn’t the only being from The Void that has crossed over however. Every now and then you will encounter a new enemy, each more dangerous than the last. These, combined with various environmental hazards provide much of the challenge outside of the platforming. The jumping itself isn’t complex, but as the game progresses you will discover new colours which can be painted on the walls, ceilings and ground of the levels. The game has five separate worlds, and there is a colour tied to each of them.The Frozen Hills grants you blue, a colour to make surfaces icy, helping you run faster or push previously unmovable objects. The Living Forest gives you green, allowing you to make surfaces bouncy. The Ash Desert provides brown, which makes anything you paint it on sticky. The Volcano grants you red, which heats up surfaces to burn objects and enemies alike. Finally, The City unlocks yellow, which conducts electricity, allowing you to link electrical objects together. Thankfully the controls translate to keyboard and mouse perfectly. Painting is as simple as left clicking and dragging, and doing the same with right click acts as an eraser.Although the game is 2D, the first two colours in particular have a very Portal 2-esque feel about them. You will be using momentum to jump and bounce your way to new platforms, and although it sometimes lacks precision, it isn’t all that frustrating. You will often use multiple colours in the same puzzle. For example you might use yellow to activate a powerful electromagnet, lifting your enemies into the air. Using brown on the floor in front of you allows you to walk along underneath them without being attracted yourself. There are a good amount of well thought out puzzles here. None of them take particularly long to figure out though. The game as a whole is not all that hard, and can be completed in a few hours at most – an unfortunate leftover from the fast paced mobile platform it was born on.Nihilumbra employs a simple, yet effective art style. Each level has its own colourful theme, often attempting to give you a feel of the heat of the area. The icy areas are very blue, and the volcano is red, for obvious reasons, but this also related to the story. As Born uncovers new colours he begins to feel warmer inside, as if The Void inside him is being filled. The main character himself begins as an amorphous blob, but upon entering the real world he decides to change himself to try and blend in. The first thing he encounters is a scarecrow however, so you spend the rest of the game naively jumping around as a cute, raggedy old shadow creature. The character design of the Void enemies is good too, with weird plant creatures which launch projectiles at you, and a huge snail-like thing that erases any colours it slithers over. At the end of each world, there is a fast paced platforming section where you are being chased by The Void. Ever encroaching from the left of the screen, you simply have to stay ahead of it and reach the end. These are some of the weakest sections of the game, as it shows off the lack of accuracy the platforming has at times. Switching between colours quickly is cumbersome, especially when attempted at speed. I would have liked the action to pause when bringing up the colour menu, as I often got caught out without the colour I needed. Thankfully the game is liberally checkpointed, even in the normal levels, so you never lose much progress. These checkpoints also seem to return all of your colour to you. It feels as if you are using some sort of resource when painting, but this was never explained, and I never ran out, so I can’t be sure.All in all, Nihilumbra is a short, but fun, puzzle platformer. The puzzles you encounter aren’t all that difficult, but they do require some thought, particular in later stages. The platforming itself isn’t all that good, but the unique painting mechanics make up for it. Mobile games are becoming more complex, and simply better overall, and it is nice to see that some of the higher quality ones are making the switch over to PC.			"

												NOTE:  Don't be fooled by the in-game time Steam is showing for me -- I played my first two times through on my DRM-free copy :)Disclaimer: The game does require some hand-eye coordination and patience.  If you have neither, you probably won't get very far ;)Basic options include choice of seven languages and separate sliders for Music, Sound, and Voice, plus mono or stereo sound and mouse sensitivity.  The game automatically adjusted itself to my widescreen, and graphic options include choice of screen resolution, Enhanced color effects, HD textures, VSync, or Automatic settings (which was my preference)As with most games of this type, you don't just save at any time -- there are save points.  Just touch the globe -- the small lights (aka checkpoints) that will ""forgive your mistakes"" -- to save your progress.  These are nicely spaced, so don't worry!Unlike most of these games is that we have multiple profiles to choose from (three of them,) so we can switch profiles if more than one person wants to play the game at once.If you hit Esc. during gameplay, you'll see a button that says ""Resume Game"" and three symbols:  A compass, a swirl, and some gears.  Clicking on the gears will take you to the game settings, the middle button (the swirl) will take you back to your last checkpoint (you can cancel if you didn't mean to hit that button!) and the compass will take you back to the maps page, and from there you can get back to the main menu by clicking on the arrow at the bottom right of the page.Where to start?  Well, I guess at the beginning would be best!The game very clearly shows us how to play, without being annoying in any way.  The instructions are seamlessly introduced by our narrator, who stays with us throughout our journey, giving us new information and telling us the story.  What a wonderful voice they chose, and such an interesting way to progress the story!The controls are basic to start with -- the arrow keys or W-A-S-D and space bar to jump. I recommend using W-A-S-D, as later in the game it's nearly impossible to continue to use the arrow keys whilst managing your colors!  As we progress, we discover colors which allow us to affect the world around us.  The game teaches us to use these colors very clearly, so don't worry!  Each color has a different effect, and I don't want to ruin any surprises, so I'll just mention the first two:  The only color we have at the very beginning is purple, which is unusable until we discover other colors, for it allows us to erase any colors we place or find.  Soon we will learn how to use blue, which creates an icy surface where it is placed.  NOW we can use the purple, if we so desire. ;)  Each world area we visit teaches a new color ability, and all told, we have five worlds and five colors:  Blue, brown, green, yellow, and red (though not in that order.)So how do we use our colors?  It's really very easy.  In the top right corner is an orb showing your current color.  Click on it to open up your color palette (see the first picture in post #1 for a visual.)  Choose whatever color you need for the current situation you're facing.  To place the color, simply hold down your mouse button and swipe the cursor over the surface you want to coat.You have a limited amount of color to use, and sometimes it's necessary to remove the color you've placed to complete the current puzzle.  To do so you COULD click on the color palette, choose purple, and click-and-drag the areas where you want to remove it... OR, you can do it the easy way and simply right-click-and-drag. :DDuring my second time through the main story I discovered that we can easily and quickly change our color by simply using the scroll wheel on the mouse!  Whee~!  Happy day!The experience is really the driving force of the game.  It's one thing to watch someone play it, and something else to actually sit back and do it for yourself.  Take your time.  Discover.  Learn.  Let yourself be immersed in this beautiful and deadly world.  You could power through all the scenes and ignore all of that, but you'd really be missing out.The primary focus of the game is discovery.  Find your way through the worlds without being damaged or reclaimed by the Void.  Nihilumbra is very story-driven, and for the most part, we have plenty of time explore and figure out how to solve the puzzles.  Towards the end of each world, the Void will advance, leaving us with only a certain amount of time to get through the final screens.  The use of the scroll wheel to change colors makes a big difference in the difficulty level, but even if you're doing the point-and-click method (which I was the first time through!) it's still doable.Five colors, five worlds...  Before I knew it, I came to 'The End' and was watching the credits. *cry*  I felt so wistful, wishing that it hadn't ended so soon, wishing that there was more...  Two hours is all it took (the second time 'round,) yet I felt that it was still worth the asking price.. . . except that it wasn't 'The End' at all!  It turned out that this was only the beginning of my journey in Nihilumbra, and the true challenge still lay before me.  Now the 'Void Mode' was unlocked, and the focus of the game changes.  We've finished with the main story, but still have much to do!  Every single save point from the main game is now a complex puzzle that needs to be solved, and all puzzles must be completed to have true closure for the story.  There are no save points during these puzzles, and I can tell you for certain that you will die -- over and over again -- before you're able to figure things out.  The story-driven, take-your-time adventure is over, and is now filled with one complex, mind-bending puzzle after another.  Though I had a couple of ""how the heck am I supposed to get past that?"" moments, I was able to get through the main story without even thinking about about looking at a walkthrough.  The Void gameplay, though?  I couldn't figure out the very first screen! Mahaha~  I admit that I've had to look a couple of times, but I've been finding great joy in figuring things out on my own whenever I can.Am I finished with the game?  Not even close, but I'm enjoying every moment I spend playing. I can't even begin to tell you how beautifully-done this game is.  The combination of story with narration are poignant and thought-provoking, leaving us with a lot to consider, and I found it equally moving my second time through (the main story -- still working on the Void section!)  The music is beautiful, though I found it better to have the music and sound effects half the volume of the narration.  For me, it was the perfect balance.  I really loved everything about the game, and I can't recommend it highly enough!  Two thumbs up!			"

This is a masterpiece.There are no more words to explain the feels into you while you play this gameBEFORE START: if you play only one time this game you'll be sure that you're playing one of the best indies in the world.✔ Translation: well, I'm going to say my point of view here. I'm Spanish so I played 3 times in Spanish and I have never found an error because the developers are from Spain. However, the english translation is very good and all the game is related in English with a very very deep voice.✔ Art: B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L. That's the word... OH! I forgot to say the another word... PERFECT!✔ Replayeable: you can always play the story over and over again and again but the good point is this: if you start to memorize the levels you'll be ready to beat the story in the ""Void mode"" (this means more difficult) and you can always try to complete the game 100% with all the achievements.= Puzzles: in my point of view they're not hard or easy, it's a normal-difficult game, you need the enough skills to beat it.x Time (Normal story): the only bad thing is that the normal story time is too short for me.Conclusion:Buy it 1000 times. 100% recommendable.When I finished it I thought: Wow, now I know why it won those prizes... It's because it's a great game! "

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  NihilumbraDeveloper:  BeautiFun Games Publisher:  BeautiFun GamesGenre:  PlatformerGeneral ImpressionNihilumbra is one of the  few 2D platformers to which I could find no deficiency. It is a chain with no weak links. Everything from the way it looks, sounds and plays, feels perfect. Storywise, few platform games leave a more poignant impression in regards to the levels themselves which seem deserted and devoid of any chromatic diversity until the protagonist arrives. Color plays an important role in Nihilumbra (loose Latin translation for “shadow of nothing”), since you will face more puzzles than enemies in this game. The use of colors in altering the landscape and avoiding obstacles bares a powerful contrast to the barren levels. While it never becomes too easy, after completing the first playthrough you unlock the Void mode, which significantly increases the difficulty. The game’s asking price is fully justified and you have both Achievements and Cards. Nihilumbra remains more of a contemplative journey than one filled with action and combat. And that is exactly what sets it apart from generic platform titles which fail to deliver a story.  Strong Points+ Interesting game concept, storyline and effects.+ Diversified levels with two game modes.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- None.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I can`t believe that I didn`t played Nihilumbra earlier. Its a wonderful game. playing this game has a lot of feelings, its like beeing in an endless dream, full of hope, sadnes and happiness. But also it can feel being in a therapy, with an doctor who tells you how its feel to be depressive and how importan it is to feel that you can be something who can change the world, if not for others then for your selfe. All begins with a birth and all end with death.You are a little nothing in this game, born as nothing and you thing you are nothing, but the more the speaker tells you  the more you try to win. You learn and you see like a child, slowly but powerful, you learn that a little thing can be a little light, that this changes can move mountains.  its like awakening from a depression into a live, a live you can love.This game is an Artwork! its wonderfull and I`m happy that I finaly started to play this game!10 of 10 PointsPros:MusicLevel DesignAtmosphereStoryeasy to playcan be hard to masterdifferent colors for abilitiesContra:For now there is no contra			"

												This game is beautiful, the art style and the gameplay are so peculiar. It's a nice puzzle game where you must find a way through different scenarios using your abilities, kind of easy at the start but the void difficulty is insane. The lore is weird, simple but cool (maybe nihilistic). I like puzzle games which have an innovative gameplay and let you use different strategies for solving problems this is one of them.10/10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												This game is weird looking but with beautiful environments.  You have a narrator to help you in your journey and an amazing soundtrack.  It's basically a platform game with a unique style of its own.  It is rather short with only six (6) sections to explore.   What made the gameplay standout, is the way you can manipulate your environment with just a simple stroke of your mouse.  When you pick a color and move your mouse it paints your suroundings.  If you choose blue, the terrain becomes slippery; green makes it more springy; brown makes it sticky; red burns things and yellow conducts electricity.The game appeals more to a much younger audience but I am still glad I purchased it.  It is one of the best platform games out there.  I recommend this to everyone.  Go and pick one now.			"

												It's a good puzzle-platformer, a well-done one, with no bugs or glitches and a pretty interesting gameplay concept, but it's still far from my favorites. It's got its merits, and I can only recommend it for them, but it made me appreciate it without liking it. Why? Well, there are some downsides, that many could easily ignore, but for me they were important:- that narrator was a really bad idea. It seems like an attempt to recreate the Bastion one, but a shallow, totally unsuccessful one that rather annoys and feels unnecessary.- the controls are only partially accurate. When it matters the most, like when trying to get the Pacifist achievement, one can easily notice they're rather clunky and imprecise.- the game idea / storyline is somehow just pretentious. Yeah, I get it, void, searching, profundity, philosophy, whatnot, but it never really ""communicates"" something to me, it doesn't come with any true revelation or original idea. It ends up feeling just as superficial as the narrator's texts.Anyway, I loved the background music, the graphics are nice, and the gameplay concept of using the colors to transform the world is really interesting in my opinion, and captivating.

												Nihilumbra is a platformer with a few twists. You go through many different enviroments while learning about colors, its abilities as well as yourself. The game revolves around the subject of life, death and existence. It really gets to you sometimes...having to reconsider all that you know. This game isn't complete without puzzles, some are self-explanatory while others require some thinking. There are achievements that are really easy to acquire, while others require patience and practice. Overall, the concept is unique for a standard platformer.Highly recommend it for those looking into some good platformers. Rating: 8.5/10			"

												There are dozens― hundreds, no doubt― of platformers that mimick this one in execution, you might be presuming. There are plenty of games with an art style similarly atmospheric, others that use colour or shadow as a gameplay mechanic. What about Limbo? Contrast? Why entertain this indie game when you can play those? It certainly isn't the first platformer to capture my heart, but there is something undeniably special about Nihilumbra and it would be a crime to dismiss its own merits because you've met your quota for indie games this year. Nihilumbra is a bleak but beautiful puzzle-platformer, stunning in its simplicity, that struck a chord with me in an emotionally cathartic, personal way. I cannot recommend it highly enough.You are Born, an adorable creature from The Void, who spends the game fleeing because The Void wants you back where you belong. Home. The darkness. Born must run from the all-consuming Void, adapting to his new and vibrant surroundings in the real world, encountering enemies generated by The Void, with ever intensifying (occassionally timed) puzzle-solving. His desperation to escape inevitable capture at the clutches of this nothingness is not unlike struggling with depression and it resonated so powerfully with me I was all the more encouraged to keep on going. I was compelled to help Born live.The story mode's puzzles are splendidly straightforward― yes, this could be a turn off for some― but it does allow for appreciation of other aspects of the game, such as:• The story itself. Nihilumbra becomes less about the puzzles and more about the message behind the storytelling, which is profound in an uncomplicated sort of way.• The somewhat unique gameplay mechanic of using colour to traverse platforms and solve puzzles. With a flick of your mouse you can coat the floor with red to burn away the shadow of a skeletal monster or propel yourself with icy blue across a previously unconquerable gap.• The art. You can enjoy it in game or from the concept art section of the main menu, which unlocks as you finish each level. The enemy design is fittingly simplistic but interesting as well, with an Edward Gorey flair. • It boasts a sublime soundtrack, which is understated but accompanies the game well. • The narrator's voice is flat (deliberately, I believe, but I might be wrong) and ominous. He often points out the obvious and it reiterates how dire a situation Born is in. Although there is an option to turn the narrator off or lower the volume, I much prefer the game with him. He adds to the sense of despondency, but I realise this is a matter of debate. • The aptly named ""Void Mode"" which unlocks once you've completed the main story. This mode is tough as nails. I would argue that you haven't truly experienced what the game has to offer if you haven't subjected yourself to the teeth-grindingly frustrating (but ultimately doable) Void Mode. It is much more unforgiving and a decent challenge for those who thought the main game was a breeze.Nihilumbra is well worth the asking price and it's a steal on sale. If nothing else, it's an easy, ethereal endeavour that should only require a couple of hours of your time to show you it is not a game to be ignored.			"

Note: video review embedded below.There’s a specific scene you revisit a few times throughout Nihilumbra. It begins with you falling, the world having been twisted into something surreal, yet oddly soothing. You don’t stay here long, but it was within these brief moments that I was able to collect the scattered thoughts swirling around in my head that I had previously been unable to make sense of.These scenes represented to me what Nihilumbra was on a conceptual level. They’re beautiful, empty, and meaningless. The reason I was finding it so hard to take something away from Nihilumbra was because there was nothing there. It’s a gorgeous experience filled with expression, but its aesthetics are simply a mask with nothing underneath.Nihilumbra tries relentlessly to carve out a philosophical core within its narrative, but it comes across as venting the poorly formed ideas of someone who has given up on the world rather than something profound. The writing feels forced and lacks any impact, obnoxiously attempting to make you feel something - anything - by simply stating those feelings as if that is somehow enough to bring them into existence. Ultimately the constant reminders that I was supposed to feel guilty or scared only caused me to become despondent and annoyed.The detached way in which Nihilumbra handles morality makes it feel as if it doesn’t really care. It wants to come across as deep without having anything to actually say, filling its world with empty words that bounced off me as quickly as they reappeared.Eventually I simply tuned the writing out and attempted to focus on the puzzle designs instead, yet doing this only brought out how similarly hollow and disinteresting those elements were too. Controlling various elemental powers which can be painted on the environment should provide endless interesting applications, but Nihilumbra never even scratches that surface. It provides you new tools at a steady pace but never a creative way to use them.Puzzle designs repeat the same basic ideas the entire way through, often requiring no forethought as the answer is simply a slightly altered version of the tutorial. Nihilumbra isn’t just easy, it’s numbingly repetitive and unstimulating. The only time I felt challenged was in navigating the interface, which while not terrible tended to feel awkward and more suited to its touch-based origins than a mouse and keyboard. But then as if to mock me, completing the game unlocks “void mode”, which far from the simplistic main game radically raises the difficulty with cheap trial and error level designs. This doesn’t in turn make them any more engaging however, as the only thing being tested is your patience and how quickly you can move your fingers, rather than your puzzle solving skills.Nihilumbra is such an exquisite game to look at, that it’s disheartening to see such lovely artwork was wasted on an experience that only manages to dull the senses. It functions, but provides no incentive to spend even a few hours to complete it. Playing it felt almost like it was actively pushing me out, unintentionally but forcefully, as if despite having outrun the void pursuing me it had already devoured the game itself.

												Nihilumbra is a puzzle platform game that has you playing the role of a big worthless blob of nothing from the void. Eventually you turn into a scarecrow looking dude and gain the power of colors. Like your first power, which lets you paint ice onto things so you can slide around. This puzzle element is really well done and interesting. You run into monsters and learn to avoid them using your wits and new powers. It plays out a bit like Oddworld from this point on, which is a good thing for me. This game is slick, innovative and worth checking out if you like puzzle platformers that don't involve direct combat.Watch the full review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP124			"

												A great artistic game. You are Born, a Void being running away from the Void, wondering what to do. In your journey to get away from the Void, you pickup up 5 colours, Blue, Green, Brown, Red and Yellow. These colours give you interesting powers when you paint with them and allow you to escape the Void. However, you inadvertently destroy 5 major locations as the Void chases after and there is a New Game Plus that allows you to right everything wrong. Conclusion : A must play. It will remind you of games such as Portal 2 and Max:The Curse of Brotherhood.PROS1. Novel MonstersKlimethCustodissLaser Cannon Void CreaturesSkelegothsFlower MonsterColour Absorber Flower2.

												Nihilumbra raises questions about life and existence during its (3 hour or so) story. It's an unique game. One that I really enjoyed. It's a puzzle platformer game that's light on the puzzles; you have to use one or more of 5 colors to paint the landscapes and that way solve these puzzles. Paint the landscape green to jump, paint it brown to stick to the ground or use stealth, paint it yellow to generate electricity etc. At the beginning you'll use only one color, but after a few levels you'll be combining two or more colors in order to advance. The puzzles are never hard and even the most casual gamer will know how to solve these.The voice acting is ok-ish. The narrator has a boring, uninteresting voice. I think no voice acting would've worked better in this case.The graphics look okay for the most part. The environments are just perfectly fine, but the character you control as well as the enemies around you seem to lack animation frames. It all looks really basic and wooden in motion. A terrible shame. A few more frames would've definitely benefited this game. I didn't get immersed into the game and I think it's because of this. It's just too obvious. Anyway, enough about the animations. Nihilumbra is a clever game that all gamers can and probably will enjoy. If not for the gameplay, then most likely for the story it's trying to tell. Recommended.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												I'm kind of surprised there weren't more indie games with strong narrators released in the wake of Bastion. Then again, it's probably a good thing because strong narrators require excellent writing and voice acting. That didn't stop the people behind Nihilumbra from taking a swing at it, and luckily they paired their efforts with a very solid puzzle platformer.You play a sentient piece of the Void, the nothingness that inevitably consumes all of existence. As you progress through the many regions of the world, the unnamed narrator describes how your little Voidperson learns of emotions and hope and all that jazz. Especially in the early game, the narrator has a real bad case of never-shut-the-hell-up-itis, delivering some seriously overwrought lines almost every single screen. While many of them are the tiresome ""You are nothing"" or ""They are coming"" sorts, the writing does improve the further you get in, which was a welcome discovery.The actual platforming revolves around painting the world with the colors you find. Each region you travel to grants you a color to use, such as the blue from the snowfields that makes surfaces icy and slick. Levels are laid out in a way that eases you into learning how your new color works, showing you how to combine it with other colors, and then tests you in auto-scrolling escape sequences before moving on to the next land. The puzzles are all clever and fun to solve without being repetitive or all that challenging. Interestingly, the game keeps giving you new powers right up to the final stage, so there's always something to look forward to.The reason for this is a Void Mode unlocked once you beat the game, which consists of remixes of the base levels. In stark contrast to the originals these start out incredibly hard and only grow more ludicrous. If I have one complaint about Nihilumbra, it's that there's really no Normal difficulty. The base game is practically a two-hour tutorial, and Void Mode is the Dark World from Super Meat Boy. I doubt that most will have the patience to plow through Void Mode, but honestly the two hours I spent in the base game was enough to make me happy. The art is clean and creative and the platforming, while a bit floaty, is a good match for the color gimmick. For charming or challenging puzzle platforming, this one fits the bill just fine.			"

												Nihilumbra is a poetic 2D platform game.In my opinion, it's very similar to Limbo, but the game  also made me think about Another World and Heart Of Darkness for the design, the level-design and the gameplay.The poetic side of the game is reinforced by the off-voice of the narrator in almost every screen of the story mode.The story mode is not very difficult, and its main purpose is to tell a poetic story, the birth of the protagonist from the void, and his discovery of our world through different and various landscapes.The gameplay is based on the mastering of colours, which have different properties, such as the possibility to slide, or to bounce, etc...Once you've finished the story mode, you unlock the void mode.Here, forget about the story, the poetism and the narration, it's all about thinking, skill and timing.The void mode visits all levels of the story mode once again and modifies them into much harder puzzle levels.It's somehow like the dark world in Super Meat Boy, but in a more easier way though.I had a good time with this game, and I recommend it to every Limbo-like lovers.Nihilumbra has just one big problem : its length.It'll take you about 3 hours (maximum) to finish the story mode, and maybe the double to beat the void mode, depending on your skills.

												One of the most original game I have ever played. It's a platform game with a tale about sens of life, colours embellished with great artism put into it's graphics. Your eyes are going to feast by watching well-drawn stuff, starting landscapes through enemies and ending on small elements. This game is also innovative because of it's mechanics based on the manipulation of various colours used to beat each level. Finishing basic storyline will be a short (but with great atmosphere) experience, although you have also a hard mode called ""Void Mode"".I can fully recommend it for people who like platform games with original content.

												This is a beautiful game with a stirring atmosphere and mood. A puzzle-platformer at it's core, it is immersive enough to make you forget that you're solving puzzles or dodging strange other-wordly creatures but feels more like a story that you're enjoying and experiencing.I don't play many puzzle games and I still loved it so don't overlook this game because of the puzzle factor! I found the puzzles to be just right - they were sufficiently rewarding and never too frustrating to solve. The platforming is pretty straight forward and enhanced by some of the unique abilities the protagonist acquires (eg: being able to shoot a sticky-mud thing onto walls to cling onto or shooting bouncy grass or ice to reach sections otherwise inaccessible. There's some nice creativity at the core of this game.Once you complete the main story (arguably not quite a 'story' in the traditional sense but still immensely enjoyable...) you unlock a harder version of the game - same areas with more complex puzzles. These, I safely avoided due to my aforetold indifference to hardcore puzzle games but that does add good replay value and may strike a chord with the puzzler in you.In all - this is an excellent Indie title. You can even try the demo from the developer's website I believe if you're on the fence.PS: IIRC I spent more than the 3.5 hours reported by Steam on this game (probably spent offline) but in any case this is a short game without any doubt, so bear that in mind.

												Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer, with more emphasis on puzzle and less emphasis on platformer.  I'm usually pretty terrible at platformers, but I'd even classify it as ""not hard but fun.""  I rarely requires very much precision in timing.  There are places where you might be pressed a bit with timing and precision, but that's certainly not the emphasis.You play with a combination of keyboard and mouse.  With one hand you control movement (left, right, jump); and with the mouse hand you control the deployment of ""colors"" which change the characteristics of the terrain around you.  For instance, one of the first colors is blue, which is slippery, and if you apply blue to a surface it becomes slippery, allowing you to go faster and/or build up momentum.  There are secondary effects, such as making your enemies slide also.  Other colors have different effects such as bounciness, stickiness, etc.Again, I'm usually terrible at platformers and I enjoyed this, so if you're more into puzzle aspects of games, and less into platforming, I'd say give this a go if you're interested.  For those of you who are more hardcore platformers, there is a more difficult void mode of the game that is much more challenging than the regular game that unlocks at game completion.  The more difficult mode is far more difficulty than I was looking for, but it might be good for those looking for something requiring more precision and quickness.			"

												If there is one thing that could be held against Nihilumbra, it’s the game’s massive difficulty spike. There’s just no middle ground between “too easy” and “way too hard”.  If you consider yourself more of a casual puzzle solver, you’d better pick up Nihilumbra when it’s discounted.  It’s a well-made game and you will enjoy its first half.  If you’re ready for a challenge that keeps you engaged for a long time, the game is definitely worth its $9.99 price tag.  Altogether, this is an impressive first effort for a small studio. If you’re fond of the puzzle platformer genre, Nihilumbra is a must buy.(read my full review here[truepcgaming.com])			"

												I went into this game not really expecting much, just an average adaptation of a Steam game from an app, but I was pretty surprised with how well this game translated, and I would even say that the PC version was better! Basically, you take control of a being created by ""The Void"", who is searching through the world, trying to discover what he is and where he belongs. Along this journey, he takes control of many different elemental powers, which makes up the basic gameplay. This may sound like an overused story with a basic platformer, but the game is extremely charming and a load of fun. Top it off with the low price of $9.99, a good soundtrack, and an overall great atmosphere, and you have a game that I can't help but recommend. The only downside that I can see with this game is the brutally punishing difficulty curve, via Void Mode. You basically go from a game that even young kids could play with relative ease, to a game that I doubt the developers themselves could beat with ease, but that's not necesarrily a bad thing, especially to anybody who wants a good challenge and added replay value. Just be prepared to be left floored by some of the especially challenging levels. Overall, this is a game that I really enjoyed playing through, and I recommend it to any platforming fans that are looking for a good side-project.Rating: 7.5/10			"

												Nihilumbra is about destruction. Basically the main character Is born in the void. He then leaves the void to live and see the world. However, the void follows him, creating monsters to slow/end his journey. He moves from location to location, damning each one by passing through it.Nihilumbra is a platformer/puzzle game. You spend most of the first campaign running and jumping with no combat ability. You never get a direct face to face combat option but you get a way to kill enemies. I think this adds to the appeal. Nihilumbra has some great platforming and some seriously challenging puzzles. Sometimes both are required.The gameplay involves color which you use to change the surfaces around you by clicking the mouse. During the main campaign the narrator will speak about what you're doing and question the nature of it. I loved the nihilistic tones and questions of meaning. Existing only to stay alive. Destroying things by your existance. It's a fun idea to explore.There's a second campaign that's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥and  I haven't got very far in itBuy it.			"

												The game title pretty much sums up the game content ; Nihilumbra is the union of two latin words, Nihil ( Nothing ) and Umbra ( Shadow ) ---> you're a shadow made of nothing,literally. Your main goal in this action game is to survive and avoid your natural enemy,which is also your philosophical father, ""The Void"" or Death,call it how you want. The game will reveal its best aspect when played in New Game+,known also as ""Void Mode"". This game has a nice longevity ( 13-14 hours ) and it will surely pleasure your eyes. The gameplay is solid; your charachter will gain new and new abilities troughout the entire game.Note that this game deals with philosophical issues like death,nihilism and hope.This game is a little pearl,touch it with silken gloves.

												Game: NihilumbraPublisher: BeautiFun Games Gameplay:Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer which heavily depends upon the use of five colours. Your main goal throughout the game is mostly solve the puzzles and kill monsters using the power of your colours which have various different properties like Burn, Stick, Electricity, Slide and Bounce. All the areas in the game has a different colour scheme which requires you to use the given powers in a different manner each time. Nihilumbra is divided into two parts: A tutorial sort of Story mode, and the Void mode. The story mode is quite short lasting around 4 hours and relatively much easier than the latter. Void mode is where the real meat of the game lies. It is difficult to cross, no one holds your hands during these levels and sometimes it can be brutal to surpass these levels. Overall, Nihilumbra presents a different kind of gameplay which is not seen much in today’s games. VisualsThe art of Nihilumbra is very unique.  It lends beautifully to the atmosphere created by the gameplay. It helps create a very solid environment which doesn’t let go until the very end. As the gameplay relies mostly on the use of various colours, the visuals do make you feel as if all the different colours are popping on the screen. It also helps that the protagonist is entirely purplish black which shows how much the colours might mean to him. The visuals are sharp and very intelligently done. Nihilumbra sports a visual style which will remain in your minds for quite some time. Sound and MusicWhile not as exceptional as the above explained visuals, the sounds still do a good enough job to support the environment of the game with minimal soundtrack while you are doing absolutely nothing and some intense music during the final stages of the game. It really helps set the mood right and helps the game grow to another level where it really shines.While it is nothing that we haven’t heard before, it still shows that a good soundtrack combined with solid and unique visuals can create a strong atmosphere.PerformanceNihilumbra has spent time on the shelves and runs buttery smooth with no crashes, screen tearing or freezing at any given point of time. I did encounter a couple of bugs but nothing took me out of the immersion or broke the game. It is a very stable game which might even run on even the lower-end of the computers.OverallNihilumbra is a very good game which captures your attention from the get go and never lets go. It’s unique visual style and a solid gameplay really deserves the applause and it is a game you won’t regret buying. The story mode might be short but the Void mode more than makes up for it.

												LOVED THIS GAME!  I wish it was 5x as long!  I would play it to the end.  I became very fond of the main character and I adored the narrative that happens throughout the game.  The art is interesting and (if I remember correctly) I enjoyed the music.  Fun stuff.			"

												This game is a mixed bag from first glance. Honestly, the first half of the game is very dry and has copious amounts of needless narration. The narration is so rampant that you have to sit still each screen just to hear it, and honestly little is being said. To borrow from Shakespeare: the narrator speaks an infinite deal of nothing. It left a bad taste in my mouth as I felt the world could speak for itself in most cases. Less narration is more in this sense; the only reason why Bastion got away with gobs of narration is because there were interesting things to say, which were said in colorful ways. Do yourself a favor and drag the narration volume slider all the way to the left. The text alone, ironically, is more immersive since the narrator ends up getting cut off mid-sentence during normal play.That said, the second half of the game is good. Don't get me wrong: the story is interesting, but the color mechanic is the real star of this game. The initial game is mostly a tutorial, while the void stages allow you to get creative with solving the problems ahead of you using the five colors you acquire during the main game. Many puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, some of them probably in ways not intended by the developer. However, I ran in to two major problems.First off, there's some collision issues in the game, and often they can break puzzles entirely. In some cases, they are surmountable obstacles, such as the player's character getting snagged by the terrain. Those same snags, though, can send the player bouncing in different directions when using the green color. It's frustrating to be punished by the game for using the powers as intended.Second, bullet collision is absolutely broken when vsync is on. It took me a while to figure this out, but my experience was tarnished by it. Several puzzles required bouncing bullets using the green color, and often those bullets would inexplicably implode before hitting a target. Some of the collision is off in the game, such as metal boxes, but turning off vsync at least allows the player to finish the game.I definitely enjoyed the second half of the game way more than the first half, so take that with a grain of salt (and maybe wait for a sale), but I can still say this game is decent enough for someone looking for an interesting puzzle/platformer hybrid.

												I bought this game during Steam's winter sale for mere few bucks without expecting much. Just the fact that I've bothered to write a review with a recommendation should make obvious the fact that I got more than I expected. While the gameplay itself is cool (puzzle/platformer with a twist), the animations are great and the music isn't half bad either, what got me really interested is the story, or better yet - the storytelling. The way the game is being presented somewhat reminds be of Bastion. You're introduced to a creature you know nothing about (the character you play), running from a mysterious enemy while discovering new worlds and developing along the way. Just like in Bastion, the narrator's script and voice acting make the game really easy to get into, and so far it seems like it's not getting old too quickly, either, as the game introduces a fun, original aspect of learning and using abilities.That element, as in ""the twist"" I mentioned on the first paragraph, is the use of ""colors"" as abilities. Every color represents an ability with specific functions, and you have to figure out what colors you need to use in order to solve a puzzle, defeat an enemy or deal with any other type of obstacle you encounter. The first color you discover is blue. When you ""paint"" a surface blue, you can run faster on that surface, allowing you to gain more momentum and jump farther than you could without it. As you advance to new worlds, you discover more colors which in turn, give you new abilities. Sometimes it's necessary to combine two or more colors in order to solve a problem, as the puzzles become more and more challenging as you get farther in the game. In conclusion, this game is really fun, and I recommend it to anyone who likes platformers. Definitely worth it!			"

												A nice logic game, with a deep story. Can get challenging and definitely gives you many fun by playing it. Escape the Void and learn what it is to be alive. Collect different colors and use them to make your way through. Fight, run, outtrick and save yourself and the world. Definitely a game worth to be played. "

												I beat this game. And I hated it. The narrator never shuts up. Potentially, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But he has nothing to say. Almost EVERY screen he has some mundane remark to make. In the few instances the puzzles actually DID take multiple attempts to solve I just became even MORE infuriated because every time I freaking die, I have to come right back to YOU NEED TO KEEP RUNNING. RUNNING AND RUNNING AND RUNNING. WHAT IS THE POINT IN RUNNING? WHY MUST YOU KEEP RUNNING. BUT YOU MUST KEEP RUNNING. I just wanna yell at the guy. Oh my god. Shutupshutupshutupshutup! RAAAA. ok. I'm ok.♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now that I think about it, I shoulda checked to see if there was a option to mute him. Doubt it.Anyways, IN TERMS OF AESTHETICISM  the game has some kewl concepts, but aside from the kewlness value of piggy backing onto other things that do a ""void"" concept with more success (lovecraft, D&D...uh, any other horror or fantasy game with ""cultists"" in it) that's about all the game has going for it. It reminded me of Party of Sin in terms of stale-ness. Then again, it DOES manage to incorporate game mechanics better than Party of Sin in admittedly sleepily easy puzzles to solve. But while we're on the topic, without spoliers (idk why I'm avoiding spoilers, there's nothing to spoil anyways) I did play the game through to the end with a pessimistic curiosity to see if the story would go anywhere, but...well...it's about as deep as The Grinch. Original, not Jim Carey version. There was not much to that ending. I would have been disappointed if I wasn't just so glad to finally finish the damn thing so I can delete my files and transfer it to my ""Uninstall Hell"" tab in my library.IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY: At the beginning of the second level, I realized that this game not only had a narrator constantly jibber jabbering almost SOLELY to ""fill a void"" as it were [heeheeheehee*snort*], but that the gameplay was going to be extremely formulaic. Namely: 1) FIND FLOWER 2) TRY OUT POWER [three: we just gotta, like...become one with nature, mee-unn] REAL3)BACK TRACK SHORT DISTANCE 4) LEARN 2 OR 3 THINGS POWER CAN DO 5) RUN [AKA walk] FROM VOID. There are five (if you don't count the void) levels and they are almost exactly the same except for the new power added each level and...I guess volcano had rising lava and darkness in it. Now that I think about it, the whole game felt almost like a tutorial of itself. They held my hand so firmly that it's all sweaty and gross now. Eeeugh. The ONLY reason I didn't permanently scrap this game after the first five minutes of the second level was because I still had cards to drop and by the time I got to volcano I figured I might as well see if the ending was any good since I'd gotten this far (It wasn't. See above.)I have not played the after story puzzles, which based on accidentally clicking the first one I imagine may actually be challenging, but...I'm done. I'm done with this game. I beat the story. I put in my two hours and am thoroughly dissatisfied enough to never play again.I'm not a pro gamer by any means, but story mode was easy. Very easy. And given how shallow the plot is I think if I were to recommend a target audience for this game I would suggest...middle skoolers. Or anyone who just wants to play a spooky shadow guy in a video game more than anything else. To anyone potentially interested I STRONGLY recommend maybe watching a stream or something before buying this to see if the narrator irks you as much as he did me or if the repetitive gameplay still looks fun enough that you'd still want to rinse and repeat for two hours.

												I. Love. This. Game.I am one of those people that really loves the narration.  It reminds me of Portal mixed with this cool flash animation I once played.  The artwork is awesome, and I love the color scheme.  It was a lot of fun to play.Now for a more in-depth review:Main Story: This is a really nice indie puzzle game, and the feel is similar to Portal.  The concept of the colors is nice, but it does get repetitive the further you get into the game.  Accept that you'll die a few times on some of the levels because you won't be prepared for what's coming.  The puzzles are simple, though.  If anything, play through the entire main story.  It's short and worth trying.  Void Mode: Void mode is hard!  I'll give them that.  It's a nice challenge, but at times, it seems to be a little too difficult.  You have to have the timing just right to get through the levels.  As void mode goes on, you'll notice that some levels are super difficult and some are super easy.  It feels like the developers might have been running out of ideas as it goes on (or just gave up - the cave levels on void mode are super easy).  I got through the entire thing without help, so it's doable.  Just accept that you'll die many, many, many times to get through it.Secret Language: If you get to this point, it is worth playing through the main storyline in the secret language.  It appears just to be the developer's rant mode.  Some of it is really stupid, but some of it is really funny...especially the end.  The one thing I didn't like is that they assumed that you are most likely a guy playing.  Ummmm...no.  I find that slightly offensive since I'm a girl and a gamer.Achievements: They are super reasonable and at just the right difficulty.  I'll admit I did look up which level the Easter egg was hidden (though I didn't look up where in the level).  I would have eventually found it if I replayed the entire game again to look for it.  I saved that achievement for last (after already having played the game through three times), and I was being lazy.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game.  I don't think it's for everyone, but it is a fun way to pass the time.  Yes, it's worth the cost with or without a sale.  :)			"

												Nihilumbra seems to be automatically compared to LIMBO by those who have played both, and rightly so as they are quite similar. However, where LIMBO is dark, eerie and gorgeously gothic, Nihilumbra revels in the atmospheric use of colour and an inventive, immersive style of puzzle-based challenges. The idea is to find and use ""colours"" to change your environment to allow you to move through it in different ways, overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. The visuals are stunning, with an oil-painting feel and beautiful rendering. The captions and voice-over in story mode are beautifully done and almost reminiscent of being read a story from a picture book, but with deep meaning-of-life type of stuff going on. I almost felt the need to take constant screen shots to capture the beauty of the ""pages""! Moreover, for those looking for a real challenge, the Void Mode that comes after the main story line will make you weep blood - the puzzles require a serious amount of thought (one of the achievements is to die 10 times in a row on Void Mode, which I achieved with depressing ease and totally unintentionally on my first attempt at the first level!) but that just makes it all the more rewarding when you finally find the solution. I bought this game on a bit of a whim and I'm so glad I did, I love it.  I think the metascore is a little on the low side; this is a wonderful, beautiful and challenging little platform game that I recommend to everyone.			"

												I think Nihilumbra kinda went under the radar for pretty much anyone or maybe I wasn't paying enough attention to the news. Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer with a very unique looking to it, you start the game being born in The Void and after you escape you end up on a strange world where The Void sends his creatures and it's coming to get you. The plot of this game along with a mindblowing soundtrack is what make them one of the best puzzle platformers of this year. According to the narrator, which identity remains a secret, The Void is one and you can't simply escape the void, he needs you in order to become one and that's why he's after you. [MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS FROM NOW ON] Your journey is divided in various environments ,you'll  travel to cold montains, a desert, a forest, volcanic fields and a city. Each of this places will great you an unique power which comes into place in the form of a colour and you can use them by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor on any surface, the montains grant you the blue colour which when used on any surface will make that surface slippery which will alow you to run or slide faster, the forest will grant you the green colour which if you jump on it it grants you a huge jump boost and sometimes is used for changing enemy projectiles course, in the desert you'll gain access to the brown colour which will grant you the power to slow things down or making you walk stealthly and even get enemies trapped in corners, the volcanic fields of course will grant you the red colour which when an enemy steps on it (including yourself) it will start burning and this is the first time you can actually kill an enemy by yourself and last but by no means least, the city which takes a huge role on the story grants you the colour yellow which represents electricity. During your journey you'll not only use the last power you've earned but you'll also need to remember what you've learned before. When you step into the Cold Montains you feel that you're in a different place from the void, it's cold. When you go into the forest you'll start to notice that everything in it is alive, the trees, the plants, and that starts to make you feel alive in some way, because before you were nothing, you were void. When you go to the Desert you immediately notice it's warmer there than the previous two locations and you start to wonder if you're actually starting to have ""something"" inside of you. After that comes the volcanic fields in which you feel it's even hotter than the desert and you realize your journey started cold, then warm and now hot and that someone makes you think that you're actually becoming ""something"". And last, the city, which was once inhabited by someone, there you'll start wondering if those people were actually the ones that doomed this world and not yourself, since the void has been consuming everything while it's after you, the forest, the montains, the volcanos, the desert, everything. And so you realize that youre death is inevitable, it wouldn't matter if you kept running, even though you wanted to be alive, there's no life without death and so you let yourself be consumed by the void but... the void rejects you because throughtout your journey you've consumed the colours and each one of the elements and you've become alive, ""the void is nothing and there's nothing in you"". And so you become free... but the game doesn't end here. After this end you'll unlock ""The Void Mode"" which is basicly you fighting off the void that has consumed the world in order to clean your conscience. Nihilumbra is certainly not a game for everyone, but if you enjoy a great story, very emotional and meaningful then my friend, this game is certainly for you. One of the best indie puzzler platformers I've ever played. I recommend it 100%, please buy it because I don't think it got the attention it deserved.			"

												After finishing the game, I was going to give it a thumbs down. My world has changed after I tried the ""Void Mode"" (unlocked after you finish the regular game).To summarize, the basic game is too easy. There is a narrator (inspired by Bastion?) but Dear Lord, how I wanted him DEAD. The dialogues are BORING, unnecessary, repetitive and sound like a bored teenager philosophysing. The voice acting is... weird. It was so annoying I turned it off. Just to remark here, I loved the narrator in Bastion.The Void Mode game not only does NOT have a narrator, but also gives you considerably more challange. Some puzzles require some dexterity, but most of them require only pure logic. If I could give it a number, it would be 6.5/10			"

												The game is absolutely amazing: the art is nice, the main character really makes you want to help him escape (isn`t he cute in his own way?), original stages are not too difficult so they will not make you want to bite someone`s head off. BUT! If you have problems with your nerves - NEVER try the Void mode! While playing it I personally wanted to destroy not only the game enemies but the game itself as my main enemy. Along with my laptop... Along with my table...And everything close enough...So, be careful with the Void mode, because it can become really tricky. But all in all, you should love the game. And don`t forget to check the art in the Gallery ^^			"

ScenicBorn is a creature formed by The Void (AKA nothingness) which slowly apprehends the aspects of its world carried by the natural flow.The feelings and changes it experiences are very human, so you can easily relate to it. Of short duration, with an easy gameplay - from time to time you may have to think and act quickly.Nevertheless being nihilistic, the graphics and background music create a perfect mix for a really cute relaxing game.Personally, I didn't think about my inner self while playing this game; I was peacefully exploring the world of Born, while making empathy. The atmosphere is really nice and permits you to enter smoothly the surreal, yet so familiar, world of Nihilumbra.			"

												Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer in which you play a scarecrow-like character that is formed from The Void. As you progress, you learn to paint different colours which you can use to manipulate the world and escape from/kill enemies. For example, paint a wall brown and you can stick to it, paint a floor red and things on top of it will be set on fire.  I bought this game because it looked kinda similarish to LIMBO (which I thought was great), but any likeness really ends with the main character being a silhouette. The puzzles in Nihilumbra are generally quite easy (granted I haven't played it in Void Mode yet, which is unlocked after you beat the main game, and looks more difficult), which, depending on your POV, may be a selling point or a negative.  Beyond the level of difficulty, the game is set up to work against frustration, with frequent checkpoints and hints.  The art appears a bit rushed in some areas (some backgrounds are pretty blurry), but is solid enough, and conveys the atmosphere of the game. The Art Gallery, which you unlock as you progress through the game, is a nice feature--I found the development character sketches cool to look at.The main problem I had with this game is the narrative: the heavy-handed narrator talks on nearly every screen, beating you over the head with the meaning behind the game, explaining what to do next, describing things you JUST did, repeating the same things over and over. A game in which you play someone discovering the world should have... well, more of a sense of discovery, rather than someone telling you what's what. At one point the narrator says ""you are not a child anymore. You can do things on your own"" and I was ""YES! Now he'll leave me alone!"", but alas no, he was back on the next screen. If you can ignore the narrator and are looking for a easy puzzler in which you can make steady progress, Nihilumbra is a fine game.			"

												Nihilumbra is a game's name I cannot pronounce, but Nil is nothing and Umbra means Shadow, so you are Nothing's Shadow.  You are born of the void and manage to escape nothingness to a stark world.  But freedom comes at a high price as the void refuses to let you go, as you are apart of it.  Thus you condemn the world around you as you continue to escape the void as it swallows up where you have been.  Color is your weapon and tool, color is used to paint the landscape around you for an advantage of some kind.  Every panel seems to have a new bit of nerration to it.  This game is a must have and is up there with Bastion and Dust in my opinion.  Please buy it!			"

												Overall, I neither hated nor loved Nihilumbra.  If there was a ""Meh"" recommendation option, I'd pick that.The first half of the game is enjoyable, which I think most of the reviewers agree on, based on their play times.  The story is interesting and the mechanics are fun and easy to grasp.  8 fairly short levels in each of 5 areas, with a new color/ability found in each area.  There's nothing terribly unique or groundbreaking in the game, but it's 5-10 hours of fun if you just play through the storyline.On the other hand, the void mode -- which is unlocked after completing the storyline -- is aggravating.  I understand that it's meant to be challenging, but most of the challenge comes not from the puzzles or mechanics, but from the interface.  My main complaint with this part of the game is with the ""window"" effect -- instead of a smooth side-scroller, we get a series of screens which are mostly independent of each other, puzzle-wise.  Not a big deal until your screen/window resolution actually impacts where this transition occurs.  Too high a resolution, and critters from the next screen react to your presence.  Too low and you may not see a trap before it's too late.  Not to mention there are a few places where you'll want to sit near the edge of that transition area for at least a few seconds to size-up the next screen (I found 1600x1024 to be fairly good for most levels).With that said, the difficulty also varies wildly, and doesn't present a smooth ramp-up as you progress.  Some late-game levels are easily completable in a few minutes or less, while some mid-game levels requirie multiple retries due to timing/strategy (I'm looking at you, volcano area).If you can pick this up for under $5 and like a side-scrolling platformer, then definitely get it.  Otherwise, there are probably better games that deserve your time.			"

												Ugh, I hate this. I wouldn't say this game is recommendable, but at the same time, I can see why people like it. So, just read this review instead of simply looking at the thumbs up-icon to the right.Pros:1. It has a nice soundtrack. It can get repetitive after a while, but it still manages to create the right atmosphere.2. Enjoyable artwork. Of course, that's debatable, but I enjoyed it.3. The general idea of manipulating your environment. It's nothing new, but the abilities themselves are rather cool.Cons:1. The dialogues. Seriously, can't the voice actor just shut up? The acting actually isn't the problem, that's well done. But the dialogue itself is so atrocious and annoying and pretentious. I don't need a comment on everything there's happening. The game would have been _much_ better without any dialogue at all.2. Which brings me to the next point: Too easy. The puzzles are so easy to solve because most of the time you just have to use the one ability you just acquired. Combining abilities happened very seldom and if for some reason you are stuck, the game literally forces the solution upon you through the narrator and the hints. It's a puzzle game, I want to find the solution myself.3. The length. I don't have anything against short games, but the game can be completed within less than two hours. Then of course you can beat in the hardcore mode again, but that's not the solution. They could've added more content, really.4. The controls. The character is... ""wobbly"". It's really difficult to land accurate jumps and even more so, when I have to do the same section all over again, because the last checkpoint was two miles away.5. The tutorials. Okay, seriously. Why do I need those? Not only do you get to know the different abilities, before you can use them, but there's plenty of opportunities to test them out in the actual levels. I don't need a tutorial that basically teaches stuff I already know.So, do I recommend the game? For a discount, yeah, why not? At full price? Rather not, no. I don't know, the game feels a bit too pretentious, like it's trying to jump on the ""platformes with a deep background""-bandwagon we already know from Thomas Was Alone (which was excellent) and LIMBO (which was excellent as well).

												I have said ALOT about many Indie Titles. But this one in particular I was blown away from. Everything from your lonely protagonist to seeing the world dieing as you play to the music to the story is absolutely close to almost tear jerking. (Yes I almost cried at a video game if you can say that maturely it doesn't make you weak it makes you a VERY strong person.) Nihliumbra is now literally slated as my absolute favorite Indie title of possibly all time. Everything about it pulls you in. Would if I could buy a copy 100x over just to tell the developer I loved this game that much.			"

												A lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty pseudo deepness you'd expect from a highschooler who heard the word ""nihilism"" once and never tried to understand it further; stacked on top of the most basic platforming. The art is pretty enough, but the constant narrration kills the game and there's no way to turn it off. If there was more depth to any aspect of this game, it would be good enough that I would recommend it. Instead, it,s just that worst kind of good enough.			"

												There is a good game in here, but to get to it you must first plow through a rather dull, ~2 hour long story mode with mostly tutorial-level challenges and a narrative that sounds like a cross between Thomas was Alone and Bastion styles of narrative but very poorly executed (read: the narration is shallow, redundant and gets unbearably annoying after the first 15 minutes). At least you can turn the narrator off.Level design also has some issues, like the irregular, ""bumpy"" terrain and enemies with deceptively big hitboxes. Nothing major, but these can still annoy the player from time to time.Aside from that, it's a nice puzzle platformer with some good music. Nothing too special, but by no means bad.			"

												Honestely, this game is overlooked. And it's a crime.So what IS Nihilumbra? Without Spoiling anything, its about a little blob-thing (named Born, apparently) who tries to escape from the Void and make himself exist in the world. Does he suceed? Play the game. You'll find out.Gameplay-wise, it's a simple 2D Platformer/Puzzle game, implementing the use of different elements to continue your journey. Each element helps you in one particular way (e.g. brown makes you stick to walls/ceilings, red burns enemies and boxes, and so on). The main story is fairly simple, and can be completed in about an hour and a half or so. There is a harder mode called Void mode which does present a fairly difficult challenge, but wasn't as enjoying (at least, in my opinion). Visually, it's not bad. Not the best I've ever seen, but simple enough to do the job. It reminds me of Braid at times (the ""painting/storybook"" look).While I think the soundtrack isn't as memorable as other indie games, it is rather relaxing and easy on the ol' ear drums. I personally love the Void chase music.This is definitely a game that you want to take your time on, not because its difficult, but just to take it all in.The price is a bit over what I would pay for this kind of game (about $4-5), but if there's a sale, don't hesitate on picking it up. You won't regret it.			"

												Overall, I would just barely recommend this game. At this point I have only finished the story mode, I have yet to try Void mode, but I wanted to center my review on the base game first. The first three colours you receive are fun, and slightly reminiscent of Element41, which is a game I really enjoyed. But the last two seemed like they had a vision for the game based on 5 colours and no ideas left. There could also be a much easier way to switch between colours, like using the number keys or cycling through using q and e. That coupled with what I thought was really weird voiceover work (both the voice acting and the writing) were the two main flaws of the game. The voiceover sounds like the guy from truck commercials trying to sound omniscient and he just came off sounding kinda bored. What made matters worse, voiceover-wise, was the writing. I would say the writing is by far the weakest facet of the game. It's too explanatory. What makes games like Element41 great to play was the simplicity in the explanation, and they didn't overuse the voice to further the plot. Nihilumbra felt the need to explain every metaphor to death and back. Now for the positives:The level design was interesting, especially towards the end where there could have been a few different ways to use the colours to move ahead in the level. The atmosphere is very neat, and the creatures from the void had some cool designs. All in all, I don't regret buying this game on sale for $2.39, I'm not sure I would pay the full $7.99 list price for it as a relatively poor person. Get it on sale if you can, see if you like it.

It'll run on anything, and still look amazing. The story is very thoughtful and takes a little over 2.5 hours. There is a challenge mode called Void Mode for when you finish the story, and it is very difficult, so there is a lot of content here.

												Nihilumbra is ok. It's a puzzle platformer wherein the central mechanic is covering walls and floors with different substances to give them different properties like being bouncy or hot. It's not very hard at all. I got stuck for a little bit in a couple different places, but it was more not being able to execute correctly as opposed to being stumped as to what to do. It took around three hours to finish. There is a narrator that talks over a lot of the game and is weird. The mumbo jumbo being spewed made me wonder when the narrator was going to start asking me to join the church of Scientology. The look of the game is decent for a budget title. Overall, Nihilumbra is just ok. You probably won't be disappointed if you pick it up on sale.			"

												I picked this up during a Humble Bundle sale having never heard of it. I didn't know what to expect and really wasn't expecting much. To my surprise, Nihilumbra delivered and turned out to be one of the best and most underrated indie games I've ever played.Story:You are Born. Born was created from The Void but has somehow separated from it and is now in the world. However, The Void will not allow this and is now chasing Born in an attempt to suck him back into the darkness. In order for Born to escape The Void, he must allow everything else in his path be destroyed.Gameplay:Nihilumbra is a puzzle-platformer. As you progress through the game, Born will be granted new colors, which the player can use to paint the terrain in order to solve puzzles and aid him in his platforming. In total there are five different colors. Each have a different use and create a different effect. Throughout the game, Born will be accompanied by a narrator that will talk to him. It is uknown exactly who this narrator is whether he be Born, The Void or something else. The narrator really gives this game it's charm and gives insight to the world and what is going on. Sometimes he says some really philosophical things and it really adds to the atmosphere. Speaking of that, the atmosphere is amazing. The combination of colors, textures, music and narration sets a very solemn, yet relaxing mood. The main part of the game is very short. It only took me about 4 hours to complete. However, once you complete it, you'll unlock “Void Mode” which is essentially hard mode. Void Mode offers the same levels but with different and much harder puzzles.Conclusion:Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone that's a fan of platformers or puzzle-platformers. It's really unique and highly underrated. Nihilumbra is a very insightful, relaxing and fun experience. That's what this game is. It's more than just a game. It's an experience to be had.			"

												Nihilumbra is both a very interesting and very divided game. It was presented to me as ""Limbo meets Portal,"" but in practice, I found it to be like neither of these things. The unfitting dark creatures roaming about the relatively normal environments felt more like Heart of Darkness, and the emphasis on the ""paint mechanic"" (there are no portals) gives it more similarities to Tag: The Power of Paint. I was also told that the game made figurative waves on the iOS market, but that is a market so inundated with inane and uninteresting nonsense that the comment meant exactly nothing to me, so I went about my playthrough of Nihilumbra determined not to give it a free pass for standing out from mediocrity. So let's get to it.I said that I felt that the game was divided. The gameplay is divided into two distinct modes, the story mode, and the void mode. The latter is unlocked after completing the former. The story mode is what you'd expect; it tells the story. The biggest problem people will have with the story mode is the narrator, or more specifically, the narration design. The decision to have a narrator in a game about nihilism is questionable. I'd think silent, empty text would serve the presentation much better, so that's what I went with when I played it. I don't think the voice is necessarily terrible, but I don't think the presence of a voice in this game is necessarily warranted, either. The narration is also triggered by your position on the different screens within the levels, and if you die and return to a checkpoint, the narration will repeat every time, and this can get grating. Fortunately, for the people who will be too lazy to mute the narration, the story mode is almost too easy.Void mode is the game's answer to that. It's the obligatory, ""you can't spell 'indie' without 'die'"" departure from the almost insultingly easy story mode. This section of the game is of a very much ""Oddworldian"" difficulty. There is plenty of trial and error to go with the more challenging puzzles. You will die in void mode. I've seen void mode criticized a lot, but again, these are (mostly) iPad gamers we're talking about. Fortunately, you are given a reprieve from the narration, but this can be both good and bad. You are introduced to void mode with the promise of closure to the game's somewhat bitter epilogue (What? Did you expect a good ending in a game about nihilism? DID YOU?). While you do technically get that closure, it's accompanied with absolutely no narration or text, so it's a bit of a dull reward for anyone who played through void mode because they liked the story and wanted that elusive happy ending. The only other thing you get (besides the achievements and accompanying bragging rights) is a ""secret language,"" which changes the text of the narration and makes it the complete antithesis of taking itself seriously, so if you thought the story was pretentious garbage, hated it and want some cheap catharsis, you might enjoy replaying story mode for that, but it will just end up leaving a bad taste in everyone else's mouths, especially with the internet memes which have basically already made the ""humor"" rather dated.There is appeal to be had in both the story mode and the void mode, but I think the whole package kind of antagonizes itself. I don't see many people enjoying the whole of the game. Most people will probably heavily prefer one half over the other, and people who prefer the story mode will have to settle with the bitter ending, and people who prefer void mode will have to trudge through the story mode. Whether you decide this game is worth it to you or not will depend on which of those two types of people you decide you are, and whether you feel that you'll only enjoy one half of the game.			"

												I feel that a forewarning before you begin playing is required.. When it comes down to it, due to how the game is laid out, it makes it like the narrator through the game is speaking to you, portrayed as your cute blobby character within the game. It's quite harsh and for anyone with a low self esteem, it can really be deterring to play, it was for me at quite a few points, too. Something of which I don't believe was thought through very thoroughly. It however evolves as your character does within each stage of the game. With that been said, let us continue!The only thing I can draw a comparison to is perhaps Limbo, Portal, Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, Abyss Odyssey and partially Contrast.Now, starting with a basic breakdown, you are part of the void (basically your replacement to being in a womb) a place of darkness and decay, and are born to be a little shapeless voidling.. You want to explore and be part of something bigger than yourself. Typically you let that take over and begin a journey that pulls you away from the void, however, this does not please the void as one does not simply leave it.You begin by taking a human like shape, to feel as though you fit in the human world easier, while the voice continues to tell you that you are stupidly deluding yourself for trying to think that you could do such a thing. You ignore it and continue on through little puzzles along the way, and the further you go through, the more you learn about yourself and the world around you. The first ability you get is a blue goop, basically an icy slide (hence the little comparison to Portal I was half expecting the next one to be orange), anywho, this aids you to get through the next few levels of puzzles and annoying timing levels however the puzzles themselves are well thought out for the most part, and give you a decent sense of satisfaction and relief when you figure them out. You continue on to discover 5 other colors, all of which provides you something new to help you through each of the changing environments tailored to each color, (blue-ice, green-forest, brown-desert, red-volcanic, yellow-electricity, purple-void).However, the fact that the void is closely following to recapture you means everything in it's path is destroyed. The world your voidling blob has come to love is being destroyed due to them being frivolous, leaving your character feeling responsible. Final summation; in all, it's a really well put together puzzle/platformer. The scenery is gorgeous but can sometimes be a little repetitive. Music fits in amazingly with the atmosphere being slightly abrasive yet quite immersive, puzzles are escalated in difficulty slightly too quickly with it going from casual to incredibly complicated and requiring a need to have mastered all the colors you've been given, and lastly the initially discouraging narrator. All in all though, it's a worthwhile experience to play through and on completion, it gives you even more reply value, having to fix what you've destroyed.			"

												This game gets a rating 'Very positive', but only 6.3% finished the first world in Void Mode? Underrated, because this Platformer game's Void Mode is a lot better than Story Mode. Last mentioned also comes with great music and a great story, but this mode isn't challenging at all. A bit ironic, but Story Mode = void and it feels more like a tutorial than it should.Finishing Story Mode I was curious about Void Mode. I thought it might pretty much be the same, because we have to deal with the same worlds and levels...but I didn't notice that (so far). Many enhancements to make the game challenging while for example adding monsters and more obstacles, but also with another 'nice' restraint (I won't spoil). If you really want to see the beauty of this game and have fun while dealing a challenge, be patient and finish that Story Mode.This game comes with a lot of great puzzles, but also knows some unfair puzzles (""you couldn't know"" thought). It also has some really interesting achievements that are 'must haves'.9/10EDIT: people who finished the Void Mode should definitely try the secret language ;)			"

												Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer. There are two game modes; Story mode and Void mode. Once you finish Story Mode, Void Mode unlocks. The narrative of the game and gameplay are complementary. The game mechanics design holds so much potential, yet, the application of it  into puzzles is not always very successful.Pros:- Well-designed game mechanics- Good narration- Easy to learn how to play/ good tutorialsCons:- Story mode is unnecessarily easy, while Void mode is unnecessarily hard. Not well-balanced level design. Meh:- Graphics are okay. Nothing interesting or unique but not too bad either.- Texts are sometimes a bit cliché. 6/10			"

A bit ironic, but Story Mode = void and it feels more like a tutorial than it should.Finishing Story Mode I was curious about Void Mode. I thought it might pretty much be the same, because we have to deal with the same worlds and levels...but I didn't notice that (so far). Many enhancements to make the game challenging while for example adding monsters and more obstacles, but also with another 'nice' restraint (I won't spoil). If you really want to see the beauty of this game and have fun while dealing a challenge, be patient and finish that Story Mode.This game comes with a lot of great puzzles, but also knows some unfair puzzles (""you couldn't know"" thought). It also has some really interesting achievements that are 'must haves'.9/10EDIT: people who finished the Void Mode should definitely try the secret language ;)			"

												You are the void, created by the void itself, and your purpose is to outrun a ghastly purple entity. You'll be traversing different landscapes along the way, as the title attempts to relay a message that's moving at times, and touches upon the idea of destruction as a means to survive.Gameplay-wise, the release is fairly simple. It's a standard 2D platformer with a twist, which arrives in the form of colour-based powers. Along your sombre journey, you'll encounter flowers, which provide you with unique abilities. You'll start out slow, frail, and unable to attack enemies, but as you soak up these vibrant skills, you'll find yourself able to bounce off the floor, slide on ice, and much more.Nihilumbra is not the biggest game, but sometimes great things come in small packages. The puzzles are not especially difficult, but there's a nice plot and some decent presentation here which will push you through to its conclusion. If you're looking for something a little different for your Vita, then make sure that you don't a-void this one.			"

												Fun little game, sucked me right in. The combination of narrator/atmosphere brings an emotional drive to push forward.It is pretty easy to play, the game teaches you as you go, as you get further in there is some challenge but it easier than some other puzzle games. It looks good, the narator is really cantankerous at first but as you advance he stops saying such sad things.  Maybe not a good game if your feeling blue though. "

												  Nihilumbra is, overall, a great experience. A platformer somewhere along the lines of Limbo, it's less atmoshperic, but its thought-provoking premisis, coupled with some intelligently designed platforming and puzzles, make it a real gem of the genre.  The game's short but thoughtful philosophical interludes are perfectly fitted within the environments that the game has you explore, and it succesfully conveys the feeling of a journey toward maturity, gradually finding out more about the world as it is and what you can (or can't) have an impact on. The narrator's remarks are frequent but never too revealing, thus leaving you the liberty to link and interprete the metaphors for yourself.   Nihilumbra also gradually opens up its gameplay through the aquisition of colours, with which you can change the environment. One lets you create ice, which helps you traverse certain sections more quickly, or enables you to make certain objects or enemies slide and fall, given that there is an initial momentum to begin with. Another is mud, which acts both as a means of slowing down - yourself and others -, stealthily traversing a section, as well as a sticky surface, allowing you to stick to walls or ceilings. Each of the six colours has its unique multiple purposes. The great thing about this is that most puzzles or obstacles you encounter along the way have multiple solutions, so you can do it your own way.  The aesthetics are very well designed - the diverse environments look beautiful, yet not majestic. The music used is very suitable as well, and nicely adapted to each of the worlds you explore. However, I think it's used in excess. Sure, since it's not trying to convey an atmosphere as tense and empty as Limbo's , I wouldn't have pleaded for complete silence, but there are some sections of the game which would have benefitted from less rather than more background noise.   While the main story mode is rather easy, and can be completed in around 3 hours, the real challenge here is represented by Void mode. It's a redesign of the original maps, but made much much much harder. So hard that I think the contrast between the main game, where I was never stuck for more than 2-3 minutes, and Void mode, where simply the first level of the first chapter took me around 20 minutes to complete, is a bit sharp.   Overall, I can only tell you to buy this game. It's fairly priced for the content it offers, it will delight you with its beautiful visuals and smart story analogies.			"

												Nihilumbra is a really hard game to review because it's almost impossible to describe properly.You play as Born, a being that emerges from the Void & takes on a humanoid shape. You explore the world, gaining colours, each with an ability to help you progress. You 'paint' them onto a surface to activate that ability, whether it's making the surface slippery, sticky, burning hot, bouncy or conductive. You then use these colours to solve puzzles, defeat Void monsters & escape the Void as it hunts you across the side-scroller world.Sounds a bit plain & simple, but it is actually a fabulous little game. The graphics are perfectly judged; pretty but simple, not overblown for a side-scroller. The music is as good as it gets, varied & often haunting & eerie.The greatest part is the narration. It's not constant, but what there is, is a real asset to the game. I could never quite tell if it was Born's own voice berrating & encouraging him to resist & fight to exist, an external voice talking to Born, or simply a narrator talking to the player. The narration is presented in what can best be described as a moving picture-book, with the words that are being spoken appearing prominently on the screen in large text. You are able to play without stopping to wait for the text to fade though, which shows sensible design.The puzzles are challenging, generally requiring you to make use of the newest colour, but always you have to think about all of them throughout. Even the length is perfectly balanced, with a 2nd play through built in if you haven't had enough, but doesn't necessarily add to the story.In fact, I'm struggling to think of much that's wrong with Nihilumbra, aside from the fact that it is a very quirky game that won't appeal to everyone. At a stretch, it's not the ultimate in immersion, but given that Nihilumbra's main plot is only a few hours long, it doesn't need to be. Everything about it feels complete, a game that has fulfilled it's entire starting breif.If you are interested in a well-rounded, well though-out & beautifully scripted game that is something totally different, then you will almost certainly get something out of Nihilumbra. I'm really pleased to be able to say I own & have played Nihilumbra.			"

												The mechanics are interesting and fairly well implemented, the graphics and music are forgettable yet passable, but the narration destroys this game. Firstly, the narrator is ever present, and rather than relaying a plot through environmental storytelling or immediate presentation, Nihilumbra consistently relies on the narrator's explicit descriptions. Second, the writing is extremely cheesy, constantly explicating and repeating how the protagonist, addressed in second person, is supposedly feeling as well as the considerations the game wants the player to make about the protagonist's relationship with and impact on the world. Mechanically, most puzzles are extremely easy, many solutions are given away immediately and explicitly by the narrator, and the same dynamics act as solutions to many, even subsequent, puzzles, making the levels feel like flavored repetitions of the same scenarios with no new challenge. New mechanics and dynamics are not explained through level design but rather explicated by the narrator, and the level design itself is not particularly clever although this is mostly insignificant due to the omnipresence of the guiding narration. In short, the awkward narrative explication of story, mechanics, dynamics, and solutions combined with repetitive puzzles and resulting low difficulty overwhelms the otherwise interesting mechanical potential and renders Nihilumbra a rather uninteresting game.

												A great little game. Even though the notion of colouring stuff is new to me the game play itself feels somewhat typical of puzzle solving games, however the enviroment created by the art work and ambient music really make it worth what you pay for it. My only minor nitpick arises because I type using a dvorak layout, the keys to control the game were clearly made for a QWERTY layout, and unfortunately I can see no in game way to change them (I have XFCE set up with a shortcut to change keyboard layouts precisely for when this sort of thing happens).

												This is a pretty neat puzzler-platformer, with gorgeous art and cool music. In Story mode, the game is easy, but the main point of it is for you to enjoy the game, admire it's landscapes, relax, listen to the narrator, and getting familiar with the game mechanics. Once you finish it (2-3 hours) you'll unlock the Void mode, and here is where the real game begins, with plenty of puzzles and challenges for you to complete. Sometimes is hard, but never overwhelming. And the difficulty is evenly spread through the levels, so all 5 worlds have roughly the same difficulty. If you beat it, there's a cool bonus that gives incentive to replay the Story mode. In the end, this is a nice cohesive game, with good gameplay.			"

It is easy to tell that a lot of time and love went into making this game, this is a one of a kind game that has a rich story and an engrossing atmosphere.It looks stuning and is realy fun to play The game at its coar is a farely standard platfoarm puzzle game whith a few gimmics. Its easy controlls and chalinging yet forgiving gameplay make it subtable for aneyone.It is an unusual tale, not one about saving a princes or killing bad guys, but one about self-perception this makes it stand out to me as i hav play many janeraus of games but hav not come across such a unique expirience in years. This game is the perfect example of why vidiogames are an art-foarm as this game makes the player feel something most games dont or can't {true empathy} the gammes crushing surialism and deep underling messeges make it as intreeging and criptic as it is relatable. Honestly im not shure i understand this game but perhaps that's the point i cant tell you exactly what its about becasue im shure you will see diferent things in it than i do. "

												As a big fan of 2D sidescrolling puzzle platformers, Nihilumbra gave me exactly what I wanted while also bringing in a fresh perspective. You play as Born, a creature that was created in the Void, and you are trying to outrun your fate while discovering the new world you are in. You learn to use elements of the world to your advantage, by finding colors and 'painting' (or erasing) those elements onto the world around you. You can make yourself slide, bounce, etc. You can also use those elements to make OTHER things in the world slide, bounce, and so on. This becomes fun pretty fast, and satisfying as well. The satisfaction I used to feel after making something blow up in Oddworld is the same satisfaction I feel when I make a monster slide off a platform or I successfully rebound a bullet off of a few walls to thwart my enemy. Most of the levels can be taken at your own pace, and offer fair, regularly placed checkpoints to assistant you in advancing. There are a few, but still fair, timed levels, where the Void chases you. There are checkpoints during these levels as well, and though I normally hate timed levels in platformers, these are made to be player-friendly. Though there is a lot of dialog from the narrator, it's spoken as you move, so you don't have to stop for it. So far the levels have been increasing slowly in difficulty, allowing the player to adjust as they continue.I think this is a great game for any for any fans of puzzle platformers. It has the feeling of being detailed, unique, and well thought out, though it's easy to toggle through your colors/elements with a click of the mouse, so it's also nice that it's far easier to control than some other games I've come across.

												Nihilumbra is one of the few games I've played so far that I'm sure will reserve a special spot in my memory. Right from the beginning, the story captivated me to the point that I just kept playing until the end, without even stopping once. The main game is only a few hours long (~3, I'd say), but once you've completed it, you'll gain access to ""Void mode"", which is basically ""Hardcore mode"". It's tough, to say the least, but rewarding.As far as Indie games go, this is the perfect example of how it should be done: Unique, fun to play, beautiful to both look at and listen to, but all without a huge budget.

												This game was a somewhat odd puzzle-platformer. The storyline was interesting and somewhat moving, and the mechanic of adding colors to change the environment was novel. The first round of puzzles weren't too challenging and most people could solve without too much difficultly (without a guide). The second playthrough (or void mode) becomes much more challenging and much more fun in my opinion. I almost wish that it had been the game all along rather than the second playthrough because it has much more creative puzzles. Unfortunately the second playthough drops the narrator and doesn't seem to have any story to go with it, other than here are some more puzzles for you to do. So overall 8/10 game. Fun story without too much depth, fun mechanics, good gameplay, but some questionable decision about why they made the second playthrough drop the continued narrative.			"

PROS:+ fun gameplay+ nice UI & menu+ great puzzles+ challenging void mode+ pretty visuals & in-game art book+ decent narrative & storyCONS:- a couple of ridiculously hard puzzles- rather short main story- void mode does not have narrativeComment:This game went on sale so I picked it up because I am a fan of indie games and it had a good rating. So it is a platformer puzzle game with a decent narrative (in story mode). I was not sure if I like it at first, it was okay but frankly it felt too easy once you got the hang of the various colors/skills. Well, until I beat the main game and went into void mode. While some puzzles had me guessing right away what I am supposed to do there were MANY that I went dozens of times because I had no clue and I always died before I figured it out. However after beating the void mode levels you do feel a sense of accomplishment and the checkpoint system is rather fair. So I like even void mode after some consideration since it made me very angry but because I sucked at it, not because it was truly bad. Overall this is a nice game and, even though short, it is quite fun. Recommended!			"

Escaped into the real world, you dont really know what you are, why you are here and where you should go.Just one thing is for sure: You want to life !! and outrun the destroying void. While you are travelling through the world you learn more and more. Just like growing up.Its a challenging puzzle platformer and i really like it. The best thing is: After you finished the story mode you unlock ""The Void Mode"" which isnt just an increased difficulty..it seems like it are different levels.

												8.5/10""You are the void"" the game keeps repeating that, shaming you for being void and lifeless. If youve played smash bros brawl and remember the purple stuff, thats you the world destroying purple and black mist. But can you be more than that?Never mind the cheesy story, it doesnt matter, what does is the palette of relating powers the game gives you to take on levels, add to the fact that i enjoyed the snowboard like way the character gets around, the variety of enemies that make sense and dont get in the way. And the linear direct approach avoids needless exploration or getting lost. Maybe needed boss fights but for a small studio this is great stuff why isnt this promoted by steam? Its great i completed it in very short time though but those mechanics,. there is potential for a great longer game here by a bigger studio.Great game			"

												Nihlumbra is true to its name: a game about Nihilism and a little umbral shadow that escapes from the nothingness and wants to LIVE! It’s all about trying to escape your fate, and seems like it’ll end with the typical Nihilist “everything is meaningless and hopeless” but you’ll be pleasantly surprised. You control a little shadow who learns about colors, each of which has a different effect: Blueish-white = ice, Green = trampoline, red = fire, brown = sticky, yellow = electricity. You combine these skills as you go along to solve puzzles and try to escape your fate.Let me preface my review by saying that a lot of the negative reviews are unfair. One of the main criticisms of this game is that the main story is easy, and the so-called afterparty known as “Void Mode” is insanely hard. That’s because they’re thinking of it as one continous game, when it’s not. It’s essentially a “Story mode” where you learn the skills, do some levels of varying difficulty (usually easy to medium), you enjoy an interesting story in an interesting world as you go along. It ends with the words “The End.” You can play to this point and have a wonderful experience, perhaps not one that’s 100% worth the $7.99 asking price, but almost certainly worth $5 and DEFINITELY worth the $1.99 I paid for it on sale. If you’re a hardcore puzzler, then you get BONUS levels with some added difficulty. Yes, the bonus levels are GRUELING, with some colors (i.e. powers) forbidden in certain areas, few (if any) save points, and really tricky timing at times. (Like starting off a level with something directly behind you and chasing you.) To be honest, I played a few levels of the Void Mode and felt a little cheated, because I looked at a level and said “Oh, I know what to do! The story mode taught me this! Oh, wait…I can’t use fire here. Or ice. I have no effin’ clue how to get past these 6 enemies without dying over and over.” A lot of them weren’t about planning or skill, mostly about finding the ONE solution that was correct, whereas the main game allowed some creative thinking and was forgiving with your various options. Each “world” of levels ends with a “You’re being chased by the Void, so solve these puzzles really quickly” which is frustrating at times, but it’s kind of like the Boss battle of each world, so it works, and it’s a nice change of pace I guess.Pros:+Great music!+Great art – complex yet minimalist+Interesting game mechanic with tons of cool powers to mix and match+Atmospheric – Each area of the world reflects the color you’ve just learned. E.g. You learn red in a volcano level with steam and lava. You learn the blue/white color in an ice world with howling wild and falling snow.Neutral:~ Voice acting is AWFUL, but I put it in neutral because there’s an option to turn it off. It seems unnecessary anyway, because all the words are on the screen, and the voice ruins the atmosphere by interjecting itself all the time. I turned it off after a few levels.~ I’m not a fan of the end-of-the-set-of-levels chase scene, but some people might appreciate the change of pace, so I’ll put this here.Cons:- As mentioned above, your experience will either be A) very short if you only play through the story, but will be casual and enjoyable or B) long and grueling, if you play Void Mode. So it’s either a length problem or a difficulty problem, but not actually both. Paradox.Overall: 8.5/10Story Mode: 9/10. Fun, casual, but not overly challenging.Void mode: 4/10. Punishing. Not for the faint of heart. Skippable.Tl;dr version: Buy it, if only for the story mode.			"

												Quaint little puzzle game that revolves around using colors with certain advantages to progress your quest. The puzzles are quite simple and aren't too hard to solve until the second playthrough. Really the journey is the story being told that both beats you down and lifts you up in incredible ways.Easy game to get 100% completion if you're looking for some more perfect games.7/10			"

												This game is such a gem. The gameplay alone makes it a worthwhile purchase, but the true beauty of this game is in the sound and design. The best way I can think to describe the music is that it's something reminiscent of Danny Elfman, Edward Scissorhands in particular. The narrator speaks to you on your journey, making for quite the immersive start and then some. The best thing has to be how this game makes you think - and I don't mean with puzzles, though it will certainly do that. I believe the game must be a metaphor for how small and insignificant humans feel on the Earth, and about trying to attain some sort of meaning. The void will always find you... 10/10			"

												Indie games always tend to be either hit or miss, but after playing Nihilumbra for quite a bit, I can safely say that the creators certainly hit the mark on this one. I definitely enjoyed the art style and idea of the story, a creature born from the nothingness of the world, seeking a purpose in a world in which it doesn't belong. While a puzzle/platformer with a nice challenge in it's own way, I find that between the story, art style, narration, and the way the whole thing ties together, makes it a beautiful piece of work that can certainly hold well in the argument of whether or not games can be viewed as art.

												This was a fun little game. Nihilumbra is a 2D platformer that focuses on puzzle solving and spans 5 main areas, each of which consists of several stages. Each area introduces a new colour, which then becomes important for the solutions of puzzles in that area. For example, blue colour makes you slide along as though on ice, making you travel faster and jump further, green makes you bounce, brown makes you stick to walls, and so on.I found the use of unique effects of each colour for puzzle solving to be a pretty cool mechanic that made puzzles interesting. Some colours even had multiple uses. For example, the red could burn the enemies, but it could also make fireflies glow brighter, hence illuminating darker areas.The overall execution is very nice. The art and the music are especially stunning. Though the narrator's voice was a bit offputting at times and seemed a tad repetitive. Worse yet, if you died and returned to a checkpoint, the narrator would say the same quote again, even if he already said it earlier. And having to redo the puzzles you've done already just to get to the one you died on was also frustrating.The game in general is worth playing if you like puzzle games, though the story mode is pretty short (took me about 3 hours to complete). After the story mode, you unlock the void mode, which is significantly harder and might not be for everyone, as you go through the same areas except with much more complex puzzles and more enemies, often pitting you in very vulnerable situations where you're bound to fail or die dozens of times before you succeed. So if you're on the fence and unsure, best to get the game when it's on sale. The story mode is worth it alone.I would certainly like to see more similar games from the developers, because this one definitely had the right idea.			"

												  The game runs very smoothly, and the graphics are absolutely fantastic. It is actually very easy to play, and it's not extremely stressful like a lot of other platformers. The story in Nihilumbra is of those you'd never expect to find in a platformer such as this one.  I have seen complaints about the controls, where you've had to click the bubble to used your Void ""color."" This is, infact, one way of doing it. If you're on the Desert stage, and you already don't know that holding down the right mouse-button would let you use your Void ""color,"" you may need to re-check your controls to make sure that you know what each one does.   As for the story of the game, it's wonderful. Tell me, how often do you find a platformer game with as much story as this one has? Yes, it's a little bit odd, I agree; just the fact that there IS a story to this game at all is what makes it so great.  Now for the narrating. I really adore the deep voice, but sometimes the narrator is only pointing out the obvious. For example, when you first ecounter the Kilmeth, he tells you that it can ""erase colors"" after you've most likely figured that out [if] you'd tried to burn it. As you progress through the game, he's only telling you things that have already figured out. I will agree that you could just turn off the voice, but what's the point when the text would still be there? It's what he's saying that's the most obnoxious, not the voice (for me, at least).           +Swift			"

												As a big fan of 2D sidescrolling puzzle platformers, Nihilumbra gave me exactly what I wanted while also bringing in a fresh perspective. You play as Born, a creature that was created in the Void, and you are trying to outrun your fate while discovering the new world you are in. You learn to use elements of the world to your advantage, by finding colors and 'painting' (or erasing) those elements onto the world around you. You can make yourself slide, bounce, etc. You can also use those elements to make OTHER things in the world slide, bounce, and so on. This becomes fun pretty fast, and satisfying as well. The satisfaction I used to feel after making something blow up in Oddworld is the same satisfaction I feel when I make a monster slide off a platform or I successfully rebound a bullet off of a few walls to thwart my enemy. Most of the levels can be taken at your own pace, and offer fair, regularly placed checkpoints to assistant you in advancing. There are a few, but still fair, timed levels, where the Void chases you. There are checkpoints during these levels as well, and though I normally hate timed levels in platformers, these are made to be player-friendly. Though there is a lot of dialog from the narrator, it's spoken as you move, so you don't have to stop for it. So far the levels have been increasing slowly in difficulty, allowing the player to adjust as they continue.I think this is a great game for any for any fans of puzzle platformers. It has the feeling of being detailed, unique, and well thought out, though it's easy to toggle through your colors/elements with a click of the mouse, so it's also nice that it's far easier to control than some other games I've come across.

Nihilumbra is an exciting and moody platformer that should interest casual and hardcore gamers alike. As Born, use the different elements acquired to traverse the obstacles given and avoid being absorbed by The Void.A hardcore version of the game is unlocked upon completion, called ""Void Mode"".It is essentially the same game, albiet with design differences in each level as well as a drastic spike in difficulty.9.5/10 Highly Recommended for fans of the Platformer Genre.

												This game was a somewhat odd puzzle-platformer. The storyline was interesting and somewhat moving, and the mechanic of adding colors to change the environment was novel. The first round of puzzles weren't too challenging and most people could solve without too much difficultly (without a guide). The second playthrough (or void mode) becomes much more challenging and much more fun in my opinion. I almost wish that it had been the game all along rather than the second playthrough because it has much more creative puzzles. Unfortunately the second playthough drops the narrator and doesn't seem to have any story to go with it, other than here are some more puzzles for you to do. So overall 8/10 game. Fun story without too much depth, fun mechanics, good gameplay, but some questionable decision about why they made the second playthrough drop the continued narrative.			"

I do like the main character, even though it doesn't speak or really react to anything it is likeable, mostly beecause of it's simplistic design. My major issue with this game is the narrator. By god, I want to strangle him sometimes. His voice is very nice to listen to while playing the game but his reactions sometimes are so distracting that it takes me ou of the game. He seems to be on your side and encouraging you on your journey sometimes but then all of the sudden he'll flip his ideals and just try to bring you down. WHO'S SIDE ARE YOU ON VOICE MAN?! I was forcing my way trying to finish this game and get to the end, only to find out there are void levels and I just said f*** that s***.			"

After the credits scene, it unlocks alot more levels, but I havn't gotten to those yet. But it took me a good 2 .8 hours to get that far (It is a puzzle game [kinda] so playtime may vary). Anyways in the game you start out as a baby, but you were born in the void. You escape the void and go to the world. And theres snow everywhre. But you find a flower. You pick it. It gives you a color, blue. You can place and destroy that color at will. You can run fast on that color. You ue it to solve puzzles and whatnot. Then the void comes back for you. And you run, knowing that the void is destroying the world behind you. You still run. And you escape. With that world gone. Then you end up in a forest world.Play more to find all the colors, and all the worlds. And to see what happens in the end. When he can't run anymore from the void.7/10			"

												Nihilumbra is a game that has been on my wishlist since a pretty time ago and during the last winter sale I finally bought it. Oh man, it was as beautiful as expected, I do not regret it in anyway.The hand-drawn landscapes, the minimalistic but yet complex animations. The sounds, the music, the narrator voice and what he says written in huge letters. And of course the touching story (at least for me, I was very emphatic with the protagonist). All of it came to transform the game in a breathing entity in which I was truly and fully immersed while I played it.I mean, even my father who is not into videogames said it was beautiful :')It's an interesting concept that of transforming your environment helps you moving forward, that being the gameplay.The controls are not very tricky and did not feel sluggish at all, you get used to them very fast.The only con I must mention is obviously the length, I finished the basic mode in neatly 3 hours and now I'll clear the Void one. But hey that's why I bought it on sale.PS: For me, what completed this fine work of art is the fact that is localized to my language, catalan. But hey, the devs are catalan so :)PS2: I personally think Nihilumbra must be played if you like platformer games.PS3: OMFG Void mode is pretty hard xD			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Nihilumbra. A Bit Pretentious and A Bit Overrated.Genre: 2D Platformer with Story. Developed & Published by: BeautiFun Games Platform: Windows, Mac, LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself PreambleThis is an overrated game. As I sit here and think about my experience with this game, that is all I can think. It got a lot of fanfare when it came out in 2013 but I can’t figure out why it did. This isn't really anything new for the genre and mostly just toes the line of what's come before. Maybe that's just me. Story ThoughtsNihilumbra is a 2D puzzle platformer where you follow Born, a being that fled something called “the Void”. You journey through multiple “areas” with various puzzles to be solved. All while being narrated/told what you’re feeling the entire time. The game gives off a feeling of being pretentious, whether that was intended or not. I didn't find the story to be all that new, interesting or even good. It simply existed to talk to me about life, death and acceptance of said life. However, I feel like other games have handled it in a better, less ham-fisted way. As it is, Nihilumbra is all about that point and well, leaves a lot to be desired because of it. PlatformingThe platforming and puzzle solving itself isn’t too bad. It’s just really forgiving with the difficulty increasing slowly and steadily the entire campaign but never getting too challenging. The only challenge the game really creates is switching between the different colors/powers quickly. Outside of that, there was only one puzzle I got stuck on and that was because I didn’t realize I could use the brown color to stick to the floor while a magnet was running nearby. One puzzle out of the entire experience. Not a really good sign. PC SettingsSettings are really basic but unsurprisingly so. It has v-sync, some resolution options and that’s about it. But as its a 2D game, it doesn't really need much. So, not a big deal. Graphics are reasonably ok, though I don’t think they’re the best we’ve ever seen in this genre. Not even back in 2013. Sound is passable but there isn’t much depth to it. The soundtrack itself is overwhelming repetitive and you will quickly tire of each area’s new theme. A mute option would have been loved. Final ThoughtsI’m not sure how I missed playing this platformer when it came out nearly two years ago, during a time I was all into platformers. Playing it now, well, leaves a feeling of ”mehness” to it. Sorry, I can’t think of another word to describe this feeling and that word is certainly not useful. However, as the game works and there’s nothing inherently wrong with it (other than being overrated/pretentious), I can think of worse ways you could waste two hours of your time. But I can also think of better uses. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Loved this game, I was skeptical at first but was immediately drawn in. Its fun platformer where you use different colors to solves puzzles. The game gets more intresting as you gain more colors with different abilities. I only wanted to try it out and ended up beating the game in one sitting. Its about 3 hours of gameplay and there's a void mode after completion if youre looking for a real challenge. I recommend you get this game if you love platformers or puzzles and if its on sale since it isnt too long.			"

												Nihilumbra is alright. It's cheap enough to be easy to recommend. New game plus is frustrating at times, but it's optional. overall, it's a fun game for killing a few hours with  very little invesntment. More information is down belowThe game has issues, primarily due to it being a mobile port:   - The keys cannot be rebound, and you cannont assign custom keys to particular abilities.  - There are few options, and what options are present are icons instead of text. I had no      idea what they did.  - The controls are tempermental at times. If you use an ability too quickly, the ability will     be ineffective.  - some abilites don't look right in some situations  brown can make you stick to     nothing or inside walls if you stick at certain points . It doesn't effect gamplay     but it does look goofy.  - The new game plus mode can be frustrating. You can easily make small mistakes that      forces a reset. In particular, pushing boxes into walls will make them unmovable. if you     have no way to destroy the box, you are forced to restart. In addition, some enemy      placements feel unfair The first level in the void run is a good example. There      is an enemy immediately on screen, and you have to react fast to avoid a death.      Because you can't bind colors to keys, you have no way to quickly select a color. Most      early deaths will be because you didn't know what color is needed for the next screen. The game does have a lot going for it:   - It's cheap at all times.  - It can be finished quickly. (2 hours)  - There is a new game plus mode that adds to the run time and gives more of a challange.  - The game allows for a lot of freedom with the mechanics.  - Everything looks and sounds great.  - It is fun and satisfying to beat the levels quickly.

												Nihilumbra is a game that has been on my wishlist since a pretty time ago and during the last winter sale I finally bought it. Oh man, it was as beautiful as expected, I do not regret it in anyway.The hand-drawn landscapes, the minimalistic but yet complex animations. The sounds, the music, the narrator voice and what he says written in huge letters. And of course the touching story (at least for me, I was very emphatic with the protagonist). All of it came to transform the game in a breathing entity in which I was truly and fully immersed while I played it.I mean, even my father who is not into videogames said it was beautiful :')It's an interesting concept that of transforming your environment helps you moving forward, that being the gameplay.The controls are not very tricky and did not feel sluggish at all, you get used to them very fast.The only con I must mention is obviously the length, I finished the basic mode in neatly 3 hours and now I'll clear the Void one. But hey that's why I bought it on sale.PS: For me, what completed this fine work of art is the fact that is localized to my language, catalan. But hey, the devs are catalan so :)PS2: I personally think Nihilumbra must be played if you like platformer games.PS3: OMFG Void mode is pretty hard xD			"

												Nihilumbra is, at its core, a puzzle game. You control the strange black shape (shown on majority of screenshots), and you can use 5 different colors to give surfaces certain properties (like ""slippery"", ""sticky"", ""bouncy"" etc.). These surfaces then affect you, enemies AND objects alike.The good thing about Nihilumbra is that you always know where to go (always to the right), so if you see two paths to the rigth (upper and lower) and one of them turns out to be blocked, there's not any real backtracking or getting lost. The game progresses very nicely.The puzzle challenges are quite good, sometimes there is some head-scratching involved until you figure out the solution. Each of the 5 worlds ends with a somewhat nerve-wrecking ""boss level"", where there is a time limit in the form of a big wall of destruction that is always progressing from left to right, so you will need to be able to perform the solution at reasonable speed. But the system of checkpoints is very well thought through and there is virtually no frustration - just tons of fun.Took me 2 hours to finish, and I liked every minute of it.I got the game for about 3 euros during the Community vote sale, and I would not hesitate to spend the current reduced price of 6.30. If that becomes the after-sale price in January, I strongly recommend this game.			"

												Nihilumbra, a game in which you play as an entity created by the void trying to come to life.  Nihil, Latin for nothing. I can quite appreciate the wordplay there i got to admit it. The story is non existent, all there is is a narrator following along. All he does is tell you what you are supposed to do basically, so the story is your journey which I will come to now. Coming to the gameplay. This honestly disappointed me quite a bit. The gameplay is composed of simple platforming gradually throwing in different abilities for your character. Nevertheless these abilities add basically nothing to the gameplay. You will encounter enemies which are nothing more than a gimmick as they don't really do too much, seeing as they can easily be taken out with aid of your abilities. The 5 different stages do very little to the gameplay as all of them introduce another ability.  The problem I have with the game is that it is basically the same thing over and over again rarely even having to use the ability you've learned previously. This bored me to the point where i didn't even feel like giving the void mode a shot There is nothing much more to say about it, other than the fact that i closed the game and won't ever open it again after finishing the main ""story"". I just can't wholeheartedly recommend this game			"

The story is truly excellent, seems all simple at first but by the time you end the game it takes on a genuine measure of grandeur, very very good stuff!The visuals are striking as well, the soundtrack is fitting to the game's tone and the gameplay presents some interesting challenges. The game is well balanced and the length is quite good especially considering there is an extra mode for new game+ a la super meat boy and a nice funny extra as unlock (won't spoil it), well worth the buy to experience this little gem!

You explore the world, gaining colours, each with an ability to help you progress. You 'paint' them onto a surface to activate that ability, whether it's making the surface slippery, sticky, burning hot, bouncy or conductive. You then use these colours to solve puzzles, defeat Void monsters & escape the Void as it hunts you across the side-scroller world.'Its one of my all time best games' :)			"

												What do you think would arise if you combine parts of games like Portal 2 (coulours remind me of it) Limbo (the story of void) and Super Meat Boy (hard but exiting void mode, as well as the void chasing after you at the end of the levels)? I believe it's Nihilumbra. I simply love this game! The storytelling is great (the narrator has very pleasant voice). Storyline makes you think about the game, you put yourself into the main character's place and try to escape from the void, try to understand who you are. The graphics is beautiful, the soundtrack... oh, the soundtrack! It's a masterpiece! I cannot do anything else but recommend this game, I haven't found a single imperfection. I have fallen in love with this game after watching the sample on the store page, and I really enjoy it now. Buy it, play it and you'll see ;)			"

												 In this game, you are being that escapes ""The Void"" - a place that eats it's way into anything and everything and, inside it, there's nothing. Much like black holes, really. Somehow, your escape alerts The Void and it starts chasing you. You go from being nothing, having no purpose in life, to grow intelectually through the learning of colors, an interesting mechanism that, by painting them on the game's surface, each one will provoke a different effect on it, ranging from slippery surfaces to making them burn, etc. In essence, this game is really philosophical. I thought the message embeded throughout the story was something from the likes of ""You are insignificant, yes. But if you stand out, explore, make something different, you will become significant. You will become something."" The narrator basically helps to tell the story, as through every section of the game, he says something. The art, background-wise, is very pretty. The models and tiles are nothing suprising, but that's not negative. There's an art gallery that will slowly unlock after the completion of each level. As for length, the game is relatively short. But, after you do complete the main story, there's a void mode to be completed, which can take more than the actually storyline, and it is freakishly hard! Also, the game's controls are smooth and easily maneuverable. Overall, I completed recommend Nihilumbra. For it's story, controls and for the originality that it takes to come up with something such as ""The Void"". Besides, it's cheap for what you get!Screenshot:

												The game is quite nice and generally I'd recommend it, but ... Story mode is too easy The narraror in story mode is only for the very depressed,  I really  don't know what this talking about ""guilt"" is all about, it's just annoying.  Some levels in void mode can bee very hard, there is no way to adjust difficulty.  impossible to remap keys  it is not a real side-scroller, so often when you move to a new screen you are confronted with a situation that will kill  you and you'll have to redo everything from the last save point to enter this screen prepared. Often the sitation that is presented is not really hard to resolve if only you would have had a chance to see it half a second before. Or maybe that's just me being slow ... In void mode this can become very annoying. Well, at least there is an achievement for dying 10 times in a row in void mode ;) Apart from that it is fun to play.			"

												Nihilumbra, a Jewel from BeautiFun Games is indeed worth every penny. It is a jump and run riddler. It has many good aspects like harmonious game design. Good design and a atmospheric soundtrack. Furthermore it has a nice and immersive backstory, so it is fun trying to reach the next zone, or die trying. There are also some small minor drawbacks on the game - mostly because the timing can at times be absolutely unforgiving. A game that can enthrall the players for hours and days onward, if played in several sessions. Addictive? Maybe! But not for players who have a strong dislike of platformers, riddles and jump and run action.			"

												This game felt a lot like some asked ""hey what would happen if we took the portals out of portal two, just focused on the special goos, and made it a 2d platformer"". Simple level design, and interesting puzzles, which involve the interaction of several different ""colours"" (which you acquire over the course of the game, obviously). You ""paint"" these colours onto surfaces, and they have different effects. The tone of the game seemed a little dark for the light nature of the play elements, but was fun none the less. The story is fairly brief, but there is a challenge mode which I have not completed. A good solid game, but not an amazing one.			"

												I just played my first 40 or so minutes and reached the Ash Desert, which is the 3rd world after the intro section. My god is it a wonderful game!To put it in perspective: I usually, for almost every single game, play in windowed mode. So I actually went to the options menu, set the game to windowed, and started playing. Even before leaving the Void, I had already switched back to 1080p fullscreen and got rid of all external distractions to best take in the beautiful art direction, soundtrack and voice.The setting, while rather depressing in many ways, actually also feels quite uplifting - and I can appreciate that. That the gameplay is very intuitive and enjoyable only supports my belief that I've got a real gem on my hard drive right now.Thanks to the developers for Nihilumbra. How in all the hells could a game like this have been stuck in Greenlight-limbo for over a year?! Valve really need to get their act together....I will update this ""review"" later on, when I have played (a lot) more of it. However, I doubt this game can anything but better from there on out. It is a lovely game, and I would very much recommend picking it up!			"

The puzzles are fine, but it lacks all of the personality of Papo & Yo, Portal 2, Contrast, Limbo, Trine, Oddworld, Ori & The Blind Forest, or even Tri: Of Friendship and Madness. Each room is its own very bland puzzle, which was a good decision for the mobile game that it was. However as a port on a full PC you have so many better options. I found myself hoping that the game would end, only to be presented with yet another boring puzzle with a completely pretentious voiceover.			"

												Nihilumbra has a defined art style, strives for narrative, and deals whimsically with depression. But its narrative does come off as a touch preachy and its narrator is not entirely interesting. There’s also the problem of game play. Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer with few solid puzzles and irritating platforming that consists of predetermined stages of play. These areas shift as you move along instead of the screen following your character. It’s off-putting at first then it becomes truly annoying as you die to enemies situated directly out of your view or you have to take leaps of faith. The game doesn’t advertise itself with the game play though, but ultimately what it does claim to have falls short. There is great potential here, but it falls short. Nihilumbra has a good name, interesting art, and a nice soundtrack… That’s about it really. If you like those things go for it. If not, I can’t recommend it.  "

												Nihilumbra is a short, mild puzzle game with above-average storytelling for a platformer. Normal Mode is fun, though not challenging, and there are many worlds, enemies, powers, and ideas to encounter on your journey to escape the nothingness.Void Mode (unlocked after completing the game) is completely unforgiving, which I suppose can still be fun if you like dying instantly after every screen transition.The combination of a mostly dark color scheme with the protagonist's colorful ""flower-powers"" is a good contrast visually, but it also serves to effectively set the protagonist apart from their origin. They grow in many ways as they travel, or rather, run for their existence.The deep, velvetly voiceover suits the air of the game well, while the music and sound design are light and fitting, but ultimately forgettable.Overall, it's pretty fun, and it's nice to see this kind of existential theme discussed in a type of game that usually doesn't.

												There are a lot of nit picky things that you could say about this game. Like the fact that you can't use your mouse roller to choose diffrent colors so in the middle of trying to stop a red color from killing you, you must go to the corner and click the purple and in trying to do that the red color burns you to death. Then you have to go to the last check point which in most cases is very far away from where you were. What makes that more frustrateing is that the check point that would have saved you was two feet away.       But then there are some really annoying things about it like the fact that if you die and there is a point where the narrator talk he will repeat it and if you die a lot he will repeat it AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Is the narrator suppost to be my conscious? He would always say stuff like ""You should feel bad"" ""You feel guilt"" it was kinda like gauntlet where the wizard says PLAYER 2 IS HUNGRY. Except the wizard only said that when it was necessary not every 2 seconds.     It was like the narrator was trying to make me feel bad for this little black thing that had no personality or backstory.And he kept trying to remind you that HEY DONT FORGET TO FEEL AWFUL. Sometimes he would blatenly say something along the lines of you should just kill yourself because you were ""ruining"" the places you were leaving behind.         The puzzles are not challangeing and the monsters in the game make inovative and new ways to solve them impossible and they are so repetitive that you die 3000 times before you can get to the next checkpoint. Sometimes there is a part of the void that is plastared onto the scenery so it is impossible to try new ways to solve the puzzles. The scenery is bland and the game itself is very repetitive. There is no real story at all to it except to run away from the void. No reason to why I want to do this no reason to why I am in the places I am. It was cute at first but then it just got annoying and was no longer fun to play and had absolutly no replay value. It had a lot of potential and I was really excited to play it but in the end it was not worth the money.			"

												This is a puzzle game. The controls are sticky and it's hard to choose between the tools quickly, which becomes frusterating immediately. it also feels like your character is slogging through a sea of jello, which is probably intentional, but coupled with the stickyness of the controls and the hurtbox on the character being severely disjointed becomes a source of perpetual annoyance. So the contols are annoying, but that isn't what breaks the game.What really breaks the game is the narration. This voice is never explained and makes no sense in the context. This is on almost every screen and is like a mosquito buzzing in your ear the entire time. You can mute the narration but you can't make the subtitles go away. Not only does this voice basically solve every early puzzle for you it also tries to tell you how to feel in the game. THIS IS BAD CONVEYANCE. If you want me to feel like the game is hopeless, make the game translate that. Don't just shove it down my throat and expect me to think that way.TL;DR: Bad controls, Insanity inducing narration.

												This game is a peculiar thing...first off, it IS a game and it isn't bad, BUT it is a curious mix of genres, some form of art and random stuff. It is neither a platformer nor a puzzle game initially (more on that later).You are a voidling, you escape the void and you're on the run. The void is chasing you with monsters and directly in 1 ""boss"" level per stage. There are 5 stages in the game, not a whole lot. You can play through the game in about 2-3 hours. It is not difficult. Basically you gain 1 new ability per stage in the form of colours (ice, moss, sand, fire and electricity) with which you have to beat the rather short levels. After you gain fire you can actually kill enemies yourself from time to time. As I said you do neither a lot of platforming nor puzzling. 98% of the stages are self explanatory. Perhaps this is more of a visual and thoughtful journy, as you are accompanied by a narrator, who is almost constantly babbling something I didn't really care anything about, and possibly acts as your inner voice, telling a story about regret, fate etc. blabla. As you are running away from the void it devours the lands you travel, making you directly responsible for the destruction on the earth. Maybe that's the message. After you have beaten the game you unlock ""void mode"", a kind of alternate hard mode for the game. This is where stuff could get interesting, but I can't force myself to play through it, because here the game really becomes a puzzle platformer and I'm not interested in spending the time for this, but for anyone who is interested in that, you have to endure the normal mode first. Void mode is for you to clean up the void and restore the earth...whatever.For a few bucks this game provides some entertainment in my opinion, but it's in the end just mediocre and a bit strange.By the way, no controller support, which makes sense, because you have to ""paint"" with your mouse cursor. Would be difficult with a controller.TL;DR: nice game, if somewhat strange concept and annoying moral story. Has additional puzzle hardmode after completion. Pick up for low price.			"

OverviewOh god, I cannot remember how many times I have forgot how to spell/say the name of this game. Nihilumbra. Nihilumbra is a very original indie platformer that is actually very deep. The narration explains the character, Born, and his thoughts. Of course, assuming that they are a he. It's fairly standard 2D platforming here, except that it introduces the concept of drawing colours across the landscapes. You will use colours to solve the many puzzles in this, admittedly short game's, levels and defeating the many enemies the void throws at you. I won't spoil the lovely narration in the game however, that you can experience for yourself. However, after finishing the main story you unlock void mode. Which is boring as hell. Honestly, the game isn't really suited to dashing about and disposing with various void enemies in different and pretty frustrating ways. I honestly couldn't be bothered with it.Positive+ Great Narrative+ Moving Story+ Fun Platforming+ Colour MechanicsNegative- Void Mode- Short PlaytimeConclusionA very interesting game, with beautiful artwork and a fun colour mechanic but... void mode is just painfully boring. It would have been much better to extend the main story mode of the game. Overall, a great indie title and particularly because it's fairly cheap.			"

												Nihilumbra does not feel much like a puzzle game. Progression through each level is often done with ease, and as a platformer it also fails to deliver a challenge. Regardless, it's enjoyable. The simple gameplay feels nice, and allows you to appreciate the beautiful visuals and the simple but intriguing narrative. The Void creatures were creatively designed, and encountering each of them was perhaps what I most liked about the game. As a puzzle game it falls short, but it's a really good game anyway.For Linux usersAchievements aren't implemented for 64-bit Linux. If you want to unlock achievements, set Nihilumbra's launch options through Steam to ""linux32 %command%"" (without quotes) to run the 32-bit version of the game. If you already have a 64-bit save started, I talk a little bit about transferring them here, but be aware that the unlock times for the previously earned achievements will all be set to the time at which you load the save in 32-bit.

(just plain inexcusable)          -poorly executed central game mechanic, introducing unintuituve controls (controls intuitive, powers uninteresting)All in all, wonderful concept, poor execution, takes itself too seriously, very low quality. 2/10			"

												This a weird game but it's also kinda interesting.What bugs me about it is the fact that everything is spelled out. The writing is not of a high enough quality to make it literarily valuable. And the level design suffers from the repetitiveness. The narrator talks as if he was the game designer, shoving every meta concept down your throat. And everything is established way too much. I'd appreciate it if it was a little more subtle.Although the art is very elaborate, some objects seem like they were done by a different person. They do not blend together seamlessly. And some of them are not cohesive in the game world. Like the laser turrets and everything mechanical.The gameplay reminds me a little of Trine and Scribblenauts, because you draw into your surroundings while being in a sidescrolling platformer. So it is actually a puzzle game. Coloring the surfaces is a little like the gels in Portal 2. You have one that makes you bounce, one that makes you fast... but there are a couple more. It's acually not bad.There are a few beginner's traps - stuff you can't possibly foresee and walk right into. Also when you enter a new screen it may happen that you get killed instantly. It's good to have a lot of checkpoints, though. But you will hear the same lines of the narrator repeatedly.The experience would be better when the narrator would have talked in a made-up language or if you heard undefined, mysterious soundeffects together with the onscreen text.The controls are fine and so is the music.It feels very indy but also as if they were trying a little too hard to reinforce this notion. It was probably made by someone who is not a game designer first.			"

												I didn't really enjoy this as much as I thought I would, playing through the main quest. Once you finish it, the game opens up into a 'void' challenge which is significantly harder than the (easy) main storyline. I didn't enjoy it. It's not a 'revisit' or 'redo' of the original story line levels, but it focuses more on killing void creatures in thos enviroments, rather than exploring and puzzles.Main storyline took me 2 hours, and i'm not a big fan of difficult platformers, so I had no interest in what may of been a longer definently more challenging mode. Honestly the controls themselves didn't lend themselves to faster paced more difficult platforming/killing, so even if i was grooving on the idea, i can assure you the controls would of kicked me out just as quickly as the narration.I feel the narrator was relatively unessesary, and many of the lines of dialogue, i really felt were out of place, or didn't mesh well with the story. Honestly, it's game where the narration should really add to it, but more often than not i felt it pulling me out of the game because of lines i didn't expect or just lines that broke the feeling. I normally go into this game expecting a big point, or big plot or big overarching theme 'redemption' 'exploration' 'overcoming of one's greif' 'growing up' honestly, I didn't feel any particular ONE theme from this game... and that saddens me because it could of been as enjoyable to me as Thomas was Alive if it had one thing and explored it well, rather than trying to touch on multiple things at once.Unique mechanics, not particularly engaging though, and marred with questionable narration and thematic choices...Get it really cheap for 2 hours of entertainment, more if you enjoy the more punishing execution style platformers, but be aware the mechanics themselves don't lend themselves well to the platform genres need of smooth, precise gameplay. It's a game that would of benefited more from a longer storyline or a more crisp singular point, than a second challenge mode and shorter story line. The story failed to buy me in, and so I was left, ultimately disappointed.			"

OverviewYou solve the puzzles, deal with various purple monsters and progress by painting parts of the platform with 5 different colours, each of which has its own property: slide, bounce, sticky, burn and electricity. There are 5 areas in the game, each with its own environment and colour scheme. Within each area you can take your time until the last level which is always a speed run where you are chased by the Void (a purple wave covering the whole screen).The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay itself adds to the beauty as you paint the scenery. The devs are clearly proud of their work, and rightly so, as their gallery of rough sketches and gameplay development is gradually unlocked throughout the game.Steam trading cards and achievements are included and it's cross-platform (I'm a Linux user so that's a big plus for me).No performance issues or glitches at all. Very stable and smooth.Early GameNearly all of the negative reviews of this game show less than 4 hours of gameplay, which means they are only reviewing the Story Mode part of the game, of which there are 41 levels that seem endless. The gameplay at this stage is very easy, I would say the first 70% is child level. The whole time you are subjected to an extremely irritating narrator droning on about hopelessness and death and giving clues to the gameplay, as if it wasn't easy enough already. I was sorely tempted to throw in the towel like so many other reviewers but I wanted to get all the achievements so I carried on. I'm so glad I did!Void ModeAs it turned out, this is a 'game of two halves'. Void Mode is properly challenging, one of the best puzzle platformers I've ever played. I'm talking 50+ attempts at some levels involving timing and accuracy, and that's after you've worked out how to solve it in the first place which isn't easy either. The narrator has disappeared by this point too, replaced by a subtle background tune, just what you need for concentration. Many of the solutions took a lot of brainpower but none were impossible if I thought about it for long enough.AftermathAfter beating Void the 'polyglot language' is unlocked. All the menus etc are slang/internet speak. You can play through Story Mode again and this time there are funny comments from the developer and interesting insights into the game concepts. It's strange because after Void Mode it seems to take no time at all to speed through the entire game (this is the same playthrough that seemed to take forever the first time!) If you reach the 'True End' you will find out what the Void represents.Finally, I cleared up half a dozen of the remaining achievements which, having completed Void, were entertaining but not too difficult (but would have seemed impossible without all my previous experience).In retrospect the Story Mode is nothing more than an extended tutorial. If the developers left Void Mode open from the start instead of forcing you to play through the entire Story Mode to unlock it then players who were getting bored of Story would attempt Void and go scurrying back to Story because they would realise they need the practice and that there is a decent game ahead. I'm sure doing this simple thing would prevent most of the negative reviews.Minor ConsFullscreen only, no windowed mode.No controller support, although this may have been left out deliberately. It would be better for moving around but the painting side of it just wouldn't be feasible with a controller, it needs a mouse.64-bit Linux doesn't upload achievements to your profile but there's a workaround - it's Linux, of course there is :)ConclusionThis is excellent value considering the low price vs amount of gameplay. Apart from the initial Story Mode section (which I now understand was a necessary evil), the vast majority of the 32 hours I've spent playing this game have been fun and rewarding. I highly recommend it as long as you have the patience to work through the 2-4 hours at the beginning before you get to the meaty part of the game.Hot tip: use right-click to quickly erase - it's much easier than selecting it and you will need to know this for some of the quick-fire later levels.I bought this game myself but have dedicated the review to the fabulous and generous people at Steamified.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												This follows a long line of puzzle platformers and it really hits the spot. The history of puzzle platformers is a long one and very much is a genre I've always loved. Way back in the 90s there were many. Usually cartoony in form and had stories and plots. Original Prince of PErsia fits this bill but with the Playstation came 3D and very cartoony characters like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro and such. Also in the past shooting has been part of the mix. But the indie wave since about 2010 had taken things back to its 2D sidescrolling roots and added an art to it that was so new and appealingly fresh. The biggest addition to this line was Limbo. A totally beautiful game. A game that was totally the opposite of lots of platform sidescroller shooters from before as it not only featured a helpless protagonist that was relentlessly tortured throughout the game but had an artistic style and statement that just was pure beauty. So goes Nihilumbra. Yes Nihilism. It's not just for Lebowski fans anymore. This is another success in this genre and it really taps into the most fun bits of Portal 2. Remember the goo levels? This game features a lot of things like that. YOu have this character, this blob...this ""nothing"". That escapes ""the void"". And he mimics the form of a scarecrow. I LOVE this choice. Your ragdoll man floats and blows along. He doesn't walk. He kind of floats. And his ""clothes"" are always flopping in the breeze and especially when he lands from jumps. It's so appealing of a character. LIke the best of disney sidekicks. And then you have gruesome bizarre monsters. Think of all the craziest scariest designs from Dr Seuss or Tex Avery. Stuff of nightmares in shape and form because all these things are alive. And there are different ways to avoid and outsmart these creatures. And traverse this world. Okay now....the guy. There is a narrator that comes across like one of those positive self help cassettes. Always telling you your place in this world. Telling you what a failure you are. Telling you how waful your life has been. Telling you you will never win. And then reinvigorating you with his soothing tones what a success you will be, are being, will continue to be. You are special and goshdarnit people like you, Stewart Smalley. I still don't know what to make of this really. The narrator gives you all the instruction for the game. And then visual aids appear in a lot of places to tell you EXACTLY how to solve a puzzle. In fact they don't wait for more than about 2 failures before the game actually tells you how to solve a puzzle. I am not sure if it does that all the time. Maybe just when you are learning a new move? But I see it often. I've conquered the first two worlds thus far. I guess that means levels. And each world seems to offer new types of gameplay and monsters and moves. Very much like Portal 2 did. More moves and thus more puzzles you solve for those moves then puzzles combining those moves and monsters with previous ones to remind you. It does do a bunch of handholding for sure. But I do feel satisfied playing it. It's like relaxing in a hot tub. And when the swirly purple void emcompasses me...and the whole screen. I don't mind. It's beautiful. Well....unless of course well yes I do mind when it is chasing me and I'm trying to plan for moves that haven't come on the screen yet because...the ....screen....is....scrolling....by....so........S....L...O...W...L...Y.... However any frustrating bits so far have been solved with a few tries, trial and error and whatnot. Seeing how you die and then remembering and preparing for that offscreen jump. And it is satisfying changing the ground to grassy bouncy, maybe just a LITTLE less satisfying to shooting goop everywhere with a goopgun. I'm liking it. It's a satisfying PP...and a satisfying experience. I'll let the narrator lull me with his dulcet tones and float away in my scarecrow body. I really love the animation of the characters by the way. And the scenery and weather are just gorgeous. This is also one that goes on sale a lot from it's list price of just 8 dollars so it's a steal when it does. Get it.			"

												I've got mixed feelings on this game. Overall it was a good experience and a relaxing platformer/puzzler to play over an evening. The puzzles were ridiculously easy (except for a handful that were mainly dependent on perfect timing) for any adult, which normally I'm fine with so long as the story is interesting; however, the story was really nothing interesting at all with awful narration that was horribly redundant and rarely revealed anything interesting. The game mechanics for the puzzles were fun - but they clashed with the way side-scrolling was implemented by sliding in/out each background/scene instead of a single continuous level. Most of the trouble I had with puzzles was due to the mechanics clashing with side-scrolling, but not in a fun way that seemed intended at all. Toward the end I started wanting to just finish the game already, and found myself enjoying it less and less.Pros - Nice artwork, and sound was decent- Fun game mechanics (painting colors on surfaces)- Relaxing platformer/puzzler gameplay that never left me frustratedCons- Short (I like short games now and then, but I know it will irk others)- Way too easy (Solutions were always always obvious at first glance without any thought)- Story was bland and repetitive, if you can even call it a story - Narrator was getting annoying- Only challenges were unintended annoyances due to side-scrolling implementation- Lots of glitches with getting stuck on certain surfaces (causing character stuttering and sound repeating) "

												I did finish the game. Some of it was very fun. I love to figure out puzzles. But once into the Void levels, it became so frustrating that I considered abandoning the game. Instead I referred to a walkthrough to help out. It was never that the puzzles were hard to figure out. It was the timing that was so critical in some cases. A second or less could make the difference in not getting through an obstacle.There were times you needed to bounce so high that the figure you were controlling would go off the top of the screen. This made it very tough to ""stick"" a landing or bounce just right. There was no way to avoid death repeatedly because you could not see the next screen of obstacles/enemies until you were in the line of fire or off the edge of a cliff.  I could not find any way to change the key mappings/bindings. So, I was stuck using WASD. That means my fingers were in the wrong position to quickly tap on numbers to change colors, I had to rely on the mouse wheel which means cycling through colors which takes more time than desired.  There were times I just left the game up in paused mode because I did not want to replay a prior part of a level (no save nearby). So the number of hours it took me to play is highly inflated with 8 hours while I slept or worked.For me, these frustration points were just too many. Yet, as always, I feel good having completed the game. I even played all of the extra levels that get unlocked once the void levels are completed. I actually enjoyed those extra levels and their pithy monologues more than the void levels. Those were hilarious and informative about the game's development.However, I can not see any replay value. So if you choose to play the game, consider waiting for a sale.			"

												Honestly, I expected much less from this game than I actually got. Till now, I didn't know a really good game from Spain, but this really changed my mind. The story is not that impressive, it's just a guy telling you something about life and comments the 'colors' you found, so that's not really a game to shed tears. On the other hand, the game requires you to use common sense, which means you only have to have a piece of brain to be able to pass through the whole game, the skill is not that required, it's more about repeating till you get it. The story line is more for people who want to get into calm mood, but reversed, void mode is for those, who really want to enjoy it and they do not mind repeating one part of game thousand times.Pros:Nice interface, the game is about void and the UI really looks like that.Usage of common senseThe enviroment changes progressively, you do not insensibly pass through random maps.Void difficulty is extremely funnyPlatformer with unique mechanicsCons:It is way too short - I would like to play, but repeating maps is not that fun. If it had some kind of multiplayer, it would be great. Like you would have a chance to make your map, people would play it and that would be ranked by time, or you could be able to make a whole mod or something, but currently, it was pretty short.Difficulty gap - The first difficulty was totally easy, but when I came to void difficulty, but I raged more than when I played Dark Souls, but as I stated above, you can pass through the game with zero skill, it is just repeating and common sense, but if there was some middle difficulty, it would at least make a game longer and people who are not that patient would at least be able to pass it.8/10			"

												I think the concept here is decent, but... they really don't know what to do with it. The main game is too easy and basically feels like an extended tutorial. And void mode is just harder versions of the same levels, often with really repetitive puzzles and lots of gotcha moments. All it really does is make for either a boring or unfun game. The level design isn't very clever and the puzzles aren't very clever, the controls are solid but the physics occasionally pretty janky. The narrator's voice isn't very good and most just sounds bored. Oh yeah and at one point the game couldn't find my save file (closing steam fixed this but seriously now)Music and visuals are nice though, but, I can't really say I enjoyed playing this game. I only really finished it out of obligation for one reason or other. Meh.			"

												This game has an amazing story. While the graphics aren't too good, if you want a game with an excellent storyline, Nihilumbra would be one of my first recommendations.It is fairly short, although it keeps feeding you new content (unlike other games, where you run around hours upon hours in the same environment and all); aside of that it challenges you with puzzles and sometimes it ""hunts"" your character ...I can only say that this game is totally worth it.

												This game.. ohh Boy this game just bleeds personality, and yet your ""character"" technically isint even alive, you have escaped the never ending maw of the Void, the Entropy of the Universe manifested in physical form, Why do you exist? should you Exist? are the questions you ask yourself as you venture through this game.Gameplay wise its fun, you obtain colour powers that allow you ""paint"" the world, to aid in light platforming/puzzle solving, and to avoid the creepy dark creatures the Void has created to stop you from fleeing it, it has a nice feel using your mouse pointer to paint the ground with ice to slide, or use Electric currents to power circuit boxes.To top that off there is a wonderfully almost sinister Narrator guideing you through the game, He questions your existance, even telling you your not strong enough to move forward.. yet you do cause you are a new being in a mysterious world, but no this.The Void is Eternal.. The Void cannot be stopped.. it will chase you to the ends of the Earth.. The Void must be made Whole again....Note that 4 hours was the length to for me to complete the first ""part"" of the game, a much Harder Second part is unlocked when you complete part 1.			"

												I'll be honest: after finishing Nihilumbra, I quite disliked it.  It tries to establish a mood with a constant narration, in the style of Bastion.  But the writing is mediocre and the voice acting is boring, so the entire thing comes off as trite and cliche.  I was just about to uninstall the game and never think about it again, when I decided on a whim to quickly try out 'Void Mode'.  Void Mode, unlocked once you complete the main game, is a new game + of sorts.  You start over with all powers unlocked, and are tasked with going through the game again.  However, things are much harder.  There are entirely new setpieces, enemies, and mechanics that really force you to think about things.  All voice acting and story elements are removed.  Void Mode is when the game really comes into itself as a puzzle platformer, and I found completing it genuinely satisfying and enjoyable.  I'm recommending the game for Void Mode alone.  If you're looking for a good puzzle platformer, rush through the main game and enjoy Void Mode.  If you're looking for a story-driven experience, I suggest you give this one a miss.			"

I just had a more variety of ""powers"" which I would need to get past the puzzles.  Yeah, some of the puzzles were a little more difficult later in the game than in the beggining, but I still wasn't feeling the ""progress"".It's a nice game but I'd wait for a discount!			"

												Nihilumbra is a fun little indie that has a good bit of platforming and can be related to  super meat boy in some small aspects.It can give you a few good hours of fun, and if you are looking at this because of the community choice sale going on as I type this, it is a good idea to buy it for only $2.99. Some people seem to dislike the placement of the autosave locations, but there is a reason you can't save wherever. Most platformers don't do it that way for a reason. The narrator adds a little bit of fun to it, and the puzzles progressively get harder and entertaining. If you are very good at platformers, I can recommend this. If you are meh at platformers, I can STILL recommend this as it is very simple to learn and it teaches you perfectly.			"

												Should probably caution on the fact that:1) the game is very short (I beat it in 2 hours, this is without the challenge modes though).2) the game is very easy (minus the challenge modes).Now with those out of the way, let me say that Nihilumbra could be a hidden gem. It's just as good as some of the other indie greats like FEZ, Braid, or even Super Meat Boy (except, again, this game is way easier than those). The game makes use an intresting macanic where you paint surfaces with different colors that all have different effects - somewhat reminds me of Portal. If you want a game with logic puzzle like Portal (minus the humor though because this game gets somewhat depressing) and are okay with a short length like Portal then this game is for you. Although I say the game is easy, the Challenge mode after beating the game really is hard, but I still feel like the game is only giving me the difficultys of ""Press A to win"" Easy, and ""Start the game to die"" Hard.

												Dissapointingly easy. The mechanics could make for great puzzles, but an hour into the game the game is still giving me hints as to where to color the ground with my mouse, when the solution was already straightforward. There is no intellectual challenge whatsoever :(""Void mode"", which I have read is actually challenging, is not available until you play 3 hours of the main game -- or, as it has been accurately described, ""agoo goo goo ga"" mode.The narrative is OK, although the voice often sounds more bored than anything, and the writing walks you through many things too explicitly. The only real pros of the game are the graphics and atmosphere.			"

												I like puzzles but I don't really like the type of game that makes you die 50 times trying to figure out what to do.  That's what kind of game this is, at least once you get into void mode.   You begin the game in story mode which takes about 2.5 hours and is pretty dull.  Basically a tutorial on the different types of abilities you can use.   You are never really challenged in story mode and then the difficulty immediately goes up to ridiculous in void mode.   It's frustrating because you have to paint the walls with the various colors and every time you get killed you have to repaint everything until you get it perfect.  This kind of game has to balance the frustration with the fun and it does not do it well.			"

												This is seriously creepy. No, not this game. But the fact that Beautifun snuck into my house with some kind of brain scanner and, after completely profiling the entirity of my memories and thoughts, decided to make a game specifically for me. Ok, maybe I am being a bit narcissistic and it wasn't made specifcally for me, but I feel like it was because I loved every moment (and every pixel of every moment) of it.Everything from the beautiful aesthetic (including the enemies) to the wonderous narrative, to the challenging, yet managable platforming. Though solving puzzles with the colors (metaphor through mechanics) is the best part. Honestly I couldn't even imagine a game of this scope being any more enjoyable to me than this. While you might not enjoy it quite as much as I did you will certainly like it a lot if you like 2d puzzle/platformer games.			"

												This is one of those games that can easily be contender for ""Games as a art form"" as it has a beautiful story-telling narritive. It reminds me of Limbo with the hinted oblivion, but also of Bastion with the Narrator speaking to you and explaining what's going on and even taking philosophical discussions into it.i'd highly recommend this game ot any fan of puzzle games as the interesting way the game is played makes it unique with the colours doing different things and able to place them on different parts of the area, making you deadly, but also making some of the challenges difficult, but the checkpoint system is quite forgiving so I can't see anyone getting frustraited with it anytime soon.

												I bought this game while it was on a flash sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay more than what I did for it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, very challenging in void mode, but very frustrating. I enjoy a good challenge, but I do not enjoy being so enraged that I want to break things during my gaming experience. At this point, I am just trying to get my money's worth out of the game, beat it, and will never play it again. >.<Bottom line, it seems that with most of void mode skill doesn't matter. Luck has played the most part in passing any void mode level. As others have stated, there's no grey area progression between easy and throw-your-tower-out-the-window hard.			"

												I usually try to recommend stuff overall, but when there are so many better platformers (both old and newer ones) which are somehow getting less attention than this ""barely average"" game, I can't, and won't be recommending this.Controls are good, mechanics are good and stable, visuals are kind of OK, soundtracks are not too bad, and that's literally all the positive (If you consider ""kind of OK"" and ""not too bad"" as positive.) aspects of the game. On the other hand, there are like a dozen negative (and I mean, NEGATIVE) aspects. Puzzles and application of mechanics are just dreadful, boring, and repetitive. It feels like mechanics are there, not because they'll be the foundation of the game, but because they'll efficiently waste your time with silly tutorial-like levels (Whole game consists of them, not just the 'mechanic introduction' parts.). Camera is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I won't even try to describe it. Story is non-existent. Narrator is a disaster, it's the exact opposite of the narration at 'Thomas was Alone', where narration completes the advancement of story, while simultaneously making you wonder he'll say next. Instead, you'll just curse at that damn nonsensical boring text-reading voice each and every second (It won't even be catching up with your progress speed.), while playing a more boring game (If you still may play this game despite this review, do youself a favor, and mute the narrator right away. Don't even try getting into game for the first time, thinking like ""How bad could it be?"", just, don't..). Also, name of the game is Nihilumbra, but both in terms of concept and story, it has nothing to do with Nihilism whatsoever. Creators must've thought like ""Void = Nothing = Nihilism"", or something shalow like that, just to seem cool. By the way, 'Void' is a purple wave which absorbs everything, more like a blackhole. Last but not least, typography in this game is a ♥♥♥♥ING TORTURE. Trust me, as a graphic designer, I've endured many bad typographies throughout my life, but this game has by far the WORST typography I've ever seen in any digital content. My eyes bleed several times, that huge serif typeface haunted me in my nightmares.And as a result, I consider Nihilumbra as an incredibly awful waste of a potentially above-average concept.If you finished literally all the great platformers out there, like Limbo, Braid, Teslagrad, Thomas was Alone, FEZ, The Swapper, The Cave, Trine, Mark of the Ninja, and you are still searching for a platformer, it may barely be OK to buy Nihilumbra on a -%80 sale..

												You are a (not) evil blob thing born of the void, and decide (I think) you want to live and blossom into a healthy, young and bright upstanding adult.StoryI'll be frank, the story is really bare bones and overly convoluted and just outright idiotic in it's narrative.  You'll be hearing some guy almost talk to himself and keep switching his opinions of what YOU should be feeling about the situation instead of coming to that conclusion yourself and is incredibly contradictory about 90% of the situation.  He also loves stating the obvious, assuming you have the intelligence of single celled organisms.GraphicsProbably the only decent aspect of the game.  The sprites have a decent amount of variation, but the environments and overall aesthetic feels like some old mobile phone game to be perfectly honest.  As there's only 4 zones (5 if you include the unlockable Void zone) the variation in art and enemy type is extremely limited.GameplaySo as you progress, you'll acquire different colors which adds a few abilities to your arsenal (such as blue being the ""ice"" color, increasing speed and having enemies slip over themselves).  Unfortunately the puzzles themselves are either extremely straight forward, requiring little to no thinking, or so stupidly broken that you end up dying due to bad enemy placement and level design before figuring out how to avoid the scenerio (and even then it still is a bit RNG if you end up falling on an enemy off screen).  Even the narrator will neglect to tell you of a new enemy until AFTER straight up dying to it, and then restate the obvious of what you figured out after passing it, like the game assumed you somehow cheated to get past or something.  Supposedly after beating the storyline, you unlock Void Mode which is supposedly harder, but after getting a taste of the base game's puzzle and level design I can tell you with 100% certainty you will just end up dying 50 times before memorizing a pattern and avoiding it.  That isn't skill or a measure of difficulty folks.ControlsThe controls are honestly either okay or genuinely confusing.  You can use WASD or the arrow keys to move while your mouse is your paint brush of sorts, which seems logical.  Even using the scroll button to cycle through your colors seems okay.  Then you want to get to your color remover, and for whatever reason the game won't let you scroll to it, you need to click the icon on the top right bit of your screen which whips out a large tree branch with all the colors on it, then click the one you want.  Why they only did it for that is beyond me.  Also there is no controller support.SoundThe music is actually pretty good, IF I COULD HEAR IT OVER THIS IDIOT NARRATOR.  Sure I could turn the voice volume down to 0, but I shouldn't have to do that over something that is supposed to be relatively important since every once in a blue moon he will give out a helpful tip.  So I'm stuck with him and his irritating self patronizing voice.Final VerdictHow did this get so many positive reviews?  Seriously?  If this game was 3.99 or something I could maybe justify it as an experience, but I got this baby on sale for 1.99 and actually canceled my refund ticket solely because of the fact that I needed to write a review of reason and maybe spare someone from paying the full price, or even buying this at all.  This is a decent phone app game, nothing more (and with no more then 3-4 hours total playtime WITH Voidmode unlocked it is not worth the mileage either).			"

												Nihilumbra has you control a being who is questioning it's existence, in a sprawling, puzzle-filled world. Unfortunately, I could not connect with this game.The game has merits: the puzzles all work, there's no bugs (at least none that I encountered) and everything works as it should. The puzzles aren't challenging, but they are what they are, a little lite puzzle adventure. Now, on to the reasons I wouldn't recommend the game. I could not get over the narrator. I'm sorry, maybe it was just me, but it bothered me so much. The line delivery wasn't great and the tone and tambre of the voice seemed purely to rely on being deep and kind-of sounding like a movie-trailer guy to bring any depth to the words spoken. For me, it really irked me. Then, the story. I didn't like it. It was confusing, a little pretencious, and a little forced. The game felt as though the creator had came up with the idea for the puzzles and bent a story around it to package it. Maybe you'll enjoy it, have a look over the trailer and see what you think, but for me, I sadly did not.Nilesy			"

												There are two games in here. One of them is a fairly easy and short puzzle game, with some tacky/artsy story. The second is punishing platformer, sometimes with time pressure, combined with what might otherwise be a reasonable/interesting puzzle game. The ""sweet spot"" for difficulty lies in the exlcuded middle of these two games. I should probably give the second more of a chance, but honestly, I can't care enough to load this back up. Oh, and you can't play the second until you've unlocked it, by beating the first (~2 hours).			"

This is a review as someone who is slower than others.Nihilumbra was a..odd game for me, Think as if you went to a fine diner, The people who work there are nice, The place is neat and tidy with a touch of low priced food, The same low priced food that looks wonderful but ends with a rather sour taste.Story: Not quite a masterpiece but far from being a best seller.The story is you are born as a piece of void who escapes the emptiness of it all, You move from place to place picking up new colors and learning more about the world around you, Sadly you do not have much time to learn about these places as the void not only sends monsters to destory you but also comes after you itself. In your luck, A voice assists you on the way, Telling you of the void and it's creatures. Who this voice is exactly, We never know, It can't be a voice in our head because our character does not know these things until the voice tells so. Graphics: Fits for it's lore and stays in a nice place.I'm not much as a graphics freak so most of the time it doesn't matter, But the graphics are quite nice since they are hand drawn. Since this was a mobile port moved to PC, I feel they did a good job. One thing I do love is how much detail is given to your character. When you push a item, Your ""feet"" will actually push against the ground to push said object, Pay attention to your character, You might see something new.Puzzles: Oh wow Look at all the pretty colors..Ack, Most likely the worst part of the game. As someone who's thinking is not quite fast as others, This game can be very unfair as fast reflexes and thinking is needed. Most of the puzzles are very bland and easy to figure out, Some did take many tries for me, But I feel that was more on my part. The color mechanic could have been used much better but the depth of the puzzle do not drop far from the flower. Most of them are pushing boxes to leave on a button or getting past an enemy, Which would have been fine if they had a bit more variety would have made it where it wasn't so tedious.Music: Wait? You can only unlock old timey mode AFTER you beat the game?The music fits the game very well, but since I was raging more over the puzzles, It was too hard to pay attention. Old timey mode sounds great but I really wish you could have had it for the whole game because I actually ended up prefering it.Final feelings: I wish I could play void mode.I wish there was a ""maybe"" on recommending games because I feel right in the middle about this game.Not sure if I would come back and play it due to the sometimes downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles, But I do feel the game holds a good spot on my top 50 favorite games, It's empty yes but it's good while it lasts but the end just left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I really can't say I would recommend this game, I mean it's a good indie piece, And the translation wasn't broken up or off-putting but, The puzzles are the core of this game and if the core is bitter, You might not want to take another bite.Rating: 5/10 I'm happy that I got it free but make sure to catch it during a sale.

												Summary: A good looking side-scrolling platform puzzler which offers little challenge and presents its story in a very overbearing fashion. Severe pacing problems left me bored and unwilling to complete it. First impression: I won’t say review, because I will not be finishing the game. I made it to the third area (Ash desert) and it still feels like I’m in the tutorial. The game holds your hand despite not offering anything resembling a challenge. I assume that it becomes more interesting later in the game when you have more abilities that can interact. Moreover, I do not question the benefits of letting the player get used to the basics first and gradually increase the difficulty, but why let the game go on so long before doing so? While many games are able to present interesting challenges with a single mechanic, this one had not presented anything interesting even by my third ability.  The game looks good and the narrator is competent. Unfortunately the narration, which otherwise would be the game’s strong point, feels like it is trying to force me to feel something rather than letting me feel it. Rather than explaining what Born is feeling or thinking, it is saying that I am Born and “You are sad, you feel guilty, you will not escape.” In contrast to, for example, Thomas Was Alone, I felt completely disconnected to the story. The combination of severe pacing problems and an overbearing narration makes me not recommend Nihilumbra. Sure, it is a cheap game and it looks good, but it is also boring.			"

												A fantastic looking puzzle game that heavily suffers from overnarration.  Most of the puzzles in the game are linear requiring little to no thought to advance, only gaining complexity at the very end.  This is not helped by the frequent deaths caused by trail and error aspects in with foreknowlege of the puzzle itself is the only possible way to advance.  For those looking for a deep and satisfying puzzle game this is not the game for you.			"

												This is nothing really redeeming about this game.The game play is mediocre but is sadly the best part of the game. You get 5 colors that change the environment but you rarely need to use more then 1 at a time. And there is nothing about the colors really inventive, it is just there.The graphics are just lazy. The main character has some nice animations, but everything else is just the bare minimum to get the point across. The all scary void is just a flat image that lights certain parts in a sequence, reminding me of a Christmas tree.The voice actor is bad. Just reminds me of free flash game voice actors. He also reads the wrong word in the game ending making the sentence make no sense. To make that mistake worse, the intend sentence is written on the background, just so you know he screwed up.The worst part of the game is the script. It is really bad. It is like the some accidentally grabbed the first draft instead of the final one and no one noticed. And these are all thoughts I had while playing the game, but I decide to finish to see if it would redeem itself. The ending was the worst part of it.Final verdict: Do not play it even if they are giving it away for free.			"

												Well... There is one big question: For who is this game?When I first started it, my first opinion was ""oh okay not kids"" but further I developed and listening to more to narrator I wasn't sure anymore about this... and well thats really the thing I don't like about this game...It did not satisfy me...The game control is in my opinion not very well thought out... and well if you played the first part of the game there is no need for this, true! But come on... in the second part of the game it gets so much harder... it could be made better...Also I think the hitradio is sometimes redicules...The graphics and the narrator  are very well! But somehow nothing new and so spectacular that made the game ""ok""...I really credit the gamedevelopers for making it! But it bothers me for who... a child who should learn perspectif about life? (well not with this strong words and complex gameplay...) a teenager? (well yeah could be! but I don't think they will be interessted for long...) an adult? (listening yes! but the gameplay makes it very fast boring...)Please remember, this is only my opinion. And so the question of the day if I would recommend Nihilumbra is therefore: No.There are many absolut free games or maybe cheaper on the market that have done these kind of games better...			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game; it has so much going for it, but in the end, I was just angry at it.It's absolutely beautiful. It's almost worth buying just for that. The story is fun, the mechanics are great and very novel. During the first part when you're collecting the colors (game mechanics), the game is super fun, even though it's kinda easy. However, in ""Void mode,"" (which is the real game, honestly), the puzzles are just stupidly hard. And I don't mean they're difficult to figure out (that's the fun part of any puzzle game, right?). What I mean is once you do figure out what to do (and that part is challenging and fun because they don't let you take the obvious route), it's almost impossible to time correctly. The game stops being about figuring out puzzles and starts being about minuscule timing tasks, i.e., try to make an enemy chase you off a ledge and have it step on a button while you rush through the opened area. I'm sorry Nihilumbra. I wanted to like you so much more than I did.tl;dr: Beautiful, fun story, stupidly hard timing/jumping tasks.			"

												Story mode is easy, with puzzles, but only a few represented a challenge. The story mode is more like an introduction to the gameplay and to the colors use. I thought that after this, as I considered, introduction, there would begin the rest of the story. But once you learn to use all the colors, story mode ends and you can play void mode. Void mode is too hard after the story mode, and it isn't about puzzles, but about killing creatures, and more talent is required in using the controls than thinking.I only would recommend it as an easy and distracting plataform game, but not a puzzle.

Posted: January 27, 2014
												Simply put, I really did not like this game. Many of my complaints are mirrored by other reviewers. The narrator's voice is not very well acted, very repetitious, very trite, and just...constant. He shows up with zingers about finding your heart, how anger is dangerous, how it's important to feel sadness, and at times I found myself blinking in disbelief that the lines made it through to the final draft. The gameplay is mediocre. It isn't outright bad, but it's just not very fun. You spend most of your time trying out different powers, which will give you the ability to: slide yourself and objects over ground, toast things (including you if you're not careful) with raging fires, make the ground 'bouncy' so everything springs off of it, create electricity to turn on circuits (and thus make puzzles 'run' their active elements), and a few others I'm probably forgetting. That's the thing - the abilities are really just forgettable. Platforming staples like 'bouncy bouncy' need a little twist to make them interesting. Otherwise you are just back to Mario and spring-boards again. Personally, I found the story tedious and unoriginal. You play as a sliver of the void, inexplicably cast onto the earth, and running from the 'void' - an understandably featureless foe who chases you across the map on occasion, and summons minions to try and slay you in a few different ways. The rule in this game is Insta-Death, which would be fun and exciting if the monsters were not so often acting in entirely novel ways, reacting unpredictably to tiny mistakes on your behalf (e.g. missing a small spot on the floor with the 'paint-on' effects), or just being RIGHT THERE as you enter a new frame. They also tend to have (IMO) awkward hit-boxes, such that you think you are okay springing over them, only to mysteriously die when you get too close.I finished the main game in a little over two hours. It's a decently priced game, and I don't have much to complain about here. There is a 'void' mode unlocked after beating the main game, but I found the game suddenly veered from stupidly easy, to stupidly hard when I reached this mode - I never found the game reached that 'sweet spot' for me, between the two poles. I found myself, ridiculously, stuck on the very first 'room' of Void mode, perfectly able to solve the 'puzzle' (jumping over a charging enemy by building a little altitude), and occasionally succeeding (only to die on the next room) but almost entirely unable to execute it. Trading Cards are a nice perk, and I sold them for an effective $1 reduction in price.Achievements are what you would expect. About half are for clearing levels and winning the game, or objectives you can't avoid completing. The other are fairly obscure, and I believe there is a handful of hidden ones. Nothing too staggering here, but par for the course.Overall, I disliked this game, and would probably rate it something like 4/10. It wasn't pull-out-your-hair bad, but on reflection, I think it was not worth the money. A couple hours wasted, no harm done, but nothing I can give a 'thumb up' to with a good conscience.			"

												This game was just... uninteresting. The first few levels were pretty fun, getting used to the whole painting mechanic, but once I played with it for a while it got really boring. I tried hard to like this game, but the more I played, the more I didn't even want to finish it. The story is cliche to say the least, and the narration absolutely ruined it (yes, I know you can turn it off, and I did). Instead of giving you bits and pieces for you to interpret, it shoves it down your throat. In fact, this game barely even has a story. It's kind of like they wanted to make a platformer that incorporated the whole painting technique and THEN they just kind of came up with some boring storyline just so you would feel like you had a reason to run through these levels.The platforming is mediocre to say the least. The screen transitions in this game will absolutely mess you up. In a game where you need to know exactly what is around the corner to prevent your death, you don't get any warnings at all. Most of my deaths in this game were not due to the puzzles being challenging, but due to me not being able to see what I was walking into. You'll just be walking along, get to the end of the screen, the screen will transition and all of a sudden HOLY MOTHER OF GOD AN ENEM- dead.I also found that sometimes I would breeze past a puzzle using a certain method, but if I tried to do that exact same thing in another spot, it wouldn't work. Like the one part where you needed to sneak past one of those flower monsters using the brown colour. Okay, worked fine. Then on the next level I try it again but NO, it didn't work, I had to use green to jump over it or something. I can't really remember, oh well.When it comes to aesthetics the game is.. alright. There are some really nice looking parts in the game but I found that a lot of the background and level design just looked very dull. I think there was only one point in the game where I was walking through the forest across the fallen tree near the waterfalls that I actually said ""Wow, this is nice looking and unique and my eyes like it!"" other than that the environments were forgettable. The gameplay gets VERY repetitive. You find a flower. You get a new colour that has a different power. You learn how to use the power. You go through the level using the power in very self-explanitory ways. Run from the void. Repeat. The game really just tells you what to do half of the time, the other half is you sitting there saying ""what the hell, this should clearly work but it doesn't for some unknown reason"".Overall I think I got about 2 hours out of this game, and I was definitely taking my time. I thought maybe I was missing something the whole time, but it was really just that shallow. I'll admit I haven't tried this void mode things yet, but I doubt I will since the main story bored me so much. This game is not worth $10. I repeat, DO NOT WASTE $10 ON THIS. If you're even thinking about buying it, look for a half off coupon or something. Oh jeeze, the more I type about this the more and more I come to dislike it.			"

The art is excellent, the story is decent, the gameplay is reasonable, the animation ok. There's nothing overly wrong with the game, but I didn't feel overly compelled to continue when playing through it. It wasn't quite challenging enough for me (not necessarily a problem), but perhaps it was a bit too slow for its difficulty. This wasn't a game that I was sad when I completed it since I couldn't play it any more. I was content at the end, but that's about it. Note that I did not play new game+ since I personally had enough. Maybe I would have liked it more if it started with hard mode as an option, but that still might not be enough to merit a recommendation from me.			"

												A cheap indie platformer with a bit of story to hold it together.The main gimmick is that you gain access to elements that you can place on the the ground/walls to alter it their properties. E.G. brown makes them sticky, ground bouncy, stuff like that. It's a decent enough concept but the mouse control of it never felt right to me, it's a bit sloppy, as opposed to precise.The puzzles in story mode are deadly easy, so it seems that this mode is more about the plot than anything else. You're a creature from ""The Void"", basically a hellish nothingness, who escapes and discovers the wonders of the living world while your home realm follows you, putting obstacles in your way and fighting to pull you back. The plot is just meh to me. I don't really go for abstract philosophy, and the narrator is deadpan and annoying. At a couple hours, with too-easy puzzles, story mode felt like a waste of time. Finishing it opens the Void Mode, which ramps up the puzzle difficulty from 2/10 to 12. I didn't enjoy the bit of that that I played either, so overall I'm not happy with this game in any way.			"

												If you can get this on sale it's worth trying out, the first part of the game is fun, if a little easy. I enjoyed it.It's the ""Void Mode"" that unlocks after the credits that's terrible, because of the poor puzzle design. It's just a mixture of trial and error traps where you have to know what to do beforehand to be able to do it quickly enough, and puzzles where you spend several minutes setting up the solution only to die during the execution of it because your timing was a half-second off, then the whole thing resets and you have to do it all again.From what little I experienced, it seems like Void Mode is the meat of the game, expected to take a lot longer than the first part. Which would be good, just a shame it isn't the good kind of difficult.Edit: I did enjoy how the programmers in the credits were listed starting from ""Programmer 0"" :v			"

												Ugghh. I picked this up assume it was a attempt to dupilcate LIMBO and found i was both right and wrong. This game is aggressively depressing by means of constant reinforcment of the 'Just roll over and die you worthless failure.' but then at times it will say right after 'You deserve to live and be happy don't give up hooray for you <333"" before stomping on your dreams yet again with how worthless you are. It ropes you in with deceptively easy first playthough of punching you in the stomach which unlocks after specifically saying to you you're free and says ""HAH you're not free yet- go clean up all of the worlds that were destroyed on your journey- 'Mario Must DIe' style. This game has very little in the way of making you feel anything other than worthless. I guess that's why the root word of the name is Nihilism.I'm sure this game is a gem to some people but i am not one of them- i don't like when a game smacks me with it's c*** and tells me it's my fault.

Some of the art is kind of pretty, but the game constantly droning on and on about how you feel and trying to make it as though there is some kind of attachment that isn't there is just irritating.Don't buy this game, unless you want to feel like the most boring schizophrenic for the couple hours it lasts.

												The game consists of 5 stages that take about 15-20 minutes each to complete. So you'll probably finish the game in about 2 hours or less. In each stage you get a new color that you click and drag across the ground to make it slippery, bouncy, sticky, burn things, or connect electricity. Honestly I was expecting the game to have controller support with such basic controls. It has none; keyboard only.The narration is alright. The gameplay is honestly very boring throughout the first two levels. I was about to give up on the game; I felt no reason to continue playing. I wasn't having fun and it was boring. After forcing myself to keep going it got a little more interesting in the 3rd-5th levels. Overall a fairly average and short game. The file size is fairly big, about 2.3 gb. I usually expect small 2d games like this to be around 500 MB or less. It doesn't really seem to have any replayability and I have no desire to play it again so I just uninstalled it after I beat it. I got it in a humble bundle for $1 with two other games. I've seen it on sale for $1 by itself before too; so pick it up while it's cheap if you want to. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know unless they really wanted it or got it very cheap.			"

												Beat it in two hours. Glad I did, too, because if I had to listen to that narrator for even five more minutes I may have lost my temper. His droning is unbearable! He uselessly spills out dull remarks in this highly contrived narrative. Which may be my biggest issue... the story is horrendous. Games that are simple and easy to complete like this one only ever leave an impression if the story is top notch. Think of Little Inferno...the gameplay is (while incredibly amusing) very simple. The story is what makes that game great!All in all, I finished Nihilumbra not because I was enjoying it, but because I was hoping it would do something to surprise me. And it did not.			"

												Discover the beautiful world of Nihilumbra and join Born on his adventure to find himself whilst trying to escape from his inevitable curse. Born was created from the absolute nothingness: The Void. But somehow he separates himself from the black emptiness and appears in the world. This is where his long odyssey begins, in which he will learn how to use the colors around him to gain powerful abilities and transform the world. However, his experiences come at a high price. The Void must be one. It seeks to reclaim him and will never stop chasing him, destroying everything in its path along the way. To survive, Born will have to condemn the earth he walks to its inevitable obliteration by The Void... Advise: Nihilumbra has been designed in a way that everyone can enjoy its story, even without previous experience with puzzle games. However, players seeking for a challenge will find it on the second half of the game: the Void Mode.			"

""push box, use color to avoid baddies, jump gaps"" and variations. and thats it. level design is really infantile.tl;dr: if its on 75% discount, its worth it. if not, stay away. theres a ton other games worth this price.edit. btw, you can finish the story mode in under 3 hours.

												This game looked enticing at first glance, however its not as enjoyable as first concieved. Liking puzzle platformers, I thought this might've been an interesting variant, but due to its simple level design and mechanics, I don't really recommend it. I've only played just past the area where you gain the ability to bounce with green, but I have no real desire to continue even after spending $4.99 on it. I honestly wouldn't recommend this game to anyone above the age of 8. The narrative to me is quite bothersome because of how persistent it is trying to slam some story onto this basic platformer as well as giving some hints as how to solve incredibly simple platforming puzzles. However, this would be a good game for much younger audiences. I don't entirely have the right to say this game is bad considering I haven't finished it, but judging on the first hour or so of gameplay, this game is much better suited for a younger audience.

												It looked interesting, but I was somewhat disappointed.Art is ok, not exactly fantastic but fitting enough, I've seen far worse. There were some alright relaxing music tunes.Level design didn't feel too great, not impressive or challenging (in story mode; you unlock another mode when finishing the game where you progress through whole new levels and which I played shortly; that mode is apparently harder, but I had no motivation to try that too much). Logic lacks a bit too. Why would you be in a forest and find mechanical devices to block or help you on your way? I didn't remember any explanation for that. I guess gameplay-wise there could have been ways for the developers to make things work the same just with different, more logical and ambiance-fitting objects.There is a constant neutral narration throughout the levels. The voice quickly became tedious to listen to, and I soon didn't care about what he was telling as it felt pretentious and repetitive. The game dearly tries to make you feel like you were on a meaningful journey of life and death, but it didn't strike me. There are some lines so dripping with a tryhard-meaningfulness that I couldn't resist to roll my eyes a bit. Or maybe I'm just hardboiled? I don't know.Regarding the gameplay: You find flowers resembling colors. These colors give you certain powers to draw on surfaces. One color makes you move faster when walking the ground it's on, another makes you (or enemies slower), another makes you jump higher and so on. It's moderately interesting, but not fleshed out too much in the story mode, which is why someone has to get through that first to see the other, already-mentioned second mode in which he can use all these colors to a bigger extend. I didn't exactly like the progression of the game: There are clear lines between the levels and settings. I think it was first an icy area, then a moderate forest, a hot desert, after that some volcano area and one more special place. In each you find one flower/color. I prefer a less narrowly drawn progression in games, as this is a very ""classic"" or predictable/""boring"" scheme (pick your side) to make someone advance through.			"

												For the most part, I would say it deserves the 75 from Metacritic:  Gameplay is simple at first but comes up with interesting puzzles, the narrator and narration are overwrought, and everything is generally quite nice to look at, especially some of the monsters.  But after you beat the game, there is a challenge mode that is EXTREMELY difficult.  It even has an achievement called ""Hard Mode is Hard."" for when you die 5 times in Hard mode.  I got that achievement within 10 minutes of starting the hard mode.  I rarely died in the normal game.Now, this will give you one of two reactions:  ""Ugh, who has time for this?"" and ""Aww man, I'm gonna be the best Nihilumbra player ever!!""The 2 factors I would recommend you consider are:  Do you like dark-coloured existentialist narrative wanderings?

												You've got smooth controls, an interesting visual style, great audio, and puzzle platforming similar to Oddworld. The story is fair as well, although the ending was a little predictable. Void mode presents a step up in difficulty after the main game is complete, and although it's almost at rage game level it's presented more like bonus content. You can skip it if that's not your style. All in all, it's definitely a worthy addition to the puzzle platformer genre, and most certainly worth the price of admission.			"

As you progress through the story, you will collect colors, which will unlock special abilities to allow more and more complex puzzles. The gameplay of this game is incredible, with some slow-paced action and fast-paced escapes.The game truly shines on it's narration, that guides you through the entire game, narrating what your character feels like.

I have to say even after beating the game, the twist at the end, that just so perfectly sends you into void mode, was very ingenious, but as you play you may find it too easy here and there, but don't worry. Once you do manage to advance to void mode, you will find it a lot more challenging (and rage quit here and there).

												The game is a platformer with some clever mechanics, divided into two modes. The initial story mode is effectively an extended tutorial with little actual challenge. New mechanics are introduced very slowly, while the plot presented at this point is about what you'd expect from a casual indie game; very forgettable and completely predictable. The atmosphere is pretty nice though, and the voice is pleasant to listen to.Once you finish the story you get access to the extended challenge mode; think Super Meat Boy dark world. The mechanics are much the same, but the game tries to add extra challenge by presenting a lot more complex scenarios. Unfortunately for the most part these extended challenges end up being nothing more than timing puzzles or trial and error memorization of where the enemies spawn.Get this full price if you really like precise timing puzzles. Wait for a sale if you like platformers and artsy games. Skip it if you're looking for deep or thought evoking challenges.			"

												You enter the world, not knowing who you are, not knowing what to do, chased by ""The Void"". So what do you do? You run! After each death, it becomes a little easier as you realise what not to do - the game won't always tell you. The game has a relaxed and philosophical feel to it, but there's always a sense of urgency as The Void never sleeps.The soundtrack adds nicely to the mood and it's worth the $4 on Bandcamp.			"

												Nihilumbra has great art, a soothing soundtrack, wonderfully original puzzle mechanics, and a story that you want to see through to the end.  The different abilities are given to you gradually and appropriately ramp up the complexity of the puzzles at a good pace.  The game is split between two parts: The first time through and all of the the levels re-done as a bonus hard mode (called void mode) once you complete the game.  The first time through the puzzles aren't all that challenging but serve as warm up as you get used to all of the different puzzle mechanics.  The puzzles are never boring, but walk a fine line between being solvable fairly quickly but also satisfying to do so.  After you get to the end, the void mode opens up and really makes you think and be on your toes.  The puzzles are never frustrating but can be quite challenging.  The story is written such that the void mode makes sense narratively and motivates you to want to finish it to get the 2nd (final) ending.  The void mode levels aren't narrated as the main playthrough is which is a bummer, but just a minor complaint.  Very much worth the complete playthrough!			"

												Nihilumbra started off as an iPhone game that I loved and enjoyed for its story telling. It is like a metroidvania puzzle game that is linear. There are no branching paths like a true metroidvania but story is of more importance than gameplay. That being said the gameplay is well crafted and all the puzzles are solvable with minimal intrusion, this is not like early point and click adventure game puzzles but more of an actio-adventure sort in 2D. The Steam version has an added art gallery and full voice over. THe voice over is nice but is not needed, though having played both versions it was a nice addition, but I still think the voice over work is more like a director's commentary and shouldn't be heard the first time around. It is one of my favorite indie games to come out in the past year or so.So yes, buy this game for the experience. It's better than Limbo, and about as good (if easier) than Braid.			"

												Nihilumbra, by Beautifun Games, is one of those games; when stumbled upon and given time, you really get to see all the heart it holds, and the care it had been given. When you are introduced to its world, you can't help but marvel at its art, deep in the frigid mountains to the ruins of a city long abandoned, and you're drawn further in by the awesome music that it emits. It truly tells an interesting tale.You are Born. A being that escaped from the Void to see and live a life for yourself. As you traverse Nihilumbra's world, you come across various 'colors', which act as both your tools and your weapons. For instance, Blue is Ice, allowing your character to either move quicker and jump further or to allow your enemies to slip and slide off a ledge to be trapped or to their untimely doom. Each color that you get are often used in conjunction with one another to help solve the game's many puzzles. Puzzles that I found very appealing, and interesting, some of them simple, some of them more complex. It's all about how you analyze the situation and how you yourself are going to utilize what has been given. With a solid control scheme and responsiveness, the game didn't feel it was trying to work against the player, which is crucial for a puzzle platformer.When you start, it gives you a 'Story-esque' tutorial, here is where you learn how to play, what to expect, and how Born and everything around you reacts to your actions. It was interesting actually, and didn't feel as if the game was holding my hand, but rather an introduction. It was a nice touch by developers. After the 'story' as been completed, you are far from being finished. Now, you must right the wrongs that you have done, and this is where the real fun begins. It was a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles, and after completing each one, the accomplishment was indeed satisfying.Overall, it's a game that is well worth its price. With an overall great infrastructure, and charm, Nihilumbra has easily become one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to those who enjoys puzzle platformers, or to any gamer in general. It's that easy to pick up and play, and easily be drawn into its fantastical world.			"

												Awesome platformer, which makes a genuine attempt at letting you combine different elements to overcome obsticles. The story is nice, not too deep but satisfying nontheless, very rewarding especially towards the end of the first playthrough. Speaking of which, that first playthrough won't take you too long and I felt it was almost too easy (apart from some sections being trial and error but those are far and few between). However, then I ""finished"" the game and unlocked void mode. Boy was I wrong. Things got immeditely challenging and very satisfying.Consider the initial story mode as one huge fun story driven tutorial. Once you are done with that, and mastered all the elements properly, its time to really test you and this is where the game absolutely shines. Music/effects are gorgeous and fit really well with the ambient, artistic graphics style enhances the whole experience and enhanced the gameplay.On the down sides, movement can sometimes be little bit kludgy, especially when it comes to magnets and jumping of brown  sticky surfaces, but those are really minor quibles.You like a good puzzle/platformer mix? Then go buy it now! 9/109/10			"

Even completed I plan to do it again, for the messages hidden here, really draw you along.			"

												I can appreciate and understand the message they wish to convey, however, that being said, they take a typical approach, with very little thought put into its design. The art, although stylized, felt rushed, the story which tried to be engaging, was both unoriginal and rushed. I found the puzzles to be very predictable and hardly engaging, There was no real rewarding feeling you do not identify with born and the narrator at times is too slow, and can even just be an annoyance. Very short game, with poor gameplay and predictable story, a great example of what not to do in game design. I can clearly see its inspirations and its overall goal however the approach taken was wrong. The ending felt almost like a ""what"" moment, where in teh beginning it was eluded too, tehn forgotten, then brought back. If youre buying this solely for the story mode, then dont waste your time, overall a 6/10, but for the price, those are my only complaints.			"

												All I have to say about this game is that I dont really like platformer games but I love this game. I played it all the way through in 2 days which, at its short length isnt that hard. But the void mode which is unlocked after that will keep you busy for a while after that. This game is beautiful with the different colors. And the narrator was a nice touch keeping the game from feeling too lonely which it would have been without that and left me wanting more of his voice. The story of the game is simple but deep at the same time, if you want to think in it too much. Overall this is an amazing game and you should stop reading my ramblings and go buy it already!			"

												Challenging, atmospheric, meaningful and immersive; all that describes Nihilumbra. Many know this game as an iOS port, but it is definitely best played on PC. You play as a piece of void, who craves to seek the world beyond darkness -- and this game really delivers the emotions of the voidling through the narration of the 'voice inside your head'. It is quite short, however, but very thought provoking.Consider the first time you finish the game as your tutorial for the challenge mode that comes next: The Void Mode. So the game never stops challenging you with harder and harder levels.A great buy, especially if you purchase on a sale.			"

												I haven't yet played Void Mode, but after completing the main story here are my impressions. The levels are short but sweet with frequent checkpoints - even if you have trouble adjusting to the controls you never get sent back too far. The music is wonderful and does an excellent job at setting the mood of each area. Although I've never been a fan of auto-scrolling, especially while being chased by an invincible hazard, I found myself looking forward to the void segments the most. They're easy enough that I didn't find them frustrating at all.One problem I had is that at times I found myself overthinking the puzzles and making them harder for myself than they really are. The solutions are always fairly simple, and the frequent checkpoints mean that even if you have trouble and die several times you're able to try again almost immediately. That being said, this game is suitable for any skill level and isn't hard to learn to play. Highly recommended.			"

												Nihilumbra started off as an iPhone game that I loved and enjoyed for its story telling. It is like a metroidvania puzzle game that is linear. There are no branching paths like a true metroidvania but story is of more importance than gameplay. That being said the gameplay is well crafted and all the puzzles are solvable with minimal intrusion, this is not like early point and click adventure game puzzles but more of an actio-adventure sort in 2D. The Steam version has an added art gallery and full voice over. THe voice over is nice but is not needed, though having played both versions it was a nice addition, but I still think the voice over work is more like a director's commentary and shouldn't be heard the first time around. It is one of my favorite indie games to come out in the past year or so.So yes, buy this game for the experience. It's better than Limbo, and about as good (if easier) than Braid.			"

												This is a fun platformer game with an incredible gameplay idea. You gain powers, each power being a different colour. Blue for example can make things slide/go faster, like ice. There are many colours, and the combinations provide for interesting answers to how you must progress throughout stages. There are enemies that are quite tricky to avoid, plus the void from which the protagonist was born will chase after you at the last level of every stage.Apart from the gameplay, the narration is great, and many of the music tracks are wonderful as well. The enemy design is high quality as well, though some of the background art could be better. The main story is just challenging enough to keep you interested, but after you're done, the Void Mode unlocks and it's.... so tough! I'll probably spend the next two years trying to finish it.All in all, this is a really interesting game, though if you don't think you're going to bother with the Void Mode, it might be better to wait for a sale since the main game is about 3 hours long.

												Really a beatiful little game.  -The art style is very nice, -the story is cute, -the controls feel fluid and responsive. -The voice acting is fantasticHowever-It is rather short-The platforming and puzzles arn't paticularly difficultThis is definatly a game to get if you're looking for a cute little narritive and a lovely art style, but if you're looking for a long and challenging game I'd say to avoid it.

												All I have to say about this game is that I dont really like platformer games but I love this game. I played it all the way through in 2 days which, at its short length isnt that hard. But the void mode which is unlocked after that will keep you busy for a while after that. This game is beautiful with the different colors. And the narrator was a nice touch keeping the game from feeling too lonely which it would have been without that and left me wanting more of his voice. The story of the game is simple but deep at the same time, if you want to think in it too much. Overall this is an amazing game and you should stop reading my ramblings and go buy it already!			"

												This game is beautiful and that's a shy word to use. Very simple, yet it catches you and drowns you in it's exotic surroundings. It has you delve into the crevices of wondering why you were made and finding a purpose beyond what you could ever imagine. The 'You shouldn't exist, but you do' feel is very well played and having you try and answer the questions yourself is very interesting to experience. Made with a clearly deep imagination, the mechanics are very well-thought out. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Borrowing some ideas from Portal, this puzzle-adenture-side-scroller yields a consistent story that is enjoyable and somewhat unique. I find the voice acting a tad too pathetic, but having a naration adds much to this game. Definatly worth playing even if you are not usually into side scrollers. It's not too hard (except the second playthrough, i didn't do it), so its definatly all about the story and the beautifully designed landscape.			"

												I played through this game's story, got the ending (which I thought was pretty lame), and thought ""is that it?"" since it felt kind of short.Turns out that wasn't it. The story ends there, but that's where the real game starts - the story was just a really extended tutorial, and the real game (""void mode"") is much much harder.If you're a fan of puzzle platformers, this is definitely recommended.

												The puzzles are pretty good, and sometimes clever, though not especially mind wracking. The art style and controls are really the strongest aspect of the game. I think it could have benefited more from a ""show don't tell"" approach to the story and mechanics. That narrator guy is obnoxious. If you want to play a pretty fun casual platformer, this isn't a bad pick. But seriously, mute the narrator's voice. And ignore the subtitles. So much more enjoyable without that.			"

												The art is pretty. The story is fairly short, but has a couple of nice ideas in it.  The void mode is really challenging.  They manage to get all three (visuals, interesting ideas/story, challenge) into the game.  Satisfying to whizz through the story and yet still lots to do afterwards.			"

												This game is beautiful and a rare gem.  It seems to be a side scrolling platformer, and it is, but toss in a few new elements and a few puzzles and you will have a good time.  The controls are very responsive and the story telling is near perfect.  The game gives you colors instead of items to help you progress, like white=ice=slippery and speed.  Once the logic of the puzzles kick in, you'll quickly lose an hour or two.  Hard at the right times, easy at the right times.Kudos to the developers, cheers for the community voting it on to Greenlight.9/10			"

												Ein sehr schönes Spiel. Das Spielprinzip war mir so noch nicht bekannt, ist aber gut umgesetzt (Farben per Maus im Spiel auf die Oberflächen malen, die dann direkten einfluss auf die Physik des Spielgeschehens haben). Teilweise etwas Buggy was die Hitboxen der Monster betrifft, dies ist aber zu vernachlässigen. Imho ist der Storymodus etwas kurzweilig, aber es geht danach noch weiter. Ich kam mir im Abspann etwas schlecht vor, da ich das Spiel ""nur"" im Angebot gekauft habe. Ist meiner Meinung nach auch den vollen Preis wert.			"

												Nihilumbra first appears as yet another 2D puzzle platformer in a long line of indie games trying to follow the successes of Braid and Limbo from years back.  Once the game begins, it’s quite clear those assumptions are not without reason, but diving deeper reveals a much bolder game with grander ambitions than the typical modern sidescroller.Video Review - 


YouTube™ Video: Nihilumbra (PC) - #1 - Frozen mountains 

			Views: 113		

			Pack your bags! Get moving! The void is after us. Let's GTFO of here before it catches us! Subscribe for new videos every week!		

		The player controls a creature named “Born” as it escapes an empty void into the physical world. As Born progresses, a narrator will explain the futility of the whole affair. The narrator insists the void will relentlessly chase Born down as the “the void must be one.” The narrator argues the world is harsh and doesn’t care what the fate of Born will be. The narrator repeats Born is not a part of the physical world and cannot live there. Born is nothing. It’s all pointless. Born will die. Nihilumbra, as its name suggests, is a game about Nihilism – a philosophy asserting the meaninglessness of life. 	The message is presented in a brutally heavy handed way. It has the subtlety of a hammer slamming on a nail. Perhaps some will find this off-putting, but the decision to forgo nuance results in a gut wrenching emotional conflict between Born and the narrator. As Born moves through the world in spite of the harsh rhetoric, the narrator can be seen as Born’s internal doubt. Progressing through the world feels like an accomplishment, not only for overcoming obstacles, but for overcoming the narrator’s negativity. Eventually, the narrator will admit Born is putting up a good fight. One of the best scenes is early on, when a set of obstacles tests Born’s physical abilities. Born is not strong enough, nor quick enough, but maybe - maybe Born is smart enough. 	The Nihilistic philosophy of the narrator is constantly undermined throughout the adventure.  The narrator will present a point in their favor, and quickly offer a counterpoint, countering that point, and then countering it again. The narrator argues with itself, and can be seen as a debate inside Born’s head. While the always in pursuit void is a threat, doubt and anxiety within Born are the central conflicts. 	The narrator, while maintaining the end is nigh, provides tons of encouragement to push Born and the player onwards. It offers assurances just as much as it offers doubt.  It’s never an unlikable presence and more often than not feels like a good friend and ally. As Born comes across and absorbs elemental powers, the narrator will instruct on how to use them. The elements themselves are typical of this type of game. There is slippery ice, bouncy grass, and destructive lava. Sand and Electricity are the stand outs. With Electricity, the player can create currents sending power to contraptions like elevators and turrets. Sand is the most versatile of them all, allowing the player to slow enemies, withstand fierce winds, stick to walls, and silence footsteps. The narrator will also take the time to explain various enemies around the world. Some chase, some shoot, some will erase elemental powers, and other just suck … quite literally. 	The game is masterfully paced, presenting these abilities one at a time, but not spending very much time with a single element on its own. The game follows a formula where it teaches an element in a safe tutorial, then asks the player to use the element by itself, and finally tasks the player with using the element in conjunction with previously learned abilities. There is always a feeling of progress and of learning something new with every scenario. Again, there is nothing completely unique about the gameplay, but it is well executed.	The only blemishes to the game are tedious chase sequences in which the Void has found Born and attempts to reabsorb them. These moments are used as an equivalent of boss battles, happening at the end of an act and requiring mastery of that acts new mechanics. Nihilumbra’s puzzles are clever, but are never a challenge. As such, the problem with these battles is twofold. Often the puzzles are too easy to solve, leaving Born to wait on the camera to move forward. Alternatively, the full breadth of a puzzle isn’t unveiled quick enough and can’t be completed in a timely fashion resulting in a frustrating death. These sequences are only a small portion of the game, but are definitely its weakest points.	The games real strengths rarely come from the gameplay by itself, but rather how the powers, enemies, and puzzles blend beautifully with the story being told. As Born gains new abilities, it becomes clear they are becoming more attached to the world around them than they are to the void giving chase. The narrator notes, Born was nothing when it left the void, but through these learned abilities has definitely become something. With this revelation, the game shifts from being a dramatic depression factory into a somewhat uplifting criticism of Nihilism. 	What Nihilumbra does is nothing extraordinary, but it wraps itself in a protective blanket of rich atmosphere and tastefully direct writing perfect for the moody teenager in all of us. Its story and gameplay meld seamlessly with excellent music and art to create a completely cohesive vison throughout its entirety. Nihilumbra knows what it is, isn’t ashamed of it, and preforms with a high grade of quality.			"

												The Narrator learned to voice-act at the William Shatner school for overacting, but other than that, it's a pretty neat game. Took me 2 hours to complete the story and the difficulty was easy-peezy. Then... voidmode. I was pleasantly surprised at the extreme jump in difficulty, except for the fact that I couldn't get very far before I decided that I had other games to play. I'm not a completionist, so what seems like may be the best part of the game may just fall into my ""probably own't ever play again"" category. It's a shame, really...			"

After each death, it becomes a little easier as you realise what not to do - the game won't always tell you. The game has a relaxed and philosophical feel to it, but there's always a sense of urgency as The Void never sleeps.The soundtrack adds nicely to the mood and it's worth the $4 on Bandcamp.			"

												Very enjoyable game that I can recommend.There are two parts to the game story mode, which is fairly easy (but fun), and the very challenging void mode, which is unlocked after finishing story mode. However, I can't say much about void mode because I realized after playing a couple of screens in void mode that is would require a lot of repeating of already completed screens in order to get to the next checkpoint. Also, the game doesn't save at these checkpoints, only at sub levels breaks.			"

Solid platformer puzzle game, the main story is pretty straightforward gameplay wise however the ""Void"" mode levels pick my brain and my reaction times in order to be able to complete them. The story itself is somewhat dark and is hard to explain mainly due to symbolism  and how you interpret the narritive and the ending.10/10 for the $3 I spent on it well worth at least twice that.

												Nihilumbra is a mix between a puzzle game, and a platformer game. It has a pretty straight forward story, but it's still nice. The gameplay mechanics are great, and forget about it being a mobile game prior to its release on Steam. I didn't even realize it was first a mobile game until after I beat it. Throughout the game you will gain new abilities which can work together to solve puzzles. There are a few enemy types, all of which come with there own strengths and weaknesses. Don't worry about the game being ""too easy,"" because things get more difficult down the road.Long story short, it's totally worth the money. I got it on sale, but I would definitely have payed full price for this experience.			"

												Nihilumbra is an artistic platformer with a neat little story. It took me around 3 hours to get to the credits and I am currently working on finishing a playthrough in the void zones to work the game to completion. The narrator can get irritating at times and the puzzles rarely take more than a try or two, but there is a good diversity of puzzles, a welcoming learning curve, a solid soundtrack, and a memorable protagonist. 7.5/10-Good game to play on a lazy saturday. Kid friendly too.			"

												Nihilumbra is very enjoyable 2D platformer where you use various elemental themed colours/powers to ""draw"" said colours onto walls, floors and ceilings to slide, jump, and stick your way over and around obstacles and enemies. The overall story is slightly dark and focuses on you, a small spawn of the ""Void"", trying to escape from where you were born and find a reason to live in these strange, new (to you) worlds. Overall a fun game I got off of Humble Bundle that took me almost 2 hours to beat the story. The game also features a challenge mode after beating the main story which I plan to get into at a later date. Glad I played it.Edit: it actually took me a little over 3 hours to beat the main story because I was attempting to get the ""Pacifist"" achievement on my first playthrough. Still ended up not getting it. ; _ ;			"

												This game might not be for everyone, but it is a personal favorite for me! I find it to be absolutely beautiful! It's an amazing puzzle platformer, it has a nice story, and the music is phenomenal! The story is so amazing! It's a journey of self-discovery! I don't know if it was intended to have a message behind it or not, but to me, the game is a representation of battling depression and a feeling of worthlessness. I related to it so much because I have struggled with clinical depression for a majority of my life. I find this game outstanding! It's so simple, yet so beautiful! The story, narration, puzzles, the art style, and everything else is amazing! I especially love the music! I adore this game and I definitely recommend it! Not only is it fun, it speaks to you on an emotional level! ^u^			"

												You enter the world, not knowing who you are, not knowing what to do, chased by ""The Void"". So what do you do? You run! After each death, it becomes a little easier as you realise what not to do - the game won't always tell you. The game has a relaxed and philosophical feel to it, but there's always a sense of urgency as The Void never sleeps.The soundtrack adds nicely to the mood and it's worth the $4 on Bandcamp.			"

												Very enjoyable game that I can recommend.There are two parts to the game story mode, which is fairly easy (but fun), and the very challenging void mode, which is unlocked after finishing story mode. However, I can't say much about void mode because I realized after playing a couple of screens in void mode that is would require a lot of repeating of already completed screens in order to get to the next checkpoint. Also, the game doesn't save at these checkpoints, only at sub levels breaks.			"

												Nihilumbra started off as an iPhone game that I loved and enjoyed for its story telling. It is like a metroidvania puzzle game that is linear. There are no branching paths like a true metroidvania but story is of more importance than gameplay. That being said the gameplay is well crafted and all the puzzles are solvable with minimal intrusion, this is not like early point and click adventure game puzzles but more of an actio-adventure sort in 2D. The Steam version has an added art gallery and full voice over. THe voice over is nice but is not needed, though having played both versions it was a nice addition, but I still think the voice over work is more like a director's commentary and shouldn't be heard the first time around. It is one of my favorite indie games to come out in the past year or so.So yes, buy this game for the experience. It's better than Limbo, and about as good (if easier) than Braid.			"

But there is way more to this game which makes it art than just an philosophical interesting premise. It is designed very athmospheric, and the sound does the rest. Even though the game design is pretty, lets say ""traditional"", the puzzles aren't frustrating (until now). Finally i can say: a very intelligent, well-told story.

												Get it if it's on sale.Overall, not bad. But it seems like the creators saw these beautiful, story-rich art games catching on and wanted to make one so. very. desperately. The only thing the over-prevalent story can claim as its own is a narrator that won't shut up, telling you what you should feel on just about every screen, ultimately resulting in you feeling nothing. It doesn't help that the writing is poorly translated, and that the lone voice actor dutifully reads through typos as if they make as much sense to him as anything else in the script. (Honestly, given the fact that the guy had to say things like: ""Red possesses the power of fire"" that seems likely.) Someone missed the memo that games like this should omit text and voice acting entirely, unless it's borderline poetry.Now that that's out of the way, other artistic elements flourish. Honestly, I bought the game because of how gorgeous the screenshots looked, and it didn't disappoint visually all the way through. The animation, in particular, is extremely detailed, and it seems like every time you watch your character move, you see something you didn't notice before. All the backgrounds are equally pretty. The orchestral soundtrack is utterly fantastic, and the most surprising thing about the game (yes, it has an orchestral soundtrack). I just wish the developer had had the wisdom to let these elements speak for themselves.I know I'm mentioning the gameplay last, but personally, while it may have been easy, I thought the powers were a lot of fun to play with, and the mechanics for how they worked together were pretty well thought out. I haven't started Void mode yet, but I've heard it's when the game actually gets difficult, and that the 3 hour campaign is really just an extended tutorial. Honestly, I think it's a good format for a game with memorable mechanics, and this one has them. I'd love to see the game take advantage of the green and brown powers to make some insane platforming sequences. We'll have to see whether I'm disappointed or not later on.			"

												It's OK?Nihilumbra is a dark indie looking puzzle platformer (Yes another one). The gimmick in this one is that you have different ""colors"" which you can paint the world in order to make stuff bouncy or stuck (for example). It's pretty interesting concept and the puzzles are based on it. The art style is distinctive and pretty interesting but I don't personally like it (although a lot of work has been put into it). the music is also interesting but its not my deal. The story is a meta commentary on... Something? All you philosophy majors have fun with this but honestly it was so preachy I didn't like it. The game was just not made for me. If it wasn't for the puzzles I really would not have suggested it. Overall, not a bad puzzler but the rest of it is meh. Get it on sale if you can.			"

												Not a bad little game.  The puzzles aren't overly hard. I was able to complete the game in 2-3 hours and I only got stuck a handful of times - usually because I was trying to solve a problem in the hardest way possible.  By contrast the Void mode, which unlocks when the game is completed is ridiculously hard. I gave up on it after spending 20-30 minutes (and many, many deaths) trying to get past the second screen.  The music is well suited and definitely helps to instill a sense of urgency during the 'chase' phases.  As many have mentioned, the narration is probably unnecessary, or at least, over used.In summary the game is well worth a look, especially if on sale.  It won't challenge you, at least not the first time through, but is still fun if you're looking for a short distraction to occupy yourself.			"

												The playthrough can be divided into two main stages. Casual - ~2h main story mode where you learn about your abilities and about puzzles. There is narration, feels, thoughts etc. When you finish this mode the game unlocks the ""void mode"", which is a more difficult mode which tests your understanding of the mechanics. Progressing in the void mode unlocks more stuff in the art gallery, which actually is a nice reward. The art is a strong side of this game. I'm glad you can even see designer scetches when you unlock that.Thoughts:I wasn't very comfortable with the controls (and the mechanics). Initial momentum is very important, you don't get much control mid-air.Levels are divided into screens. I get a feeling that this decision was brought up very late, as beating some screens requires speeding up from an area on another screen. I wish this game used the classic side-scrolling model.The narrator began to annoy me a little after some time (he sounded a little monotonic). Also after respawning at a checkpoint a few times the narrator reads the same lines every time, which is also getting annoying after a few times.Art is an important aspect of games like this. Progressing unlocks more entries in the art gallery, which in my opinion is a good reward (there are also achievements, which add replayability value).While the story mode is beatable in short time, I'm sure the void mode will take a lot more time to beat as it is more puzzle-and-mechanics based.So, should you get it?It's an interesting position. Made me a little emotional actually. The art and music fit well together. The narrator says some things that actually make you think about life and death a little. If you're looking for something like that - go for it. If you're looking for a challenging platformer then I'd recommend something else. This game takes away some control from the player.			"

The gameplay is very nice and easy to get used to, so if you enjoy platformers i would definitly suggest this to you but if you dont love platformers i cant say that you should buy it right away but maybe look up some gameplay maybe first.

The music is nice too, the orchestral music is very fitting to the situation that Born(the main character) is in, when being chased by a unstopable void. The enemies have really creative design and helps solve puzzles if you use your powers correctly. It is worth your money... go on... get it.			"

												I can appreciate and understand the message they wish to convey, however, that being said, they take a typical approach, with very little thought put into its design. The art, although stylized, felt rushed, the story which tried to be engaging, was both unoriginal and rushed. I found the puzzles to be very predictable and hardly engaging, There was no real rewarding feeling you do not identify with born and the narrator at times is too slow, and can even just be an annoyance. Very short game, with poor gameplay and predictable story, a great example of what not to do in game design. I can clearly see its inspirations and its overall goal however the approach taken was wrong. The ending felt almost like a ""what"" moment, where in teh beginning it was eluded too, tehn forgotten, then brought back. If youre buying this solely for the story mode, then dont waste your time, overall a 6/10, but for the price, those are my only complaints.			"

												All I have to say about this game is that I dont really like platformer games but I love this game. I played it all the way through in 2 days which, at its short length isnt that hard. But the void mode which is unlocked after that will keep you busy for a while after that. This game is beautiful with the different colors. And the narrator was a nice touch keeping the game from feeling too lonely which it would have been without that and left me wanting more of his voice. The story of the game is simple but deep at the same time, if you want to think in it too much. Overall this is an amazing game and you should stop reading my ramblings and go buy it already!			"

												""Beautifun Games"" is right.  This is a true hidden gem of a platformer/puzzler with it's unique art-style, nice/soothing soundtrack, and challenging puzzles.  Watching the trailer should be enough reason to want to purchase this game.  Some reviewers have given this game some flack for it's dark tones/negative narrator.  It is deeper than what is being said by the narrator though.  After the main story there is a ""Void mode"" which is MUCH more challenging than the first playthrough.  You are sure to enjoy this game if you enjoyed LIMBO, Trine, Braid, The Swapper, etc.  Looking forward to see what Beutifun Games comes out with next.			"

												This game is beautiful and that's a shy word to use. Very simple, yet it catches you and drowns you in it's exotic surroundings. It has you delve into the crevices of wondering why you were made and finding a purpose beyond what you could ever imagine. The 'You shouldn't exist, but you do' feel is very well played and having you try and answer the questions yourself is very interesting to experience. Made with a clearly deep imagination, the mechanics are very well-thought out. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Borrowing some ideas from Portal, this puzzle-adenture-side-scroller yields a consistent story that is enjoyable and somewhat unique. I find the voice acting a tad too pathetic, but having a naration adds much to this game. Definatly worth playing even if you are not usually into side scrollers. It's not too hard (except the second playthrough, i didn't do it), so its definatly all about the story and the beautifully designed landscape.			"

												Nihilumbra is a mix between a puzzle game, and a platformer game. It has a pretty straight forward story, but it's still nice. The gameplay mechanics are great, and forget about it being a mobile game prior to its release on Steam. I didn't even realize it was first a mobile game until after I beat it. Throughout the game you will gain new abilities which can work together to solve puzzles. There are a few enemy types, all of which come with there own strengths and weaknesses. Don't worry about the game being ""too easy,"" because things get more difficult down the road.Long story short, it's totally worth the money. I got it on sale, but I would definitely have payed full price for this experience.			"

												PROS:- nice art & style- good music- good storytellingCONS:- it's a platfromer-puzzle with plenty of 'one-shots'. One wrong move or key and you're back to your check-point. Some find that frustrating. Like I do. - no controller support. Really?.. I'm not a hardcore gamepad fan (more like the opposite) but it should be played with a pad, not with a restyled touchscreen  K+M UI. Do I recommend it? Yes, especially if it's on good sale (-75%\-80%).  If you don't have any issues with plenty of timed 'one-shot' elements and you're into nicely drawn casual platformer-puzzles - you're going to like it.			"

So I recommend it (at a cheap price) for the first half, but you should expect it to glide by in a peaceful couple of hours and then become frustrating / the really hard game you actually want to play.

												Very beatiful piece of art. The first time you go through it, it is mostly a story telling game, and i simply loved living this adventure. Very deep. Another good aspect is the fantasy it relases, you have to wisely use your ""colors"", which have different powers, to go through the game. In normal mode it isn't that difficult, but in ""void mode"", unlocked once finishing the game, heck, it becomes really difficult! The art works are fascinating and catching, the narrator voice is like your only fellow in your odissey, the music and the atmosphere are really involving and will make you want to get to the end of the game, the end of the story, the end of the suffering?! In conclusion, i'd reccomend this game to ones who like challenging puzzle games, or good story telling ones			"

The narator also does amazing job, which only adds to how awesome this game is.P.S.: And after you're done with the story, you have void mode to figure out, which is times more challenging than the story mode (which gets progressively hard towards the end).

												First off, I cant say i have play all too much of Nihilumbra but i did however beat the main story on normal with a bit of hard mode. In the art department the game is defenatly somthing you wont see anywhere else (i personaly like it but wouldent say its the best i have seen) so if thats your sort of thing then it defenatly is not lacking. the gameplay is responsive and smooth, the elements take a while to unlock and getting them is a bit anoying at times but it isent detracting from the overall experence too much. the story is interesting and i realy like it, i will try to give a overall picture of the start of the story here. there is a void being that is having an exostential crisis of sorts that is getting chased down and has to escape its grasp. so yep thats my review kinda all over the place but it is what it is.over all its a fun little puzzel game that wont last too long if you dont go into hard mode and beyond but a good purchase at $8 none the less.6.5/10			"

The resolution is supported, but in the void scenes you will immediately die when the games resumes after a death. Work around this by going to the game menu and then resume the game. The game is a quite easy puzzle game that sometimes requires fast reaction. After completing the game a new much more challenging mode is enabled. Suitable for casual games and children.			"

If you want to play a pretty fun casual platformer, this isn't a bad pick. But seriously, mute the narrator's voice. And ignore the subtitles. So much more enjoyable without that.			"

												I played through this game's story, got the ending (which I thought was pretty lame), and thought ""is that it?"" since it felt kind of short.Turns out that wasn't it. The story ends there, but that's where the real game starts - the story was just a really extended tutorial, and the real game (""void mode"") is much much harder.If you're a fan of puzzle platformers, this is definitely recommended.

												A really well created game alot of fun especially when you enter void mode. The narrator telling the story is what really brings the game together allowing you to understand what is actually happening in the world besides mindless puzzle solving.			"

												GET THIS GAME NOW. RIGHT NOW. It's charming, simple, but will challenge you when death rolls at your heels and you need to think fast. Learn from your mistakes, and grow. This game is a work of art visually, and in the storytelling. The gameplay is top-notch with enough freedom to solve problems in your own way. No bugs, no glitches, no frustrating impossible moments-- the only thing slowing you down is how fast you can think!From beginning to end, the journey Born (the player) takes is poignant and humble.Experience this game. Do it.			"

												This game is truly beautiful. From the art style of each level, to the story itself. You truly feel like you're a stranger in the world as you follow the shadowy Born on his journy to escape the nothingness he left behind.Each level provides you a series of different puzzles you must navigate to proceed. There are some as simple as killing an enemy with a new ability (Color) while others require you to study your surroundings, and learn how each Color can send you on your way. It's a small, but fun way to get your brain working, especially in Void Mode where quick learning and fast application are required!While it's a short game, it'll leave a big impression!			"

												Story Mode whooshes by as a passable, simple puzzle game with beautiful scenery.The Void Mode happens.  Possibly the most difficult challenges I've ever seen in a game.The game would be worth the price for story mode alone, void mode makes it a must have for anyone in the mood to rip their hair out for a good challenge.

												Alert: schisophrenic wooden-voice ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!First of all, works flawlessly on my linux (fedora with gnome-shell 3.x), EXCEPT ACHIEVEMENTS - I ended basic story mode in 6 hours, and achievements were shown in game, yet, on steam profile I have none.Game is fun - except the narration. Guy who reads it simply doesn't express proper emotions during reading. What is more, the game would really get more positive feedback, if narration would be split between 2 people - the good guy and bad guy, because as this could be good schizophrenic appeareance - as Gollum in Lord of the Rings - right now, when you hear it, you hear just poorly made, schisophrenic wooden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character, talking about himself in 3rd person.

												Nihilumbra is a 2D platformer with an extremely compelling art style and story.Story: Without spoiling too much in Nihilumbra you play as Born a being from the void and you set out to find your purpose while the void tries to stop you. In short this game has a great story and I encourage that you see for yourself.Gameplay: Nihilumbra is a 2D platformer were you must use colors to your advantage. Each color has a unique property that you can use to your advantage whether it's going through terrain, avoiding enemies or solving puzzles. In this game there is no way to kill enemies yourself until later in the game you also need to use your enviroment to help you. Using colors in my opinion was a great way to expand the depth in the gameplay and make it much less simple but not too complicated.Presentation: The art style of this game is beautiful. It really shows difference between the different levels you advance through and uses a wide range of colors. Not to mention that in this version there is now an art gallery where you can look at concept art, sketchs and level designs.Is it Good? There is one complaint I have about this game and thats how short it is if you play it fast it could be less then 3 hours of gameplay (not including Void mode). But besides that this hidden gem of an indie game is worth buying.			"

												regardless of what you say, narrator, that blob of void is not a hehow could you---this is where steam's binary 'do you recommend this' metric fails for me since it has too many flaws to be a no questions asked buy but i wouldn't completely write it off.the balance is weird, with the main campaign being very easy and feeling like an extended tutorial at times, while the new game plus 'void mode' is basically impossible (i never got past the first screen). i love games with narrators, but the narrator is second rate and better as text than as a voice. the asthethic and feel of this game is really good (those monsters <3) , but the art assets themselves are pretty mediocre, feeling a little too 'default photoshop brush' fuzzy around the edges. i wrote this review like 3 months after i finished the game so i don't remember the ending all that well, whoops! still, i enjoyed playing this game and am interested in what this dev does next			"

Gameplay is innovative and I wondered myself, that a touchscreen-based game was so perfectly executed for keyboard + mouse.Only minor complaintment I had was the stuttering of the background-music, while jumping or other soundeffects.Otherwise beautiful game, reminding me of Transistor with the narrator talking to you.

												Nihilumbra had a very weak first impression on me. The naration and story is not all that motivating to play the game but after you finish the game and start void mode from the beginning it really opens up actually. It becomes a somehwat challenging and interesting platforming/puzzle game. The art and ambience is really nice too, and they came up with some pretty neat mechanix. I'm really happy I finished it, it was a great little experience. ^^Just don't expect too much from the initial play thru, it's really easy.			"

												The story is a terrifying, dark, twisted, tragic and sad journey, but delivered in the most subtle and gentle tone imagineable. I suspect some sense of spirituality or religious material as some of the inspiration or perhaps the basis of some elements. Yet, I percieve this more as a metaphysical mirror of the nature of life, death and reality, presented in a way that wouldn't frighten children;  even if the subject matter is a little too deep for them. The somber soundtrack suits the mood of the story very well. I don't think this game misrepresented anything in the description, however, I was a little disappointed. I don't think it's a bad game at all, just not really for me. Also, really short and extremely concise in every aspect.I am recommending this review based on the fact that had I really looked at the game descriptions, I might not have gotten it, but there were really alot of positive reviews, probably by alot of people who like very casual games.When they say, ""casual,"" they really mean, ""casual."" This game really has little to no challenge at all. It has some very simple and very basic mechanics coupled with unusual and original devices, but that I find has been implemented to a very limited degree as far as challenge and stimulation are concerned. It's cute and fun in a way. I only mention that because I find this game to be perfect for any child that can handle simple game mechanics.I don't dislike this game, but it's really too moderate for me. I think the premise deserves a much darker tone, more intense atmosphere, and much more philosophical literature. I think if you like children's tales and really casual and simple games, then I do recommend it.			"

												Some games are just fun, some tell a good story, and others can only be called works of art. Nihilumbra manages to be all three at once. The gameplay is satisfying as it blends tricky yet manageable platforming with puzzles involving physics-altering pigments. The story is charming at first, since you can not help but cheer for the little blob of life who has just been Born of nothingness, then slowly becomes more tragic as he is forced to bring death into the world around him simply by the act of surviving. Nihilumbra is also a beatiful artistic piece, sporting deep, ponderous themes and striking visuals both in the background and in the foreground. All these factors grip you and hold you so that you do not want to stop playing until it's done. I can't say for sure whether this game changed me as a person, but it certainly made a powerful impression on me. This is a wholehearted recommendation from one very impressed player.			"

												""Beautifun Games"" is right.  This is a true hidden gem of a platformer/puzzler with it's unique art-style, nice/soothing soundtrack, and challenging puzzles.  Watching the trailer should be enough reason to want to purchase this game.  Some reviewers have given this game some flack for it's dark tones/negative narrator.  It is deeper than what is being said by the narrator though.  After the main story there is a ""Void mode"" which is MUCH more challenging than the first playthrough.  You are sure to enjoy this game if you enjoyed LIMBO, Trine, Braid, The Swapper, etc.  Looking forward to see what Beutifun Games comes out with next.			"

												If you like more relaxed or strategic games, this is one for you! The game takes place in the void and many parts of the earth. A small black blob of ""nothingness"" escapes The Void and is trying to find out who he is, what he is, and where he belongs while the void is trying to capture him and bring him back. He doesnt understand the world but as the game progresses he begins to learn. The narrations are cool and in my perspective the narrator is like ""life"", always trying to bring him down and make him feel like he isnt good enough but he always proves the narrator wrong. Its fairly easy, except for a few parts that seem to have no soloution but once you figure it out its fine. There are parts closer to the end of each ""world"" which are more fast paced and challenging but if you have a friend with you so you can share the controls and do two things at once, it may be beneficial for you when passing the ends of each level. You should definitly download this game if it sounds like something your interested in, but hurry...The Void is Coming for you. :)			"

												Now I do like this game I really do, but it has some quirks that I myself found annoying one being the narrator during the whole adventure. From begining to end this narrator will try and tell you something about the world your in. At first this is fine but then it  quickly becomes annoying when he does it for every other room transition and then he tries to tell you how to feel  ""you feel sadness"" then im just sitting here thinking to my self while squinting my eyes ""dont tell me how to feel, Mr narrator man"". Also I was unsure what kind of narrator he is, whether he was the character experiencing the world or  all knowing omnipresent void in the begining of the game. It became more confusing when the narrator switches from helping me by giving me hints to then belittling me for destroying the world. My point is that the game could of used alot less narrative or at least a more consistent one.Now I got two more design nit picks that I have to get off my chest. Although the worlds are beautiful I felt that they were marred by fact we see gunturrets propped in the middle of this beautiful forest. I feel like the designers of Nihilumbra were going make a platformer with a much more syfy setting but changed their mind near the end and couldn't redo all of the objects. Now the last thing would have to be what I suppose you could call a ""boss"" which is when the void comes from the left side of the screen which provides the sense of urgency, but what bothered me is i couldn't run from void until it begun moving forward. So here I am trying to move to the right but I cant becuase the void it too slow. so im just sitting to the right  waiting for the void to catch up so I can progress which took sense of urgency right out of the whole situation. If they maybe just allowed me to move to the right without restriction, they could of sped the void and made me feel the urgency that they wanted to make me feel.All in all a good puzzle platformer game that I felt had more potential and could been something great. I wouldn't say not get this game for 10$ but it might intrest you to wait for a sale.			"

												Really amazing indie game. Nice nihillistic story with enjoyable storytelling and animation. It's more puzzle solving game rather than platformer at least the first part. In the first part you collect collors in five different worlds. Each color gives you some special ability like you can paint red color on the floor to burn monsters. After finishing the game, which will happen pretty soon because it's quite short and easy, you will unlock challenge mode. In this mode you can go through previous worlds (in any order) which are now a bit modified to provide more difficult brain teasers and rexlex & timing abilities. Problem is that it's not very well ballanced and some levels are really difficult. See, difficulty is not increasing regularly but it's somehow random. At the end all puzzles and challenges are possible to handle ballancing on boundary where it can get bit too frustrating especially if you're not skilled in this type of games. After beating this mode you will unlock special ""Secret Language"" bonus which gives the game brand new replayability and chance to enjoy something untraditional and funny. To sum up, it has some pros and some cons but overall for 2.50€ in sale it's great deal you shouldn't miss.			"

												KNOW WHAT YOUR GETTINGNihilumbra is a beautiful game with a unique art style, world, and interesting story that is definitely worth playing if you're the kind of person who would enjoy it. Its basically a story driven platformer with basic puzzles. The game is pretty easy and not overly long. Although after beating the main story [void mode] is unlocked which challenges the player to go back through all the lvls with more challenging layouts to get a better ending to the game. If you enjoy atmospheric games and supporting indie developers you should have about a weekends worth of fun here. I could see some people feeling the game is to short, to easy, or to simple for the price. If you're at all tempted I would recommend trying this game, you can tell the team put a lot of love and effort into the world.The Good+Refreshing Art Style+Interesting Story that keeps you engaged until the end+Great soundtrack and narration The Bag-Short game length-Most puzzles are very simple			"

												A game of two halves, one reasonably easy and entertaining in its portentous but well-meant way (this is better than Depression Quest, for example), and the other... well, once you've finished the game, it unlocks Void Mode, which is a remix of the entire game, and I didn't get past the second screen, mostly because I thought, well, what's the point. So I recommend it (at a cheap price) for the first half, but you should expect it to glide by in a peaceful couple of hours and then become frustrating / the really hard game you actually want to play.

												A very nice game with fun mechanics and an artistic aspect. It won't be that much of a challenge for any hardcore player, but still a satisfying experience. It's a bit short, but I guess it goes accordingly to the theme going on (i.e : colors). The musics are stunning. I'd recommend you buy the game just for the soundtrack, it is that good.Nihil Umbra, it has its charms, some may enjoy it, some may love it, some may not. I, for my part, really did enjoy the game.

Without any intersubjective affirmation something, which was nothing, was suddenly existing, being ...To make it short: this kind of game is what i would consider as ""art"" - even only because of its high philosophical depth. But there is way more to this game which makes it art than just an philosophical interesting premise. It is designed very athmospheric, and the sound does the rest. Even though the game design is pretty, lets say ""traditional"", the puzzles aren't frustrating (until now). Finally i can say: a very intelligent, well-told story.

												Fun, easy to learn/difficult to master, and rather short, Nihilumbra's story mode can probably be finished in a single sitting. Controls are easy and intuitive, and powers are doled out at regular intervals. Many of the puzzles are quite clever, though to be blunt the most fun ones are extremely front-loaded. The art style and music are absolutely gorgeous, and though simple, the clear aesthetic unity and crispness puts many other games in its price range to shame. The game only suffers from two problems, but they are irksome: 1) Even in story (""easy"") mode, there are moments that are just plain unforgiving. Many puzzles are more accurately described as ""die so you see the mechanic, respawn, use knowledge get through mechanic, then die to next mechanic, repeat."" Essentially savescumming as progression. This isn't Planescape: Torment where death was used to solve puzzles, it's just a way to pad out the game's length. There's a very noticeable drop-off in players who have the level 1 and 2 completed achievements; a fact that coincides noticeably with the first die-through-it puzzle. 2) The script seems like something written by a teenager going through a goth phase. and is narrated by someone extremely doped up on sleep meds. If you enjoy the slow, monotonous, repetitive naming of emotions rather than any actual content that would invoke those feelings, this may be up your alley. For most people, though, it's most likely simply to bring back repressed memories of terrible college creative-writing papers. You remember the one guy who always told everyone how deep and underappreciated he was despite not having done anything memorable? That's this game's script. That said, the actual gameplay is generally fantastic. At least until you unlock Void (""hard"") mode by beating the story. There's a reason that roughly 1/6th the people who beat the game have even a single Void level clear achievement. Void Mode is die-through-it on steroids, and will literally kill you within seconds of spawning on the very first stage of the first level. Up until you get to Void, however, it's a fun, mostly casual game that anyone with a fondness for platformers will enjoy. Art: 10/10Sound: 10/10Writing: 4/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 8/10Definitely worth the buy, especially considering how cheap it is.			"

												Get it if it's on sale.Overall, not bad. But it seems like the creators saw these beautiful, story-rich art games catching on and wanted to make one so. very. desperately. The only thing the over-prevalent story can claim as its own is a narrator that won't shut up, telling you what you should feel on just about every screen, ultimately resulting in you feeling nothing. It doesn't help that the writing is poorly translated, and that the lone voice actor dutifully reads through typos as if they make as much sense to him as anything else in the script. (Honestly, given the fact that the guy had to say things like: ""Red possesses the power of fire"" that seems likely.) Someone missed the memo that games like this should omit text and voice acting entirely, unless it's borderline poetry.Now that that's out of the way, other artistic elements flourish. Honestly, I bought the game because of how gorgeous the screenshots looked, and it didn't disappoint visually all the way through. The animation, in particular, is extremely detailed, and it seems like every time you watch your character move, you see something you didn't notice before. All the backgrounds are equally pretty. The orchestral soundtrack is utterly fantastic, and the most surprising thing about the game (yes, it has an orchestral soundtrack). I just wish the developer had had the wisdom to let these elements speak for themselves.I know I'm mentioning the gameplay last, but personally, while it may have been easy, I thought the powers were a lot of fun to play with, and the mechanics for how they worked together were pretty well thought out. I haven't started Void mode yet, but I've heard it's when the game actually gets difficult, and that the 3 hour campaign is really just an extended tutorial. Honestly, I think it's a good format for a game with memorable mechanics, and this one has them. I'd love to see the game take advantage of the green and brown powers to make some insane platforming sequences. We'll have to see whether I'm disappointed or not later on.			"

Another good aspect is the fantasy it relases, you have to wisely use your ""colors"", which have different powers, to go through the game. In normal mode it isn't that difficult, but in ""void mode"", unlocked once finishing the game, heck, it becomes really difficult! The art works are fascinating and catching, the narrator voice is like your only fellow in your odissey, the music and the atmosphere are really involving and will make you want to get to the end of the game, the end of the story, the end of the suffering?!

The story is semi-interesting revolving teaching you the surface of basic nihilism based on ideas of a consuming and ending Void.  The really big issue for the game is the very annoying ominous voice that is sometimes directive, encouraging, degrading, and overall contradictive--it would have been a strength to remove some narrative and the voice acting all together.Short even with two modes.  Enjoy only for a low price.			"

												Nihilumbra is a nice little way to spend the afternoon. It's nothing truly incredible, the visuals don't really have a unified style, the environments are a bit samey and the narration seems forced, but in the end, I enjoyed it.Nihilumbra has a fairly unique set of mechanics that make for decent puzzles, the character sprite looks incredible, and there's something very original about the story, becoming more introspective and character-focused than I ever imagined it would be. If I'm honest, I expected this to be sort of a lazy indie game clone: Bastion had narration, Limbo had bleak environments and silouhettes, Tag had paint that covers surfaces and alters their attributes, but there's still something unique and special about Nihilumbra, and that's the story. Even though the story centers around (generously speaking) only one character, and even despite the cliched appearance, I was left satisfied nonetheless.			"

												I bought this game at summer sale and just beat the Story Mode. I actually decided to get this since it was cheap and I love Haunter from Pokemon...since the artwork was great I didn't care how great as a game Nihilumbra is.I, however, hereby am proud to say that this game has betrayed me. Apart from the one place in the Boss Stage, where you have to jump at the right place the first time, everything wasn't that hard and hell-a-lot fun. It makes you twist your brain; and it is worth every penny. And the main character is so cute! His/Her every reaction is...well I don't know how to explain but it is cute. MEGA cute. Like this guy sneezes when they are cold. And more. OMG. Why did you guys have to put those faces in, dear creators? I'm now in love.Anyways on personal note, I'm happy that the Boss representation wasn't the one on Bottom Left of the concept art. I may not have been able to continue the game out of fear if that happened. I like the ones on the right...top and bottom. :P  But now that I beat the game I think the final decision is the greatest.			"

												Nihilumbra is a fun game about a creature, Born, born from ""The Void,"" a primordial entity of eternal darkness, trying to escape from The Void. Born finds himself in Nihilumbra (meaning ""the shadow of nothing,"" from nihil, nothing, and umbra, shadow), the ruins of a world once inhabited by whom one can only speculate. This is one of the most thought provoking games ever.			"

												My first impression is awesome! This is a game I actually enjoy failing because it doesn't matter. The music is a smooth drippling background noise that contradicts the harsh words and worlds beautifully. The setting is just great.As far as the controls go, they take some adaption. However, they game does a great job (so far) of Challenging you setp by step. That might be why a failure state doesn't make my rage quit. It really is a process of growing.The graphics are suitable, I guess. Some of the animations are ridiculous (coyote over the cliff moments) but normally you won't be bothered by them.There seem to be more game modes - the achievements spoiler a bit. "

												Nihilumbra is a game that at first glance seems a little too inspired by Limbo for some, but upon further inspection is a game that creates its own unique world and atmosphere.One of the aspects that sets this game apart from Limbo is its narration. The voiceover never completely explains certain parts of the story, which keeps a certain mystery around the game's world, and sometimes may make the player consider what side the narrator is on. Subtitles are set to be always on, and are integrated into the game's environment so people can still read the story if the narrator annoys them that much, though I personally enjoyed the storytelling.The game has a reasonable difficulty curve for the main story, though there were a few puzzles that were a little more difficult than someone would suspect at only 1 or 2 points in the journey. Nihilumbra also features a challenge mode similar to Super Meat Boy called ""Void Mode"", which has every level from the main story but more difficult and without narration, effectively doubling the game's levels from 40 to 80.Void Mode provides some replay value to Nihilumbra, and the puzzles range from a worthy challenge to a bit vague. Certain solutions have no origin in story mode, such as bouncing and sliding a crate on the ground between two points so it can hit multiple switches, and will probably result in a player looking up the answer. However, the majority of puzzles have been somewhat reasonable, with some requiring excellent timing and others utilizing planning in advance.This game is a welcome addition to my library, especially when I purchased it at only $2 during a sale. I look forward to the remaining challenges this game can provide. FYI: For those curious, the Linux version, which I'm using, works, but the achievements unlocked in-game do not sync with Steam without some work. A solution is mentioned by someone here: http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1u2v4r/couple_of_tips_for_nihilumbra_players_on_64bit/which also links to a dev post on Steam forums for any necessary further explanation.

												This is a great game. It is a fun, creative game with puzzles that will make you thinking for solutions, and sometimes make you think outside of the box. The void mode is really difficult, giving you a great challenge and make you think outside of the box most of the time. The music is nice too, the orchestral music is very fitting to the situation that Born(the main character) is in, when being chased by a unstopable void. The enemies have really creative design and helps solve puzzles if you use your powers correctly. It is worth your money... go on... get it.			"

												Challenging, atmospheric, meaningful and immersive; all that describes Nihilumbra. Many know this game as an iOS port, but it is definitely best played on PC. You play as a piece of void, who craves to seek the world beyond darkness -- and this game really delivers the emotions of the voidling through the narration of the 'voice inside your head'. It is quite short, however, but very thought provoking.Consider the first time you finish the game as your tutorial for the challenge mode that comes next: The Void Mode. So the game never stops challenging you with harder and harder levels.A great buy, especially if you purchase on a sale.			"

			Views: 24		

			Nihilumbra first appears as yet another 2D puzzle platformer in a long line of indie games trying to follow the successes of Braid and Limbo from years back.		

		The player controls a creature named “Born” as it escapes an empty void into the physical world. As Born progresses, a narrator will explain the futility of the whole affair. The narrator insists the void will relentlessly chase Born down as the “the void must be one.” The narrator argues the world is harsh and doesn’t care what the fate of Born will be. The narrator repeats Born is not a part of the physical world and cannot live there. Born is nothing. It’s all pointless. Born will die. Nihilumbra, as its name suggests, is a game about Nihilism – a philosophy asserting the meaninglessness of life. 	The message is presented in a brutally heavy handed way. It has the subtlety of a hammer slamming on a nail. Perhaps some will find this off-putting, but the decision to forgo nuance results in a gut wrenching emotional conflict between Born and the narrator. As Born moves through the world in spite of the harsh rhetoric, the narrator can be seen as Born’s internal doubt. Progressing through the world feels like an accomplishment, not only for overcoming obstacles, but for overcoming the narrator’s negativity. Eventually, the narrator will admit Born is putting up a good fight. One of the best scenes is early on, when a set of obstacles tests Born’s physical abilities. Born is not strong enough, nor quick enough, but maybe - maybe Born is smart enough. 	The Nihilistic philosophy of the narrator is constantly undermined throughout the adventure.  The narrator will present a point in their favor, and quickly offer a counterpoint, countering that point, and then countering it again. The narrator argues with itself, and can be seen as a debate inside Born’s head. While the always in pursuit void is a threat, doubt and anxiety within Born are the central conflicts. 	The narrator, while maintaining the end is nigh, provides tons of encouragement to push Born and the player onwards. It offers assurances just as much as it offers doubt.  It’s never an unlikable presence and more often than not feels like a good friend and ally. As Born comes across and absorbs elemental powers, the narrator will instruct on how to use them. The elements themselves are typical of this type of game. There is slippery ice, bouncy grass, and destructive lava. Sand and Electricity are the stand outs. With Electricity, the player can create currents sending power to contraptions like elevators and turrets. Sand is the most versatile of them all, allowing the player to slow enemies, withstand fierce winds, stick to walls, and silence footsteps. The narrator will also take the time to explain various enemies around the world. Some chase, some shoot, some will erase elemental powers, and other just suck … quite literally. 	The game is masterfully paced, presenting these abilities one at a time, but not spending very much time with a single element on its own. The game follows a formula where it teaches an element in a safe tutorial, then asks the player to use the element by itself, and finally tasks the player with using the element in conjunction with previously learned abilities. There is always a feeling of progress and of learning something new with every scenario. Again, there is nothing completely unique about the gameplay, but it is well executed.	The only blemishes to the game are tedious chase sequences in which the Void has found Born and attempts to reabsorb them. These moments are used as an equivalent of boss battles, happening at the end of an act and requiring mastery of that acts new mechanics. Nihilumbra’s puzzles are clever, but are never a challenge. As such, the problem with these battles is twofold. Often the puzzles are too easy to solve, leaving Born to wait on the camera to move forward. Alternatively, the full breadth of a puzzle isn’t unveiled quick enough and can’t be completed in a timely fashion resulting in a frustrating death. These sequences are only a small portion of the game, but are definitely its weakest points.	The games real strengths rarely come from the gameplay by itself, but rather how the powers, enemies, and puzzles blend beautifully with the story being told. As Born gains new abilities, it becomes clear they are becoming more attached to the world around them than they are to the void giving chase. The narrator notes, Born was nothing when it left the void, but through these learned abilities has definitely become something. With this revelation, the game shifts from being a dramatic depression factory into a somewhat uplifting criticism of Nihilism. 	What Nihilumbra does is nothing extraordinary, but it wraps itself in a protective blanket of rich atmosphere and tastefully direct writing perfect for the moody teenager in all of us. Its story and gameplay meld seamlessly with excellent music and art to create a completely cohesive vison throughout its entirety. Nihilumbra knows what it is, isn’t ashamed of it, and preforms with a high grade of quality.			"

This wasn't a challenge to beat is was impossible. Needed to YouTube it to see how it was done. Stopped playing at that point. I don't recommend it for any puzzle enthusiast it will just raise your blood pressure on the annoyance scale. Well the makers could have shown better talent when thinking that part out.			"

The game follows a formula where it teaches an element in a safe tutorial, then asks the player to use the element by itself, and finally tasks the player with using the element in conjunction with previously learned abilities. There is always a feeling of progress and of learning something new with every scenario. Again, there is nothing completely unique about the gameplay, but it is well executed.	The only blemishes to the game are tedious chase sequences in which the Void has found Born and attempts to reabsorb them. These moments are used as an equivalent of boss battles, happening at the end of an act and requiring mastery of that acts new mechanics. Nihilumbra’s puzzles are clever, but are never a challenge. As such, the problem with these battles is twofold. Often the puzzles are too easy to solve, leaving Born to wait on the camera to move forward. Alternatively, the full breadth of a puzzle isn’t unveiled quick enough and can’t be completed in a timely fashion resulting in a frustrating death. These sequences are only a small portion of the game, but are definitely its weakest points.	The games real strengths rarely come from the gameplay by itself, but rather how the powers, enemies, and puzzles blend beautifully with the story being told. As Born gains new abilities, it becomes clear they are becoming more attached to the world around them than they are to the void giving chase. The narrator notes, Born was nothing when it left the void, but through these learned abilities has definitely become something. With this revelation, the game shifts from being a dramatic depression factory into a somewhat uplifting criticism of Nihilism. 	What Nihilumbra does is nothing extraordinary, but it wraps itself in a protective blanket of rich atmosphere and tastefully direct writing perfect for the moody teenager in all of us. Its story and gameplay meld seamlessly with excellent music and art to create a completely cohesive vison throughout its entirety. Nihilumbra knows what it is, isn’t ashamed of it, and preforms with a high grade of quality.			"

												Challenging, atmospheric, meaningful and immersive; all that describes Nihilumbra. Many know this game as an iOS port, but it is definitely best played on PC. You play as a piece of void, who craves to seek the world beyond darkness -- and this game really delivers the emotions of the voidling through the narration of the 'voice inside your head'. It is quite short, however, but very thought provoking.Consider the first time you finish the game as your tutorial for the challenge mode that comes next: The Void Mode. So the game never stops challenging you with harder and harder levels.A great buy, especially if you purchase on a sale.			"

												Absolutely one of the most beautiful 2D platforming games ever made. I originally found this by accident on the iTunes App Store, and it was one of the best purchases I've ever made. As soon as I saw that it was available on Steam, I obviously purchased it in a heartbeat. The graphics, music and story are unprecedented, and really make you question the world you live in and the way you live your life. What really brings this masterpiece to life though, in my opinion, is the musical score. It is so emotional, I can almost hear the composer's thoughts as he brought notes to paper. To me, gaming has always been an art, and if you believe that too, you should purchase this game and experience what it has to offer.PS: There's a surprize at the end!			"

												Nihilumbra is very enjoyable 2D platformer where you use various elemental themed colours/powers to ""draw"" said colours onto walls, floors and ceilings to slide, jump, and stick your way over and around obstacles and enemies. The overall story is slightly dark and focuses on you, a small spawn of the ""Void"", trying to escape from where you were born and find a reason to live in these strange, new (to you) worlds. Overall a fun game I got off of Humble Bundle that took me almost 2 hours to beat the story. The game also features a challenge mode after beating the main story which I plan to get into at a later date. Glad I played it.Edit: it actually took me a little over 3 hours to beat the main story because I was attempting to get the ""Pacifist"" achievement on my first playthrough. Still ended up not getting it. ; _ ;			"

												Very beatiful piece of art. The first time you go through it, it is mostly a story telling game, and i simply loved living this adventure. Very deep. Another good aspect is the fantasy it relases, you have to wisely use your ""colors"", which have different powers, to go through the game. In normal mode it isn't that difficult, but in ""void mode"", unlocked once finishing the game, heck, it becomes really difficult! The art works are fascinating and catching, the narrator voice is like your only fellow in your odissey, the music and the atmosphere are really involving and will make you want to get to the end of the game, the end of the story, the end of the suffering?! In conclusion, i'd reccomend this game to ones who like challenging puzzle games, or good story telling ones			"

												A game about overcoming an existential life crisis with heavy usage of art motifs for emotion? SOLD! :DNihilumbra is a unique indie 2D platformer/puzzle game in which you play as an awakened consciousness from the Void that has decided to escape from the dreary and desolate darkness and start life anew, traveling across vast landscapes while the Void lingers slightly behind in pursuit. You, as the Void Creature, traverse across numerous unique and beautiful landscapes to discover your purpose in life while solving puzzles to progress further. The game's light platforming segments are made into unique puzzles based around various powers you acquire from different colored flowers, each with its own special ability and suiting to the environment. If anything can be properly said about Nihilumbra, is that it does it's tone WONDERFULLY. As you travel across the land, your exploits and thoughts are told by a wisened narrator that offers his thoughts (or rather, narrates your own in second-person fashion) on every instance you find yourself in. The game's atmosphere is finely split between three moods: Wonder, somber, and fear. Every new area you enter, you find yourself experiencing thoughts of wonder and curiosity, amazed at every little thing, from the embracing green of the leaves to the harsh red of fire. However, the mood shifts to somber once you realize that the Void, having been chasing after you on your journey for leaving, will come soon and consume the land. And finally, when the Void shows up, intensity is raked up to twenty, and you are in a state of panic as the narrator continues his tirade about hopelessness and inevitability, some part of you desperatly clinging to the idea that he is wrong and you can prove it!!!... Wow, that got a little outta hand there, didn't it?Well! Anyway, Nihilumbra is an artistically pleasing game, good on the eyes, good on the ears, good on the gameplay, and good looking in your game library. I give this game a positive recommendation and a 8/10 rating. Plus, there's always Void mode to play post game, if you're so inclined for the challenge...			"

												Ah, Nihilumbra, another one of those ""Cute"" games that comments philosophically on the nature of life, the universe, and everything. Yes, a lot of games do this, but I have never been so attached to a character as I have been to Born, so much wanted to see this character grow, and so wanted everything to be okay for the little mite. You really kind of have to put your own spin on the character by nature of what it is, and that's pretty different from most games like this I've seen.The story is that you (Born) are a shadow being from the Void - the Nothingness, that is - and you, curious about the world outside the Void, break free from it into the world of... Something. Quickly, you learn to become and adapt in this environment, changing it, loving it, only for the Void to come after you time and again, trying to reclaim you. The way Born navigates his environs is through elemental magic of a sort, painting elements onto the environs to solve physics puzzles in a way somewhat reminiscent of Okami/Okamiden. Of course, Okami/Okamiden never left me a crying disaster over a shadow creature just trying to make his way in the world, because puppies generally try not to hurt your heart when they make mistakes. The monsters in the game are terrifyingly designed and (yes I know my reviews say this a lot) really do look like something out of a Lovecraft story. Try looking at a Crawlaggar and NOT seeing something that could reasonably pass as a Hound of the Tindalos, I dare you, especially when it comes chasing after you in packs from off-screen...That said, this charming game is not everyone's cup of tea - there is a New Game Plus mode after the end of the normal game, a sort of ""B Adventure"" where you go back through the levels fixing what the Void has destroyed, and it is ABSOLUTELY BRUTALLY HARD. I'm serious, I consider myself a puzzle buff and a fan of rogue-style difficulty, but this is even too much for me. Split-second timing, rather unfair jumps, trial and error, and using elements to deflect bullets into incredibly tough series of enemies - they're all here, often during the chapter-end chases, and they will bend you over a table and go in dry. I am not kidding here, the New Game Plus of this game reaches unprecidented levels of Guide Dang It at points, and that's not even counting the various achievements that aren't related to gameplay itself! I genuinely needed a walkthrough to even make it to the end, and even that was difficult when you look at some of the absolute bull-hocky that this game expects you to do in New Game Plus. To compound that, Born's hitbox sometimes plays oddly with certain enemies - like the Vacuumore - where even being two feet away from the enemy's maw is enough to kill you. This also appears to occur with boxes and spikes on some occasions. I suspect this is a bit of a glitch or oversight, and the game maker did not intend to make the hitbox quite so sensitive, in which case - please fix this, it makes the game quite difficult for the wrong reasons.At the same time, IMHO, the normal game is almost too easy, with obvious solutions to fairly obvious puzzles. Yes, it gets very clever with them - using the bounce power to ricochet bullets, using the sticky power to stick enemies to walls and ceilings (which is freaking hilarious to watch because they flail around), etc. However, generally any time you need speed, you used the slippery power, making electronics work uses the electronic power, etc. Obvious problem + Obvious power = Obvious solution, and I wish that there was more use of mixing of powers to get to a solution as the New Game Plus does. So, between the main game being too easy, and New Game Plus being too hard (but not impossible), couldn't there have been a bit more of a transition between the two? Maybe like, just add more monsters instead of more difficult puzzles, or add more puzzles but not more monsters? Then you could have an easy, medium, and hard mode for those who wanted to play around with the powers and use new and more interesting power combinations to reach their goals, and you could have had the B Adventure be tougher without being so tough it made me tear my hair out in frustration. At the very least, you could have cut down on the number of timing-sensitive puzzles that are near freaking impossible; there's a difference between Nintendo Hard and Frustrating.All in all, I do still like this game, a lot, and find it difficult to hate. The scenery and general idea behind it is gorgeous, I love playing Pseudo-Okami with the powers, and obtaining each power was a true pleasure and very satisfying. Burning things with the fire power is amazingly fun, and the puzzles are pretty clever all things considered. I would recommend this game, but only if you like physics platform-puzzlers with a tough streak in its New Game Plus, because seriously - that second half makes you WORK for its achievements...			"

												Nihilumbra is a fun game about a creature, Born, born from ""The Void,"" a primordial entity of eternal darkness, trying to escape from The Void. Born finds himself in Nihilumbra (meaning ""the shadow of nothing,"" from nihil, nothing, and umbra, shadow), the ruins of a world once inhabited by whom one can only speculate. This is one of the most thought provoking games ever.			"

												I initially bought this game just because it was on sale, but it turned out to be one of the more imaginative games i've seen in a while. As soon as the game started, I was thrown into a world of beautiful artwork and music. I also loved the main character, despite it being little more than a blob. The narrator (whose voice resembles that of Morgan Freeman) plays very well into the overall atmosphere, which can vary from charming to downright unsettleing. This is an amazing indie game that obviosly had a lot of love put into it and deserves more attention. My only complaint is that the puzzles leave something to be desired, as I solved most of them almost instantly. Overall, I'd give this game 4/5 stars			"

												Good game, though it often pretends to be more profound than it actually is. It often breaks the age old rule of ""show, don't tell.""The puzzles themselves are often too easy, though I also would like there to be an option to disable hints (maybe there is, couldn't find it) because the hints that there are just give away the solution.Still, I'd recommend this game.

												A clever puzzle-platformer based on ""colors"" mechanic -- think gels from Portal 2. First half of the game feels to easy, but the difficulty builds up as you reach the ""Void"" chapters -- those bring both some brain-teasers and tricky action sequences. The visual style is pleasant, and the story is simple, but touching. Not a masterpiece, but a strong, solid example of the genre.			"

												The first playthrough is only around 2.5 hours and is fun and mildly/comfortably challenging, but the second playthrough in Void Mode is where the game shines (challenge-wise). While Void Mode goes through the same landscapes, the puzzles are different: Braid/Portal levels of complexity/challenge (judging from the first 6% I've played of it so far), and I get the feeling this mode will take at least twice as long to finish, so at least 8 hours' worth of fun gameplay. It has a basic story, which I was indifferent to, but other reviewers seem to like it. For me, the story neither helped nor hindered the game. The narration can be turned off.Highly recommended.			"

												The first part of Nihilumbra feels almost too easy, but once you reach Void Mode things really heat up and the game becomes much more difficult.  I am thoroughly enjoying Void Mode and, as I beat each level, the feeling of accomplishment from beating the puzzles.  :)The music, narration, art, and gameplay come together perfectly to create an environment that I quickly became attached to.  10/10 would recommend!On a personal note, I played Nihilumbra at the perfect time in my life; the story, while minimal, resonated with my struggle with depression and anxiety.  Escaping the Void (depression) and slowly learning different abilities (ways to cope) helped me see that there is a way to beat the depression I'm fighting against and become my own person.			"

												Love this game. I actually first played it on my iphone for free I think, but when I saw that it was on steam on PC one day, I was like omg.This game is amazing and deserves much more players and attention. It's beautiful, fun, touching, etc. And I connect to it, I feel alone and like a void myself.My main username online is litterly ""BitterVoid"".And the artwork is so good, I collect backgrounds for my PC. It's on slideshow and changes every 5 minutes. I have so many backgrounds and I love it, so when I went into the art gallery in this game, I used some of the beautiful artwork for backgrounds.Also I wanted to support this game, having already played it on ios. But it was much better on pc also. Don't regret buying. Don't regret supporting.even with the few visa card money I have from christmas			"

												A game about overcoming an existential life crisis with heavy usage of art motifs for emotion? SOLD! :DNihilumbra is a unique indie 2D platformer/puzzle game in which you play as an awakened consciousness from the Void that has decided to escape from the dreary and desolate darkness and start life anew, traveling across vast landscapes while the Void lingers slightly behind in pursuit. You, as the Void Creature, traverse across numerous unique and beautiful landscapes to discover your purpose in life while solving puzzles to progress further. The game's light platforming segments are made into unique puzzles based around various powers you acquire from different colored flowers, each with its own special ability and suiting to the environment. If anything can be properly said about Nihilumbra, is that it does it's tone WONDERFULLY. As you travel across the land, your exploits and thoughts are told by a wisened narrator that offers his thoughts (or rather, narrates your own in second-person fashion) on every instance you find yourself in. The game's atmosphere is finely split between three moods: Wonder, somber, and fear. Every new area you enter, you find yourself experiencing thoughts of wonder and curiosity, amazed at every little thing, from the embracing green of the leaves to the harsh red of fire. However, the mood shifts to somber once you realize that the Void, having been chasing after you on your journey for leaving, will come soon and consume the land. And finally, when the Void shows up, intensity is raked up to twenty, and you are in a state of panic as the narrator continues his tirade about hopelessness and inevitability, some part of you desperatly clinging to the idea that he is wrong and you can prove it!!!... Wow, that got a little outta hand there, didn't it?Well! Anyway, Nihilumbra is an artistically pleasing game, good on the eyes, good on the ears, good on the gameplay, and good looking in your game library. I give this game a positive recommendation and a 8/10 rating. Plus, there's always Void mode to play post game, if you're so inclined for the challenge...			"

												Slightly disappointed by this.  I played through the whole thing and never really got into it.Voice over narration is unnessecary, angsty, and constant.The story mode game is fair on the player.  Solutions make sense and achievable.  GFX and gameplay is much what you see in the video.  I think I was convinced by some of the positive reviews that there was a lot of gameplay in the post-story mode, but I just couldn't drag myself through it after a couple of quite ridiculous unfair bonus levels.

												This platformer is a neat little game that I had a good time with. It is interesting, has a indie feel to it, and is just a little brooding. Or maybe more than just a little. Your being chased by a leathal darkness/nothingness. Anyway it is a nice little game that I found to be enjoyable.			"

												Very good Indie-Game!Pros:+ Solid gameplay+ Great atmosphere+ Amazing story+ Storytelling works out perfectly+ Fitting graphic-elements (creatures, backgrounds, ...)+ Everything seems very dark and deep (personal preference)+ Satisfying ending (in my opinion)Cons:- Graphics are beautiful but could be polished- The game often is either too easy (normal mode) or too difficult (void-mode)- A little bit shortAll in all I can really recommend the game if you need a small game you can play between learning or work sessions.I would love it if the developers would bring out a polished and longer version of the game.

												Looks nice on the surface, and I like the mechanics. Still, I found puzzles simple to the point of being dull, and the voiced narration on just about every screen not charming in the least, such that I turned down the volume. I can't recommend to anyone who's well familiar with puzzle platformers, but it might appeal to a casual crowd.			"

												Although it was short, this game was beautiful. I loved the story and the beauty within it. It creates a memorable experience and I would definitely recommend looking into it! It's fairly priced for the story it tells and the experiences you and the character go through. All in all one of the better short games I've purchased.			"

												It's a charming game and I like how you collect different colors that give you different abilities/powers throughout the game. The voice acting is alright but it loses its mysterious charm by making everything sound the same. I haven't gotten more than a few levels into the game but I do feel like there aren't any proper endings to the major areas, no bosses or such. You just sort of move on to the next place. The game might get more interesting as it goes on, but there's not much going on in the game so far.			"
