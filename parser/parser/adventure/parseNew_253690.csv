												Buyer Beware! Check the game for updates. I bought the game during steam sale for $2, and I didn't check. If the most recent update is still Mar 27, 2014, then multiplayer over internet is broken (players can not join a game over the internet, they get dropped from the game and sent back to the lobby) leaving you unable to play with friends (you will be sad). On the forums, the Developer promised an update in the beginning of April, but it has never shipped, and the game is still broken. Tl;Dr: If the game was last updated Mar 27, 2014, Multiplayer is broken, don't buy it until it is fixed by the developer. (14 weeks and counting)			"

												Though hampered by the occasional bout of unpredictably frustrating physics, Tiny Brains is unique and creative enough that you forget to care. It's clear that the game was designed with multiplayer at the forefront, as playing solo is possible but significantly less rewarding. Multiplayer can be in the form of couch or online co-op or competitive play, and features gameplay so fun that it's difficult to get too worked up over the potential failures of your teammates.The game never wants you to take it seriously, and that framework is part of what makes the game work so well. It's charming, packs a killer ear-wormy soundtrack, and offers brain teasing gameplay that will no doubt remind you of Portal. Though the main story campaign is pretty short, the package you get from the multiplayer is more than worth the price tag.			"

												This game is a blast to play, though it was a little glitchy/laggy at times. This was to be expected though, as my friends and I were playing co-op over not necessarily so good internet connections, but it didn't detract from the game very much. We were all extremely sad to realize that there was no way to do Tiny Soccer or Troll Mode via online connections, however, as we worked hard to get all 20 cheeses and had been so excited to get to play Troll Mode together and just be ridiculous derps. It would be amazing if online co-op for these modes could be enabled, as we all would probably play the game for many more hours as a result. Otherwise it was a great challenge, and we had a ton of fun shouting at each other over skype to do this or be this Tiny Brain. :)			"

												Tiny Brains is an excellent co-op puzzle game that I think anyone can enjoy. It's not portal, but it's still an excellent game, what really makes this game shine is when you play it with a bunch of friends- and that's the point. If you're going to solo play this, I think your time is better spent, but as a co-op game its definitely a great experience to test friendships working out puzzles, since each person is handed a single tool in your toolkit.My only complaint about the game is that I wish there were more puzzles, DLC is likely in the future, but even so when my friends and I did our first playthrough it only took us 90 minutes- there are some challenge modes, which are definitely great to extend it's lifetime, as let me tell you, working together with 3 other people to keep the ball on the endless rotating pillar is pretty exhillarting and full of suspense, and when you do fail you just try to do it better again.Finally, I will say this, the game is available on the PS4, and if you have one I would reccomend you get this game for the PS4 instead. The game's strength is as a couch co-op/party game. Its easy to play, it's kid friendly (if you're wondering) and the single player mode just honestly doesn't bring the same entertainment playing it with friends is. As of this moment, I think this is the best party game to get for a PS4, definitely something to grab if you were looking for a reason to invite your buddies over to play your PS4 with you.			"

												Tiny Brains is a small game that is best played with friends. If you play it solo, you'll find the puzzles a bit boring, the horde missions awkward and the get-the-ball-to-the-other-side puzzles annoying. The graphics are pretty, but that's all it has going for it. If you want to play a proper puzzle game, play Portal (2) or Q.U.B.E., which are also coincidentally twice as long.[Rating: 60/100]			"

Overall, this is a fun little romp when you have 3 or 4 local couch co-op players available. In my opinion, there is some wasted potential here, but it works. Tiny Brains boils down to giving each player a very specific 'power' which they can then work as a group to solve puzzles. In general, the puzzles are trying to get out of a single room (move the 'key' to the slot kind of thing). The theme is science. It could be better executed, but because this is such a niche genre (4 player puzzle solving) it gets a pass. I hate saying that. In general I think it suffers from some blandness that often is associated with AAA titles. Although I have no idea what the budget was for this game - there were many people in the credits.Try the demo - it is a decent length.Pros:+Science theme is cool enough+Controls work fine+Puzzles have a medium difficulty - could have been more difficult IMO, but it was fineCons:-Some levels have fighting elements which I would rather do without - just stick to the puzzles-Voice over is real meh-Graphics are bland, needed someone to make stronger artistic decisions, IMO-Better in short play sessions to keep it from feeling repetitive-I know this sounds really silly and picky - but it bothered me when all the people in the credits had the Dr. title - I know its in the theme, but it just bothers meIts a steal if you can get it on a sale. Try the demo - it speaks for itself. "

												What an amazing breath of fresh air, this puzzle game is. Amongst all of the similar platformers and shooters and everything in between, this game somehow manages to bring back that hilarity that we so enjoyed on a snow day at a friend's house. It can be played alone, but the game really does shine when you are playing with others. If you can't do local or friends (which is preferred, you won't want to miss those moments), you can still play with others online, and it is simply a blast. The characters are lovable and zany, and the story completely out of left field, as to be expected from indie publishers. The game has a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and the story is quite short, but the challenges and extra modes don't get old when you play with friends - it's an overall very positive experience. 8/10P.S: Beat the Jules mode to get the best achievement to ever grace our mortal kind!

												Tiny Brains wants to treat you like its minuscule rodent protagonists.A coop focused puzzle game, you play as one of four furballs who through some bizarre experiment have been given superpowers and are now naturally stuck running through tests to deduce just how intelligent they've become. Where Spearhead takes this so far however is in seemingly forgetting to design its puzzles as anything requiring involved thought or clever utilization of its awkwardly implemented mechanics.There's this feeling throughout playing Tiny Brains like you're running on a treadmill through the tutorial for all of its four very brief levels. It reuses the same puzzle types, repeats similar level designs, and never gets around to taking the training wheels off. You're a rat in a maze doing the same things again and again. And that's really boring.More frustrating still is how poorly it makes use of its coop component. It's very clearly the way Tiny Brains was designed to play, but puzzles rarely requires the use of more than one or two different powers, essentially meaning if you're playing a full game of four you'll be trading off who gets to actually do anything instead of using your combined efforts to progress. It's at this point that you're probably asking why you wouldn't simply play solo, and the answer to that lies in the aggravating handful of levels that make playing solo immensely difficult or downright impossible. I'm fairly certain I cheated through several of the last levels as there didn't seem any way to possibly get through them without the help of more players, and at one point was attempting to use two controllers simultaneously to get past what was still a very rudimentary puzzle.And then there are all the portions which don't center around puzzle solving at all, but instead rolling a giant ball through an obstacle course or protecting a little pink chick from a horde of rampaging chickens. These are without question the worst parts of an already miserable game, and besides being terribly boring are often obnoxiously difficult because of the poor controls and annoying cooldown timer. These portions probably take up about a third of the game, which is only an hour or two long to begin with. I'd take a moment here to write a bit more about how the before mention pink chick, ostensibly the sole female character in the game, is used solely as a victim and a villain and feels just a little sinister and problematic, but the dialogue is so cringe inducing and the narrative flimsy that there's hardly any point.Everything just comes together like a giant mess of bad design, not helped by the abundant technical issues (as of this writing online coop is all but entirely broken, and even playing solo I experienced crashes after every chapter). I love what Tiny Brains was going for with a coop puzzle game with some unusual means with which to solve them, but it fumbles the whole way and never does anything with its concepts that it just wants to keep introducing over and over. Getting through Tiny Brains would have been a chore even had it worked as intended, but the sort of disrepair its in just makes it sad and embarrassing, and I feel a little bad for having made others play it with it.

												The game is very short and most of the puzzle are straight forward. Collision detection is clunky and you get stuck more often than not when it comes to jumping. Some of the harder puzzles are not more complex, but involve frustrating trial and error and ""redo the sequence until you get every part of it right"". I think the game would be challenging for kids and entertaining as a family game, but I do not recommend it as  casual puzzle game.			"

Haven't broken into the other modes of the game, but Co-op is top notch.  This is better than what I thought I was getting for what I paid.     Great attention to detail from artists.  Each of the levels are wrought with little things which are amuzing when you notice them but never detract from the experience or your focus on the challenge at hand.  The puzzles are not overly challenging but they still invoke real problem solving skills.  Anyone who enjoys playing games with their friends will find Tiny Brains to fit the bill.			"

												Players control 4 lab rats with unique powers.  One rat can change places with objects, another can create blocks of ice, a third can push objects, and a fourth can pull objects.  You have to use these rats to solve puzzles and reach the level exit.  Some times you have to move objects around the map and other times you have to protect something from getting attacked, but most of the time you just have to figure out how to get to a cube and place it on a switch that opens the door to the next level.This game has a very strange difficulty curve.  You're confronted with several difficult puzzles in a row, followed by several easy puzzles.  The puzzles get harder, then easier, then harder again, and easier again.  I get the impression that the developers had a bunch of puzzle ideas and kept adding them to the game as they came up with them rather than trying to put the puzzles in an order that made sense.I played this 2-player but I think the game would be better with 4 players (and way worse if played solo). I found that with only 2 players we were constantly switching characters in order to combine abilities. It gets confusing when we both are switching characters at the same time, or when one player has the character that the other player needs. I figure with 4 players you know someone else will always be waiting to use the ability you need them to use, so there is no rush to cycle through characters.			"

												Tiny Brains is an incredibly stupid co-operative game.  It tries to hit the same spark that Portal did all those years ago, but is held back with strange & sometimes buggy graphics and programming, not to mention finicky collision boxes and sub-par voice acting.That being said, you should totally play it.  If only for a couple hours, playing it with friends is a hilarious experience.  Though the puzzles are clever at times, there is usually a way to cheese your way out of doing it the right way, and the different characters and abilites are fun to mess around with, and completing the game is satisfying.  It's a great way to kill time; even if you only play it once, that will be enough.Not to mention one of the best ending songs I've heard in a game.			"

I played local coop with 3 others of varying ""gaming"" skills and we still breezed through it without scratching our heads but maybe once. And the script is annoyingly un-funny as well.

												It's a nice puzzle co-op game. The problem is, the gameplay is a bit disjointed. Probably the best way to play it and get the most fun of it, is to play it full 4 player co-op. That way four different people will get four different characters with four different powers. Having 2 player co-op or 3 player co-op leaves somebody to switch characters with different powers on the go, which could be problematic and frustrating.To the game's credit, it is possible to fully pass the game in 2 or 3 player co-op. But that leads to my other problem with the game - it's short. Really short.About 2,5 - 3 hours of gameplay.The humor is fine and cheeky. But visualy the style is undefined and, personaly, hurts my eyes a bit.After all of the above, I would only recommend this game if it's on sale AND you have 3 other friends that want to play a short, nice, little co-op puzzle game.

												A funny little game. Unfortunately it is way to short (only 3h playing with friends) and it has some minor bugs. We encountered synch problems regarding the position of some players. Also some minor graphic bugs after reconnects due to connection loss ... weird screens, black screens and such things, all of them were resolved after restarting the game. I would recommend playing this game with a controller ... mouse + keyboard are rather annoying ...I can't say anything about solo play, as I think this game is not meant to be played like this and I have never done it.A bit to expensive for it's shortness but fun ... maybe we will see some DLCs  in the future to lengthen the play time.

												This my Review for this game : Awesome game, i enjoy it to play on challenges and is puzzle base on physics, is have good concept but when you try to play only you this game will punish you for that, If you want to play with some friends this game is really good for coop. I try to play just my self on the story campaign with was getting bit frustrated because some of the puzzles are really tricky, But i manage to play try to finish that puzzles, I did not finish the full story but is actually a good game but requires to have patients. I can say this game was designed for coop play with is not a bad thing if you have a couple of friends to play it. I try to play on challenges with a friend, i fall in love with the ball washer is just pure fun that game mode will be every time your progress will be much harder. Other challanges content atually is worth it to play them. Music is very cool and i will like to see them to make a dlc for only the songs, music created by Samuel Laflamme ( he also did the Outlast music ).Here is

												It's a nice puzzle co-op game. The problem is, the gameplay is a bit disjointed. Probably the best way to play it and get the most fun of it, is to play it full 4 player co-op. That way four different people will get four different characters with four different powers. Having 2 player co-op or 3 player co-op leaves somebody to switch characters with different powers on the go, which could be problematic and frustrating.To the game's credit, it is possible to fully pass the game in 2 or 3 player co-op. But that leads to my other problem with the game - it's short. Really short.About 2,5 - 3 hours of gameplay.The humor is fine and cheeky.

												______new-review______As i stated in my old review (that you can find below) this is a very funny game.But it's only playable to a certain point. Lags will hinder you to play the challenges (roughly 50% of the game), some people can't connect to each other and are theirefore unable to play the game at all and the developer doesn't really care about all this. So they abandoned this game for their new project. You want a decent coop game? As funny this game does look, it's not worth your money. Don't buy this one and get something else.______old-review_______If you didn't picked up this game yet you missed a very well executed coop game. There is nothing bad to say. Get a friend or 3 and play and laugh along with them.+ Good music & sounds+ Nice & Cute graphics+ Well designed puzzles+ Coop with much fun and laughter- Every now and then i experienced a latency lag spike in online games but it's not game breaking nor does it kill the fun. So everything's just fine.			"

												I'm seriously considering off'ing myself after playing this game. After waiting four HOURS just to download it, my friends and I had to wait thirty minutes just to start playing. After going through the elongated and repetitive tutorial, we all decided to just claw our eyes out with forks instead for entertainment. After finishing the first level, (and suffering through endless lag spikes), Our screens went white and forced us back to the home screen. No offence to the creators, but next time get game programmers to make your games. This is all for now, just please don't get the game unless you are ready to end it all. Thank you for reading.			"

												This game is awesome if you have 3 friends to play with. I definitely suggest it for those of you I know (especially you and those you know, Scooter).It is sort of like Portal Multiplayer, but with 4 people. You go through wonderfully crafted levels and figure out puzzles by using all of your powers together to accomplish different goals. The campaign is a bit short (maybe 6-10 hours tops) but the challenge modes are addicting.There are about 3 (if I remember correctly) endless mini-games, where you might need to work together to roll a ball as far as you can up a hill, or save a target from dying. It's really challenging and can get addicting as you try to get the top score (ahem, Blough).			"

												Barely an hour and a half long (played with one other person, the fact it has FOUR player co-op blows my mind) incredibly simplistic puzzles, and then really shoddy online combined with wonky physics leaving us both just going ""what?"" during half the game. On top of all of that visual glitches occuring during the final encounter made it far more difficult than it actually was, on top of wonky physics. Nevermind the fact that the controls in general are bad. Aiming the powers is a nightmare half the time and switching characters isn't good either.I only spent 99¢ and I regret it!			"

												This is going to destroy Portal 2 co-op ... Easily one of the best and smartest co-op type games I have played... Although I have only played solo I can still sense how the co-op will be implemented... Truly awesome game and can not wait for the full release... If you are thinking about buying it, don't think... Just buy it, well worth the money...			"

												Tiny Brains is a decent enough puzzle-platformer for two or more players. I can not imagine playing it alone, so make sure you have someone with you, as the game is not just for two players, it is pretty much only enjoyable this way.Anyway, you control four mice that have unique powers(Push, Suck, Switch-positions, and Freezing) and all their powers combine to help you get through the increasingly harder levels. The game has a cute look and the puzzles are usually quite satisfying to solve.However, the game does lean towards being very rage-inducing. Some of the puzzles involve keeping a little critter alive while it is being attacked by waves on enemies. It's not fun and can drive just about anyone made. Other puzzles involve pushing a ball through a complicated hole-filled maze. They are not fun, either.The majority of the puzzles, though, are wonderful little rooms(think of Portal) that require solving something in order to open the exit. These are all great and a lot of fun to solve with a friend. If they make a sequel, they should focus on these kind of puzzles exclusively. Room puzzles - 8/10Non-room puzzles - 4/10Overall, this game is worth 6/10 to me.			"

												This game is a game that is  top down view of portal without the portals and 4 people this game is great i cannot say anymore than that this game includes 4 rodents trying to stop a scientist while being tested. and is like the indie version of potalLevel 1 gameplay this game i will be comparing with portal because they both use physics based puzzles but tiny brains more or so focuses on more fast reflexes and sharp wits to find out the answer. single player is harder you have to switch between rodents and multiplayer you have to find a way to communicate.Level 2 graphics these graphics are not the best graphics but thats what it is its supposed to be funny with all the scientists refrences and just genuine good humor and it is definetly a colourfull game.VerdictThis game is a indie game that deserves more love and is an intriging gameplay and extra modes and the best trophy/achivement (dont think its on xbox) the completionist a great youtuber that i watch daily at thatonevideogamer so watch his review and see if you want to pick it up i give this game a 8/10 amazinga			"

We had no issues.The difficulty level goes up during the second chapter.At a point on chaper 3 we had to give up where you apperently had to swich a char in a mid air jump, but maybe we are just not skilled enouth for that :-)Game compairs to Portal2 and Trine.

												Absolutely love this for local co-operative play, it is heaps of fun and has some great puzzles and mini games for replayability, great for kids. Only problem is the glitches, for example if someone leaves the game, its nearly impossible to kick them without disconnecting their controller and rebooting the game. Another is players respawning in places where it is impossible to complete the level without restarting. These can make Tiny Brains a really frustrating experience!			"

												Tiny brains is a geniusly well put together game where you can either collaberate with friends for hours on end or tease your own brain.It's good to take a break from the occasional shoot em' up games that you see every day, something to work your brain while having some good laughs as well. If you let the appearance of it at first fool you, you should take another glance at it and when you find it on sale (not saying it's worth its original price) pick it up and try it out sometime :) i promise you will not be dissapointed.

												Rather short but lots of fun if played together with 3 friends. Very polished, nice script, cool music and funny. Not too easy, not too hard.			"

												Quick fun little puzzle game to play with friends. We enjoyed it. The puzzles are more rote and skill based than thought provoking though. I can tell 1 player mode would also be a pain in the butt.			"

												A nice, colorful puzzle platformer that's waaaaay too short. Finished it while kidding around in less than 2 hours, if I had to play it seriously I'd finish it in less, which is way too short for the full price game.Absolutely get it if you are ok with a very short main campaign and if you find it at a very discounted price.

												This game is so much fun.  A great local co-op experience.  The puzzles were great, non of them were too difficult, but they weren't so easy that I wasn't engaged and had the answer immediately.  I also really enjoyed the campaign.  It was funny and clever.  The art was appealing.  I recommend this.			"

												A fun and charming little 2 hour co-op puzzle game with 1 to 3 friends. The sale price of 99cents on it's own makes the game worth having in your library!			"

												I played Tiny Brains on the PS3 and loved it.  It was a little faster and nicer on a console of course, compared to my aging PC's specs, but otherwise it plays the same.On my PC, this game is still very playable and fun.  The puzzle aspect is good.  Every level is a new mini-puzzle to figure out how to best solve, even though there are usually multiple solutions to progressing forward.The couch co-op aspect is excellent.The overall theme is fine and entertaining, but only loosely incorporated into the actual gameplay.My only real complaint is that the game is a bit frenetic for me and requires a bit more dexterity than a pure puzzle-solving game.  In addition, the characters are quite small on the screen so I'm constantly getting mixed up of where I am and which character I'm controlling.  Still, a very enjoyable game well worth the few dollars.			"

												Bought this game for super cheap on steam, it's actually decently fun. I played through the entire thing with my little sister. I think it's worth the $2 I paid because I got 4hrs of game play out of it and req some creativity. I would not buy this for full price.			"
