""You are getting closer... not. At this pace, Robin will save YOU!"" - StaufThe 11th Hour is the slightly inferior sequel to 7th Guest, Trilobyte's classic horror adventure and a Herculean Puzzle game challenge published in 1993. After the prior game's success, The 11th Hour is published in 1995, yet eventually failed to deliver the achievement of its predecessor and became Trilobyte's last game. Following the horrors of Stauf's mansion, the narration takes place 60 years after the original game with a new vicious challenge as the product of Stauf's ingenious evil.The opening FMV movie introduces our protagonist, Carl Denning; the investigative reporter for the television series ""Case Unsolved"". Being the semi-educated and sensitive as a door knob ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Carl gets into a relationship with his producer, Robin Morales, only to end the relationship a couple months after with cruel remarks, implying that he'd wish that Robin would be one of the missing people that she's been investigating about in the little town of Harley-on-the-Hudson. Wait a minute, isn't that Stauf's town? Not so curious enough, Robin actually gets missing on investigation and a mysterious little device called ""The Gamebook"" is dropped on Carl's doorstep. Opening the device, Carl encounters a video of Robin, stranded in Stauf's mansion, desperately calling for his help... You can see where this is going, right?The moment Carl steps into the mansion, our gameplay begins. Stauf sends us the most confusingly complicated riddles through the Gamebook and asks us to antique hunt in the whole deserted mansion to grab the item that would be the answer for his riddles. In the meanwhile, we solve a handful of frustratingly hard puzzles - in some we compete against Stauf's AI - and witness many short movie crops retelling us the background of Robin's investigation as the series of events prior to our arrival at the mansion. Will we manage to save Robin from Stauf's evil mansion?I think we already know the answer to that question, knowing Stauf's sense of humor and resourcefulness from the prior game. Anyhow, let's take a look on the game itself. Camera angles and the movement pace got slightly better and faster in adventure interface. Our encounters are not as much as uncanny though, and the acting of characters in the movie crops is plain bad with needless dramatization. The dramatization in 7th Guest was a success considering the tone of the environment and time - 1935 - but in this game, which takes place in 1995, characters' attitude and reaction simply end up being ugly. They are all portrayed as shallow as shallow can be.It should be proper to note that the Steam Overlay doesn't work at all; and the game crashes regularly if you wouldn't use a compatibility mode. The soundtrack consisting of midi-music are mostly okay, but the repetition of chosen songs and their suitability to scenes that we encounter is questionable. In some of the puzzle scenes, the soundtrack gets silenced completely. I remember a joke coming from a streamer about that issue: ""Maybe Trilobyte wanted you to hear the sound of your own aneurysm.""The environment display is a bit better compared to 7th Guest yet the mansion itself didn't age gracefully. Everything is practically in ruins now and Stauf's riddles are suicidally hard with anagrams, cypher codes, synonyms, word associations, cryptograms, accent remarks and even bilingual references! Knowing your art history doesn't hurt either! After the first 2-3, solving these riddles and finding the answer within the mansion becomes a frustrating chore rather than being fun. The starting point of the whole riddle and the actual answer rarely corresponds with each other, leaving you confused and annoyed most of the time. Randomly choosing objects makes you no good, considering there is a truckload of rooms and a good amount of clickable objects in each of them - and Stauf relentlessly mocks you with each wrong answer. Puzzles themselves are not as half as bad, they are relatively possible to figure out with patience but considerably troublesome to arrange with given angles and the slow pacing of puzzle interfaces.In and all, 11th Hour is less remarkable compared to the first game, being subpar on acting and nauseatingly frustrating in terms of riddles. By the end of the game, you'll be given the chance of making a choice between 3 different endings, yet none of the endings are satisfactory or somewhat meaningful. I'd really like to recommend this game, I remember having a lot of fun with 7th Guest but this is not an educative challenge like the first game. This is a trial of association with little to no indication for the wanted associations given to you. Good luck if you'd like to try anyway.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Three reasons to buy this game: * Challenging puzzles for people who enjoy frustration. * A decent and interesting horror story. * It's a very valuable piece of gaming history. Three reasons NOT to buy this game: * Cheesy cutscenes (but for some of us who like to laugh, it's a GREAT reason).  * Won't appeal to people who love HD games. * The engine is outdated. Some people will have to fiddle with the game to get it running. Now... for the review: I have to admit that, like most people who played this game when it came out, I have fond memories of it: I used to play it with my family, in the weekends, when we usually took turns to solve the puzzles or to try to beat Stauf in Honey & Blood or the Rat Maze.It's kind of sad, but I haven't played like that with my family and friends in a while. It seems like games rarely have that balance anymore. Most games nowadays are divided in two: A single player paradise with a flexible difficulty (so the player doesn't lose its appendix because of the frustration) or a multiplayer gore fest where rarely you understand what's happening anymore. Yeah, like most gamers, I also enjoy those kind of games, I know it's the evolution of gaming. However 11th Hour (and the 7th Guest) was a game which could be enjoyed with other people in a single gameplay and somehow, it seems it was meant to be played with the advice and skills of other people or it could be a very frustrating game. You had to ask for help before the internet spoiled everything. But time has passed and I know this game will barely catch the attention of new and young players. It's a shame. It deserves an opportunity, at least as a piece of history. The game has an interesting story but cheesy and low-res movies require some faith and imagination from the player; a suspension of desbelief and a willingness to enjoy what's happening or what's about to happen, regardless of the acting, or the 90s modelling and rendering. In my latest gameplay, although I knew most of the story, I could feel some scary or tense moments. The music is amazing, a true accomplishments (some puzzles are so difficult, that you could be listening the same tune for hours and you will hardly feel tired from hearing it). Henry Stauf is a great character. It could be an icon like other popular videogame mascots.			"

												This game is an all time classic, like the 7th guest for comparison only Myst or RivenLets face the facts that these Games are not aged well- indeed this is a thing i´ve heard many timesfrom the (new) Gamer Generation if there is one acutaly.1 off if you comapare those games Myst Riven and 7th guest and 11th hour wich came outway before the CD rom or DVD Blu Ray standarts- these were the first games wichgave the gamers the feeling he is acutaly part of that games.I would say myst made the job a bit better but thats not the point.So after ive finished the 7th guest in my nostalgic phase (now in 2014)i can easily say- this game sucks because of the bad video standart of those days.But no i dont say that because its not the main reason to play those games.The riddles are fantastic they are harder than other games yes.If i compare Myst with Riven than there is pretty the same increase of difficulty betweenthose games.Take Riven wich frustated many gamers those days- So yes the 11th hour and 7th guest are for hardcore gamerswhom take the challenge of these increased riddles.You get a real fine story even the 7th guest made a better job.If you think it has to be a HD Remake with newer days standarts yourterrible wrong and its your own fault if you bought a game you espectedits a new one.The only problem i see is that it runs to fast on my machines.I mean the cutscenes the ingame graphics etc.But thats all.If you didnt played the 7th guest and bought 11th hour and thinkabout that stauff cant shut its mouth? He did this in 7th guest tooand no one had a problem with that.Its his house its his riddles its his horror world your into in those gamesand its called sarcasm all the way.If you think this games are easy and disturbing horror genre games are not your thingdont buy it.This game is a milestone of its genreand still challenging today there are not many gameswich made this.Yes technics of today made this game bad.But as i said before high end graphics arent thethings that makes a game great.Poor that the Collector never made it to the releaseand that the remake of the collector didnt made it.If you would do remakes of all those games with all its details im shure there would be a nicerresonance. But fans of the genre would buy it anyway. "

												Circa 1993 and originally played on a CD disc.  Sequel to The 7th Guest.  Horror, mystery, point and click, ""hidden object"" puzzler.  The game itself holds up to time passage but the graphics, speed, sound, color, etc. are not adjustable (at least not by me) and depending on the computer (especially newer ones) may make the game lag or be twitchy - just a warning.  Included with the game is a ""making of"" section that are short movie clips about different aspects of how the game was put together, about the charaters, and the NEW 'AT THE TIME' concept of a 64 minute movie divided into clips and inserted in the gameplay to tell the story.  (These clips are not skippable, nor is the beginning movie which the player only sees once and sets up the story.)  Recommend listening to the title screen music/song.  It is really creepy.Storyline: Investigative reporter Robin Morales has decided to do a story concerning the Stauf Mansion in the town of Harley, prompted by rumors of present disappearances and the mysterious happenings 70 years ago and presently.  (So sad I did not realize Stauf is an anagram of FAUST until nearly the end of this game.)  Robin has disappeared while doing her investigation and her colleague/ex-boyfriend/boyfriend Carl Denning (news anchor) goes to the Stauf Mansion to find her.  Through various video clips throughout the gameplay the player discovers what is happening and why. (Digression: the way Stauf says Carl when taunting him reminds me of when the llama Paul says Karl (Llamas with Hats - YouTube) and I can imagine Karl the llama being perfectly content in the grisly Stauf mansion).  Gameplay:  This game is actually easier to play than the 7th Guest.  The puzzles are not super hard logical puzzles and the brain busters that some of the logic puzzles in the 7th Guest were.  Plus the storyline is much easier to understand.  This is a stand alone game and playing the first game is not required to understand this one.One of the best features is the Gamebook (phone).  The Gamebook (accessed in the upper right - just point the mouse there and it shows up) contains an AI who will play or simply solve the puzzles for the player, all except the last endgame one.  I suggest that the AI play any game that is being played against Stauf. (Gamebook has all the rules for the puzzles and games, and will tell the player if they are playing against Stauf.)  Of the 5 Stauf games (not including the endgame one) only the mouse maze as far as I am concerned is unbeatable without using the AI to do it. (In my game it took the AI 3 times before it beat Stauf.)  The other Stauf games are like Othello or Go, and logic and good strategy will beat him. The gameplay is driven by answering ""riddles"" which read and are solved like British cryptic crossword puzzle clues.  The 41 cryptic crossword puzzle clues can be anagrams, homophones, put together words (like guile + lot + in = guillotine), backwards spelling, backwards anagram, separated words, etc.  There are also number clues and two cipher clues.  Once the word is found then the player must go find that object somewhere in the mansion and click on it to get the next cryptic crossword clue.  Fortunately the Gamebook gives the player hints about the word/object that needs to be found.  When the player arrives in a room if an object can not be clicked on then a puzzle has to be solved first.  There is one puzzle per room and once the room opens up the player can go solve the puzzle.  Defintely look around at everything because the player will be back to find some object when mentioned in some word clue.  Puzzles include 2 chess puzzles (exchange sides - one with knights (6 pieces), the other with bishops(4pieces)), various logic puzzles, a couple of scrambled word puzzles and a train puzzle.  As I said before these puzzles are easier then those encountered in the 7th Guest.  The Gamebook will also kindly ask if the player wants the AI to outright solve the puzzle.  At word clue 7, 17, 29, and 37 all the movie clips gathered between those word clues will be played in full showing the player ""the story"".  These can NOT be skipped.  I highly recommend saving at these points.  There are 9 save slots and make sure to save before exiting the game.  Finally save the game (final save point) at the last word clue (which is at the grandfather clock) because you may opt to play the endgame more then once (and beat Stauf's final game more than once) to see all the endings.  There are three different endings to this game and are determined by Carl's choice.  Do try to remember this was a very inventive and innovative game when it was made in 1993.  So please try not to laugh too hard at the end or be disappointed by it.  I personally think the end is still really creepy, even the ending that would be considered the best, ""good"" or ""true"" ending today.I recommend this game for puzzlers who want a challenge and something different from today's fare.

												This game takes place inside the same mansion as The 7th Guest. The mansion is more detoriated than the previous, your character uses a flashlight while moving around. The gameplay is the same as The 7th Guest. Pointing and clicking along, you must solve puzzle after puzzle in order to continue on deeper in the mansion and figure out more of the story. Anyone who likes puzzle games should play it.			"

												The production values went up a lot, but the gameplay itself is almost completely identical to The 7th Guest. It starts out with an almost fifteen minute long stupid montage that looks like it was ripped straight out of some mid-90s made for tv movie where some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a motorcycle rides a motorcycle and reminisces about the hot babe he seduced and then got mad at for some reason and told her he wished she'd die or disappear.Spoiler: She dies or disappears into the house from the first game, which is in more or less the same state as it was in the first game, just with evidence that some♥♥♥♥♥♥stumbled around dropping puzzles everywhere. And to be honest, I would rather play this game, if I had to play one of these, but that's mostly because this game allows you to fast travel around the house. But that's also a problem in its own way because, again, this is just a series of disconnected puzzles that have nothing to do with each other, so we have to wonder why they even bother with the wrapper of the computer generated mansion or the threadbare plot or anything at all.I guess the answer is that games were still mostly just a novelty at the time and we let ourselves get caught up in the power of the CD drive, allowing for games that weren't really games at all to slip through the cracks. But it's clear that a lot of the novelty of this style of game had already slipped away in the two year span between 7th Guest and 11th Hour because this game just seems pretty quaint and forced in comparison. That probably has a lot to do with my lack of nostalgia for this, but I guess that's just the way she goes. I've played worse, but I think that looking back at this series it's pretty easy to see about a dozen games (it struck me while I was writing this how similar, in essence, this series is to the Professor Layton games, for example) that have done what it tried to do so much better.

												The FBI could do away with all forms of previous torture devices and practices such as water boarding and just expose extremists to this game. Torture here is an understatement. The game will expose you to mental anguish like never before. Where do I even start with this one?It's the sequel to a game called the 7th guest. The story is a alien/evil spirit (Satan I believe) has taken over deceased toy maker Stauf who possesses a house with his soul. He is a sick man who likes to invite women into his house to bed with them by manipulating the house to touch them in all the wrong places. He also likes to invite men so he can kill them and nourish the house with their bodies. The house has a blood thirst and needs sacrifices. You've been lured into the house because your girlfriend is trapped inside after she started investigating the house for a unsolved mystery TV show. Think it's weird so far? Oh wait it gets better. The house somehow impregnates two women, 1 who immediately has an abortion, and the second who decides to give birth to miss Satan and after she grows up she immediately finds a sucker to start killing the towns folk in the area and start feeding them to the house. This is all acted out in a B grade movie by work experience actors which you get to see each time you solve a puzzle in the house. At the end you need to choose between 2 women who have sold their soul to Stauf or a wheel chair woman who hasn't. If you choose the wheel chair woman the house explodes for no apparent reason, the end.The puzzles in this house are fruiting ridiculous. You need access to a super computer to solve them. Your given a riddle which you need to untangle to work out what you need to click on next. The riddles will give your brain a clot in seconds. Once you have done that, you then need to solve a puzzle. The puzzles are so hard that your brain will turn into soup just with the thought of having to get through it. Seriously... Insanely difficult. There is a chess puzzle which takes 40 moves to solve, there is another puzzle which will take you 20 minutes to solve, even if you have the correct answer. Half the puzzles in the house even the walk throughs written by other people tell you 'sorry this is too difficult your on your own just keep hitting the hint button in the game' and even that half the time tells you, your going to lose this time.On top of all that the game puts you down with every click you make telling you how stupid you are and that there are bird droppings that have more intelligence than you. The house mentally abuses you, hoping you are soon going to become manic depressive and want to slit your wrists or something. Furthermore, the house also tortures you with grating music that will make your ear drums bleed, it also makes every transition monotonous, because it cuts to a short movement walk when you move between rooms, this is so trolling that you will probably be tempted to try and break your own neck on your keyboard just to get out of this nightmarish game. I recommend this game only if your into SM on yourself. Other than that it gets a huge thumbs down, The game is a chore to play and is not fun. Here's the twist, I played this game as a kid (had a bad babysitter) and had fond memories of it back in 95. I guess it just goes to show that with HD and better constructed gameplay's even the cream of the crop of 95 just does not meet the benchmark of today's gamer's needs.If you want to watch the whole movie which goes with the game which I actually do recommend its an interesting b grade movie you can watch it here....

												11th hour is the second in my quest of playing at least an hour of each of the games in my Steam Library.  Obvious constraint of a 1995 game aside it was a very enjoyable time and I might try it again.The game is a follow up to 7th Guest the 1993 hit which I hear is better game wise then 11th hour.It is a FMV game of the era, puzzles & treasures hunt or the “padding” in between movies.The puzzle are very clever and hard. The treasure hunts are VERY hard and border on the arbitrary at time with the constant use of anagram.The story is interesting liking it to 7th guest nicely. I actually went on Youtube to watch a montage of all the cut scene in order which makes an interesting hour long movie.	All in all a fun nostalgia game. "

												This game was one I enjoyed when it was first released in the 1990s. Unfortunately, it has not aged well. The seveth guest was known for being one of the very first games with full-motion video, and animated screen transitions instead of slide-show transitions. But even when the 11th hour was first released, the novelty had worn off. And twenty years later, the graphics [which were the best features] are now considered low-resolution. The interface is clunky by modern standards, and the puzzles frankly are not that interesting. If you are out for a nostagia trip, the 7th guest will better satisfy the urge. Or watch the reconstructed movie on Youtube.			"

												Bought this game purely for nostalgia reasons and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I would have been better off forgetting it existed.The Pros-The song in the beginning is hauntingly good in a minimalistic english as a second language wayThe Cons-Literally everything about the game-It has terrible logic jumps-A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice of the house that has a comment for everything you do-Sound mixing that just does not work, VO that's lost because the background noise it too loud, some sounds follow you when they should stay in a different part of the house and leave either when they feel like it or when a cutscene begins.-If you feel like it, you can have the computer solve all but one puzzle in the whole game, effectively making the puzzle game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ movie that you have to go from room to room to see the entirey of. -That last puzzle can feel impossible.Do yourself a favor and watch the cutscenes on YouTube and save yourself time and money, i wish I did.I wish I could turn all my fingers into thumbs so I could give this game 10 thumbs down.

												Overall its a pretty poor game. some of the puzzels are fun, but the constant abuse by the narrator means that you pretty much have to play the game muted. ignoring the graphical and musical limitations (this game was made in '95 after all,) its not the worst. Unfortunately the storyline is confusing and not super enticing, involves the sexual assault of two women, and ultimately ends in a near unbeatable game of reversi (an already frustrating game.)on the whole, I'd skip this one.

												I am recommending this with a giant asterisk.Those who love FMV adventure games, who liked the 7th guest, may enjoy this one.  Those who don't like the 7th guest at all, or have not been exposed to it, but like FMV adventure games, know this - it's a sequel to the 7th guest, and you should read up on everything present and lacking in the 7th guest.NEITHER of these games are true adventure puzzle solvers.  They are ""activity books"".  Their puzzles are random with no sense, few hints, and feel like they have as much connection to the game as an activity page has to another activity page.SOME of the puzzles are absolutely terrible (irritatingly boring, or just ""Figure this out and solve it because we were too lazy to make a real puzzle""), others are so tedious you know exactly what to do, but need the hint walkthrough just to make them go faster (such as in the 7th guest where you knew you had to move the chess pieces from 1 side to the other, only it required something over 30 moves, and making one single mistake would wipe out 40 minutes of your life from existence, thanks to the slowest animation EVER), and other puzzles are just passably enjoyable.I swear to the gods, some of these 'puzzles' were made by someone who was a high functioning autistic, because the mathematical involvement in their design requires no more creativity in execution and solution than a calculator.  That in and of itself is a poor representation of what an adventure game should be, as a true adventure puzzle should make you feel like you are exercising your entire brain, not just your mathematical brain.  OH!  And that's not all, you have to solve the puzzle in the right way the developer wants you to solve it!  For instance: I solved the cash register puzzle using two different methods before I had to use the ""RIGHT KEYS"" that the developer ""INSISTS"" I depress for it to give me the reward.... yeah.THIS GAME decided to make that formula even worse by repeating the same horrible structure for the puzzles, and adding a riddle based twist - you are given riddles which instruct you on which puzzles to solve first.  To solve the riddle you must touch the right item in the right room to view an FMV.  Then your game can progress.  So basically, if you solve puzzles without solving riddles, you won't really advance.....WALKTHROUGH TIME!THIS kind of ""puzzle"" is what you call ""artificial bottlenecking"", especially since so few of the riddles make sense even when you have the walkthrough explain it.  you literally just wander from room to room clicking on whatever you can click to make the FMV riddle crap go away.Another failure which is repeated in this game is the complete and utter LACK of musical/sound volume control.  This isn't like it was unheard of to have those controls - those controls for music and sound were considered MANDATORY by 1992.  This game came out in 1995.  So the lack of controls is entirely due to the laziness of the developer.  I don't care how small their studio is, programming a slider bar is first semester basics in programming.As far as the FMV goes - actually halfway decent for 1995.  Granted, it's pure cheese, but that's what FMV is.  Try to pretend it isn't, and you are living in a fantasy world.For Adventure game completionists, such as myself, this game is worth a SINGULAR PLAYTHROUGH.  For developers who want to learn what is right and wrong with adventure games - you MUST play this and you MUST play the Zork games.  Compare the two, and you quickly learn what works and what doesn't.If you have little patience for poorly constructed puzzles, and bad music (with NO subtitles), ignore this game.  DO NOT BUY IT.Otherwise, take this as a recommendation for a select group of people.			"

												Although The 7th Guest and The 11th Hours are both titles that were defining in gaming history, I don't think they aged very well.Don't get me wrong, I love both of them, specially since The 7th Guest was my first PC game ever, but I can't honestly recommend this game nowadays for any reason other than the nostalgia factor: the graphics look choppy and weird, the acting is horribly over the top and cheesy and although the puzzles are still really challenging and fun, their interface and playability will have you aching to play some Professor Layton or other modern puzzle game. The ports are okay, I guess, considering how old these things are, but there are still big flaws: sound problems, resolution problems and video sequences playback problems are all common to those playing Steam versions of these games.In short, those were amazing, groundbreaking games back in the day: they had an enticing story, full video and voice acting, great puzzles and an atmosphere that felt really creepy back then, but nowadays, they just fall short.

												Unliked The 7th Guest, I did not play The 11th Hour when it was initially released. There have been many remarkable improvements in this game such as much faster movement speed, easier access to help functions (no more backtracking to the library), and slightly better acting.However, this game now berates you at every step. Stauff simply won't shut up, and the game makes it a point to let you know you're a complete idiot if you don't solve the puzzle in one move. Sometimes even taking the shortest route (four moves to complete the library's book puzzle, for instance) will result in Stauff saying you have the brains of bird droppings halfway through.The pacing is also absolutely terrible, and the new riddle mechanic makes it that much worse. You're constantly clicking at random objects hoping to figure out the terrible clue you were given. How is a ""riddle"" of a heart attack putting you into the ground supposed to make you click on a globe? Or how about a clue about a winter coat supposed to make you find a bottle of tonic?Adding to the frustration are game-breaking bugs such as solved puzzles not registering, audio glitches such as some ambient sounds playing at more than double the volume of the speech and music, and lack of context for pretty much all of the FMV sequences.Overall, this game is far worse than its predecessor due to these problems and more. I do not recommend buying this even if the game was on sale for 90% off. You will get more enjoyment for your money from buying a soft drink than you would buying this game.			"

												I couldn't imagine it getting any worst with the sequel to 7th Guest. Yet it somehow did.The insults from the narrator is amplified now. This means, each time you reset a puzzle, Stauf gives a little witty reply.The navigation UI is also worst now, as it is more difficult to choose between moving and observing. This is reinforced by the treasure hunting objective they've added in. You'll be waving your cursor around at every single corner of the house you can possibly click on.Remember how the word puzzles in 7th Guest supported the story in a sequence. Well forget about those. It’s been replaced with a slew of anagrams of the hidden item you need to find. Where are the items? Well there’s no hint for that, you still have to wander around till you find it, hence the treasure hunting part of this adventure. What’s even worst is the item you need to find is not targetable until you solve some puzzle elsewhere. So, you're back to randomly waving your cursor around until it pops up.Is there any relevance with puzzle to the hidden item?Nope.Can you complete the puzzle associated with future content before ever getting the anagram for it?Yup.This spaghetti mess of a design just doesn't make any sense on paper nor in practice.On the plus side, the hint button for the puzzles is on hand at all times from the menu system, instead of being in the library... if that's any consolation of the headache of trying to find where you need to go.

												Even tough I know its an old game, don't buy it unless you want to revive the old nostalgia or something like that, I never had the opportunity to try it in its prime so I can only compare to some old (but not as old I think XD) games like Monkey Island in which you have a clear ditinction of what you can click and not, here after a painfully long intro, you enter the mansion and you are in a room with a lot of doors none of you can click, also one great problem i have with the game its its skeleton hand cursor.

How did they take a terrible game, and give it an even more atrocious sequel.Aside from the game itself not being fun (because, come on, it came out over 20 years ago), the acting is abysmal. It makes you gnash your teeth together it's so bad.

If you have the hankering for some decent puzzles and need that 90's nostalgia, get the 7th guest. This is garbage thanks to the poor gameplay, bad acting and voice overs and to compile on top of my 'thumb-downedness' (yes I just created a new word thanks to Trilobyte), the old tech runs like garbage on my i5.

												I was skeptical of The 11th Hour, and rightfully so. The 7th Guest was terrible and I expected this game to follow suit. I played it anyway because I bought the two games in a bundle and having spent money, it would be a waste not to play at least a little. It was my hope that the first game, being from 1993, was only as bad because it was because it was developed when dinosaurs ruled the earth; and that its sequel, being form the distant future of 1995, would hold up better. To my disappointment, it did not. Good thing they were on sale for a huge discount or I would be furious. As it stands I'm merely annoyed. Being in essence the same game as The 7th Guest, it would be easier to list the differences than to talk about the game as a whole so lets get down to it.While the first game lacked for any form of coherent story, this game filmed an entire live action movie, using the scenes (or in some cases parts of scenes) as cut-scenes in the game. To the game's credit the movie wasn't bad looking. It seemed to be on par for a shoestring budget horror movie from 1995. The problem with this is that watching a movie for 30 seconds to 3 minutes at a time is unengaging at best and terribly confounding at worst. It became hard to tell if anything I saw was in order as scene changes are disguised by the cut-scene ending and the movie picking back up in a different scene.You play as C.A.R.L., the mk2 version of the roller coaster/human hybrid from the first game. Unlike his ponderous predecessor, C.A.R.L. can move at reasonable speeds using his new chicken-walker legs and observes objects without panning around them. He also seems to be some kind of transformer as his default size, which reaches the tops of door ways, can also somehow fit into spaces easily a fifth that size. In the opening cut-scene C.A.R.L. calls  his girlfriend a ♥♥♥♥♥ and tells her he hopes she gets murdered by a psychopath. When this apparently happens, C.A.R.L. defies his programming and goes searching for her, leading him to the murder house from the previous installment. In addition to his Mechwarrior legs and head mounted flashlight, C.A.R.L. is equipped with a tiny computer that he uses to analyze the riddles sent to him by the demonic toymaker, who is apparently still around.The puzzles in this game are similar to the ones in the last, except somehow more poorly explained. Where a brief explanation was provided by the dead LARPers about the nature of the puzzle in the last game, no such organic help is given here. Instead your computer coldly tells you the object of the game, forcing you to revert to what effectively amounts to an in game walk through to gain general information about what you're suppose to be doing. The puzzles that require proficiency in chess make an appearance again so I hope you've managed to keep those skills sharp. Otherwise a large portion of the mini-games are A.I. battles resembling the microscope puzzle from the first game. Where there was only one such game in The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour sports seven of them. The problem with these is the same as before: their rules and premiss are poorly designed and, in addition to just being poorly explained, force you to go first despite it being a detriment to your ability to win.The game still has no inventory or way to pick anything up but none the less expects you to hunt for items as they are needed. Instead the toymaker e-mails you riddles corresponding to interactible objects littered throughout the house. Once you've interacted with the correct object, your computer will be updated with a cut-scene you can watch that advances the plot and a new riddle will be provided. The puzzles don't take as long as they used to thankfully because C.A.R.L. doesn't think out loud and the toymaker only speaks at the beginning and end of puzzles. The game as a whole has less organic fluidity than the first, which is surprising considering the first game flowed like rocks through a faucet. Everything about The 11th Hour hinges off of you referring back to your computerized walk through for the answer. You don't have to, but good luck manually deciphering this jumbled mess with out it. The computer also can do everything for you, including telling you the answers to riddles and solving puzzles. While it's easier to let AI battle AI in those stupid versus games, you might as well let it solve the riddles and other puzzles, which would be like playing a driving game where you don't control the car.Much like The 7th Guest I didn't beat The 11th Hour either and even spent less time on it. The reason being is I had no patience for those A.I. battle games and would be damned of I let the computer solve everything for me. Try it if you wish but you'll be in for a world of disappointment.			"

												I've played alot of point and clicks, matter of fact I was raised up around them. But this point and click definately stands out from the rest. It is utter crap, in more ways then one. First of all The game is stupifyingly hard, that it has an inbuilt cheat function. I'm not joking, the game actually lets you have the choice for the computer to solve the puzzels. So If you're going to get this game you'd better be packing a walkthrough or something. The only reason I got this game is because I remember my family playing it when I was like 5, so I thought I'd get it cause i remember very little of it. And I'm glad I did.....Remember very little that is. Most point and click games have a great story which drags you into it and you can easily play the game and figure things out by acting like the character, but this one is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Overall I'll probably rate this game 4/10, Only because it is a great game to get you thinking...But that's all.

												Too many of the reviews here that aren't helpful. Some of them just complain.The problem here is that this game was a 2 step forward, 3 steps back kind of deal.One of the biggest problems is the FMV concept. 90% of it takes place outside the mansion. It feels detached, and even when it's on the inside it's kind of of lame because of the extended scenes and the actors in it. You actually appreciate the ghostly, brief scenes of the 7th guest. Other problems include the treasure hunt, the whole ending thing and the 90's futuristic techno-theme gimmick.But there are a lot of little improvements as well! Much better interface and menu, faster animations while moving and in puzzles, you play Stauf multiple times, better hint system that punishes you if you abuse it and a good story that ties in nicely to the 7th guest for example.I have to give credit to the team. They were trying to create something new and bigger while staying faithful to the original.I liked it but there's bound to be some mixed feelings somewhere. Should you get it? That depends. If you liked the 7th guest, then you should play this at least once. Certain characters will appear that will shed some light of the events of the first game. Otherwise, avoid.			"

												HelloWhere the 7th guest (at that time) was cutting edge, the 11th hour is a clear “sequel”.The puzzle part is there, the story is a bit better (but told in separate video parts) the graphics are improved and there is more gore, it lacks in reinventing itself.I did enjoy the game as a nostalgic look back.Best regardsTycoon			"

												I feel incredibly torn writing this. I played 7th Guest when it was new. I had the poster for 11th Hour - but never managed to get a copy of the game, and it evetually fell into obscurity.Fast-forward 20 years and I've finally got a copy that's compatible with my system! HUZZAH! Let the good times roll!Well, that feeling lasted all of 10 minutes.Sadly - taking into account the game was rushed back in the day, and two teams with two different goals ended up mashing together a z-list horror movie into one of the first true 'rage games'. You get clues to find puzzles around the house, but the clues themselves are the sort that make walking around the house and clicking EVERYTHING the easy way to go. Unless you're blessed with a guide, which, thanks to the internet we are able to do now.The puzzles are another matter, of course, anything you can't solve yourself you can give up on and give to your partner, Samantha, who exists through communication via an early 90s PDA. The trouble is, if you give up, it doesn't explain how to finish the puzzle, it just kicks you out unceremoniously, and you're left to finish the game in peace.This game doesn't know if it's a horror movie, a friendly puzzle game, or a Warner-Brothers cartoon. And sadly this ends up breaking any possible hint of immersion.Even by early 90s standards this is a terribly wasted opportunity. Where 7th Guest broke boundaries, defined a generation, and kicked us into the future, this game feels distinctly like an 'also-ran', desperate for the attention its older brother got.Save yourself the brain ache, because even at £4.79, I find it incredibly difficult to recommend this game.Full playthrough begins here, if you'd rather have a look first:

												I enjoyed this one much more than the 7th Quest. The gamebook is a great tool, helping us when we need, either to find out what to do in the puzzles or giving us a hand with the riddles. Not once I got lost and wondering what I was supposed to be doing. Also, right at the end, you get the choice of 3 different endings. And the right mouse button click allow us to skip transitions.

												Wow.  Wow.  Holy Cow.  What a hot mess of a game.  The 7th Guest holds a soft place in my heart due to a mix of childhood nostalgia, and legitimate recognition of optimistic and ground-breaking (if supremely awkward) game design.  That shiny colorful little game was so innocent and pure of heart at the time, and it hasn't lost its charm.  Played the entire thing in an afternoon just recently and I don't regret it.  Then, on a lark, decided to give the sequel a try, having never played it before.  Wow.....just wow.....The 11th hour...jesus what to say.I can only imagine that this game was another important and necessary step in the burgeoning awkward years of game design.  Nobody had ever seen anything like 7th guest.  They loved it and wanted more.  God bless the creators.  What they ended up with was a discordant mess, striding painfully in disperate directions whilst ripping itself apart. The prime fault in this game is the lack of cohesion.  The cut-scene driven narrative and the game mechanics clash  harder than in any game I've ever played.  The shifts in tone are so very jaring it's laughable.  Everything in this game clashes.  The acting style of the characters clash with one another, the in-game settings clash with the film sequence's, the special effects, the terrible riddles, everything.  It's truly marvelous to behold.If there's one thing that seems consistent in the game, it's in just how terrible the riddles are, and there are a bunch of them.  Most of the game consists of an awkward treasure hunt, with horrifically obtuse riddles guiding you to the next destination.  These riddles are terrible.  There's an in-game hint system that is necessary to progress, and I'd be absolutely shocked if there's one single person in the world who has ever beaten this game without cheating a little bit.  They reminded me of the riddles from the 60's Batman TV show, with solutions that could not possibly be solved with pure reasoning.  They're nonsensical, difficult, and it's shameful just how much of the game they take up.The puzzles themselves are also difficult to a fault, but that's nothing new, and most of them are skipable.  They're much the same as they were in the 7th guest, except that here they seem even more out of place.  Stauf, after all, had invited the guests over to solve these riddles in the first game.  There's absolutely no mention of them in this one...they're just...there.Not that the first game made much logical sense, but I felt that it earned some of its ambiguity due to the fact that it took place in some sort of dream-space.  Some limbo between worlds where they events depicted had already happened, and nothing was concrete.  This game, when not inspiring you to beat your head against a wall with difficulty, aspires to tell a much more fluid and fleshed out story.  These folks at Trilobyte sure tried.  They really tried.Ignoring the actual game play, the narrative is its own beautiful little disaster. In an attempt at spinning a more mature tale, the 11th hour relies even heavier on the full motion video narrative.  The settings and acting style, for the most part, seem to strive for an element of forced, day-time drama realism, with actors trying their best to take the material seriously.  Now before I get too judgmental, I have to laud the attempts of some of the performers, particularly the actors playing Robin and Samantha.  You can tell that these are working professionals just trying to do their best with the materiel they were given. They are, however, the exceptions to the rule.  Gone are the cartoonish caricatures and grand sweeping gestures of the first game.  Here we have grim, somber, cheap cable tv style storytelling, with most of the acting and staging coming across as painfully awkward and, dare i say it, soft core porney.  But dispute these flaws, or perhaps BECAUSE of these flaws, there's a subversive charm to it all when viewed as a whole.  As the game progresses, the cut-scenes themselves become more varied in style.  They span a wide range from subdued to carnivalesque.  There's a particularly jarring scene where a buxom, scantily clad young lady has a dog on a leash.  The dogs head transforms into the head of our main villain Stauff, gives a hearty howl, and then the lady's face, for just a split second, distorts into a horrible pixelated grimace while the games audio farts at you.  Seriously, the game farts.  Sexy lady - transforming dog - howl - monster face - fart noise.  All this before awkwardly snapping back to the loud (terrible) midi music and CG scenery. It's impossible to describe adequately.  You have to experience it for yourself.  And y'know what?  I almost recommend that you do.I can't explain exactly why, but somewhere along the line I found myself spellbound by this game.  It's so disjointed and so all over the place that often you're taken completely off guard. It's delightful in its chaoticness. I was laughing out loud on several occasions, and I honestly can't help wondering just how much of this was intended effect.  It's so stupid and goofy, but then goes so dark and serious that you never know what to make of it.  In one sitting I went from poking a tube of tooth paste until it ooozed into a tiny, green, tentacled booger monster, to listening to a tearful disabled woman describe her permanent nerve damage from the back ally abortion attempt of her mutantrape baby.  The damn game feels like huffing paint; I'm light-headed.  This feeling is embodied by the brilliant performance given by Robert Hirschboeck in the role of Stauf himeself.  This guy gets it.  When he's on screen, it feels like being right back home in the haunted mantion.  He's campy he's over the top, and he knows exactly what he's doing. He's literally the spirit of the game, and every scene he's in pops.  It's almost good enough to fool me into thinking that the developers knew what they were doing by creating something so scatter-shod.  I've never played anything like the 11th hour in my life, and I doubt I ever will.  This game is a beautiful mis-step, and I'm truly grateful for having wasted my time in it.			"

Cons:- Navigation is painful (you can skip the animation but since ""7th Guest"" sometimes showed something special when you looked around, I'm afraid to miss something if I skip them all).- Many items and paths can't be selected until you ""unlock"" them, even though they look exactly the same as when they were ""locked"" (e.g. you can't go through a partially opened door until you solve some riddles/puzzles).- Several hotspots can be missed just because the game tends to hide it from your sight when you explore. While exploring can be part of the gameplay, forcing you to have the worst point of view (since you have very limited freedom of movement) is just a cheap and annoying trick.Some examples:* the cash register hidden behind the bed* putting your face right against the doors when you move on the first floor, while you expected to get just a bit closer to them and see the area around.- One puzzle (at least) has a bug : the cash register (again), which has several possible solutions but refused the one I first tried even though it was correct. And that's the very first puzzle of the game.- Riddles hardly make sense. I can see what they tried to do, but the logic behind is very weak. Quite a problem for a puzzle game.- Puzzles are only moderately interesting and some are terribly designed. For instance:* the modern painting coloring puzzle where you can barely see the painting* puzzles that involve playing against the bad guy don't clearly show when it's your opponent's turn. He plays at full speed, without a pause or speech, even though any other event in the game is very slow and often include some speech. I only realized I was playing against someone after checking the help system.- Sound balance is terrible: some voices are way too low compared to the music, some are louder for no reason. The game manual mentions that you can adjust the voice/music balance but it's probably broken as I didn't notice any change when I tried. There are no subtitles, also, which makes some dialogs very hard to get (for a non-native english speaker at least).- Some voices are very badly edited. For instance, at the end of one of the riddles, you can clearly hear the guy add ""but..."" before being cut abruptly (I suppose the sentence had to be shortened after it was already recorded).- The game usually doesn't recover after you alt-tab to another application.Pro:- The cheesy videos, featuring cleavage shots and a braless girl.Conclusion:I'm playing it like I played ""7th Guest"": because they were both considered special at their time of release, I never got to play them then and I want to see what it was about. I'm still at the beginning of the game and already using a walkthrough to only focus on the puzzles and skip all the pointless wandering.			"

												This game is eye cancer, The game itself is hard to move around and use objects, they really didnt think their concept through when making this game. Its not scarey at all which it says it was. It is overall just a bad made game.			"

												Played this game when it first came out. Was amazed at the time with the puzzles and graphics that were presented. Acting is horrible... as is the case with a lot of games from this era, but the puzzles could be quite challenging. Tried to play this game again recently and it simply can't compare with today's games. I recommend yes only for nostalgia reasons.			"

												The 11th Hour is the not-so-well recieved sequel to the beloved classic point & click adventure game, The 7th Guest.  It was Trilobyte's attempt to ride upon the coat-tails of its initial success with their first runaway hit and in many ways was a hit-and-miss title.The story picks up 60 years after the events of the first game, 60 years later!  So, it's only real returning cast member is Henry Stauf.  Besides Stauf himself and the iconic Stauf Mansion (which was poorly represented in the FMV), The 11th Hour really has nothing to do with the events of the first game at all.  It's a shame really, just think: a story focusing on the original protagonist coping as an adult years after his traumatizing experiences only to confront Stauf once again - it would have made for a better sequel concept.  Despite this, the game's story and setting isn't all that bad... but it isn't amazing either.On a technical level, Trilobyte improved upon its FMV process but the cheesy acting ends up undercuting that fact.  The game also ran on a later version of the ""Groovie"" engine than its predecessor, but when The 11th Hour was released the engine was considered to be outdated compared to many point & click engines of the time.  It didn't help that for many the engine didn't play nice on most hardware configurations of the time.  It frequently crashed and for some it wouldn't even make it past the first menu screen due to differences in CD-ROM drive reading speeds.  It prevented most (including myself) from being able to experience the game when it first came out.Despite these short-comings, there is much to appreciate about the game.  The soundtrack is amazing, the 3D rendered graphics and animations were further improved upon, the quality in FMV production improved, the puzzles were equally as challenging as the first game, the story was enough to keep you invested, and all of this lent itself well to a 90s nostalgia inducing atmosphere similar to The 7th Guest yet unique in it's own way.Had this game been advertised as an independent experience and had it ironed out the technical compatiblity issues, I believe it would have fared better for it's time.  I can only recommend this game if you enjoyed The 7th Guest, have a love for cheesy 90s nostalgia, and have a good sense of open-mindedness and a humor-me attitude.  You'll enjoy and appreciate the game better if you have all that coming into it.So... ""Let's take the time to find ourselves again,  away from daily stress and pain,  though we may find we'll not come back the same,  that happens sometimes when we play,  the Game.""			"

												I was expecting after 7th Guest that sequel won't amuse me and I was right.It's puzzle game with FMV cutscenes. You return to abandoned Stauf's mansion after seventy years. Prerendered rooms of house in state of decay still look nice and now you can skip all walking sequences and cutscenes. Music is also not bad. However, i think mansion haven't too much climate in 11th Hour. It's just rotten house. Puzzles are bad, mostly based on moving things and there is several ""games"" against AI that are completly random. And Stauf send on palmtop of your character various word riddles, which make you to run on already visited rooms to thouch things to move plot. About plot, you see it by FMV sequences. Plot is more coherent than in previous game, but still is more akward than interesting. And movies are just bad. Bad acting, bad direction.I like playing older games, but 11th Hour isn't worth of recommendation.			"
