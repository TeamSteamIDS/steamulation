												Although Penumbra: Requiem is without the Survival aspects of Overture and Black Plague, its puzzles provide a challenge worth conquering as you unravel more about Philip and what goes on in his head.  However, due to this, the game does tend to feel more like Portal without a Portal Gun than a game from the Penumbra series. While it not may live up to expectations brought to the table by Black Plague, it's a satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.			"

												If you just play Penumbra for the monsters Requiem is not for you. However, if you liked the story of Penumbra this is a great conclusion for the series.Requiem takes a whole new approach to the Penumbra series: no monsters are encountered, so instead of being a horror game with puzzle elements this is now a puzzle game with horror elements. Keep in mind that Requiem is about 4 hours long (Black Plague is about 8 and Overture is about 12) and is not ""Penumbra 3"" but instead an expansion pack for Black Plague. Don't expect a full length story like the first two games, but that being said the story in Requiem is great for an expansion pack. It's actually quite scary at times, and it takes true horror craftmanship to scare the player while there is no physical threat to their character. The puzzles are by far the best of the Penumbra series. They blow the Overture/Black Plague puzzles out of the water and are a lot of fun. They're not too hard and not too easy, which makes for a nice difficulty. Requiem is the only game in the Penumbra series where I felt the pacing was uninterrupted; don't get me wrong, Overture and Black Plague are great games but were often *plagued* by clunky action mechanics (Overture only) and occasionally bad puzzles.

												Disapointment.  Thats all I got after finishing the 3rd and final chapter in this series.  What started off solid in Overture and continued with a bang in Black Plauge just fizzled out here.   The spooky atmosphere is really the only thing this has in common with the first two games.  No real threat felt.  Just puzzle after puzzle after puzzle with nothing.  It offered no resolution to what the first two games.  Hell looking back I would say Black Plague was a better ending.  This was just Portal without the portal gun.  Play if you love puzzles but if you want the horror these games offered in the first two titles than you'll be disapointed like I was.			"

												So, for the looks of it, seems like most people rating this game were not smart enough to understand what was the game about. Starting off that this is just a DLC to Black Plague, just an 'add-on', that doesn't alter the actual story:  Everything's happening in Philip's mind! If you are looking for the run-and-hide experience, don't play this. It's not what you're looking for. This only gives you a glimpse of what's going on inside the main character's mind, enriching the Penumbra experience.I'd recommend it only to those who played the previous games and are interested in the storyline, rather than the chills.

												First of all, Penumbra: Requiem is a DLC to Black Plague, and I will review this as a DLC.If you played Penumbra: Black Plague, you probably wondered what happened to poor unlucky Phillip. Well, you get an interesting answer in Requiem, which kind of poses more interesting questions than answers. Requiem is all about the puzzles. There are 9 levels (puzzles) and as you solve each one, there are interesting books, artifacts, and audio recordings to discover that piece together the current reality you are experiencing. This game isn't scary like the first two in the series, but it does maintain that dark and foreboding atmosphere. Personally, I'm glad there were no monsters stalking me, since I died enough trying to solve the puzzles.Now are the puzzles hard? Yes....and no.....sort of. The puzzles start off easy, then even though you know how to solve it, you have to execute it just right or start over. Thats where it got kind of annoying for me, since my timing can be less than great. I also like to overjump platforms a lot and jump to my death. So, if you have an excellent sense of timing and depth perception, you should have no problem. Now there really isn't a story per se, since it just build off from the last two games. There are two endings plus an optional extra ending if you find each artifact hidden in each level. I was content to get the regular two endings and Youtube the special one, since I was in no mood to look for all the artifacts and solve the puzzles. This game gave me serious feelings of nausea since I had to repeatedly try to do puzzles correctly (jumping platforms, falling, moving puzzles). I really enjoyed the dissent into madness and ""meeting"" the fellow insane people that have been dropped in the facility. The sound really keeps you on edge. The graphics would only let me play on the lowest settings, despite me trying to change the screen resolution repeatedly. If anyone ever finds a fix let me know. This was a minor annoyance to me, since graphics in a game like this is secondary criteria.I feel a sense of accomplishment after playing this, and while it is not really a full ""game"" like the two previous Penumbra titles, it should be played to enrich the Penumbra experience.  I am also looking forward to playing Penumbra: Necrologue!			"

												This is a timid recommendation, but I think the game is good enough to be called a decent wrap up for the series. There are no enemies at all in this game, so there is no tension. Despite that, some of the locations manage to be creepier than anything in the preceeding games. There aren't a lot of glowing positives to this title. The story is superfluous, so if you've finished Black Plague and DON'T want to play this, then you aren't missing much. The puzzles are more numerous and a bit more complex, but for the first time in the series, there are more than a few convoluted challenges.			"

												Take the previous Penumbra games. Substract monsters, inventory system and plot. What do you have? A puzzle game with extremely dark environment similar to the underground levels of Portal 2. Except there is no sense of progression, no thrill and resource management. And a needlessly creepy soundtrack accompanies you during tedious puzzle solving. Actually, the game does have a plot. It starts out where the Black Plague left off but the whole game is set in protagonist's own mind. Each level takes place in a different facility complex and there is no connection whatsoever in between. It usually makes references to previous games but the connection is extremely weak and to be honest, is just there to remind the players that this is, in fact, a Penumbra game. I think you will only will be interested in the plot if you love the scenerio and recall what happened in Overture perfectly.Puzzles reward observation more than logical and practical thinking. And for a game that features such large and dark environments, puzzle solving can be quite bothersome. Also, some new physics related elements were introduced here which make me think the reason this game exists is just to demonsrate Frictional's home-made sophisticated physics engine. Why? Just why is this beautiful classic horror series is trying to compete with Portal? Completely different genres. To sum up, don't make the mistake i did and think that this is the final installment of the trilogy. There is no trilogy. If we don't count the recently launched fan made mod Penumbra: Necrologue, the series started with Overture and ended with Black Plague. And then there is this stupid spin-off, Penumbra: Requiem. Even the name doesn't make sense. Requiem to what? To the series? What a disappointment!			"

												I was hoping I'd be on the positive side of the Mixed reviews for this, but I'm not.Penumbra: Requeim takes a pure puzzle and platforming approach in the same universe and engine as the previous game. On the positive side, you don't have to deal with enemies hindering your progress, but the pacing is completly changed to hunting for keys and dealing with block and platforming puzzles. Hunting for notes and logs are replaced by periodic dialogue expositions from comm devices and ""mind talk"" meant to mostly mess with the player character. This is better for gameplay, but the world building is missing from the previous games. Interactions with artefacts are replaced with diary logs from a doctor, which ultimately confused me to why they exist and what they were trying to explain or prove story wise. With Requium being a ""puzzle expansion"", maybe all the lore and story exposition should have been removed to make this a straight puzzle/adventure experience - the story telling was weird and the ending made me wonder if Philip had a different fate from the previous game, but didn't explain it well.My biggest problem with the game were trying to figure out the puzzles - often times, I didn't know exactly what I could do or what some of my actions did. I had to consult a walkthrough multiple times - your player can barely throw small to medium objects very far, but solving one specific puzzle required throwing an object over ten feet in the air twice - this never occured in the previous games. I can't fault the game for lack of puzzle variety, but I can fault it for expecting the player to pick up unused mechanics all of the sudden.If the horror and story experience was the most valuable aspect of the Penumbra series here, you'll hardly find it here and will be better off watching it on Youtube at best. If you played them for the puzzles,  you may love Requiem, but the pacing may bore you and the puzzles may infuriate you like it did me. Thankfully, it is short and is a small part of a well priced pakage. "

												Would I recommend? Tricky. If you've played through Overture and Black Plague then you probably want to take the story to completion.The problem really is that this installment doesn't really do that. As a standalone puzzle experience it's not a bad little game but as part of the Penumbra series it falls short.In essence, unlike the previous games with areas that naturally followed on and progressed with a story, Requiem is split into individual unrelated puzzles. Maybe something you've encountered in a previous area will help you understand a new one but that aside there's no real flowing narrative. The whole ""find x number of keys to exit the area"" feels a little cheap too with no real explanation.In addition there are no enemies and not much interaction beyond pulling some boxes and turning values. Whilst some areas do have the spooky unsettling feel, after you've fallen off into the water and had to swim all the way back for 15th time the atmosphere tends to wane.So to buy? If you want a fairly short puzzle game then Requiem isn't a bad choice. However if you're looking for a solid finish to the Penumbra story I think you'll be disappointed as nothing is really added beyond the conclusion of the second game.I'll go with ""yes"" because Requiem isn't a bad use of your time, but just be aware of what it is and what it isn't.

												Each one of Penumbra's games seems to be a whole different playstyle. Sadly, I don't like where Frictional wanted to take this game. It's just not as scary as the other two games, specially comparing it to Black Plague, which was a freaking masterpiece. It's WAY more based on puzzles. (And I know it's there in the description, I've got to put this on my review because there are idiots who fail to understand that). They always talk about the curse of the third, how always the third game or movie of the series will suck♥♥♥♥♥ and I guess Penumbra DID get affected by this. It's not completely bad, it just doesn't feel amazing, it feels frustrating.			"

												Requiem is an add on that puts before a you a series of puzzle challenges rather than sending you through a nerve wracking horror adventure.Taking place right when Black Plague ended, it nonetheless feels kind of disconnected, since it takes an entirely different approach to what one came to know when playing the first two parts.To me, however, Requiem is not a ""real"" third game. As I said it is a puzzle add on and you do not need it to see the Penumbra storyline finished. Putting that aside, Requiem is not a bad game. It is different than the other parts, but not bad at all. Comparable to Portal you are set to solve a series of puzzle and dexterity enviroments, each with a hidden collectible (hint) and accompanied by voices of people you ""met"" during your adventure.Playing it is not essential. If you like first person puzzles you should take a look. If you are in it for the Penumbra horror, you might be disappointed.I played it one or two challenges at a time and quite enjoyed it while it lasted.			"

												This game is the epitome of, ""Why even bother?"" You have an inventory full of all kinds of space, and you literally NEVER pick up an item and put it in your inventory. Everything has to be dragged around by hand. This leads me to my number one complaint of Requiem, which is the constant need to run back and forth and repeat parts over and over again. Penumbra is an excellent horror/puzzle franchise because it almost never required repetition. And when it did, it wasn't a big deal. This game will have you run all the way to the beginning of a level, all the way back, all the way to the beginning, and all the way back again several dozen times. It becomes so frustrating in several parts when the length of the game is being unnaturally extended through tedious activity. So when you would gladly have loved to put that item you need in your inventory, you were busy dragging it back and forth, hoping not to drop it. If you did drop it, have fun for the next fifteen minutes getting it where it needs to go. There is no horror in this game. The game developers decided that this was going to be nothing but ""puzzles"". And by ""puzzles"", they mean jumping platforms mixed with very simple solutions that took several minutes to execute. Something like, ""Oh, obviously a box needs to go there... but the only box is down that hall, around the corner, up that ledge... ugh this is going to suck."" The platform jumping was so obnoxious and so out of place. They eliminated all text documents, meaning there is no real substantial lore or plot to this game. It seems very empty and pointless. I loved the first and second Penumbra games, but I can't justify this one as even remotely passable.			"

												Ignore my playtime; Steam went nuts and erased my time for a few different games in my library.I remember finishing the first Penumbra game; I remember how shocked and confused I was when I suddenly went from a system of mining tunnels to a tiled hallway. The fact that the game shifted from what I thought would be the sole environment to a clearly man-made permanent establishment (made all the more creepy by the fact that Phillip had reached quite a deep level of the mines) formed a perfect cliffhanger that made me scramble to boot up Penumbra: Black Plague.When I finished Black Plague (no spoilers), I was excited the Lovecraftian influence, but was delivered a second unexpected devolopement when I read the final phrases of what Phillip wrote in his email right before the credits.All of these twists and horrifying events throughout the course of the first two games made me ecstatic about playing what I thought would be an incredibly well-done finale to this series, but when I played Penumbra: Requiem, I was downright disappointed.All of the things that made Penumbra's writing so good was completely absent from Requiem. It feels more like a less-sensational version of Portal than an atmospheric horror game, and it's made more frustrating by the fact that you're solving puzzles ""just because""; you're not trying to decrypt a document or escape from a gas-filled room, you're just solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles.I absolutely loved the Penumbra series, but I would have to recommend skipping this one and going straight to Necrologue and Twilight of The Archaic.I'm sad to say that this is the first ""Do not recommend"" review I've written, and it's made all the more bitter by the fact that it's of a series that has decent polish and good design.

												I'd say that this was the worst of the trilogy (Overture was my favorite) because it lacked the sad, grim feel of melancholy that the other two games shared. It's a feel that is unique to the Penumbra games, and I just didn't feel it much in this one. The storyline was also kinda choppy - felt more like a progression of puzzles with some dialogue lines mixed in. Still, though, this game had some really cool puzzles and environments that radiated a sort of crazy, dreamlike feel. It really felt like Philip's last step into madness. Oh, and he cracks a lot of cheesy jokes, too. Philip should have his own talk show.Others may say that this is the one game of the trilogy that isn't worth playing, but I say:exploding ketchup. "

												Penumbra: Requiem is the third in the Penumbra series by Frictional Games.If you're looking for the same sense of dread and horror you recieved from the other Penumbra games, you are going to be disappointed. But if you enjoyed the puzzles, you will probably like this game anyway.Requiem was intended as the third and final chapter for the Penumbra series. However, due to problems that have not been elaborated on, the original story was reduced to two games, Overture and Black Plague. Instead of a true third chapter to this series, the development team decided to create Requiem to tie up loose ends in the story and focus on a more puzzle oriented gameplay.It should also be noted that during the devlopment of this game, Frictional Games was working on their next game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent.If your looking for another good, yet unofficial, continuation of the Penumbra series, I would recommend the Fan-Mod Penumbra Necrologue.

This game (it's actually a stand alone x-pack to Black Plague), however, is very different from the other two in that there is no combat or enemies - or even horror, only puzzles. Now I do enjoy puzzle games, but this one includes some precision or timed puzzles that, coupled with the bad controls the series has been known to suffer from, makes some levels infuriating. However story wise it's very much worth playing if you enjoyed the series, as it is the effective conclusion.Recommended for fans of the series.			"

												Penumbra: Black Plague removed combat, and added a graphic overhaul to Penumbra: Overture, which was a definite improvement over the latter. Penumbra: Requiem removed the monsters, the horror and added lots of daft platforms (even a section inspired by ... Donkey Kong?) which in my opinion, is definitely NOT an improvement. However, if you look at it as just bonus content to play after completing Black Plague, it is a nice extra.Penumbra: Requiem by Frictional Games, my first impression gameplay.

												Feels nothing like its predessescors.The Cthulhu-feel has been replaced with obnoxious 'traps' and 'puzzles', and the game is overall just frustrating.Missing that jump? Well, go suck on an external harddrive, then.0/10 wish I hadn't heard it ever came out.			"

												Not as scary as the first 2 games, but the puzzles was really good. The story is fairly good. I enjoyed it, though the gameplay length is rather short comparing the 2 games, of course unless you dont know what you are doing then it may take longer. I still like it.			"

												So, you know how sometimes there's like a ""10 new levels!"" or a ""time trials expansion"" pack to a story-driven, self-contained game?Yeah, Requiem is one of those and it's sort of a snore. Basically, it's Penumbra: Aperture Science – nine boring ""hit the lever"" puzzle stages with a fourth-wall breaking female computer voice cracking jokes on someone's behalf. Art assets seem to be recycled from the earlier Penumbra games and their scrapped content, and the ending doesn't really relate to the main game story. It's basically a crock.			"

Penumbra: Requiem is a puzzle-focused expansion taking place after the events of Penumbra: Black Plague. The player once again takes the role of Philip, struggling to make order out of chaos, or at least to orient the chaos in the desired direction. Events are equally surreal as in BP, but overall, the environment is less tense and physically threatening. Each area requires Philip to collect a number of mystic orbs in order to open a gateway to places better left unvisited, so that he can subsequently visit them. Along the way, he is haunted by voices from the past.Overall, I enjoyed Requiem - it's more of a Penumbra-themed Talos Principle than a true chapter of Penumbra, but that's not a bad thing.			"

												this is the ""third"" and final installment of the penumbra series. if you have already played the first two, then i'm sure you will be hoping for more of the same and will be thoroughly disappointed. negative review aside, all fans of the series should play it just to see how bad it is and why. just to be clear, this is an ""expansion pack"" to the second game and loosely continues the plot of the first two, so don't expect it to be as flushed out as the first two, expect about half the play time of the others, if that. first, the enemies have been removed from the game altogether, and as such the horror element has been all but eliminated. second, the plot is nothing to write home about and really takes a back seat to everything else. third, whereas in the first two games the puzzles tended to be logical, have multiple solutions and had helpful clues hidden in the form of various notes scattered around, the puzzles in this one are essentially trial and error, leaving you to fumble around in the dark, so to speak, with no clear indication of what you are supposed to be doing. fourth, the flashlight has unlimited battery life, removing the sense of urgency you had trying to solve puzzles in the dark because you didn't want to waste your precious battery life. fifth, the game is laggy and full of glitches and bugs. sixth the ending. just wtf. it's like they didn't even try with this game at all. from what i have heard, a third, full installment was planned and then cancelled, then after public outcry they just haphazardly threw something together to satisfy the fans (something which fell flat on its face) and it shows, painfully. this game is centered on puzzles entirely, puzzles which don't even make sense and it will leave you pulling your hair, frustrated and seeking a guide for most of the game. if you're a fan of the series, play it anyway just to see what i mean. if you have never played a penumbra game before, avoid this game like the plague because it will be referencing plot lines used in the first two installments that won't make any sense, and the puzzles just won't be fun. at all. actually i think you need a copy of black plague to even run it, so hopefully you won't accidentally stumble across this disaster of a game and have a bad taste left in your mouth for the rest of the series, because the first two are some of the best games i've ever played. if you can, do what i did and pick up the entire trilogy on sale, because this game IS NOT worth purchasing by itself.

												I love the Penumbra games. In fact, the Penumbra games are my favorite games that Frictional Games have ever made! And that's saying a lot, all their games are absolutely incredible. But, Penumbra Requiem is different From the rest of the Penumbra games... Different isn't always bad but this game floats far away from what Penumbra actually is. The Penumbra games are horror games, but this one is a puzzle game. And for the most part, I kinda enjoyed this game. But it isn't what Penumbra is meant to be. As far as I'm concerned there's no enemies at all. There's no creepy atmosphere, there's no running away and hiding from The Tuurngait Infected or Demon Dogs. There's just puzzles. So I would only recommend this game if you've played the first two Penumbra games first, to understand the story and get a good taste for what Penumbra actually is. So this game isn't bad, it's just different and isn't what Penumber should be. So before buying this game, please play Penumbra Overture then Penumbra Black Plauge for the best experience!6/10 - Just had to click ""Not recommend"" only because there is no ""meh"" button lol			"

												Given to the player alongside Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition (which in turn comes with the Penumbra Collector's Pack), Penumbra: Requiem is a small expansion pack to Penumbra: Black Plague that acts as the final act to the story that began in Penumbra: Overture. The expansion is decent for the most part, trading the old-school adventure approach with gameplay more akin to Portal. The puzzles do mesh well with the gameplay, creating some intricate, multi-part puzzles. However, the atmosphere is pretty much gone here and, while still occasionally eerie, it's not nearly as terrifying as the original two games. The story does try to tie up all of the loose ends, which it does reasonably well, thanks to two endings that are up for interpretation. It's a short stint, but worth looking into if you want to see Philip's story to the end (or ends).			"

												This Penumbra game disappointed me so much. With the amazing two games that came before this one, I had high hopes that this would be another big winner. I found that this game completely removed the 'minor horror' aspect to it, and the story bored me to tears. I still don't rewmember if I finished this game or not because that's how boring it was. The game is mostly puzzles like 80/20 and after completing puzzle after puzzle I was hoping for something interesting to come along but it never did.I don't recommend this game at all, but Overture and Black Plague are definitely the way to go.

												This is a puzzle game not a horror adventure game like the other two Penumbra games. The game itself isn't too bad really. Most puzzles are good but a few of them require to much backtracking and braindead tasks, such as slowly moving items across large portions of the map. Supposedly the game the picks up some loose ends of the Overture/Black plague story but I think it really didn't do a too good job at that. I feel the story is told the wrong way. You are doing puzzles and a voice tells you about the story virtually without any connection to the puzzles themselves.It is almost like this game was done to keep some of Frictionals staff occupied while the rest made the foundation for Amnesia the dark descent. Cannot recommend due to wrong expectations from me and probably most of the players who started with the other games in the Penumbra series. If you are really into physics puzzle games this might be for you though.			"

												This is worth playing if you enjoyed the first two Penumbras and would like to see the conclusion further qualified and some loose ends resolved (while many others open...). I should note that this game feels quite different to either of its predecessors. It is neither horror nor sci-fi, it's basically in the mind♥♥♥♥ genre. Things will only (barely) make some sense if you have been paying close attention to the events of the first two games, so you must play those beforehand.The game is also easier because now your flashlight has unlimited power and there are no enemies other than the environment. This actually makes sense in the context of the plot. Finish the game to see why :)			"

												Philip's ordeal is not over yet, as he ""wakes up"" again in ""The Shelter"" for an unknown reason. Will Philip finally escape this nightmare for good?The closing chapter of the official Penumbra series by Frictional Games was, contrary to expectations, really enjoying. Nine areas in total, filled with satisfying puzzles await you in this expansion of Penumbra: Black Plague with no single creature in it. Every area is different from the other, each representing a part of ""The Shelter"" ready to be explored by the player in search of the Strange Artifacts that make an appearance in each level, ready to be collected.Overall, the whole series was fantastic and I recommend it to everyone interested in games with philosophical themes and deep meanings.

I noticed that the steam sale was on and decided that I would browse around. My eyes finally found Penumbra. It was on sale (£1.25). I bought it, not realising what was at the end.Requiem was not what I was expecting. It was not Penumbra. It was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ collection of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles.Now I must ask of you. I promised the Tuurngait that I would leave this game in peace. You must now do what I failed to do.Forget that this game exists. Leave it to be lost to the passage of time, but warn others to stay away. I had to perform tests for the Tuurngait, jumping through hoops like the Blobfish it saw me as. It was right: I WAS A PENUMBRA FAN!I promised I would leave this game in peace. I Lied. I hope you have the strength to do what I failed to do.Penumbra:Requiem is located at steam id: 22140Kill them.

												Disaster! I just finished this ""game"" and I'm at a loss for words. This is NOT a horror game. This barly even resembles the first two in the series. You will be solving relentless puzzles with no idea at all as to why you are doing it, where you are going, or what your goal actually is cause &^*% plot line development, right? In case you are wondering, there are NO enemies. 0. Nada. There is nothing frightening about this game. I can't understand why the developers didn't just replace the ambiance with light jazz music. It would have blended much better. Instead you're left scratching your head in confusion as to what genre of game this really is. You will hear dungeon sounds but you'll feel like you’re playing PORTAL 1 and 2 the whole time!!!! Yea. there are portals in this game. WTF? You have to find these yellow glowing balls that look like radioactive deer droppings in order to activate a portal which will teleport you to the next level, where ever the hell you end when you cross through it. This, by the way, will kill your sense of direction because you will not have any idea where you went or where you came from. Oh, and the disembodied voice you hear throughout the game, yea, that was ripped right out of portal 1 and 2 also. The ending?! THE ENDING! THE ENNNNNNDING WAS AWEFUL! Don’t play this game unless you want to be crushed with disappointment.			"

												Disappointing ending to the series. [spoilers] My complaint from Black Plague was the story was getting overloaded (illuminati type group with bases all around, mysterious virus, ancient aliens, not to mentioning balancing the multiple of events that act as background to the main story). Well, the wat! story line continues with some mysterious voice(s) guiding you through and the ending is left to major interpretation.  It should have kept it simplier than trying to do too much story wise.  This is a puzzle game, no stealth or creatures like the other two games.  I don't mind puzzle games, but the controls are clunky which will cause major frustration in moving things around, jumping, and anything with coordination.  They should have ended it at Black Plauge as nothing is really resolved here.  5/10			"

												A decent puzzle game, but why Penumbra? The story is incredibly vague and just seems like a way to resolve plot points nobody cared about in the first place. The horror assets (music, textures, etc) are so ill-fitting in a puzzle setting. The levels themselves are well-designed and challenging, but there's no real narrative to hold everything together, just a bunch of abstractly-connected areas.Good puzzle game, awful setting. Also upsettingly short.			"

												The game is very short and unlike its predecessors its not a horror game, it is just a puzzle game and an annoying one at that. If i would summarise what i've being doing in puzzles for 4 hours of gameplay well... the game's name would have been Stepping stone simulator instead of Penumbra. Its a dissapointing sequel with some mechanics wasted since they are no longer relevant due to the lack of the horror element. If you want 4 hours of cliche puzzle solving then have at it, but for the rest of us it's just a waste of time. I cannot recommend this game, play the previous two games instead to get the full experience.			"

												This game just rapes all the nostalgia (some people might have), all the greatness and the uniqueness of its prequels. It has absolutely no depth, it contributes little to the main story. You just have to collect ""keys"" for portals just as an excuse to dump you in random locations. Where are the depressing reflections of the protagonist on the loading screens? They got replaced with childish tumblr/reddit quotes that have absolutely no relevance to the game.This game's approach to some aspects of philosophy is cringe-worthy, just dumping some pseudo-intellectual affirmations about the problem of free will and determinism, without logic, expecting to add a ""deep"" vibe to this streaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thus converting a great scientific debate to  illogical and irrational garbage. Absolutely pathetic.Oh, you can also solve a puzzle with exploding ketchup bottles (11/10) !!tl;dr horrible sub-par of its prequels; not worth playing at all, the ending is dissapointing as ♥♥♥♥ as it seems like it was written by a frustrated virgin teenager.

												Started playing it with the impression it was supposed to be an actual horror game, needless to say it does not deliver on that aspect.Some horror elements are implied, but the game never really makes use of any of it. Level one contains a dead body, and I'm pretty sure it was the only one, anyway. Sorta gave a false first impression.That aside, decent puzzle game- but very lazily created off the main game. You still have a journal, and an inventory with a bunch of crud, and you can still go into hiding mode by crouching, but at no point in the game will you [have] to use any of it, save for maybe the painkillers if you happen to slip off an extraordinarily high ledge.Nothing special, but if you were gonna buy Black Plague anyway you might as well give it a spin.

												Probably unnecessary entry to Penumbra series.It doesn't offer anything significant gameplay or plot-wise compared to Black Plague. There's almost no tension, which was such a great part of previous two games. And some puzzles are quite un-intuitive. Yet there's nice design of levels and brilliant voice-acting and overall sound. Anyway, if you played Overture and Black Plague, you'll play Requiem too.			"

												While the game has a lack of opposition and some weird plot elements, the puzzles were thoughtful and the atmosphere probably tops both Overture and Black Plague due to how surreal and dreamlike it is in comparison. What this game manages to succeed in is making it creepy just based on how empty it is. It is actually quite an effective way to immerse a player into the game, considering the last two games had plenty of monsters to encounter. As a major contrast, this entry makes you feel truly alone.For a more detailed review, please read this: http://breakingcanon.com/games/penumbra-requiem/ "

												Penumbra: Requiem wraps up the Penumbra series on an unremarkable flat note. Unlike the last two titles in the series being horror games, Requiem is an entirely puzzle-focused game with a slightly creepy atmostphere. No monsters, no hiding, and very limited danger. The existence of Requiem feels extremely unnecessary because it adds nothing important or even relevant to the Penumbra storyline. Penumbra's ending would have been much more satisfying and intriguing had it concluded with Black Plague. The entire game feels like it was merely the product of Frictional making some puzzles using leftover assets they had, adding voiceovers to the levels, and then slapping the Penumbra name on it. And it's a shame because the puzzles are well made and are mostly fun to solve and complete. But despite that, Penumbra: Requiem is not worth buying, unless you want to spend three hours solving a few puzzles. If you want a good story, good horror, and grotesque monsters, ignore this and play any of Frictional's other (infinitely superior) games.			"

												Penumbra Requiem is an expansion pack for Penumbra Black Plague, still developed by Frictional Games and released in 2008. While Penumbra series wrapped up as duology, developers still decided to give more. With ""more"" being a collection of puzzles that demonstrate engine or just didn't make it into main games. No horror, no adventure, no narrative to speak of. Any wonders why people get dissapointed when they expect it to be the final part of trilogy?No, this nice castle screenshot on store page isn't from game, but concept art for another project.Also, I actually encountered some tehnical issues. First, I managed to make some objects to fall through geometry, so don't try to mess too much. At least it wasn't important stuff. Second, game refused to launch after I restarted my laptop until I deleted setting config file. Actually I think that these issues are in previous Penumbra games too, just didn't get to encounter them until now.Plot starts where Black Plague ended, as you get knocked out by somebody approaching form behind. After that you will appear in a very strange places, tomb and industrial dark structures. There is no real narrative, instead it will be almost dream-like with random pieces of voices coming through.It does have 2 endings. Which is made through choice in the final room. Everybody was doing that few years ago, it viewed cool. At least developers weren't bragging about moral choice and multiple endings, so will do.And most of your time will be spent searching for keys in each of 9 levels, giving it more of game-like quality as well. While there are no inventory puzzles at all, no notes and even your flashlight never runs out, you will be still doing a lot of them, after all there is nothing else to it. So be ready to pulls things using physics, pull switches, jump around a lot, throw explosive ketchup and platform like Donkey Kong. Yea, platforming. At least it's forgiving, though jumping is not controllable enough for Penumbra to have such platforming.And monsters were completely removed. There is almost no horror. Now, there was a level where I felt like I was being stalked, but there was nothing to be truly afraid of. Because of this atmoshpere, while providing ambient music and dark places, took a hit as well.To be honest, if it wasn't part of Penumbra series, it would have been barely appealing at all for me. It does get boring without good narrative or horror, with levels mostly being dark and with no points of interests. While puzzles are good, the pacing doesn't manage to hook player, ever. In the end it makes me question for who this expansion pack was designed for. The only reason for it to exist is ""didn't want puzzle ideas to go to waste"" after all. Plot didn't tie any loose ends either.No, it still made me think occasionally, it still is fine. Just nothing great. Like a tech demo of engine. But not as exciting as actual Penumbra tech demo, yes.Also, you can still collect all statues to get a bit more of text at the end of a game and get password for secret in-game computer where you also have to do a special action just to get to voice acting blooper.

												It's a shame there are so many mixed reviews for this. It is different to the first two games but also similar. It is more puzzle based, like Portal, and less focused on a story but the puzzles are very tricky to solve yet it still has the feel of Penumbra minus the baddies. The gameplay is exactly the same as the previous two games in the series but you finish the levels by finding the keys and heading to the exit.Still recommended as it will give you around 10 hours of gameplay and keep you engaged.

												Penumbra: Requiem is the third game of the series, and this one focuses its gameplay strictly on puzzles. The atmosphere and theme are still there, as the main character returns to where the first two games took place for some finality in the plot. All plot turns are done in what seemingly feels like memory flashbacks, and some more information is entertained concerning the characters of the overall story. This iteration of the series is not scary, and does not provide the player with any creepy or surprising moments, as the main objective this time around is to solve puzzles. While this is a departure from the previous two games, it is rather enjoyable, even for someone like myself who does not prefer to solve puzzles for fun. Some of the levels later in the game are much more difficult than in the beginning. They do not scale up the difficulty gradually. Suddenly, the puzzles are very complicated. The minute details you are expected to spot are very well hidden, which makes some of these later puzzles frustrating and unreasonably time consuming. I'm not sure how viable the comparison is, but Penumbra: Requiem reminds me of Portal. You are in need of some keys, which in turn, opens a portal to the next level. Even though this third installment of the series is an attempt to complete the story, I am a bit disappointed to say that it does not. At least it does not end the story clearly. This goes along well with the first two parts, and leaves the player wondering, and hoping that all ended well. Being the shortest and more complicated of the three, Penumbra: Requiem was fun for a puzzle game, and it should be considered as such.Penumbra: Requiem is okay.			"

												This is a first-person puzzler with light horror window-dressing.  It feels like the developers had some leftover bits and pieces and threw them all together to use them up.When I encountered the explosive tomato sauce I briefly thought I'd wandered into a slapstick comedy by accident.StoryNot very much, not even an excuse-plot for the puzzles.  A few characters from the previous games show up in voice-overs, but they don't tell us anything new.  If you haven't played the previous games then these will just be confusing: there's no recap.The markings and paintings in the first level are interesting (implying the ""Tomb"" was built by some primitive people who worshipped the big worm thingies), but the concept isn't developed at all beyond art assets.  Again, it feels like they're just some unused objects that didn't make it into the previous games.The very end has a throwback to the incinerator scene from Overture, but it's just a choice-without-consequence as neither option is any more a ""victory"" than the other.  The credits immediately roll.GameplayI hope you like pixel-perfect-jump puzzles.  The piston-platforms in the ""engine room"" (at least you die and the save point is nearby) and the sewer (Fallen in the water? Better swim all the way back down the corridor and start from scratch.) are particular offenders.Special mention also to the teleport-beams in the ""power ball"" level, whose entire purpose in life seems to be driving the player insane in real life.  So I guess this is a horror game after all.The world is divided into distinct levels separated by technological portals.  The tech of these portals (and some other devices used in specific puzzles) doesn't match up well with anything else we've seen in the series, and its presence isn't explained.BugsNothing notable.  A few cases of slightly dodgy physics, including the ever-popular ""two objects mutually accelerating each other"" bug, which at one point landed me in the water in the sewers.  Again.			"

Frictional Games did great job!I played this game in July 2013 (about 40 months ago). Even if this part is about 4 hours long and it only features solving puzzles, it was fun to play. The horror element is kind of thrown away as because there is no survival part.You can't really do it well enough, unless you played other games of the series (or Amnesia, to know how physics work on this engine). [I tried and failed :D]Generally this part was suppose to continue the story, however, something was changed and they decided to release 3rd part, but not as continuation - more like expansion with puzzles.PS: EXPLOSIVE KETCHUP!

If you want a good puzzle game then go get portal, if you want a good horror game, go get outlast and if you want a good puzzle horror game play the first two in the trilogy. dont give this game the time of day.The core mechanics of this game;you can pick stuff up, rotate and throw objects.you can push buttons.you can jump.Good points about this game;for me, it came with the other two.Bad points about this game;It exists. Its an exteamly anti-climactic end to the trilogy.The random frame rate drops.lack of deamon dogs and throwing dildoes at monsters.To summerise the entire game is a fetch quest.I am 11/10 Dissapointed.

Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.(note, my #/10 score = gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. + my enjoyment)PROs:+many puzzles+different types of puzzles (platforming, switch puzzles, pressure plate puzzles, companion cube puzzles etc..)+atmospheric (peaceful but eerie at times)CONs:-some puzzles are just annoying to do-careful with elevators (my boxes bugged out)Comments:It is a basically expansion pack for those whole like puzzles. There ain't no enemies. It is purely puzzle solving.Most of the times puzzles were okay. There were unique puzzles in their own way and some somewhat difficult. Though few puzzles annoyed me (mostly 2 platforming spots) and few that forced back n forward running.Aside that it was 2 hours experience for me. It was okay, puzzle ""fanservice"" Penumbra game.Though, I'll be honest. The expansion started where game ended ""kill them all"" and then next scene you are just solving puzzles.

												At first I thought it was going to be a first-person point-and-click so I got excited. But I soon learned the horrifying truth... that this would be a horror game! Environmental hazards, item puzzles, confusion, darkness and fear of the unknown... I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.

												Penumbra: Requiem wraps up the Penumbra series on an unremarkable flat note. Unlike the last two titles in the series being horror games, Requiem is an entirely puzzle-focused game with a slightly creepy atmostphere. No monsters, no hiding, and very limited danger. The existence of Requiem feels extremely unnecessary because it adds nothing important or even relevant to the Penumbra storyline. Penumbra's ending would have been much more satisfying and intriguing had it concluded with Black Plague. The entire game feels like it was merely the product of Frictional making some puzzles using leftover assets they had, adding voiceovers to the levels, and then slapping the Penumbra name on it. And it's a shame because the puzzles are well made and are mostly fun to solve and complete. But despite that, Penumbra: Requiem is not worth buying, unless you want to spend three hours solving a few puzzles. If you want a good story, good horror, and grotesque monsters, ignore this and play any of Frictional's other (infinitely superior) games.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Penumbra: Requiem is the third and final game in the Penumbra trilogy and developed by the gods of horror; Frictional Games and published by Paradox InteractiveI won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra seriesThis game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notesI won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investmentI highly recommend this game and the Penumbra trilogy in general! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Great conclusion to the Penumbra series. However, I would only really recommend this expansion/game to big Penumbra fans and fans of the story, because this game is just a creepy puzzle game; no monsters whatsoever. It is also very short. I finished the game in 5.5 hours and that was without any help on the puzzles. However, Black Plague is definetly worth 5.99 USD and it comes with this game so I recommend it.			"

												I felt quite let down by Requiem because I enjoyed the first two games so much as well as really got involved with the story. I did not mind the puzzles in this game and enjoyed the gameplay, but felt that all three story endings were rushed and dissapointing. It felt clear that Frictional just wanted to give the series a quick kiss goodbye and move on to other things, which I thought was a shame.			"

												Waste of time.  The dialog is ok if it made sense with the game.  There was no ""closure"".  The puzzles were more about wasting your time rather than enticing your brain.  The scenery was not creepy, it was as bland as an unsalted saltine cracker floating in hot water.  After finishing this I'm just kind of left here scratching my head wondering what they were trying to achieve here.  The other two games are worth it, this one is an easy pass.  It added nothing to the story that I can tell.			"

												Penumbra: Requiem isn't as climatic and suspensful as you'd expect but full of puzzles to keep you from escaping, but what are you escaping? what have you been searching for all along? This game does answer what wasn't answered in the second episode  Once you've found your father and discovered who wrote the email . Good game no monsters to give chase but atmospheric and worth having in the Penumbra bundle.			"

												As a pure puzzle game in a Penumbra setting, it's quite good.Story is almost non existant.See this as a free afterthought.Some comical relief even, because there are some levels and comments that made me chuckle quite often.			"

												Ill give Requiem Credit that it has a halfway decent atmosphere with some of its enviroments but i thought that the second Penumbra Episode, Black Plague had a fantastic conclusion and this third is unnecessary. However It wouldnt matter if requiem were a fantastic horror game. Its not at all, instead its a halfway decent puzzle game, and while i think that The other games had appeals that did depend on the quality of a multitude of puzzles they also depened on good horror storytelling and gameplay. Requiem abandons horror almost entirely and suffer greatly for it. It ends up being more like portal than anything else and that just takes a big dump on the tone the previous two episodes set up and the and the series on a really lame note.			"
