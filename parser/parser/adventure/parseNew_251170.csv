Early Access Review
								I picked this game up late Alpha 0.56a and I got very addicted, very quickly. The game at the moment is riddled with bugs but for the first full two days of gameplay, it didn’t bother me whatsoever, each time I disconnected I found myself rushing to get back in to return my endless search for keys and then the doors for those keys. One thing that I found that is a bit negative towards the game is the Phantom, I don’t consider it overpowered but I consider it is… how to put it. Not used correctly. The game is suppose, in my mind be a survival horror. In other words I find that the goal of the monster whatever type that may be, should be to try to scare the survivors in any possible way, from talking creepy in the microphone to chasing a survivor, and letting them get away. I’ve found the best matches I’ve had are with people who just installed the game, the environment is new, they don’t know the mechanics of it yet and pretty much anything give them a little jump. Nothing is more satisfying as the monster to hear them scream and run when you spawn behind them, and give them a little growl. I don’t think the majority of the community follows this ideal of the monster however. I’ve noticed in most lobbies people let everything stay on random. But, sometimes you have someone select something, and nearly 99% of the time they choose the Phantom. Then exactly what I expect happens, the phantom rushes the spawning points kills all the survivors in cramped narrow hallways then proceeds to give remarks like. “Yes!” and “Owned!” in the lobby, like they actually accomplished anything more than simple spawn killing. The impact on the survivors is that they didn’t care, they didn’t get scared, and it was a match that wasn’t worth there time or will ever stay in their memory. Now, I’ve had a few good matches with the Phantom, but I can count on my hand how many times it happens. Now I don’t think it should be removed, it is a perfectly valid monster and I think it is quite well balanced for what it is. But perhaps one thought. From my understanding the monster works on player proximity and sound from traps, to footstep and flashlights being turned on and off. We as a player base do not fully understand the Phantom, but perhaps, the proximity effect should be removed, and replaced with an ‘aura’ the Phantom could put up from time to time, anyone in that aura would be detected. This move would need a decent cool down timer so that the Phantom could just not hang out in doorways and spike it whenever. To balance this more if a player springs any trap whatsoever the phantom should be alerted no matter the distance, this would strike fear in the heart of the player not knowing how far the phantom is, but knowing he is now on his way, and they need to calmly, slowly move away. This effect could be done with something on the Phantoms over display, perhaps a pulse that gives off slower intervals far away and faster intervals closer. The trap and the player would have a shimmering outline around it, the trap until the Phantom reached the location and the player the standard time as currently.  I feel as a player the next thing that should be looked at should be the crashing issues, and also allow players to save there log in information and password so on the occasion they do crash, they are not scrambling to enter their information to rejoin their friends. Once this is corrected I feel that monsters in general should have scaring non damaging moves and abilities with great range to keep the players on edge and fresh. Jump scares are great but if they are used over and over again it loses its effect, think Dead Space. It would be great if for example the lurker could enter a non-damage form, he could see the players but they can’t see him. He could make things move, blood drip from the walls, doors slam as players draw closer to them, fade a players vision to black, move them to another location on the map and then allow them to see again. This games potential is honestly non ending. I feel like this could turn out to be the greatest horror game of the next decade. I wish the game developers much luck and I hope they read all of this, and consider some of what I said.			"

												8/10 Still this game has lots and lots of potential, hey! but it offers what you wanted from the game! it scares the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you! would recommend.-below are anti monster guides on how to not be detected by the player-controlled monsters/ghostsOverall basicsRule 1. Don't pick up the batteries just because they are there. The batteries you pick up replace your previous battery. Meaning that if you pick up 2 you waste 1. Wait for your battery to be low before picking another up. This will save you in the late-game.Rule 2. Voice chat is C, stop askingRule 3. When a monster is chasing you, DO NOT RUN TOWARDS TEAMMATES. All monsters are good at killing clustered survivors. Run in the opposite direction and let the others survive.Rule 4. Help any new players with the basics. The more you help, the more chance this game has of seeing a real release.Rule 5. Be aware of your surroundings. Know where you could go in case of emergency (this will depend on the monster you fight).Rule 6. Sometimes things bug, get used to it.Rule 7. I decide what qualifies as a ""rule"", get used to itAnti-LurkerThe lurker is the OG monster. So if you be creepin' up on his turf, gonna get a beat down!But, if you can't help it here are some tips.Lurker fact: The lurker has a ""ghost"" form and a physical form. He can HEAR you in ghost form (like, the gamer has to use his actual ears (unlike the phantom)), but he can only KILL you in human form.Lurker Fact: IF THE MUSIC CHANGES THAT MEANS HE'S NEAR! GET TO COVER!Lurker Fact: The lurker sets traps by clicking on items in the environment. When YOU set off a trap (e.g. you set off a grandfather clock), be careful. He might have heard you.Lurker Fact: The lurker CANNOT stay in his physical form for long. He has about 30-40 seconds in his physical form to kill you. If he stays in physical form for the whole time, he will be unable to use physical form for a while (2 minutes?). The shorter he stays in physical form, the less his cooldown will be (down to 13 seconds from a <2 second physical form)Rule 1: Avoid traps! If you are playing against a monster who's main way of tracking you down is traps... AVOID THEM! Stay away from clocks, radiators, boards, light fixtures, toilets (these are the worst), ladders, wiji boards, and jack-o-lanterns if possible.Rule 2: In the beginning of the match you have about 45 seconds of free time before the lurker CAN appear. Use it wisely and progress as much as you can in this time. Remember to stop running at least 20-seconds before you think that he'll appear (to charge sprint to maximum).Rule 3: Doors! On maps with lots of small rooms, you can just go in a room, shut the door, and block it with your body. He can't get in... so.... it's good!Rule 4: Tables! On maps that have wide open rooms, your best bet is to sprint away from him or to put a table between you and him. Then, just keep moving away from the side he moves to.Rule 5: Flashlight! If the lurker didn't see you when he spawned, TURN IT OFF. He has bad eyesight and hiding is possible.Rule 6: Don't look at him when running away. You'll slow down and die. A quick glance will suffice.Anti-PhantomThe phantom is the least fun monster to play as, and the most fun monster to play against. He is hard to learn how to play against, but once you get the hang of it, it's really quite fun!Phantom Fact: THE PHANTOM CAN'T SEE YOU. STOP RUNNING AWAY ALL THE TIME!Phantom Fact: READ THE ONE ABOVE AGAIN!Phantom Fact: The phantom can HEAR what you do. When you do something loud, the player that is playing the phantom will have you appear as bright white that can shine through obstacles and walls on his screen. Avoid: clicking the flashlight, overly clicking on doors and safes, RUNNING, walking very near the phantom, RUNNING, walking on top of the phantom, setting off traps, RUNNINGRule 1: STOP CROUCH WALKING, IT DOESN'T HELP, AND IT MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID.Rule 2: DON'T RUN TOWARDS TEAMMATES WHEN HE'S CHASING YOU!Rule 3: NO RUNNINGRule 4: If the phantom does ""see"" you, run as far away as you can. After about 5 seconds, the music will become more peaceful. When this happens, IMMEDIATELY CHANGE DIRECTIONS. This will send the phantom looking for you in a part of the map that is empty.Rule 5: Leave all doors wide open, he can't see them. Closing them will just get in YOUR way.Rule 6: STOP RUNNING, I'M SERIOUS! YOU JUST KEEP DYING!Anti-MaryMary is scary!Mary fact: Mary gains energy over time. She uses this for her 2 main abilities, Teleport and Frenzy.Mary Fact: Mary gains energy if you are near her. This does not include when there is a CLOSED door inbetween you and her.Mary Fact: She's really slow most of the time, but when she frenzies, you CANNOT outrun her.Mary Fact: You can look to the left, you can look to the right, you can look behind you, you can look under your bed, you can look under your dresser, but don't look up... she doesn't like to be seen.Rule 1: don't get near herRule 2: don't get near herRule 3: don't get near herRule 4: all of the aboveRule 5: So... you got near her... idiot! Well if she frenzies you still have a chance. Start sprinting in RANDOM DIRECTIONS. Mary is super fast, so it's really easy for her to overshoot you. Doing a random pattern of sprint can save your life. You only need to survive for 8 seconds anyway.Rule 6: DON'T GET NEAR HERConclusionDon't die			"

												I'm writing this now, still a little stressed and in the throws of an adrenaline high caused by my friends. First and foremost, play this game with a group of friends who are bad at the game along side you and can get better with you. Playing with randoms online will not help you learn in this HIGH stress environment and the current how-to guides online are only so helpful.Here's what you get:You're one of the survivors in the haunted hotel/asylum/hospital, and your on a scavenger hunt for keys to open the various locked doors on the map. As you creep around, you deal with randomly generated hauntings that do aweful things like make the dark screen darker, mysterious spooky noises play in your ear, or keyboard keys can even be disabled. All temporary. And thats all before your friend takes control of one of three monsters and attempts to murder you before you get the silver key and escape.The keys and tools are all hidden in obscure places, anything from in drawers of desks to the garbage can in the woods. But never somewhere completly random like the middle of the floor of a ball room. They are hidden well, but not unfairly at all. The rest of the challenge is finding what doors they unlock. Eventually leading out.The Three Monsters:As of now there are only three creatures to threaten you and they all garner a different approach to avoid. Here's the long/short;Lurker sets traps to try to pinpoint your location and materializes in a blink for a few seconds at a time. You pretty much just run from him like an old monster movie. Bracing doors and sobbing until he's gone.The phantom is 'blind' and only sees players who make a lot of noise. People complain about him being Overpowered but  thats mostly because they run around and get slapped instantly. You need to be sneaking when this ghoul roams the halls.Then there's mary. She randomly teleports around the map, and if she fills up her spooky-meter she frenzies and can run at you rather than her usual trundle. Think the Witch from Left 4 Dead, popping and locking through the dining room looking for victims. The Good:-Very different kind of game play. If you have a group of friends you dont mind never wanting to talk to again, team up and go scavenger hunting.-This is a HORROR game, not an FPS. When you see the monster you run. There are no guns, just a flashlight. This might sound like a negative, but it really helps amp up the FEAR-Atmosphere. This might be a little generic, but they really do try to use your less obvious senses to pick up on the creepy factor. You get trained to listen for traps and musical queues, little details, that when you finally do see something. It hits hard and helps you scare.The Bad-Crashes. There seems to be a lot of crashes between my friends and I. Hardware capability dont seem to be the issue, and if someone drops midgame, they wont be able to get back in. They'll only be able to spectate.-Genuine stress level. It might not be a problem to everyone, but I get genuinly stressed out. Legs tight. Hands sweating. Worrying about ever little step. This is why you play with friends. Let the strange monster creeping on you be your pal. Not some mook on teh interwebs.Final Verdict:Love it. Go in on a 4 pack with your friends. Maybe hope it winds up on a sale. Hopefully the crashes get patched out and new features like new monsters and  different playable characters get added. But this is not a game I can compare to any other experience very well. If players could jump back in if they were kicked and the crashes were resolved I would say full price is worth it. As it stands now, $19.99 is a little steep for what feels like early access material. However I still love the experience. And few things are as satisfying as hearing your friends fill their diapers over skype as you pop out around the corner.			"

												My reviews are primarily on the silly side (because I am a buffoon), but for this game I think I've got time to sit down grab a brew and do a full review.I got this game waaay  back when it initially released, with it's 1 monster (Lurker) and 4 maps. (Back then, I was heavily into Amnesia: The Dark Descent and the mods being created for Amnesia; so horror was my Wheaties, couldn't start the day without it). So suffice it to say, when this game came to my attention I was like ""Heck yeah, horror gaming with friends! GIMME!"". So I sat myself down, enveloped in complete darkness with no source of light save for my monitor, and played... [Gameplay]I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game plays much like Amnesia! Hell yeah! Albeit, a somewhat less intuitive version, still fun though. The game goes essentially like this, find lousy keys to open doors to find better keys that open doors that lead to a silver key that goes to a door that leads to your freedom (along the way you'll want to find a crowbar or something to unblock the escape door, meh). All the while listening for sound cues to let you know whether the monster is nearby or not.[Conclusion]Upon finishing a session, my friends were somewhat dismissive, whilst I saw the potential in this game and could ignore the rough edges (random crashing, Amnesia click and drag bugginess). I continued playing the game month after month, update after update, and found my experience never altering; to this day I keep thinking to myself ""This game has potential"". And that's where I am today, while this game has seen the additions of two more monsters (Phantom, and Mary) and is now at a total of 12 maps, has added the 'Insanity' mechanic (seeing things that aren't there), and has come out of Early Access, I still feel that so much more can be done with this game. In fact, I think at the end of this review I will whip up a list of additions and alterations that I believe would improve this game.But before that, I would like to say,As it stands this game is indeed worth buying if you are a true fan of horror genre gaming, and to those that ARE NOT, wait till a Summer Sale or something because the $19.99 price tag might be a little high for most people.Overall, this game gets my stamp of approval (for what it's worth), good job 9Heads Game Studios! You proved that a multiplayer horror experience IS possible.[Extras]Oh good, you're still here! You're probably here for my personal Additions and Alterations That Would Improve This Game ( aka. AATWITG, working title).1. Why Lurker No Go ""Here's Johnny"" On That Door?I think that considering that the Phantom and Mary are just straight up more dangerous than the Lurker, that giving him the ability to break down doors would add to the primal terror of a vicious creature that wants your innards to be outtards. I mean his hands don't even look like they can even grasp a door handle let alone turn it.2. Insanity, I See Goofy Faces...Overall, I love the Insanity system, I love it to death. But the faces, those goofy looking faces are just silly! Have you ever walked around in the dark, and had a sensation that you were about to come face to face with something, like you think you can see something that is just out of sight and out of focus, when all of a sudden it's right up in your face like a deranged dermatologist! You couldn't tell what it was, you just know it gave you semi-whiplash. Yeah that, do that!3. Insanity, Why My Legs Be Broken?Okay, this one is a little finicky. But sometimes when your Insanity reachs the point where you can't move or see, is alright, accept when you're trying to escape a monster! I get it, you see arms coming out of the walls grabbing at you, you slow down and think about your life, but when a monster wants to push your♥♥♥♥♥♥in! I think you got bigger problems. (Disable Insanity temporarily when in danger, that's all I'm saying GG).4. Insanity Addition: Tunnel-Vision.Some horror games are doing it! Damned sure as shootin' can! You know that optical illusion that causes you to percieve the room or floor or what have you to stretch out further and further away. Yep that's a winner!5. Need Me a Little Pick-Me-Up.This just a suggestion, but how about the ability to revive buddies? Like a chance that they survived the attack from a monster and are knocked unconscious, whilst unconscious the incapacitated player engages a nightmare scenario that they have to beat in order to wake up or wait until an other player resuscitates them. However, if blood begins to pool, that is a sure sign that the victim is beyond saving.6. More Scenarios for Success.Escape is a fine solution, but for those more brave souls why not include an alternative. Excorsism, Slay the Monster (aka. Monster Bane), Sacrifice (appease the monster). I don't know suggest your own! I just think that more can be done here.That's all I can think of at the moment, add your own suggestions if you want to. Thank you dear reader, for listening to me babble! You're good people.			"

												I think that this game deserves a honest and detailed review because of all the negative reviews it received. I will try to remedy that, but I will also address the technical difficulties me and four of my friends faced while we were playing. If you are not interested in reading a wall of text, there is a TL;DR version at the bottom so feel free to check that out!Why do I recommend this game? Because it shocked me and it blew me away. It crushed all of my preconceptions of what is and what can be a good horror game. And here are a few reasons why: I've never before played a scary co-op horror game. Never ever. And i honestly thought I never will. Then this game almost made me fall from my chair in one instance and I even wasn't the last person alive. Though, I only recommend playing this game with a group of friends, because playing on public servers can really ruin the experience. Trust me. This game is all about the atmosphere. Monster design is in my honest opinion superb. They are given unfair advantages and the developer understands that is the thing that makes them scary. Game forces players to adapt their tactics and their approach to the level they are facing based on the monster they are playing against. If you want to add a little bit of additional suspense you can actually play with ""all random"" setting and not check the player list when the game loads to see which monster you are facing. That way actually you really don't know what you can and cannot do. For example. If you are playing against Mary you can run but you should not have your flashlight on. If you're playing against Lurker you don't want to communicate through in game voice because it can hear you. If you are playing against Phantom you absolutely must not run or keep switching on/off your flashlight because you will die almost instantly.  Being a monster is not all about winning and ending a game soon, it is about creating the experience for the survivors. Let me give you an example - Today we played a hour long game in which we faced Mary (basically the girl from ""The Ring"") in the old abandoned factory. My heart was racing for the whole hour, especially when we lost two players and my friend and I were the last ones left. At one instance we actually bumped our faces in the monster player because he had the luck to teleport in front of us. He didn't kill us and just gave us a good scare before teleporting away. Why? Because as the monster you are the ""creator"" of suspense and fear. Good monster will miss a chance for an easy kill from time to time. He will stalk his prey, instill fear into the survivors and create really scary situations. That is why I recommend playing with friends, because it's not about the winning, it's about having the best possible experience. We did all die in the end, not because of a lucky teleport, but because of our own mistakes. Playing against human controlled monster is terrifying. You can not glitch him out. He has no clear pattern of behaviour you can exploit. He adapts and learns about your patterns of movement and tries to adapt his strategy so he has the biggest chance of finding you. Human intelligence far surpasses any artificial intelligence (AI) and makes this game truly unique. Every one of your friends will have his own way of playing certain monsters. When you are the last one alive the stakes are raised tenfold and the game really shines. Other players can spectate you and can hear you talk, scream and get freaked out. But you are alone and defenceless against the enemy you can only outsmart but you cannot beat.What do I recommend for the best game experience?There are a few things i reccomend you do as it will vastly improve your game experience: Use in-game voice chat (automatic voice detection setting turned on) with 3D sound enabled. While the sound quality is not the best I have ever seen, it gets the job done, and it really adds to the atmosphere. One monster in particular (Lurker) can use your voice to locate you when he is in his corporeal form. Three-dimensional sound is really well done and it can often help you find your friends. Another neat feature is that you won't be able to hear your friends when you die (it would really ruin it for me if I could hear my friends support me when I am the only one alive) Play with premade five/four player groups. Do not play with random people! It ruins the experience to hear monster sing his national anthem in a squeaky voice. As I've said, you need to get into the character because otherwise you won't get the best experience. You need to want to be scared. If you don't have a group of friends that can take the game seriously i advise you not to buy it as you won't get the enjoyment out of it. Even if you don't have the fifth player the game plays just fine with four people. When playing the monster, don't play just to win. Everybody likes to win, but it's your duty to make the game fun for other people. Play to scare. Play to make your friends enjoy this really great game. Toy with them. They will thank you later. Play on ""all random"" setting and don't check which monster you are facing. It raises the stakes and creates permanent suspense.Technical stuff!Here are our experiences. We DID NOT have major problems with this game so far, but i will update this review if we get more problems down the line - we ran this game on seven systems so far (two of us have laptops) so I can give you somewhat detailed performance breakdown and you can compare these specs to your own specs. Also note that ""Film grain setting is OFF across all systems because we simply dislike the effect as it brightens the view.  Game runs smoothly on my main rig (Nvidia GeForce GTX 295, Intel Core i7 940, 4GB RAM @ 1920x1080) - Stable 60FPS with Shadows on Medium, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on High,  Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film grain OFF, Depth of Field ON. Game is playable on my laptop (Nvidia GeForce 635M, Intel Core i7 - 3630 @ 2,40GHz, 8GB RAM @ 1600x900) - 30 to 50 FPS, with Shadows on Low, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on Low, Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film grain OFF, Depth of Field OFF. Game runs smoothly on my friends rig (Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, Intel Core i5 3570K, 8GB RAM @ 1920x1080) - stable 60+FPS on max settings with Film grain OFF. Game suprisingly runs great on an older rig (Radeon HD5670, Core 2 Duo processor, 3,2GB RAM @ 1440x900) - stable 40-50FPS with Shadows on Medium, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on Low, Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film Grain OFF, Depth of Field OFF. The only computer that had real issues running this game was an older laptop and even it could run it without crashes.Second part - Game and network stability!The game did crash a few times but it only once obstructed our game experience. Game tends to crash when switching to full screen, but a simple game restart fixes it.We've had almost no problems with network connectivity - game lobby just once froze for me as a game host but it wasn't anything a simple re-host couldn't fix. Game didn't crash while we were playing and we had just one random disconnect (i blame my lousy upload).TL;DRFour of my friends and I had none of the issues other reviewers pointed out. I've had a lot of fun with this title and would honestly recommend it to you if you have a group of friends that will get into character and won't actively work to ruin the atmosphere. Even though this game has a learning curve it is quite rewarding. Give it a try! "

												This game is terrible.Its buggy and it’s unbalanced as hell. I’ve played a good amount of this game and have only come close to winning once, and that was because the monster was afk for half the time.One time I spawned and my camera was just completely flipped for no reason and I had to restart the entire game to get it back to normal.There are only 3 monsters and half the levels all look exactly the same.But I play this game anyway, and it’s ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying.The best word that I can use to describe how this game makes me feel is drained.The atmosphere is perfect and all the little sounds and visuals add everything you’d need to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.There you are, the last one of your friends alive and you have the finals keys clutched in your trembling hands as your flashlight starts to flicker. You know that the exit is somewhere ahead of you but you can’t tell in the dimming light.The pressure becomes unbearable, worse and worse the closer you get to safety. The sensation makes you feel almost just as insane as the character you’re playing as.But there it is. The monster jumps out and lunges at you, and in that last moment of bile inducing terror all you can feel is peace.Serenity.You know your journey is over and you no longer have to fight.As your mangled corpse is tossed to the side you’re brought back to the game lobby with your friends vying for a new game.And you feel drained.10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ with my emotions again.

Early Access Review
								Damned is one of those games where you play with your friends to be scared with them or to scare them.Damned has built on the horror genre in it's own unique way; The monster (Currently ""Lurker"" and ""Phantom"") are player controlled, while four other players search around a  myriad of different ""levels"", such as ""Pines Grill Restaraunt"", ""Black Lake Asylum"" and ""Bodom Hotel"" looking for keys to unlock certain doors to escape the horrors within..Either that or they'll be shreadded carcasses in the next few minutes.Currently in 0.71b Alpha, the game is VERY buggy, unoptimised and uncompleted. But its a gem. If you are willling to contribute to the development of this game, then consider giving it a go. For an Idea of how the game plays, look towards these two videos showcasing two maps, ""Factory"" and ""Black Lake Asylum"" from the survivor's viewpoint, alongside Cpt_Aylott! FACTORY:

												Damned is a really great concept but an absolutely horrendous execution. I picked this game up years ago and had a blast, and probably even now I could boot it up with some friends and still have a blast, that's just how amazing the concept of a 4v1 asymmetrical horror survival game is.The main strength this game had was that it filled a niche that nobody else filled, yes, it was bug-ridden, yes it has janky animations, and yes, it's unbalanced to all hell, but that was fine, because it was still fun at the end of the day, it was still playable.Back then we thought they'll fix it, you know. We thought they'll fix up the bugs, add some more features and this game is gonna be great. Well, they added stuff, yes, and they fixed some bugs, but... the core game is still a mess. They also seemingly stopped updating the game, or if anything, they update at such a slow pace that it's hardly worth it anymore. Certain monsters are blatantly broken on certain maps, I'm fairly certain you can get stuck because keys don't always spawn properly and that's not to mention the many other different issues this game has, like performance, hit detection or the fact that you sometimes cannot loot vital items from a dead player's corpse.Sadly, with the release of Dead By Daylight coming up, I see no hope for this anymore. I've said earlier that the main thing this had going was that it filled a niche single-handedly, but Dead By Daylight, (albeit not without it's own problems) is essentially a less frustrating, more polished version of Damned, that I recommend everyone check out now that Damned is basically, well, ""Damned"".

												Damned is a 4 vs 1 cooperative game where 4 survivors are trapped inside a location such as an asylum, hospital, or hotel trying to escape the horror that lies within. In order to escape, keys must be located and boards must be removed to open the final exit door all while avoiding a deadly monster. There are 4 different types of monsters that a group can play against. Each monster has its own unique abilities to locate and kill the survivors and each survivor has a different set of attributes. This leads to a lot of cat and mouse tactics in knowing where to look and when to run and hide.There's about 10 different maps, a few different game modes, and key placement is randomized each game.The game has a small learning curve which involves each monster's playing strategy to efficiently locate and kill the survivors, and as a survivor understanding where keys typically are hidden and learning to avoid and escape each monster. It is a very satisfying game after learning the fundamentals, but until that point I felt kind of lost.There are typically a handful of games going although it is often difficult to find a public game because the game has a very small player base and the majority of games available are private. You may also have to wait several minutes for a spot to open up or people to join your game, but if you already have a small group of friends that won't be a problem.			"

												I can understand the positive reviews. There is the promise of a good game here, which promises to be a lot of fun with friends. It's just not that playable at the moment. The game should not have been released in its current state, since it is glitchy to the point of being impossible to play. Your game will crash, your voice chat will not work, you will be unable to connect, you won't be able to perform certain actions, etc. (At one point, I asked if it was still in beta, because it's absolutely unacceptable as a final version.) Even if those glitches were fixed, there are some serious design flaws. The stages are extremely dark and murky, which may create an atmosphere but makes it hard to see the tiny items that the survivors need. This decision might be okay if the game wasn't already so imbalanced. The survivors don't have enough options to get away from or defend themselves from the ghost, who has a one-hit kill. They also aren't given any indications about what keys open what doors, so it becomes an exercise in trying every key in every door. Worst of all, the ghost and the survivors are in the same voice chat, which makes it impossible to coordinate with the other survivors without the ghost hearing all your plans and knowing where you will be. So, in its current form, I cannot recommend it to others.			"

								REVIEW OUTDATED!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------This game.. What can i say? Its Alpha 0.42 so theres not much to say really.But what i can say, is that this game is awesome! So heres my opinion/look on it. What is Damned?: Its a co-op/multiplayer horror game where you can play as either the survivor that has to get all the keys and escape, or the monster that sets up traps to scare the hell out of everybody and causing panic and has the job of ""getting rid of the survivors"".Map designs: I do like how the maps are designed, but sometimes its very hard to find the keys, but i like that it spawns randomly. I like the maps though.Graphics, music and sound effects: The graphics arent bad, but neither very good either, its decent. But at the moment theres a need for optimization to fix the FPS issues that are there. It is Alpha after all. It runs just fine on my pc though, but it still seems kind of laggy, even with 60 FPS.I really like the music and sound effects in this game, creepy, unexpected and makes it all much more scary, which is good. This has a connection with the traps that the monster can set up, i like it.I just think that the monster has a lack of sound effects, he has none actually. So, i think it would be great with some creepy ones added to the monster(s).Playstyles:Playing as the ""Survivor"": I will say that i dont dislike playing as the survivor, cause it can actually be quite fun, for me at least. Gathering keys, sticking together with your teammates, escaping the monster when hes chasing you and stuff, its all quite fun. You have a flashlight which you can turn on and off, its very useful if the monster is chasing you, you can just turn it off and youre pretty much invisible.Playing as the ""Monster"": This is a playstyle ive never seen before, to be honest, which is cool. It was quite confusing to me in the start what to actually do, but i figured it out quite fast. If you know where you have your survivors, its just hilarious to play as the monster. There is 2 forms that you can go in to;1. The physical form, this is where you can see the survivors, kill them, and they can see you. You walk very slow but can one-hit kill people and still set traps.2. The ghost form, this is where you are invisible, can walk through doors and set up traps around the map.Its quite fun, because you can just spawn right in front of them and scare them and see them run away.Conclusion: I like this game, its unique and very fun (and scary).If i should rate it, i think i would rate it 5 or 6/10, just because its very good, but it can also get boring very quickly. What i think it needs, is just updates, which is coming. New monsters, maps and objectives. Theres a new monster thats in work in progress right now actually, im excited for that.End thoughts:So, to end it off, gather 4 friends if you can and play it together, thats the most fun.Also a good LAN Party game. It doesnt cost much and its a lot of fun. The developers seem to work quite good on this game, so im looking forward to the future updates!6/10			"

												I should start by saying that the game did provide a few sessions of fun. That being said, there are a number of problems with the game:1. The premise is very narrow and wears thin quickly. At first it is scary and you die all the time. Then you realise that you cannot possibly complete this game (see point 2) without studying the particulars of the monster you are facing. The minute you do that, the scary aspect pretty much disappears, or in the very least much of it is lost.2. The game is extremely hard for the survivors. The only way to beat it is to treat it like any other computer game and learn specific strategies... but in a game so dependent on atmosphere and fright, this ruins things.3. Once you have your strategy in place, studied the monster to the point where there is nothing scary about it, and are ready to play, you will soon find the game becoming very repetitive and tedious. You will essentially wander around in the dark trying to find that one damn key that no one could find to the door that is still locked. After 20 minutes of going around in the same circle doing nothing but trying to imagine where on earth you forgot to look and you will be ready to pull your hair clean off your head.4. The door opening and closing mechanism is moronic. You will not believe how moronic it is if you did not try it.All in all, not a game I would recommend. Interesting idea, but not very well executed and also lacking in content to make it interesting in the long run.			"

From the weird server browser to random crashes. If you're into horror games and if you want an unusual Coop/Versus game I still suggest you to get this game, especially when you can get it on a sale7/10 I recommend any day for its brilliant idea and the fact that the developers seem to care and expand their game. When I started playing, the game had 1 monster and about 4 maps. Now it has 3 monsters and 12 maps.			"

								Is it buggy? Hell yeah, this is an alpha afterall.Is it fun? Dear God, yes.This is one of the most tense and dynamic experiences I've had playing a game with friends in forever. There's is something so heart-poundingly terrifying about being hunted by a living, breathing monster that cannot be fooled with AI pathing tricks. It WILL find you because it thinks just like you; therefore you cannot, MUST NOT, think like you. Pure genius.It took a couple games/crashes and some trial and error to find what works and what doesn't. But half a dozen games in, our schoolgirl giggling chatter evolved into concise, razor sharp planning. It has layers of depth to it as you get better, both for the survivors and the monster. I cannot recommend Damned more highly.			"

												The only problem with DAMNED is the lack of players. If you play this with 4 or 5 friends, it will be the scariest fun you'll have with them. Trust me.This game may not have the looks, and it may be a bit buggy, but jesus freaking christ if it acomplishes what it sets to do: Scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and the survivors and make the killr/monster player laugh like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maniac.One thing this game does which I feel Dead by Deadlight doesn't is make monsters and survivors act like they're in a horror movie not by forcing such behaviour as mechanics but by crafting survivor goals and monster abilities that inadvertedly and subtlety make you behave that way. One monster teleports and only atacks once a bar is filled by looking at or being close to the survivors, so you need to stalk them for a while and another one can swap between an ethereal form (which makes him super fast but he can't see survivors unless they're really close to him) and a physical form (that makes him super slow but able to attack) whenever he's ot of survivor's sight, making for some intens cat and mouse situations.Too bad this didn't sell as well as other asymmetrical horror games. This is such a hidden gem.			"

												I never thought that an online/coop game can be scary. I was wrong.Haven't had the chance yet to play as a monster (only played a few rounds), but playing as a survivor is awesome. It is like playing Amnesia or Outlast withoutt the hiding in wardrobes but with 3 other people but you don't know where they are, there are no indicators. If you see them, good, but you can lose track of them if you don't pay attention or wander off. The maps are quite large with lots of rooms and corridors so it is also a good thing.When you are walkign around and suddenly see a sobbing, slowly walking girl in the corner of your eyes, or a ghost flying around which can only see you if you make noise and then you accidently activate a trap by walking past it, you know you are probably dead.Your objective is to collect keys, combinations for safes, hammers/crowbars for barricades and find the exit zone, which can be anywhere (I guess it is random, in one of my rounds it was a random small cell).It also makes it more fun that you cannot run from the monsters, most you can hope for is that you can outsmart/outrun them but even then you only win a little time till they can enter into physical/attack form again. The fact that the monter is controlled by a player makes it more fun, more random. Some people like to hunt everyone down as soon as they can while others prefer to play with the survivors and go after them one by one (I like it when I get this one against me).Now the cons:The game does seem to need a bit more polishing, it doesn't seem to optimized but , while I can run Outlast on maximum settings, I have to leave this game on medium to get 30+ fps which is weird.Also, I hope they will keep adding monsters (some slenderman-type would be fun or perhaps one that can mimic the form of a survivor to deceive them etc.).Later, some additional maps would be nice. At the moment I can recommend the game if you like horror, want to try something new (I haven't experienced this kind of online scary coop fun before) and if your machine can handle it. If your answer is no to either of these, perhaps you should wait a bit. As far as I know, this game has been on for a while but only gotten to Steam recently, I hope it will make it more popular and they can keep on improving the game from the income.TL;DR: The game is fun, new, scary but not really optimized.

								Probably one of the horrors that will Conquer it's genre soon.I haven't played Damned that much ( For now ) but it's pretty Exciting already. ""Damned"" is some Unique in it's kind game. I won't listen to some Fanboys that will cry about Bad Textures and Grapchics. ""Damned"" even without having some stuff that Outlast or Amnesia have can scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you in first 5 Minutes. The main Unique function I think is an ability to play as a Monster and/or ( I haven't decided ) playing with Up to 3 Friends as Survivors. I really enjoyed all the maps and the Gameplay.Each map has it's own knicknacks, plus, all the objectives ( Keys, Exit Doors e.t.c ) are generating randomly, so each Play is unique and of course scary. I also liked that game has 3 Monsters and their amount will raise ( as Devs said ), and each one is perfectly balanced. Don't forget, ""Damned"" is on Summer Sale, so buy it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.			"

												Bought the 4-pack for me and 3 of my friends, let's just say that we've all had trouble sleeping lately. The game is very balanced and having the keys and items randomed is pretty challenging. The only downside is the size of the tools you need to find (batteries and keys) that are easily missed if you don't look VERY carefully, as well as having no on-screen indicators of how much battery you've got left etc. But i think it was inteneded to make it more ""realistic"" and the amount of screams we've all shared proves that. Great game if you're looking for something similar to amnesia co-op where one of you gets to be the monster ;)9/10 could use minor improvements in the future.			"

												Okay! So this game is fantastic. I know people compare this to Dead by Daylight, but I actually think this game is better. Are the graphics better? No. I like the scavanging aspect of it along with actually feeling haunted, not being chased down by a crazy murderer, but that's my own bias towards the paranormal...The controls do take getting used to and the controller support is♥♥♥♥♥♥ However, the atmosphere is great for people who love horror games and jump scares. The monsters are well balanced. Though sometimes Mary can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because of how fast she is, side stepping and running around obstacles (like chairs, tables, and closing doors) are your best ways of dealing with her. It does take some time, effort, and a bit of memory to remember what you have and have not checked in order to get out. Doors are difficult to open at times, but every person I've played with seems to gain their own little strategy for it. Batteries and keys are SMALL, so you much pay attention to the tiny glowing things. Remember where you have seen batteries for the times you can't pick them up. On some maps, you have to return to the beginning to get something that was locked in a safe so you can move on. Because there is no tutorial, this is a game you have to take the time to study. I had a friend be a monster while not attacking me in order to get used to things. This game is also much, much, much more fun with multiple friends. I recommend at least 1 monster and 2-3 survivors. If you can get all four, great! Things we figured out through playing that others might need some help on...1) You can open some drawers and cabinets. (I know there are pictures of an open stuff in the example images on the store page, but my friends and I assumed that they were already open. We were wrong.)2) HOLD AND DRAG/PUSH TO OPEN DOORS. It's not a ""push d and door opens"" thing. You have to manually open them.3) When playing Mary: She is slow as hell, so be prepared for that. She randomly teleports if you don't kill the survivors on time. You can sometimes get lucky and teleport right behind the survivors. Your ""energy"" is based on how much color you have on your screen; the more color, the more energy. You can manually teleport as well.4) The Lurker and the Fallen are trap based monsters. I don't entirely understand them yet, so I can't say much here.5) The Phantom is pretty straight forward. Survivors are invisible to it, but the survivors can see him. Stealth is key for the survivors here. Music starts when you've sensed them. Look around and chase them down. If you stand inside a survivor that's hiding, you auto-detect them.My friends and I checked the Wiki to figure some of this out, but most was trial and error. Highly recommend this game.			"

Posted: June 9, 2016
												Really good and fresh (at least to me) idea.I spent A LOT of time playing this game, BUT it has some downsides that will be explained later in this review.The rough idea is being a 1 vs 4 cat and mouse gameplay that's terrifying.The 4 survivors can't defend themselves with weapons, but with caution, quick reaction and coordination. Their goal is to reach the safe room which is locked down. In order to unlock it you have to find the silver key that spawned in a random location on the map. So your ultimate task is to find the silver key!There are many other keys spread on the whole map that will unlock certain rooms. So, basically you unlock more and more areas, search them for keys or similiar items and make progress until you find the holy grail: The silver key.Then you only have to get to the safe room alive.The monster obviously has to kill all the survivors. There are 4 different monsters to choose in the game at the moment. None of their playstyles are similiar.- The ""Lurker"" switches between 2 forms. In the ghost form it's setting up acoustic traps to locate the survivors positions, because it can't see any player or door (so it can't see the players progress either).The idea is to get near the noises that have been set off, switch to the physical form and hunt the little ♥♥♥♥♥ (god bless those hearts for saving our people) for a limited amount of time. It's a terrifying jump scare if a lurker pops up next to you. No cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like FNAF and most other horror games (*oooooooh snap*).- The ""Phantom"" can't see, but hear very well. If a survivor makes any kind of noise the Phantom will unveil him for a brief period of time (even through walls), depending on the noises volume and distance to the monster. In the end it just floats with a set speed through the map, which sounds boring at first glance, but becomes repetitive with the possibility to get tricked by the survivors. You have to be aware of the survivors' counter play style in tricking the Phantom with fake locations.- ""Mary"" is sobbing through the map, trying to get close to the survivors and make them look at her to gain frenzy. At max frenzy she will be able to attack and charge the enemies with force. Because of her sobbing she can teleport to random locations on the map, with restrictions of course. She's pretty much the opposite of the Phantom. SHE has to play mind games with the survivors to get close to them.- ""Fallen"" has 2 stances, too. At start she is invisible and can't see the survivors nor their progress. She is setting up stone guards to unveil the survivors. If a survivor is unveiled while she's nearby she automatically switches to her physical form and hunts down the survivors. The statues can't block areas since the survivors are able to destroy them. So there's no abusing of the ability.The very small team of 9heads tried to make the game fair, but scary to the survivors, resulting in the monsters seeming to be overpowered to new players, because of their one hit mechanics.In the end they're fine, with some slight differences in balancing from map to map.The maps are built with multiple schemes that are reusing the scheme based assets and pre-built areas for the sake of more maps. Because of the nature of each map having it's own gameplay flow this method works very well.The graphics aren't fancy, but fitting. The sound is good and athmospheric, except from those survivor death screams.Now the big downside for some people:The game has bugs. Many of them. Some very little and pretty much unnoticable, some gamebreaking.Some people experience pretty much no problems at all where others can't even run a match without insane fps drops or game crashes. This problem in most cases results in hardware, but not in outdated hardware. It's just bad luck of using hardware components that cause problems for this exact game.In the end, at least to me, I would give the game a shot, because the experience is great... if it just wasn't for the possible bugs.Pros:- Unique experience- Very good coop game- Differently flowing maps- 4 very different monsters resulting in different tactics depending from map to map- Good atmosphereCons:- Bugs- No bots (so no single player. It's recommended to play with exact 5 players for the best experience and balancing)- Low support for this game at this point of time (they're working on a new project now)- Difficult to play this game without friends because of the trend of password protected lobbies- Sometimes the community just sucksBtw: Phantom isn't op. You just suck.			"

												When it's working it's great.When they update with content, it's great.When you have someone to play with, it's great.Unfortunately, it rarely works.    There's issues with Login and DRM.   The content updates are small and occur rarely.There are clipping problems for a lot of monsters, as in, parts of the map you just can't access, making them safe havens for survivors and leading to people going AFK in these places for whatever reason.  Usually the kick from game option hasn't worked for me either to remedy this problem.The game CAN be fun - and atmospheric, but you need a LOT of patience.			"

												If you look for a reliable review, look no further, I have just the right review for you.Bought this game on sale, excited as fudge just to see the community being butthurt. Justified? Nope.When you play with decent people that have headsets, which you'll find very quick, you will have the time of your life.I am usually not into horror games, but this is just awesome. The atmosphere while you are trying to avoid the monster is terrifying and you will go crazy when you play the monster as you try to scare them with weird noises and screams via voice-chat letting your neighbours think you are a freakin' psychopath.Totally worth it.

												Good reviews, promising gameplay-videos, awesome design of game (4 good guys vs 1 enemy, all 5 are player-controlled), but you need friends to play this.Players in public hosted games usually leave very fast and don't join back (this could be caused by crashes), and hardly anyone joins public games.I recommend this to people who have 4 actively playing friends to have fun with in this kinda game, but otherwise: Don't buy it, you won't be able to play much.Once in a game (although that is tough luck playing with strangers), it's fun!Suvivors have to play together to leave the level before the monster gets them, and the game is a good scare! (no blood&gore kind of horror, the creeping kind of horror)The monster, being invincible and killing any player in one hit, does have an unfair advatage, although it does make playing together more important and more fun, and the monster could tease the players for fun.Summary: This is amazing with 4 friends and you (5 total), it sucks in a public game.

												So, after date night with the wife on Halloween(we saw Annabelle, fairly creepy) I on impulse bought this as it was A.) Seemed creepy B.) Let me play as a monster C.) Was on sale.I'm glad I did, because Damned, low budget that it surely is, is pretty much what I'd want in a multiplayer horror game. The environments are creepy, the monsters all play quite different and it's pretty easy to get spooked as one of the survivors. This is also one of those games that I think is best played with friends.Currently there are ten maps, all variations on scary locales. A few asylums, a couple of hotels, a warehouse, some sort of factory, and a restaurant(of all things). Survivor's currently have 4 characters to choose from, but really it's just an aesthetic choice. Monsters have 3 character's to choose from: The blind Phantom. The phasing Lurker.Sobbing Mary(my personal favorite).The Phantom can only see players if they make noise or it gets close enough to them, the Lurker phases in and out of reality, only able to track players by setting traps, and Mary must slowly approach while being teleported randomly, until she can let out a scream and sprint right upon her victims.Having said all of that, I do have a few issues with it:Playing as the survivor is much more challenging than playing as one of the monsters, to such a degree that picking any of the monster choices seems like a guaranteed win. The map variety also seems a little lacking. The largest issue however is will crash a little too often for my taste or require you to CTRL+ALT+DLT and end process. All in all, I'd say it's worth what it's currently priced and good solid fun.			"

												In all honesty underneath the not-so polished graphics lies a game that is well worth playing. Teamwork and communication is required of the survivors which is why I recommend this game if you have a group of friends to play it with. The game is slow paced in terms of gameplay so if you're looking for something faster this may not be the game for you, but the slowness factor does add into the fear that the survivors feel which I feel is what the main focus of a horror game should be. 10/10			"

												Invite your friends and play this awesome horror game! You’ll be playing as human or monster, total of 5 players for each session (4 Survivors and 1 monster).Four people is trapped with a monster, the survivors main objective is to find the way-out.Do you have what it takes to get all the survivors out while seeing ghostly things, hearing noises or desperately running from a monster, who’s only desire is to hunt down and kill you and your friends?The monster will be able to assume ethereal form, which to hunt the survivors, set up traps that trigger noises and events. Also assume physical form, which allows the monster to kill you, also toggle a rage mode which almost always ends with a killing spree.Sum up with: One of the most enjoyable horror multiplayer games I have ever played, surprisingly addicting if you’re in for a spooky treat with your friends.Damned is a masterpiece and worth a try and I can assure you will be screaming!

												There is absolutely no way that i can recommend this game. I regret paying the measly $5 for this during a recent steam sale - that is how broken this game is. It is officially released but plays like an early alpha game. There are a plethora of glitches that are, seemingly, very common issues. I played this game with 4 other people that i know IRL, and we could barely get a single game in without a hitch after 5-10 tries. These devs have a great game idea, but they are tanking it into the ground. On the forums, i have not found a single thread with a dev solving anyone's problems - they are all open ended support threads. I am done with this game for the time being. There is a chance that i MIGHT eventually try it out again a few months down the line.			"

								After managing to play a few games I wouldn't recommend buying it in its current state. The game is poorly optimized and seems buggy with amd graphics cards. One of the players who joined us could only play as a single monster and if he was a player his game would instantly freeze anytime he saw a monster in game. I'm also not sure you can even win the game, you can't live long enough to get very far with how long it takes to figure out what keys work with what doors. After looking at play throughs of Damned on youtube, it doesn't seem like anyone has actually completed a game of it to the end.			"

There's a lot of good ideas and cool concepts that haven't been expanded upon in any way or balanced at all for a viable, playable game. I would have expected some progress by now, but there's really nothing (outside of additional maps, which feature the same problems of size, length, and tedium as the rest).Don't buy this game, and certainly not at the current asking price.

												Damned has the potential to be a good game. Unfortunately there are some...damning...problems...heh..heh...Okay I'll get serious.Damned is a 5 player COOP game. 4 players versus 1 monster. The player's goal is to escape, while the monster's goal is to kill them. The players goal consists of running around the map looking for keys to unlock doors until you get the required items to leave through the escape(A hammar or a crowbar, and the Silver Key). The monster has to kill all the survivors before they escape. Sounds easy right? Well currently there are 3 monsters, and they are pretty balanced in my opinion. Of course, you can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and just kill everyone off the bat on certain maps, if you know what you're doing, but that's no fun. It's way better to play it smart and try to scare the players rather than just kill them. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game scary. I didn't think a multiplayer game could be scary but I was wrong. The way the monsters are designed and the atmosphere of the levels make this a very tense experiance. Sounds good right? Unfortunatly the game is buggy. It was an Early access title, but for some reason they decided it was ready for full release.The game runs at 25-60 FPS on my rig(Specs below), up and down constantly depending on where I am and what I'm looking at. It can be very distracting and take me out of the game. Sometimes the game will just lock to 30FPS and you have to restart your computer to fix it. No idea why, devolopers haven't explained it, they just gave the solution.I host most of the games with my friends because I have the better connection(105Megabit down, 20Megabit up), but that doesn't stop the game from lagging. Normally in other games when someone hosts something they don't lag locally, but the people connecting to him will. Not in this game, everybody feels it, sometimes the game will just freeze for no reason. This game runs off of 9Heads servers(They are located in Brazil), meaning you have to create an account, and log in from within the game. That means whenever something happens to their servers, you can't play the game. Now, the most damning problem my friends and I run into when trying to run this game happens before the game even starts. We all get in a lobby, select our favorite characters, select a map, start it up. Host loads in just fine, waiting for other players. The other players get to the screen that says ""Waiting for the host to start the game"" only...they haven't really loaded...they're still loading(At least I hope that's what's going on), but for some reason they show that screen and their game is frozen. They can't do anything until it finally loads. Loading times can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. We're so used to this that we routinely ask if anyone is frozen when we start the game. ""I'm good"" ""I'm good"" ""Frozen..."" ""Alright let's wait..."" When the player can finally press TAB and see the player list, they've loaded in and we can start playing.The devolopers are kind of active on the forum. They try to help people with problems but they aren't permenant solutions, problems always come back. They say they're working on an update, but don't have an ETA on when. Only ""This year"". At the time of writing this review(2/19/2015) we haven't gotten an update since November 5th, 2014. And the only planned update for 2015 is a ""new monster"" Nothing else. The devolopers are not native english speakers and are few in numbers. I feel as if game devolopment is a side project to their real life activities, there is no other excuse to the few comments and updates.If you're intersted in purchasing this game, I reccomend you have good patience, and a good group of friends. Their isn't a lot of people playing this, during sales the player count may jump but it always dies out. It's scary, it's fun, but there are just too many problems getting in the way to reccomend this to anyone. GPU: EVGA GTX 670 2GBCPU: Intel i5 2400 3.1-3.4GHzRAM: 8GB			"

												I've spent more for less, especially in terms of horror games. While this isn't perfect, it IS made by a small team, and they have done an amazing job at creating that suspenseful, horror feeling.The first time I played, It was in alpha, I spawned inside of a bathroom, walked over to the door, only to have a gas heater make a bang and start hissing as it spewed out gas, scaring the living daylights out of me, and that was only 15 seconds into the match. I tried to open the door, but it was locked, so I figured i'd look for a key.I heard this very strange eerie noise, which I later discovered was the noise of the monster when it was nearby in it's ethereal form, it gave me chills, and I had nowhere to hide but some toilet cubicals....which...having watched The Relic...I did not want to go into the toilet cubicals at all, as it pretty much means death.So I ran into a toilet cubical anyway....hid for a moment by shutting the door, and all was ok, so came back out, looked for the key to the other bathroom door, but there was that noise again, that spine chilling, hair raising noise, which I thought might be the noise of the monster being nearby, so I quickly ran back into the cubical, hastily shutting the door, and standing dead still.I then hear this wierd ""boom"" noise, like a subtle bass drop, thinking that maybe it is just ambient noise. I hope in my mind that if I turn around, there won't be a monster, so I turn around inside of the cubical.....and there it is, towering over me, staring at me with it's angry, evil, googly eyes, scaring the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and causing me to scramble to try and open the door in terror. Thankfully, before he could do anything, he disappeared back into his ethereal form...but after that, I had to quit, I had a near heart attack.It is very rare for a horror game to give me that kind of suspence. The culmination of almost dead silent ambient music and sound, with dusty atmospheric environments, lit only by subtle lighting, or narrow lighting of the player's torch, along with sound cue's to let you know when the monster is nearby, as well as objects that do something sudden, to both scare you, but let the monster know where you are (it can't see you in ethereal form)....is just downright creepy, and I like this very much.And THAT is just when you play as a human!When you play as a monster, you can have so much fun, toying with the little humans, messing with their minds, trying to catch them out, trap them and kill them, or just pop up in a toilet cubical behind them while they hide, then suddenly disappear again :PThe variety of monsters to choose from, may be limited, but it does change the gameplay dynamics, making it interesting and unpredictable for everyone.The environments are also very well done, large enough to get lost in, but well designed in every aspect, from textures and details, to the actual layout and interactivity of the environment.It costs me nearly $20 for lunch in a day, and that lasts me maybe 15mins. $20 for a game that has given me hours of enjoyment (if you like pooping yourself) isn't really that much at all.It pains me to see that gamers expect $20 games to be AAA quality with billion dollar budgets with an army of developers. I would gladly pay twice the amount, or even 3 times the amount for this game....in fact, I have, I bought my friends some copies too, because it's so damn awesome.Buy it, you won't regret it!			"

								I've never written a review quite like the one I'm about to write, and I sincerely hope it will be the last.     Game developers:  THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥NEEDS TO STOP.  I played this game a tiny bit months back on a different computer, and recall having some small problems there also...and now that I have a new computer, I'm forced to create a new account, and I apparently can't activate my ""product key"" because IT'S ALREADY ♥♥♥♥ING ACTIVATED!  I ask for a password reset, hoping this might solve the problem...but I CAN'T COPY-AND-PASTE THE NEW ♥♥♥♥ING PASSWORD INTO THE GAME'S LOGIN SCREEN.     Now, for some bizarre reason, 99% of games that we humble punters purchase on Steam, we can just install them and PLAY them, see?  But every now and then some clever♥♥♥♥♥♥of a games company decides they have to have their own product keys, their own logins, etc etc...people, VALVE HAVE WON!  They, along with Bill Gates, OWN THE WORLD!!  Please, stop this ♥♥♥♥ing madness, and let people who pay good money for your games just PLAY them, as easily as they can anyone else's.  WHY IS THIS TOO MUCH TO ASK?!?   I've looked up forums, and this game appears to have all sorts of problems.  Surely THIS one can at least be overridden by the developers, since it was their own stupid ♥♥♥♥ing choice in the first place.  HONOUR YOUR CUSTOMERS.  No, I'm not going to email you directly to solve this problem, I'm simply not gonna play this ♥♥♥♥ing game ever again until you can see fit to right this completely unneccessary problem.  In the meantime, I suggest that we loyal gamers BOYCOTT any fledgling companies who think they're big enough to pull this♥♥♥♥♥♥  If they're going to make it so darned hard, they don't deserve our support.  In any case, I'll check back in six months and see if I can play the game I paid fair-and-square for WITH MINIMUM FUSS.  Failing that, I won't be giving this game anything resembling a proper and perhaps positive review, and I certainly won't be buying another 9heads game.  I have too many games like this in my account now, and if the overwhelming majority of game developers can do the right thing by the buying public, so can the other few.   ♥♥♥♥ YOU VERY MUCH.Verdict: 0/10 (until I can actually PLAY the ♥♥♥♥ing game).

								Word of warning; Alpha is alpha. Is not even Beta. It's hardly meant to be playable, but it most certainly is.Now then; After hours on hours in this, I can only say it's absolutely fantastic for an alpha-stage game. Crashes will happen, but it is to be expected. Counting in the voice chat and scary levels, and an absolutely terrifying monster (Lurker - Phantom's hardly scary, more like annoying.), this is bound to have you both screaming and laughing. No promises, of course. You kind of have to like being scared and maybe be easy to scare to enjoy this fully. The more and more of your friends dieing around you only intensifies the experience, if you're not one of the few to die first. Knowing -you- are the primary target of the monster is enough to have you go "";_; Halp"" and hide in a wardrobe. Which, I might add, is perfectly possible. You can hide in wardrobes. But I'd recommend hiding in a proper room with an inward door, so you can push back against it. Outgoing doors, like those on wardrobes, are bound to get you killed. Anyway; This game is awesome. The devs are working on it constantly. The community is 'okay'. Worth more than what it sells for, even as Alpha. The only things negative about this game is trivial things that are there only because of the stage of the game. These issues are bound to get fixed. So that leaves only the good parts to go \o/ The amount of fun this gives is endless.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is great for playing with friends and the multiplayer experience. The monsters take inspiration from pop culture yet they have an original feel to them. The same can be said for the survivors. The game still has a few issues that needs to be addressed but that is why it is still in beta. I am pretty sure when the full game is made available this paragraph will not be needed.All in consideration, if you have friends that like to play multiplayer games then try this out.			"

												In my opinion this game is funnest when doing it with friends. The community isn't horrible but I'm not even sure if many people would be playing it now.I had gotten quite a kick out of the game while playing with friends a while back, though it seems as though the creators have left it now? It's tragic since I have some fond memories of the game even with all the bugs and glitches. I'm sure that if you really wanted to you could get the game if it was on sale. It's still good but it's definitely not worth it at max price.As of right now I would not recommend buying this until after they start working on this again (if ever.)			"

												I have recommended this game numerous times to many friends and have enjoyed many games of this. But why do I not recommend this to game to the general public? Well when I started playing, it was classed as early access. Pretty decent for early access. Very fun and was quite low on the game breaking bug spectrum. Sure there were a few crashes here and there, was poorly optimised and desyncs but it was early access. But now, the game is classed as a full release and bugs that should have been ironed out have been left it seems. Not to mention a new bug having risen its head.Keys that open doors are being swapped with keys to rooms you cannot get to before you unlock the doors before them. So you have a key that will open a kitchen, but to get to the kitchen you have to open the dining hall or pantry. But the keys have not spawned in an accessible area. This has happened a few times now  since release. We never used to have this issue but it seems to be a regular occurrence for us now. We are still getting disconnects and regular desyncs where players will see their team mates walking into walls. The once extremely regular patches have slowed down a lot and the amount of players which was never very high, has dropped hugely. Not that it matters for me as I have friends who I play with which, if you buy this is a necessity. This game is pretty crap to play with random people. Get a call going with friends and just play with them. If you don't have friends, there is such a little player base now that you will probably not find a match.TL:;DR This game should not have left early access at all as most of the alpha bugs are still present. Sure its a fun game with friends, but the bugs just ruin it completely.			"

												Damned is a 5 player horror game.  There are two playable roles in the game: the humans, and the monster.  It's a pretty great idea they have here.  As humans, you have to try and escape.  There's 4 different humans you can choose to play as, but it doesn't really matter which you choose.  You start with nothing but a flashlight and need to search for batteries, as well as keys and other things that can help you escape the monster.  Navigate the very dark buildings and try to get out quickly, because eventually you start to see and hear things in game and when you run out of batteries it's a lot harder.  As the monster, your goal is to kill all the humans.  There are currently 3 available monsters to play as: Bloody Mary, the Lurker, and the Phantom.  Each one has some advantages as well as some handicaps and they each play very differently.I will get the negatives out of the way.  This game has some pretty bad bugs that hopefully will be fixed soon.  - You can lose connection to the match for no reason (at least on your end).- The lobby might not recognize you have joined, and won't include you in the game when it is started.  You may have to back out and rejoin a few times, or have the host restart the lobby, for it to work.- Sometimes the game won't allow you to choose which human/monster you want to play, even though the lobby allows you to choose.- Every once in awhile the main menu from the start of the game, will pop up over the game while you are playing.  You can still play while it's up, but you can't exit it and after that happens when you talk in chat your name won't show up.-When you are killed, sometimes your corpse will still be standing.  Sometimes it will even walk into walls and will still let you spectate it.These bugs are very annoying, but the game is still incredibly fun.  Get a group of friends and hop in.  Some will say it's a very scary game, some will say it isn't at all.  What is and isn't scary is very subjective really and will differ for everyone.  For me personally, it has had some pretty scary moments but a lot of the time it just gets really tense.  If you're playing with friends you can have some really hilarious moments too.  The idea of this game is pretty genius and it is definitely worth picking up, though if you can get it on sale that'd be good.			"

												Friends made me throw headset on the ground and hit the wall on the other side of the room with my chair all while screaming at 2 am. 20/10 would get scared again.Seriously though, very fun to play with a game full of friends. Doubt it would keep the entertainment value if playing with randoms. Very tough for the survivors, but it is possible to win. I got it on sale for $10 but I'd say its a 15 dollar game. Lots of bugs and somewhat frustrating at times, but makes up for it with the hours of fun me and friends have had. Don't get it unless you've got a group of friends to play with.			"

												Got this as a gift from my brother during the steam sale for something interesting to do together... After playing it a little bit we felt it wasnt worth even the discounted price. The game is interesting, and seems like a cool premise. but with the bugs we ran into (not connecting, the way the game starts via a automated command prompt which gave errors causing a restart, connection issues in general.) we played for about 30-40 mins and were only able to get one game going correctly. Id really like to see this game improve and become something better, but until then, I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												I do recommend this game. BUT BEFORE YOU BUY IT do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. Its filled with bugs, you will crash A LOT. Its almost unplayable and for some of you it will be a waste of money because you will not get to play due to a bug in the game that no one knows the solution to (as well as the devs) which will have you at the main menu with a message ""servers are down for maintenance"" even though the servers are up. Devs will tell you its your fire wall/anti-virus well don't bother messing with those cause I can tell you thats not the problem. I have a friend that just bought this game and he cannot play it now because of this bug and we have checked EVERYTHING and the game just will not allow him to play. Not saying its a bad game, but for the price its not worth buying due to how broken this game is. Wait for few more updates and then buy the game, but for now don't.			"

												My friend bought a 4-pack of this game and gave a copy to me and some other friends, and I honestly feel terribly sorry for him.Before we could even get a game going, it took us about 20 minutes of trying to wrestle with the game to change the graphics and controls. Two of us crashed trying to change the options, and I even crashed myself just trying to register an account so I could play the game. After we got ingame, it became quickly apparent that this game was made purely for youtube ""Let's Players."" In terms of gameplay, the controls are very simplistic. You move around, use objects with left click, and right click activates your flashlight. The map design tries its hardest to be scary, though its ruined by the objects that are left lying about (i.e. the jack-o-lanterns). Character design looks mediocre and the movement looks very stiff. As per usual in all of these types of games, you can only sprint for 3-5 seconds, and the battery in your flashlight is limited. This forces players to try to progress through the map to try and even see anything. This leads to the next problem: The maps are incredibly confusing. You basically wander around aimlessly grabbing keys or objects hidden in sometimes VERY difficult to find locations. Most of the time these keys only open up 1 or 2 of the ~10-20 locked doors throughout the map. Your ultimate goal is to try and escape, but I don't see how thats really possible given the nature of the game.That brings me to my next point, which is the fact that the entire game hinges on the monster. The monster has the ability to kill pretty much any player at any time if he feels like it. You will almost NEVER win a game unless the monster lets you. Mary for example, can teleport around the map and moves very slowly until players get near her. When they are near her, she charges up and can then dash at incredible speed and instantly kill players. As the phantom, he can only ""see"" noise. The thing is, everything makes noise except for standing still, which leads to players just freezing up and the phantom wandering around aimlessly and occasionally accidentally killing someone. The lurker places down traps that make noise when players get near them, and then spawns himself nearby for 15 seconds. Players do have a chance to escape the lurker, though this again depends on the monster being merciful. Nothing is stopping him for respawning himself almost immediately after he disappears and chasing you down until he inevitably kills you.The game has promise, but its ruined by the fact that its poorly optimized and the gameplay is ruined in many aspects. The game crashes a LOT, and you get pitiful framerates no matter what your system specs are. The actual gameplay boils down to wandering around aimlessly finding keys and hoping to god that it actually opens up the ONE door you need to progress through the map. Can this game be fun? Sure. Can you actually win as a survivor? Sure. Can this game be scary? Sure. The odds of any of those things happening though are very slim.			"

												After having played a fair few games of this, I can pretty easily say two things about this.ONE: Do not let my thumbs up fool you, this is not a game I recommend for the weak of heart and mind. This game was released majorly unfinished, and is still very clearly meant to be in a testing phase. Frequent crashes, a command prompt opened up upon play, and frequent glitches plague this game.TWO: Do not let one fool you either, by no means is this a bad game, and has a pretty excellent concept behind it with a fair enough execution.As far as I am concerned, the largest two issues with this game are this:-Lack of lots of testing and polishing that allow this game to truly shine.-Lack of content to add variation, such as a larger list of monsters to truly vary up the gamplay.This game is very rough as it is, and could certainly do with some well-needed polish, which, thankfully, the devs are providing. However, I feel the most necessary implementation (after polish, of course) would be Steam Workshop support, allowing the devs to iron out kinks while the community works to try and make some monsters, levels, and even seperate game modes themselves.However, I still enjoy the game, and I feel that anyone with enough friends willing to play it (three at the very least, don't play public games) would find amount of enjoyment in this clever little horror game.EDIT: I am now nominating this game for the Test of Time award, because regardless of time, my friends and I have, time and time again, returned to this game. Also, the devs occasionally glance at it with a couple of bug fixes, so there are considerably fewer bugs now. Not to say there aren't any, or that this game is still even really that polished, but still.			"

												After giving the game another go, I've chosen to rescind my previous, negative review and write a newer, positive one based on my newer experiences. (I apologize to the people who rated my older review. I'm not sure if it will reset those votes or not.)This game is, put simply, fun. It's unpolished, it isn't pretty, and it's a delicate little thing prone to crashing. Not your everyday ""ctrl+shift+esc"" type crashes, I'm talking like the Hindenburg or Titanic.But when it works, it works. Sure the monsters have strategies for avoiding, and baiting. And sure there's more or less surefire ways to avoid death (Door battles with the Lurker / Mary anyone?) But it feels a little like you're under fire. ""Just remember your training and you'll be fine."" Except you won't. The Phantom will find you, the Lurker will trap you, and Mary will run you down. Your flashlight will betray you giving away your position, your sense of direction will be tested in pitch darkness, and you'll grow to hate toilets.10/10 would die again.**ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW**(I would also like to point out, I bought this game about midnight-ish my time in Eastern USA, and was trying to play it pretty late at night. There were about 10 lobbies and they were mostly overseas, which could maybe explain why the game was running so poorly. Anyway, I'm glad I gave it a second chance, the server list is very populated around more reasonable hours and the connections are noticably better.)1 out of 8 attempts succeeded in getting the game to work. ONE.First one, died early, had to spectate a box.Second through sixth attempts all crashed at various points. Usually while joining a game.Seventh attempt worked properly. I played as Mary, got a kill, but spent a little too long figuring out the controls and they escaped.Eighth attempt, crashed.Had I bought this from Gamestop, I would have already been on my way back to the store to return it.

												Starting off I would like to say that usually I tend not to gravitate towards most ""horror"" games. I was introduced to this game through a good friend, and he convinced me to purchase it. I can't begin to explain how much fun and enjoyment this game can bring when playing with a group of friends. If you ever decide to get Damned, please I encourage you to play it with friends.There really are not many Multiplayer Survival Horror games out there in todays market, but I feel like this game proves that it can be done. This game is no where near perfect, a few bugs here and there but nothing that absolutely kills the game. Some that maybe frustrating from time to time? Yes, but nothing that keeps the game from being fun with friends. Maybe it is personal preference playing it with friends, but I don't find as much enjoyment playing it online with other people. It makes it personal. Hearing your friend begining to laugh right before he jumps out at you or just taunts you around the map appearing out of the shadows.			"

												So here's the scoop, don't pay full price for this game because you'll immediately regret it and probably refund it. But if you get it on sale, you're more likely to stick with it. Probably the first 10 hours I put into this game were horrible. It crashed all the time, and when I was in game I didn't know what the heck I was doing. Now after 330+hours of this game, I can say it's one of the most fun games I've played. There are bugs with it and it rarely gets updated which is frustrating but I've met many people through this game, one of them is my best friend now. The maps don't change, the monsters don't change but every game is something different. So if you're looking for a fun horror game, get this when it's on sale.

												So. I don't often write reviews and the last one I wrote got several die hard fans of the series rather upset with me. But, all the same, here goes.Damned, at its core, is a wonderful game. Of all the ""Monster versus survivors"" games, this one has been the most enjoyable for me. I found myself thrilled with the different monster choices, as well as their mechanics. I played this with four of my friends and, honestly, it was some of the most fun I had.So...why am I NOT recommending it?Content. I'm sorry, truly, but this game has been all kinds of dead for a long time. Little issues with server connection and the main menu have plagued the game since launch and have never been fixed. I forgave that for the sake of them adding a new monster and APPEARING to be working on the game. But then it just went...quiet. I sympathize with how hard making a game is, I really do. But check the update news. The last thing they did was last year and it was updates on a map editor. Still menu issues and a few game play bugs here and there and absolutely no new monsters or anything. I fear they may have given up on the game. I don't mean that as an accusation, just a genuine fear. I WANT this game to get finished and worked on. I loved it. But I've had it uninstalled forever, for frustrations involved with trying to get the game running for everyone.So, in the end...if you can endure a lot of menu issues or, perhaps, are one of the lucky ones that bypass all those issues, it's not expensive. Get four friends together and play, it IS genuinely fun to play. But the issues and lack of updates outweigh the fun. Please, PLEASE keep working on this.			"

												*DISCLAIMER: I have not played it recently, so review may be out of date.*In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. The game is riddled with bugs and there are not many servers that actually have players in them, which is bad since the game is only multiplayer.I have only managed to play one game with four other people and the experience was actually pretty fun, but this does not happen often. The idea of the game is actually really great, but the game itself is buggy and sometimes unresponsive. The mechanic for opening and closing doors is a bit clunky as well and sometimes it can even be frustrating.If you do plan on getting this game, make sure some of your friends are getting it or have it already and get it during a sale. If your friends do not have the game it will be extremely challenging to actually play the game the way it is meant to be played.Overall, it is not a terrible game, but it suffers from a lack of a playerbase and it has a good amount of bugs.

												10/10 would die with a scream in my throat, insanity-blurred vision, and pee running down my leg again. Alternatively, 10/10 would whisper creepy nonsense to the scurrying humans while hunting them through an asylum again.Really though, it could still use some polish. Getting everyone loaded into lobbies properly needs a bit of work, the mechanic for opening doors is often frustrating (though that adds to the tension) and there's really no hand holding, but after 2 hours of play with some friends I was getting the hand of both sides and it had my pulse racing like no other game in recent memory.

												Fun while it lasted. Servers are absolutely dead so the only reliable way to play is getting 4 of your friends to play, which is unlikely given how high the price is for a game that has 1 game mode and is multiplayer exclusive. If the game is incredibly cheap for a 4 pack go for it but other than that exact scenario, stay away.			"

												I'm totally in love with the concept behind this game, and while it can be clunky and rough at times, it succeeds in being an actually scary multiplayer experience that offers a unique kind of fun you won't find elsewhere.  While this is a recommendation, there are several things I should note before you make your purchase:- $20 is quite high for the amount of content currently in the game, and updates seem to be coming rather slowly. The developers have not yet abandoned the project, but they are a small, inexperienced team. This may be better as a sale purchase if you're uncertain. - There are a high amount of technical issues in the current build. Many players report unplayable, slideshow framerates no matter how powerful their rig, though this sometimes randomly resolves itself through reinstallation or other fiddling. There are also occasional crashes that can ruin a match. I've only had one so far after several hours of play, but it's still frustrating. Thankfully, host migration is fairly seamless. - The playerbase is fairly small at the moment. While it's possible to fill up a lobby with random players, and there are generally a small handful of public servers running at any given time, you're much better off having a consistent group of friends to play this with. With all that said, I'm having a ton of fun with this game and it just comes down to the great idea and clever design behind it. The levels are all creepy, dark abandoned buildings like hospitals, asylums (lots of asylums), hotels, a factory, etc. The monsters themselves all have unique mechanics that require patience and vigilance from both the human and monster players. They're all deadly and can take out a survivor in a single blow, but have some sort of limitation on when they can attack, or how they move, or even how they see. It means that even as players become more experienced, the battle of wits and ""does he know that I know that he knows..."" mindgames make for exciting matches. Despite the competitive nature of the game, there isn't a big emphasis on the competition and it's more about having fun. The monster player has to be very very patient, naturally keeping twitchy, aggressive players out of the game. The simple requirement for the survivors to explore and find keys keeps things active and prevents extended campfests, though it can be rather difficult to coordinate an escape in a public game with all the different players grabbing different keys and not communicating about what they're unlocking. But it almost doesn't matter, because even with random strangers the tension and buildup and panic make things exciting and fun, and creates one of the most friendly communities I've encountered in a PvP game so far, mostly devoid of the usual rudeness you might expect. A shame there only tend to be a few servers at a time, because managing to keep a full lobby going from beginning to end of a match makes for a great time even with strangers who don't speak your language. I really hope the devs continue to add to this product, as the groundwork here is already a lot of fun and there are a lot of great ideas on display. I also wish this game would have caught on a little more, because the idea of a competitive game with emphasis on wits and evasion and awareness rather than just fighting each other is a sadly untapped niche for the most part that could do with more love. Even as someone who generally hates PvP games, I'm a big fan and want more.			"

												Myself and 3 other people got the 4 pack. The game is terribly optimized, and we had to alt-F4 the program at registration because the game wouldn't let us. After restarting the game, and finally being able to register, we got into a lobby, and started a game....TERRIBLY optimized, got an average of 5-10 fps, even on all low settings.

												E: This review was written a day before the July 28th update.Hello~ as of this review, I've clocked 62 hours on Damned.The reason why I'm giving this game a thumbs down will become apparent quite quick.I'm not going to give overviews, so I apologize in advance if anything sounds off to someone who knows nothing about the game just yet. Simply put, despite how much fun I have with the game, a lot of my friends DON'T have fun, and I'm going to list all of the problems here.1. The insanity system is bogus. E: This has been fixed as of July 28th, about two days after I wrote this review.Seriously. Having so many bad effects happen throughout the game is annoying, and un-needed unless you happen to be playing against Mary (because she moves slow enough to warrant them). Late in a game, survivors see things that aren't there, but still physically affect them, turning them blind, slowing them down, or making them deaf; often all at once. This seriously needs to become an optional thing, but for now, it's extremely crippling to any survivors that manage to last long enough against monsters to begin with.2. Mary's teleporting is bogus. - E: Still a problem, unfortunately.Tonight I've had a game where Mary's teleported into the same general area 5 times, sometimes right next to where she was previously, successfully edging survivors closer to their spawn point with no way to progress. This speaks for herself: Mary's teleportation mechanism is NOT random, but is more biased to teleporting into the same room despite how big a map is, and needs a system countermeasure.3. Phantom's camping is bogus. E: Still a problem, unfortunately.This one speaks for itself. Phantom needs a penalty for staying in one place (sometimes to camp a corpse or deliberately trap survivors) for too long. Otherwise, he's fine. Applies to a lesser extent to the Lurker as well.Those are the three big issues that my friends tend to have with this game. Personally, I've beat the odds and have continued playing despite these major flaws, and can still manage to have fun in the game to this day. And these problems don't even touch the plethora of other problems, such as...- Frequent client crashes- Host disconnecting from a game crashes the game- Connection issues cause duplicates of corpses to walk continuously into walls- Maps such as the factory spawning unwinnable for the survivors due to key placement- Lack of care / content / fixes from the developers (E: As of 1/30/16, it appears as if they've deleted their community forum)So with that being said, I definitely cannot recommend this game, since it's nowhere close to being worth its full $20 pricetag. Know that if you do end up buying this game, whether it's for the full price or on a sale, that you'll be paying lazy developers that are more talk and less action. If you can somehow see past that and can see a glimmer of fun trapped deep within the potential that is Damned, then I shall see you there.Oh, and don't forget. The monsters can kill you in one hit. But I don't have a problem with that. I just want to actually SEE the monster kill me instead of getting blinded before the climax. What kind of a climax is that?E: Having the ability for people to change their usernames was a bad addition, so I'm not going to be changing the recommendation of my review. The game's files are predominately client-sided and can be edited by hackers. Now the hackers in the game can change their names, and we'll never know who we're playing against anymore, so thanks a lot 9heads.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by Damned. The gameplay does get repetitive, and eventually you get tired with the constant issue of starting a game, only to have 1 or 2 people disconnect and not be able to join back.The game is fun if you have 4-5 friends to play with. When I say friends, I mean friends you can talk to and communicate with. My friends and I would have the humans all in a group call and then the monster on their own. This made the game pretty damn fun, as we could communicate.The gameplay gets pretty boring after 9-10 hours of playing. You basically run around looking for keys while avoiding the monster. Each monster has different abilities, meaning you have to change your strategy slightly depending on the type of monster. Currently, there are only 3 monsters.The Lurker - The Lurker has a physical and nonphysical form. In its non-physical form, it cannot see players and players cannot see it, but it can place traps. Traps make a loud noise, notifying The Lurker where the humans are. The Lurker can then transform into physical form (if it has enough charged up) and try and kill them.Mary - Mary moves very very slow, and Mary can see humans and humans can see Mary. Mary has the ability to teleport when charged up (also randomly teleporting if you do not for a long time). Mary also slowly gains ""Frenzy"". Frenzy mode allows Mary to run faster than survivors and kill them. To charge Frenzy, you have to get close to a survivor. The closer you are, the faster it charges up.The Phantom - This one is personally my least favorite. The survivors can see the Phantom at all times, but the Phantom cannot see the humans unless they make a noise. If a survivor begins sprinting, the Phantom will hear loud music and that survivor will be able to be seen through walls. You also can't turn your flashlight on and off when the Phantom is around. Basically, the closer you get to the Phantom, the less sound you have to make, by crouching or walking.Like I said, the gameplay is fun with friends, but over time it loses its luster and becomes very repetitive. I bought it with 4 other friends when it was only $5, and it was definitly worth it. Rarely we got to do 5 player, but 4 player is still really fun.If you can manage to find 3 or 4 friends to play it with, get it on sale. The bugs are pretty irritating, mostly the main menu bugs that require me to verify the integrity of game cache every 30 minutes. But the bugs are also tolerable because the gameplay has its ups for a decent amount of play time.			"

												TL;DR giant bugfest and lazy development team.I started playing this game near initial launch, around when the phantom was new. I had recommended this game in person when in early access however since it is now a ""complete game"" I cannot reccomend it.The game is still unpolished and is missing a lot, updates will only come out every 6 months as the devs feel they have completed this game, also they are talking about making a Damned 2 so literally just hold out for if that ever happens.Aside from that, yes the game can be fun if you have a monster who likes to scare people instead of be boring and just kill you, as with all games there are players who have played it so much that they have being a survivor down to a science, and some people who are so good at killing as a monster that it makes the game not fun sometimes.

								I played this game last night and it was fun as hell.  What's better than grabbing 4 friends and scarying the crap out of each other??  Nothing makes me scream and gets my heart racing better than this game.   There is ""in game chat"" so you can add your own creepy voice for the other players to hear in case you are playing with people that are not on your Teamspeak.  Definitly worth the download.  Definitly worth the time and the money.  It's fun to be the survivor and try to escape and it's also fun to be the moster and try to kill everyone.  I give this game two thumbs up and don't think I'll ever get bored of it.			"

												This game could have been really interesting however after a couple of games I have to say its utterly boring.  After you get over the initial scares there isn't a huge amount to keep you coming back.  I don't mind the graphics and I can handle the dark levels.  When I first played the game opening the doors while a beast was chasing me led to semi squirts of urine pumping down my trouser legs but after a few games it just becomes frustrating rather than terrifying.  I find that the monsters are overpowered and tend to camp dead  bodies (which is the only place you will find certain keys).  The levels are not large enough to really run away or hide in, making it easy for the overpowered monster to find you.  Maybe if they release a sequel it could be good but this game in its current format needs work.			"

												This is a pretty under-appreciated multiplayer experience.  You start with up to four survivors and one ""Ghost"" sort of character, dependant upon the number of players you've brought into the game (2-5 players, one of them playing the monstery threat).  The object of the game for the survivors is to find all the keys and tools they need to pry the boards off of an exit door, unlock it, and leave - which is not easily done.  The goal of the ghost player is, of course, to make sure no one escapes alive.The game has a pretty nice ingame chat system that works into the game.  Some ghosts can hear you when they're near, some ghosts can simply hear you chatting - and the ghost itself can use a built-in voice gimmick that lets them make their voice deeper or higher for creepy effect - this is especially good in multiplayer matches where you want to add an extra element of tension, and is particularly fun when (as the ghost) you manage to be creepy enough to make someone panic.All of the game's baddies play differently.  It's not a difficult game to get to know, and playing around with the ghosts will allow you to uncover how they function pretty swiftly.  This is knowledge that survivor players may or may not have - and not knowing how the enemy ghost functions can be particularly problematic for new players, as they may not know, for example, that the phantom cannot see you until you make noise.If you're a fan of horror games, and you're looking for a fine co-op experience with up to 4 of your friends, this game is a recommended purchase.

												The first question I ask of you is: do you have friends? If no, then stop right here. You don't need to read anymore. If yes, then the next question is: do you value their friendship? If no, then doh, you rebel, you. If yes, then my very last question is this: do you want to keep them? This game is absolutely terrifying and clearly, is best played with strangers.No, no. I kid... definitely play this game with your friends. Strangers might end up scaring you more. Beg for their mercy if they're playing as one of the four monsters. Beg them to spare you and leave you alone - ""take the other person instead!"". This is all you can do in Damned. Loyalties will be tested and friendships strained. Expect a few harsh words to come your way from someone whom you once cherised.Can you escape the hellish halls and paths that the cursed walk upon? With just a flashlight and a weak battery, are you strong enough to pervail and, ultimately, survive? If yes.... your adventure awaits...---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Mary, oh Mary...+ Great game to play with both friends, strangers, and AI's+ Monsters have been updated (Mary is absolutely terrifying now)+ Simple horror game with one objective: escape the house. Very straightforward yet satisfyingly fun+ Sound effects and music play a very important role in this game: they serve to scare you witless+ Honestly one of the most fulfilling horror games that I have played in a very long time; true jump scares are in store for you....Cons- Developer's are not as active as one would like them to be- Some elements are hard to interact with. Maybe it's just my game, but it's difficult to pick up items at times. Furthermore, it can be difficult to open things (very easy to just accidently close something you mean to open)---------------------------------------------------------Damned is definitely one of the best horror games that you could possibly ask for and play with friends. It is unique and refreshing, something that is hard to find within this genre. Your friendship will either strengthen or weaken with this game, so put it through the ultimate test. Can it survive a test from the damned?Overall7/10			"

												Fun game, if you and your friends can get passed the crashes and bugged out lobby. Changing settings crashes, sometimes  when the lobby starts someone will crash. You will find you spend more time trying to get a game running with your 5 friends rather than playing. Mouse sensitivity cannot be fine tuned and sucks for us low FPS players. Lowering the sensivity also lowers the menu cursor speed to extremely low levels.Gameplay wise it was fun, but playing with more lives seems broken.

												This game is a great game to play with friends.  It is very fun being a monster, moreso when you mess with the survivors rather than trying to kill them every chance you get.  Playing as a survivor will get your heart racing and wake your roomates.  The ambiance adds a serious chill to the air as you desperately look for items to aid in the escape, all the while being on your toes looking out for the monster.  Swinging your mouse to open doors and cabinets like the Penumbra games gives you more control, and more chances to make mistakes trying to slam doors on chasing monsters.  Sounds like a game to give a whirl right?Not so fast.You might want to rethink that purchase.  This game is absolutely loaded with problems, mainly with nuances in the design and the framework of the game itself.  Right off the bat, this game is written in Python, meaning you will have to install Python first, however Damned will install Python for you.  After installation you may have to restart your computer to fix any initial problems you run into.  Restarting a machine to get a video game to work is unacceptable in this day and age.  This game is not optimized very well.  High shadows, lighting, or AA will tax some machines more than it should with unremarkable differences in the quality of the graphics.  Connection issues can be spontaneous, and freezing can at some times be common.  This game has moods.  One day it will work relatively fine, the next it won't.  Hope you like verifying your game files, because you will be doing that a lot with this game, and you will almost always find at least one file missing.  Even after reacquiring that missing file your game may still not work properly.  It's not uncommon to spend more time than should be necessary just to get everyone to join the game proper.This game has horrible balancing issues.  The monsters are quite powerful, with some maps making it just downright impossible to win as survivors.  There are no limits to setting traps as the monsters, and there are loads of things that can be trapped.  Many maps have narrow corridors with overhanging lights that can be trapped and impossible to avoid.  Survivors also have no way of knowing what is trapped without springing it.  In order for the survivors to win, they must find the silver key, hammer/crowbar, and the actual escape door, all while avoiding the monster.  The key and tools however are usually behind some locked door which requires some other key to open.  Of course there is no indication of what keys open what, with some levels having many locked doors and you will find yourself running back and forth looking in every nook and cranny for every key you can find and testing them on many doors until you can open one.  Insanity, the condition set upon survivors as the game drags on, is designed to keep survivors moving, but uses cheap jump scares and annoying hands to do the job.  Also darkens the screen or flickers the flashlight sometimes which is actually nice.  The maps are dreary, abandoned, gritty, dark places, a staple of horror.  But they can also be confusing and tedious, especially when trying to find that one key to open that one door.  Of the 11 maps, 3 are in an asylum.  Sometimes items may glitch out and cant be picked up, or cabinet doors that's shouldn't be locked won't open.  There are also jack-o-lanterns all over the place.  Is this a halloween or horror game?Even after all this, I would still recommend the game if not for one thing:  The asking price.  $20 USD is highway robbery for a game in as bad a state as this.  Maybe the developers believe they put in effort worthy of selling for $20.  I don't see it.Buy this game?  No.  Sit on it.			"

												This game seems awesome, and is a lot of fun when it actually works. Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs, and often downright unplayable.Often on launch you can't actually click anything, and when joining servers (or loading back into a lobby after a game) you may not actually load in. Both of these bugs require restarting the game until you get lucky and it works. There are bugs during gameplay as well; several times my friends and I have encountered keys simply floating in the air but they can't be grabbed.I'm amazed this game is considered ""launched"". It's the quality I expect from a beta or Early Access game.			"

								As of October 15, 2013:Fun game when it actually works.  Very frustrating 90% of the time, however.Here's why:1) 50% chance of the game crashing upon loading into a server.2) It's like winning the lottery if you and a friend connect without one of you crashing.3) Everytime you crash, you must re-enter your username and password (very annoying).4) All maps have a chance of keys not spawning properly which makes it impossible for survivors to win.5) Asylum map is currently bugged and unbeatable as survivors.6) If the monster goes afk, the game isn't challanging.7) If a survivor goes afk with a key in his inventory, the rest of the survivors are ♥♥♥♥ed until the monster kills him (there's no votekick either).8) If the host ragequits in the middle of the game, everyone gets kicked.I'll update this review if and when the game gets fixed.

I looked into each and every forum page  related to the subject on how to fix it and lets see... I manually changed my resolution for the game, Repaired Python 8 times, Installed 3 different types of Python to see if it would work, uninstalled and reinstalled it 3 times, tried damned.reset.bat, and varified my game cache so many times that i lost count. I even reset my router, because someone said it would help. Did it?! NO.  0/10 For not even being able to play the damn thing.			"

												I've played this game on and off since about the summer of 2014 when it was early access. It was a buggy, unoptimized mess. It could barely be played despite the lack of graphics and...really, anything in the game. It would crash constantly on the simplest things. It is now the summer of 2015, and on first loadup I found that not much has changed. Among the multiple bugs I encountered, one was that I couldn't reach my graphics panel without minimizing, then shrinking the window. The moust simply would not move over on the window, it became locked in place. Then when I clicked on the graphics options, the game crashed.I reloaded the game. Crashed before it started.I reloaded the game again. It loaded! I started up a test game to see how it would run, and it finally runs well! So yay for optimization! Then I joined a real game and it crashed on startup.2/10 due to unplayability. If I could actually play it it would easily be an 8/10. I will edit this review if they ever fix these bugs.			"

												A rare, scarcely attempted genre that seems difficult at first sight has been greatly achieved by 9Heads Game Studios. Damned is frightening and succeeds bringing chills up your spine with great atmosphere and fitting design choices. It suffers from performance issues and a few level design related bugs, but none of that is enough to keep you away from the game. The will to survive and outsmart dangerous anomalies is present and eventually will fill your time with loads of fun and scares that are best shared with friends.Video review:

Early Access Review
								I would love to recommend this game, but I cannot. It has a brilliant premise, and is very creepy with it's stalking monsters and malicious spirits. But it has several catastrophic problems that render it next to unplayable. It is incredibly laggy (and not to do with my connection, which is ultra-fast on all other things I do) and suffers from FPS stuttering to quite a bad degree. Sometimes when survivors die a copy of them stays around, walking endlessly on the air until they are killed as well, leaving two corpses. It has other weird, glitchy bugs like this and I find it difficult to want to play combined with the lag and framerate crawl. It needs a lot of work, to clean up the bugs and made it a smoother game. I wouldn't recommend it until those bugs are ironed out and the game runs smoothly. I give it a 3 out of 10.			"

												Got it through Humble Bundle, so it was cheap as dirt, but even dirt can be too expensive at times.The game is horribly optimized, as it FPS-lagged like hell for me and the random people I was playing with. Moving the camera with the mouse was unbearably laggy and, without any better words to describe it, 'twitchy'. This would lead to deaths and getting stuck in spectator mode, which in turn bugged out only allowing watching the game from the death camera of another player.From what I understand it's basically an item-finding game, where you walk around a map looking for very small items that you can use to progress to the end of the level. Even without the monster to harrass you all the time, it's very hard, tedious and sadly also very boring. The premise wears out very quick, as it's basically just another Slender clone with new monsters and a multiplayer mode built on top.In the small amount of time I played the game I got it to crash 6 times, mostly when joining a server and getting stuck in the ""Waiting for host to start the game"" screen.I can't see anyone paying 20€ (or actually paying any sort of money) for this in its current state, so if you're interested, get it now while it's on Humble Bundle for the average price of the pack. Or, much rather, don't. It's not worth it.			"

								Well my first opnion when loading up this game was what you would expect from a early release ... But after playing for a while i have to say for £5.99 Its by far one of the most scary PC games i have played ... One momment your walking along looking around for keys the next your running / hideing from the Lurker ! I think the scare/horror factor comes from knowing the Lurker (Enemy) is controlled by a actual person there for you know that they will be even more unexpected ... It has a few gltiches here and there but as i said its a early release and i have to say im impressed :) 4/5 ... if u like horror and a horrible atmosphere and its kind of like Amnesia but with multiplayer then you need to buy this game !Thanks For Reading hope to see you in there			"

								This game is in its early beta state, so I'm gonna write a review based on that.First of all, keeping in mind that it is an early beta, the game is simply amazing. The main idea of the game is very original, and I've had some heart attacks playing the game, yes, it does scare you ;). To think that the game is an early beta ( sorry for so much early beta early beta :p ) and it scares is something that makes me think that the game has potential, yet the game is buggy, since beta bla bla and the performance is rather poor. But that is something that can be fixed! :)The maps are also nice, the only thing I don't really like about them are the exits, you reach one room and ta-da! you've won. You could die in that room also irl, I'd make something better like getting out of the building or whatever, with a little cutscene. BUT AGAIN! it's an early beta, what has to come will come.In conlusion, the game is good, has potential to become an awesome game, and the main idea of the game already works.			"

								Update: So I finally got to play. The gamplay seems alright but a lot of the map design just doesn't work with certain monsters and can lead to some incredibly boring game sessions. I've only really seen mary as my friends refuse to play phantom and the one time I played against a lurker I died instantly by opening a door... then the game crashed so I haven't figured out how the lurker works yet.I'd say it's ok but there are better things to spend your money on.Old review:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATETook me over half an hour to actually play the game. (went into options to change to full screen, button to get out of options and resolution had been cut off, spend a while trying to fix and give up, enter friends lobby and game crashes, tells me im already logged in, exit steam, log back in, won't open lobby or let me click any buttons, exit,  tells be i'm already logged in... eventually get into a game and it crashes the first time I log in. My compter should be able to play this game fine (it's better than at least on of my friends computer and they can play).I've played alphas that work much better than this. Be warned that this is not (in my experience at least) a playble game.My friends seem to like the gameplay (something I have yet to experience) so maybe this will be good when the game is finished.

												I really, really want to like this game and recommend it, but Damned has a range of bugs and glitches between a 7/15fps lock, monster glitches, other performance issues even on high-end PCs. The development of this game has been far too slow with updates not happening for months, and a promise to fix performance issues in 2014 but still hasn't been fixed as of 2016. The community has pretty much completely disappeared, so unless you're lucky and find an open server or have friends to play with you won't be getting very much game play out of this. I only decided to write this review because of how awful the performance bug is. I was originally running about 25fps, not good because my computer isn't great, but playable. Today I get on and I'm locked on 7fps. No updates since the last time I played was a week ago, Now in order to play with my friends I have to go through some annoying methods to try and unlock the fps. Uninstalling, restarting PC, reinstalling, adjusting settings both in an out of the game, I really enjoy the game when it runs well and when my friends play, but dealing with the bugs and stuff is incredibly annoying, and requires a ton of patience. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game to anyone for the price it is. If it ends up on sale and your friends have it, it may be worth the try. Maybe.Edit: After doing all the stuff to reset the framerate I now run 60fps, so my frames have been consistantly dropping.			"

												Very interesting horror game. Variety of monsters as well as maps and here isn't any sexism or racism! It's realistic by the way you die immediately when the monster hits you and everything has a balance. Being in the dark for too long makes you halluconate. I for one have experienced this one game when my flashlight immediately run out of power and everyone stole all the batteries. I saw faces but heard a lot more things like: grandfather clocks, flashlights being flipped on and off, laughing and much more. It brings out the fears in people when makes it such a good game for any people wanting to play a horror game WITH friends.			"

If not, don't waste your time. -Its glitchy as hell meaning that one key you need? yeah its under a sofa in a locked room that unlocks that door anyways.-If you pick ""random map"" selection you play the same 3 maps. If you leave that lobby and join another who has it set to random, again, same 3 maps right away.-Lobbies are pretty much non existent. there's always like 3, and if theres more they are all private for friends.-The ""ghosts"" or whatever they are called are kinda lame. The scare factor is 0.-If you have Insanity turned on, Garry's Mod looking heads flash on the screen.All in all it's just, bad. Again, it HAD potential to be a great game but fails to deliver.			"

								This game has great potential, if you have played the amnesia games this may be easier for you and recommended for those who like to play a horror game with your friends. It is an alpha so it is a bit buggy but nothing that the devs can not fix.  Also the more people who buy the game the more people will play and the faster you can play the game so buy it...now			"

								Really fun MULTIPLAYER horror game. There aren't that many multiplayer horror games, specially ones that are as fun as this.Think of it as Slenderman multiplayer combined with Amnesia the Dark descent.As a survivor you try to find keys to unlock different doors in the particular map, with the goal of eventually escaping. It's a group effort and when a player dies he/she drops the collected keys that someone has to grab again.As the monster you try to find and kill the survivors. There are several different monsters which all have they advantages and disadvantages. The monster is limited to what he can see, so it is pretty balanced in that sense.It is just fun to play this with friends and scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them or be scared by a friend.			"

								A unique and fun horror game. Play as the monster and scare the crap out of other gamers/your friends, or play as the survivor and be scared the crap out of as a Lurker spawns in front of you, a Phantom glides by you, or you start to hear the faint cries of Bloody Mary. This game, although buggy (it's still in development), is a fun one that I keep coming back to you. It's simple but effective horror, and without all the disgusting gore and themes of Silent Hill or the like.TL;DR If you like BEING SCARED or SCARING OTHER PEOPLE, buy this game!			"

Monster system is new in horror games but works fine, devs can and should polish it a bit and ad some new types. To be player its pretty hard, you have to find keys to progress around the map and if you dont make any progress, game will mess with you.

												This review is 9 months after my original one. To my surprise, little to nothing in this game is fixed, and in fact seems worse than before. 9 times out of 10, you can't just join a game. Instead, you'll crash and burn! Over and over again! The login system is still as useless as ever, and is just a waste of time. Useless DRM.Like I mentioned in my last review, unbalanced monster mechanics, locked to 30fps. Although, they recently fixed the frame-drops and general terribleness so that's a plus. Still not worth the $15 price tag. Get it on sale or don't get it at all and save yourself the frusturation of restarting the game constantly (and I mean constantly).This game being Early Access STILL does not let it get away with being near unplayable and broken. They've had almost a year to fix these issues, but instead of fix things they add more 'features' onto the game.Side-Note: Even if you don't crash, your friends sure can! Which means you have to restart the entire lobby just to play, and sometimes the entire game. It's better to just restart your game after every round.That's not to say this game doesn't have potential, it really does, but in its current form its awful. Steam really needs more quality control.EDIT: As of right now, apparently boards only go away for some people. So some people can't finish the game but others can walk through them. Good job!			"

								Yes, I know it may not be the best looking game but honestly you guys...its so much fun. Its you and 4 of your friends (or strangers), one is the monster and 4 are the humans. humans run around finding keys to unlock doors to get to the safe zone. The monster has one goal, to kill all the player before they reach the safe zone. But the monster has 2 forms. Solid & Ghost. Solid for has a time limit, and ghost helps you move faster (but you cant see other players in ghost form)...""How do you know where the other players are at if you cant run around in solid for the whole time?"" there are traps around each map that you can set and when the humans walk by them they set them off.This is really a game you have to get & play in order to like it. :)			"

												Its an game that with some time and money is going to be one hell of a game,First of the idea of an Human controlled monster is absolutely epic, when in your every horror game ever, you know what the monster is and how it is coded, to what it reacts to, in here its different, you can know the mechanics of the monsters like one review suggested, but the human aspect of how the person plays the monster is different.I scared the crap out of my friends by playing very unpredictable, ie; they saw me and knew i would do some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i didnt, i just remembered the exact spot where they were and surprised them from a different direction, one of the post's suggested that you know what to do with each monster, this is the part where you come along, you can kill the survivers sometimes easily, but hey, whats the fun in that when you can do it so unpredictable causing jumpscares.Youre the monster, You decide what you do, and how you are going to do it.That was mostly for one of the earlier review's.All in all the game is not complete yet, with alot of FPS problems, Login problems, Connection problems, but i can forgive those, for this one will be a gem once it's edges have been smoothed.For now it has also problems with the maps being too similar, so there is not a large enough map creator implemented in the game, so it gets abit repeatitive, i wish they will add a bigger map generator system at some point, and would not hurt to have a few more monsters, 2/3 of the current ones im loving, 1 of them is not so much of a spooky one but more like ''i see it, i avoid it''..But as this is an indie game id give this an rating of 10/10 in indie'scompared to big studio games id give this one a 6/10if the changes and fixes i suggested will be implemented its gonna be atleast a 8/10			"

												I wish I could play this one more, it's a blast with friends.You know what, I'll put it out there for anyone looking... It's not worth the price. It's a bit steep and this game is a bit buggy at times. It used to be so unbareable before, but that has been fixed. You know what, despite all the terrible problems my friends and I had, from not being able to connect to losing connection in about once every three or four games, we still played the damn game. Why? It's damn good, pun intended. There is many horror games out there with the enemies controllable. Typically, they stop feeling like horror games and more like competitive games. This one? It did a fantastic job keeping the game feel like a horror game. Though I myself only got scared only so few often (the only game that really consistently got me was Fatal Frame tbh), my friends would regularly scream in the headset. You have no idea how enjoyable and satisfying it is when you're the one causing that. So not only is it fun to be survivors, it's fun to be monsters. However, maybe not at first. The thing is, this game has a very steep learning curve, all from trial and erroring and random google search. The thing is, this game doesn't tell you a whole lot. You kinda just dive in and figure it out. Once you get over that hurdle, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic experience. The variety of monsters is great, all with different rules and gameplay mechanics that makes the game feel fresh for everyone. Some requires you to be sneaky, some requires you to be aggressive, some requires you to just be lucky. They're all fun to play for different reasons, some more than others.The human players have a simple goal of to simply progress. The levels change a bit, forcing players to look all over for keys and the likes. They have no way to fight the creatures for the most parts other than understanding some creatures require you to hide or else they can activate their attack by looking at you for too long. The human players really do feel like they're just trying to survive. The graphics, they're below mediocre. Goods news is that it's so dark, you'll rarely notice how bad they are. The atmosphere, the lighting, it all makes up for it all in my opinion. I'm not going to lie, I cannot stand some old 3D games, I am only human. I cannot even play PSOne games anymore because of my new set of standards. However, this game doesn't trigger any sore eyes. It is set up just fine. There is no single player, sadly, and online is pretty dead. Get this game on sale, get your friends on board, and have the time of your life. It has a four pack, use it. 8/10 (I give this score out a lot)Pros-Good gameplay, not too complexed and your goal is typically easy to figure outGreat atmosphere, feels like a true horror gameVariety of monsters, level resets that are always different, this isn't like L4D where it's always the same and you just speed run.Cons-It does feel pretty old sometimes. Definitely hope the developer makes a good sequel someday.Graphics are far from pretty, but you will not notice them too often with the lightingGame has its share of bugsLearning curve, it's obnoxious.The price, jesus christ... wait for a sale.

												Game doesn't tell you what you can do, how you can do it and the framerate is god-awful (locked at 15fps for some reason on a GeForce 660 and Quad core AMD).The game should lock down monster type to level, because some are blatantly overpowered for it.It doesn't tell you that you can open doors, and that you need to hold the left mouse button to drag and open the door.It doesn't tell you that you need to look at pumpkins to recharge, as a monster.The NAT traversal doesn't happen, and when a game is up and running, there can be an issue where your framerate drops to 1fps and freezes, unless the host quits.It's just buggy, I want to like it, the ghost mechanics kinda work but the people mechanics do not work, sprinting is a 'burst' type of thing and the controls are confusing and do not apply to every monster and it isn't clear what traits each monster has (place traps? teleport?).Needs serious repair and rebuild.

Recomended only for horror fans! Read my rating!This game is gona be good one day... but now (04.05.2015) it's fustrating sometimes how many bug or error in it! The game in current state not more than a nice attempt to become what the game wanted to!There are a lot of bug (network errors, character bugs, even the moving is not smooth)in this game what it needs to be fix! But If the developers fix these the game will be much better I'm waiting for this because, this game has so much potential! I'm cheering for the developers to fix and put new content to the game asap. I know it's hard because I heard only few people working on this project. But I'm hopeing.. cuz I'm a big fan of the game types of like this!Negative:- repetitive models on the maps- lot of fustrating bug (loading & network errors, in game graphics bugs, characters bugs)- bad implementing- game graphics- random laggs and FPS drops- tearing graphics- control isuess- repetitive gameplay- no gamepad support- the lack of HUD- primitive user interface- wrong choice of in game font type!- game mechanich and balance- it feels like a unfinished Alpha game! - One of that games that try to deliver on their promises.(little success)- PricePositive:- interesting concept & idea- good music & audio- nice effects- cozy environment			"

												After all this time it's still unplayable for me. This game is horribly optimized and full of bugs. I tried every fix available and still the game is running very badly. It is such a fun concept and I would have probably loved it... If it actually was playable. The best I got was 3 minutes in-game, 5 FPS, 300 ping, glitching characters and then a random crash.I've got a good machine here, so it's not that.I hope they'll fix these issues, otherwise this was just a big waste of money.If they do, I'll update this review. But by the looks of it... it's not going to happen.			"

												It doesn't deliever what the pricetag suggests. Hell i was even surprised when i noticed it wasn't in alpha or beta, it just feels like an unfinished game overall.And why? Well alot of problems to even get started with a game. Not very fun to play a game when you are close to giving it up. And when you finally get into the game it just isn't very entertaining. Close to no gameplay value, you just search for keys.Expect something like a below average horror mod for Half Life 2, just that it costs 20 euro.I will admit i got scared a few times when i didn't know what to expect, but i can't see how this game is supposed to keep you playing it.

												I wainted a year to play this game! And IT SUCKS!Overated.Not worth the $19.99 price tag. Grab it on sale (which i did after waiting for almost a year because it never goes on sale)  the graphics arent the best. You have to register to play.  Gameplay is okay but not all that scary. Basically you run around trying to find keys while a monster hunts you. Being a monster requires a lot of stratagy. setting traps and timing your exposure. I thought being a monster would be more fun but it really is boring. some games can last over 45 minutes.  The audio is very bad too. If you want to play a game like this find the GMOD version.if you really want it, get it while its cheap,Not recomended.			"

												Out of Pumpkins to Skeletons, this game is about as scary as a kid draped in his mother's white tablecloth because he couldn't run fast enough to the nearest Rite Aid for a Halloween costume. It isn't worth $$$, given it has the entertainment value of a gum wrapper and looks like the white MJ. The only joy I find out of it is laughing at the horrified reactions of the players as I swoop in for the kill playing as the monster. GG			"

												Incredibly buggy. The game freezes up on changing the options. It freezes on registering online. It doesn't just freeze itself, it also manages to make everything else on your computer freeze too so the only solution is to restart your computer. Also the UI is terrible because instead of buttons, they use text for buttons so it's much harder than it should be to select what you want.			"

												Damned, quite literally, is what you get when you take the concept of Evolve and make it pure Survival Horror. Everything is randomized, so no two games will be the same. The atmosphere of the game alone is enough to get your heart pounding (Assuming you have your gamma setting where it should be), and the Monsters available at the moment are scary. When I say Scary, I mean it. One Jump scares, another paces around 'blindly', and the other Stalks you with traps. Not only is this game scary, but it is a blast to play with friends (So much Trolling and purposeful scares without wanting to kill them yet). To think that this game is in Beta, it makes me anticipate what more they could add to such an already great game. Personally, I love it, and I recommend it to everyone. Just be warned when I say this is a great Horror game. If you do not like horror, don't get it. The biggest downside i see is that it is online only, but that is the premise of the game.			"

												Possibly one of the worst games I have ever played. I got it as a gift and feel sorry for the person who paid for this poorly deisgned and unoptimised ALPHA. Beacuse that's really what it is. Do not buy this game! The main screen had a 5 second lag from my mouse making it horribly hard to click anything, it accessed my microphone (Without mentioning this in game anywhere - it might in the description but still that is incredibly sketchy IMO!) and was apparently on push to talk but it wasn't. It also installs python on your machine and runs through that (probably explains why it's so buggy and runs like a snail)			"

												I start with the biggest problem with this game, and the reason of the ""not recommended"" stamp.It's the price. I can't believe how is that possible this game is 20€ without sale.  There are AAA games with lower price, and even indie games what are better made than this. You can't compare this game to them. The realistic price would be ""free"" , but keeping in mind this is a little indie developer team and needs money, I say 3-4€ at most. It doesn't worth more. Well, Steam keeps it at sale nowadays, but even on 66% it's a bit overpriced IMO, and the sale is just a bait.Now let's talk about the actual gameplay.Pros:-The concept is good.-The atmosphere is spooky (at least in the first few hours).-The three monsters are different, they are well made. -Some interesting map.-There's  big potential in this game, if the developers won't abandon it. -And the biggest pro of this game is that, it's very fun to play with friends...Cons:-... but without them it can be horrible, because it can easily lose the ""fun factor"". -As I said, after a few hours it is just not scary., you get used to it.-It's a bit unbalanced, if you don't learn fully how the monsters work. -Very, very unoptimized. I mean the graphics are bad, the maps are small, and the fps is horrible. Great combo.-As a survivor all you do is searching for keys, and opening doors. That's it. Of course you run from  the monster, and hide, but to progress you only need to search, search, search... -Opening doors, closets, drawers is ridicoulusly bad. You can fight 10-20 seconds with a simple door to open it.  Of course you can learn  to open them faster, but maybe it should be more important to make this usable, in a   game where half of the gameplay is opening doors... -There are a lot of bugs. I mean a bug can appear anywhere. Sometimes the server just freezes. Or the game runs with 1 FPS,   or you can't load the map.  Or the chat doesn't work. Or you can't login. Or you can't click on anything in the menu. Anything   that can happen,  in this game will hapen. (Murphy's law?)- The maps are repetitive. You can even mix up maps, because some part of them are just copy pasted from  an other map. They are not varied, they are boring.  Like there's a room full of  tables... then a room full of chairs... then a             room full of closets.. etc. (but as i said in the pros there are a few with good theme, and atmosphere)-The whole game feels amateurish. For 3-4€ I would say it's okay. But for 20€ it's just a giant NOPE. So when I suggest buying it?- If you like scary games, and you have friends to play with.- When it's on sale and it's price is just a  few € , or is in a pack with other games. "

												This game's features actively work against itself.It's trying to be a horror game, but it's obtuse method of hiding the keys actively works to thwart any attempt at generating horror.  What it becomes is an exercise in Schadenfreude as one friend gleefully kills the rest while no progress is made.  The ""Haunts"" are nothing more than tedious time-wasters that give an advantage to the already advantaged monster player. End of the day, this is a horror game that fails to scare, and barely manages to be a game.  Do not buy.			"

Of the past 5 hours since re-installing this game last week, I've played maybe 3 matches. Much earlier in the lifecycle of this game, the game was relatively stable and showed great promise. Today my 4 friends and I spent 2 hours trying to login, trying to make a game, trying to join a game, and attempting to force close the game because it crashed hard.In the end, it was better and the idea shows promise, but as of this review it is not worth the money until they fix these horrible stability issues.

												Overall this game is easily fun and scary. the music makes it rather scary as some monsters have cues that randomnly play if they get nearby. it's helpful to avoid a small run but it also makes you panic and forget about what you were doing in the first place. the only major drawback in my opinion is the new insanity system they added. the game is pretty difficult as it is but the way insanity messes with you can seriously hamper or completely stop progress of the 4 humans and it seems to way to beneficial to the monster8.8/10			"

												Fun with friends but the amount of bugs and glitches makes this a horrible mess of a game that only shines in a few moments.The premise is easy, you are dropped in a small map and you are either a ""survivor"" or a ""monster"" with the choice between three different monsters each with their own powers and personalities. However before this can be done you have to register??? for python some reason even though this game plays through steam. Sometimes this results in a crash and makes your game freeze and you have to use taskmanager to close it. restart... Now you probably want to fiddle with the graphical options as the game look and runs terrible. turning down the visual options helps getting the FPS from 8 to 25 easily...this game looks like it was made in unity like all the easy-to-make-horror-games of the last few years. However changing the graphical options makes the game hate you and freezes again, open task manager and close the game again. Now we get to join a room and this is where the fun begins. Because it's ALWAYS a gamble if you wil connect correctly. Sometimes the game joins a room but places you in a kind of limbo that shows no other players and doesn't allow you to start a game in any way, shape or form. the other kind is where it freezes upon start, open task manager bla bla bla...This game has a good concept and is really fun when it works however before you even get it to work you're already half an hour further and that is just not acceptable nowaday. If you want a good time with friends buy it on sale as a four-pack to have some laughs if you have the patience to get it all working. "

												Is your PC too slow to run Dead By Daylight?Well you've come to the right place.This game involves 4 survivors pinned up against one of the four monsters:-Mary (Teleports and goes on a ""frenzy"" that allows her to kill those close to her)-Phantom (Can't see you unless you're running or close to it)-Lurker (Is invisible to survivors, and traps are invisible to him, his attacks are based on sounds made by traps)-Fallen (Becomes visible once 10 traps are set and will destroy everything)To win as the survivors you must collect keys to open doors in order to look for the items required to escape.  In order to escape you must find both a silver key and a crowbar/hammer.  Once you find these items you can break open the exit door and have everyone escapeThe Game is very balanced in my opinion, a very good monster can kill all survivors, and a well organized team can escape with some effort.The game isn't completely dead, but I do reccomend having at least one friend buy it as well as it can make for much more fun experiences, and the game is pretty low on players.TLDR: It's an older version of Dead By Daylight with different mechanics and lower graphics.  It's a great game, and I'd easily give it a 9/10.			"

												2/10good concept but the negatives weigh out the positives by a ton.positives are that it is a good concept, good idea, and the monster ideas are a good touch.The negatives far outweigh those though.----Let's start with the fact that I could not even sign in.  Every single time I boot the game up I have to restart the entire game (exit the game completely) at least 3-4 times.  Half the time when i go to log it, it says that I can't log in because my account is in use by someone else.  Eventually I could log in, but the problems don't end there.I tried joining his game, but half the time just joining his game it was broken to where I joined his lobby, but neither of us were actually there and we couldn't start it.  That requires me restarting 3 or 4 times.-I first tried playing as the phantom with my friend on a one on one match.  Eventually after floating around for half an hour I asked him if he could see where I was, because the survivors should be able to see the phantom, but not the other way around.  I lined his sight up so he would be able to see me, but in his game I was not present. (I would know, I'm sitting right next to him) -From what I could tell the lurker seemed to be fine from my experience.-Mary, oh mary, where do I even start?--I played Mary and I literally could not play her.--The first game I played i was trapped in a room, so I teleported out, normal right?  Well then I tried to teleport out again and it never let me teleport again that game.  I was literally stuck in that small room with no escape.--Eventually we started up a new game and I did the same thing, except I teleported into a larger room the second game.  I was walking around for half an hour while my friend walked around the map figuring it out.  Eventaully he said he just got scared because he saw me...except I never left the main room I was stuck in..  I looked over at his screen and my character was moonwalking in his room and then randomly teleported out.  So I asked him if he could walk into the room where i was stuck.  Apparently that room that I was stuck in was one he had also been walking around for 20 minutes as well.  He literally could not see me, and i could not see him (I'm still playing as mary at this point), and all the doors that were open for him, were still closed for me, which is why I never knew he was there. --We booted it back up (after me restarting three or four times) and i tried Mary one more time.  Except this time I did nothing.  I did not move from the starting location from where I spawned in on the map as Mary.  I then went to his screen and watched him, hoping to help him find my room to simply see if I was there.  But not only did he not find me, a random mary once again was in his game and teleported right in front of him and was moonwalking.  Obviously this both freaked us out!  Except...I'm supposed to be Mary walking around....and my Mary never moved from her starting spot.  At that point I just turned the game off. (yes all of these games I am in his game/player list currently playing)All in all this game is not worth the time most likely unless it is fixed in a major way.  This game is in now way worth 20 dollars especially in this state.  I'm dissapointed that I paid for this, as it was not a wise purchase from what I could tell.  Buy this at your own risk, as it is broken beyond all belief atm.  If anyone has any help to give me, I'd love to hear it, as I would love for this game to work, but as of now, it's impossible for me to play.			"

												TL;DR: So bad, not worth.Aside from the constant crashing at the start and insane lag even when running on a computer well beyond this game's requirements, there is pretty much no content. You spend ages in an almost atmospherically devoid environment looking for keys and various other crap without a clear objective aside from 'escape (insert random room here).'Then comes the random♥♥♥♥♥ambience. You hear random things like what sounds like a hotel clerk bell and little bits of laughter for no reason.With these immersion-disrupting sound bits tearing through your skull and the random screen darknening which is also jarring, you are very aware that you are playing a game. There is no mistaking it, the immersion leaves a lot to be desired. Also, the enemies aren't particularly scary. If you see an enemy, you die silently. I tend to just run straight into the enemies because I feel 0 fear at all after the ambience has disrupted everything. The enemies are creepy-ish in their models alone because they arent particularly well done and it leaves a dirty-ish gross effect. Aside from that the game has pretty much nothing going for it.Cool concept, poorly executed design, no immersion, not worth the 5 dollar sale.			"

												Is this game still in alpha? Don't get me wrong, Damned is an amazing game; the 10% of the time you can actually play it. But in it's current state it's simply unplayable.- The game crashes much more often than it doesn't. When you start a match it's VERY common for at least 2-3 of the 5 players to drop out because their game crashed. Judging by the fact the game is using 1,000,000k+ memory when I kill it, there's a memory leak somewhere. - Upon rebooting the game, there's a myriad of random glitches. The most notable is the broken login screen. Others include sound simply not working, and lobbies not forwarding you into matches. Outside of these glitches, there's a missing element to this game that's required for horror. There's almost no sound effects. Lurker lurches up to you and ravages you with his giant claws? COMPLETELY SILENT. There's spookity music playing, but you die without a sound. This is a huge problem with Mary, a little girl monster. If she stands near a survivor long enough she goes into a frenzy, and can completely wipe the whole party in seconds. You'd expect for there to be some sort of audio cue when she's nearby, you know to scare you, but nope. There's supposed to be a sobbing noise, but it's so faint(even with that audio maxed) that you can't realistically hear it. The last problem I have with this game is that fact that monsters can cheese really hard if they know the map. Last night I witnessed a match where there was 1 survivor left, who had all the items he needed to escape out the final door. The enemy monster, the Phantom, was simply floating in front of the escape, slashing the air in front of the door. There was nothing the survivor could do. He had to open that door to win, and if he tried he would get killed. The game has great potential, but until they fix their codebase you'll be fighting with the game's menus and glitches a lot more than playing the game.			"

 Well to put it simply the game is good, but it's not quite Carling. I have given the game a positive review because in it's current state i would say that it is quite playable for all there are a few bugs with the game give or take.For instance there are a few irritating ones with the menu's and the lobbies. The player will get a message 'The servers are down/disconnected' Or the player might get stuck in a lobby, unable to join a game or accept invites.In-game there are not that many bugs i have encountered myself, although there is the odd random floating pumpkin here and odd floating non interactable keys there [Since the games objective is to gather keys this may or may not have an affect on the experience]. The game is currently quite stable.The game is labeled as a 'Horror'. And it isn't that bad of a one. I can compare the game slightly to that of Slender Man, only it being 5 player online and you don't collect pages you collect keys. With three monsters to choose from and an interacial gang of meddling kids that need to escape from a spooky house or forest before Jim can 'Fix-em'. The game is quite promising.Although the game doesn't quite have that real 'I just♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants' feel, it will give you quite a few jumps scares and a mild heart attack every now and then. [Well... Unless it's Mary, then you will probably need to go and change.]So all in all it is quite a good Horror. And looks like it could develop into something quite good. If i could rate this Half & Half i would, but i'm going to stick with the positive for now.			"

												A friend bought me this game and I still feel ripped off, god forbid you pay the full $19.99 for this game.In short, this game is incredibly shallow and is obviously just a cash grab to get money from youtube lets players.In long:The gameplay doesnt even need to be boiled down to explain it, all you do is wander around a map trying its hardest to be scary (which is ruined immediately by the jack-o-lanterns) and pick up items, then you use these items to progress in the map and ultimately try to escape, the monster's job is to simply kill all the players.This sounds great, except the entirety of the gameplay hinges around a single player, the monster. If the monster is playing to win, then the monster will win. EVERY. TIME. The monster has to 'play along' and try to actually scare the players, otherwise people will just drop dead and not understand why, as nothing is particularly clear and monsters will instantly kill you often before you even see them.The maps have confusing layouts with no real logic tying them together with items strewn about in a random fashion, there are so many locked doors and rusty keys that it gets confusing very quickly.The monster design is pretty horrible as well.Mary just waits on a charge bar (that charges faster if the survivors look at you) then goes into frenzy and can instantly kill a player in a dash.The Phantom can't see players unless they make sounds, except literally everything bar standing still makes sound, so basically it becomes a game of 'stand still and stare at the monster to survive', which can be easily abused and makes for a pretty idiotic mechanicThe Lurker is probably the only decently designed monster, as they place 'sound traps' where if a survivor trips it, both the survivor and the lurker knows it, the lurker then spawns in the area and looks for the survivor. However the lurker is on a 15 second timer giving survivors a chance to actually survive.Finally, the game is buggy and fairly unfinished, with crashes around every corner, mysterious performance drops with no relation to hardware, horrible netcode, and connection issues.Basically? DON'T BUY THIS GAME, IT ISNT EVEN WORTH 20 CENTS LET ALONE 20 DOLLARS.			"

								The general idea and concept behind this game is great, Basically the game is similar to amnesia but with friends, and as we all know anything with friends is better even if the gameplay is dreaded.In this case the gameplay is actually pretty good, Jump scares tend to be common and if u really jack the music up hairs will rase.Playing as the monster is difficult but easy to pick up once you get going and alot of laughs can be had, playing as a human on the other hand can be scary to say the least, with a first person camera style and rather hard to see without your flash light on making this game one of those games where the more friends you have working together generally makes you wonder if its better to split up or stay together.The main part that lets this game down significantly (at the moment atleast) is the fact that the game crashes constantly when entering or leaving a match, making actually getting into the game rather frustating to say the least not only that but the game isnt too well optimised at the momnet and even with everything turned down the game can at times run pretty badly.If you have a group of friends this game is worth looking at if your up for a night of scares and fun, otherwise for now you can give it a missOverall Damned is a fun but scary game but in its current ALPHA state this game could be given a miss for a while id only recommend this game if you have friends willing to play with you.

												I had a blast playing this game for the first time last night.  Was playing with several friends, and we were taking turns playing the monster.  I had a ton of fun tormenting my friends as Mary, a monster that is basically the little girl from The Ring.  I would see their flashlights shining around, and I would just try to stand somewhere just out of sight, so they'd turn the corner and see me standing there motionless, and then yell and run.  Once, a new friend joined the game, and he saw me standing still, and wasn't sure if I was the monster or what.  He just kept his light on me and was asking in voicechat if the girl was a monster or a friendly.  Then I suddenly went into frenzy mode and rushed directly at him.  The resulting shrieks of terror had me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.  The game was a lot of fun, and we'll definitely be playing some more.			"

								A rather interesting concept that we don't often see. Works well with 5 friends, not so much with random people. Unless said random people all leave their mics open or join a teamspeak server and share in good laughs when they get freaked out by a monster appearing in front of them or tearing them to pieces.Ultimately though, this game is lacking variety right now. It is an Alpha, so I will give it that. The gameplay is simple, find the keys or codes to unlock doors or safes to find more keys and codes. Eventually, you'll find a tool to pull wooden boards off of a door. After that door is unlocked you escape from the monster. There are a few maps so far, so it does get repetitive eventually. Withut any dynamic events happening, I don't think it will ever stop being repetitive. Anyways, there are only two monsters aka creatures. One of which is not as fun as the other.There's the Phantom. Which is the not-so-fun monster. As the Phantom you float around as a half decayed torso imbued with some evil magic or something. You float around decently fast and are allowed to pass through closed doors. Which is the only thing scary about this monster. From only a few play attempts it was clear to me that it was pretty overpowered and did not provide that great of an experience, both for the monster player, nor the character players.The second and so far final monster, the Lurker is a rather intimidating piece of work. Though when I think about it, I find that it also resembles the Phantom in a way as they share a common trait. They both can get through closed doors. The Lurker is a little more difficult to get through though. There are two phases to this monster. Your ""ghost"" phase, and your ""flesh"" phase. In the ghost phase you are unable to see or hear the players, but you're allowed to set traps. The traps range from pianos, to kitchen timers, to creaky boards. Unfortunately there are no visual traps like falling chairs, chandeliers, or candles that would blow out or anything like that. Then if you are near a trap you set that goes off, you click and change into your flesh form for a limited time. In this time you are to chase down and kill the player near you.For the Alpha that it is. Damned is definitely entertaining. If you are a streamer, this is a good kind of game to play with friends while live. Especially if you're easily scared/really jumpy. But don't play it too much or you'll get bored!For the Alpha that it is, I give it a 6.5/10.It definitely needs some updates to add some more fun to it. More creatures, more maps, and hopefully eventually some more dynamism. - Codewow			"

												Once you know what strategies to follow for each monster, the game becomes far less scary but even after 40h of playing, i still get fun and even tense sometimes, thanks for the community who tries their best to dub the monsters with passion, and even talent sometimes.Phantom used to be a absolute threat before, and now, i find myself winning against him around half the time. Globally, the mechanics behind the three monsters are well tought, and i really love Mary.I may reproach the lack of real diversity in the maps, but the main scratching part of this excelent game is the server stability, as many games may begin or finish by a crash or deconnexion.Still, i would recommand this game, just for the pleasure of being haunted by a sad Mary, singing in german some lullabies.

The keys aren't in the same places, however, so the game is challenging every time. You play with 3 other ""survivors"", pitted against the player-controlled monster. Each one is drastically different from each other, giving you a different experience for each one. Lurker is invisible and blind to players, until one of them sets off one of his traps. The Phantom is blind to players, except for when they are making noises, or are directly(like, two feet) in front of him. Mary is scary. Also deadly. She's your worst nightmare. One moment she's there, the next she's gone. Then you die.As I write this review, there's been no updates since April. The game is still great, fully playable. I'f you've ever wanted to play Amnesia with friends, then this game is probably for you. Highly reccomended			"

												Let me start off by saying that I really love this game, or rather the potential this game has. In its current state I feel it falls short of what it could be.  I first bought this game roughly a year ago, and I'm disappointed with the amount of work that has gone into it since then.  This game doesn't need *more* content, it needs *refinement* of the existing content. I sincerely hope the developers will consider making some of the following adjustments:Criticisms:1) Communication.  Typically, most players choose to have their character randomly assigned.  The unfortunate side effect is that you don't know who YOU are playing as (assuming you're a human). Trying to tell your fellow survivors where items are becomes very difficult when they cant match your voice to your character.  Simply adding a portrait of your character on screen somewhere would help greatly.2) Prolonged stalemates.  Most of the games I have played follow the same pattern, monster gets an early kill, eventually kills off a couple more, and then 3 players are stuck watching a stale mate of 1 monster vs 1 human for 20 minutes.  To exacerbate the problem, the dead players can't communicate with the living, which leaves both parties wondering if they should just give up for the sake of starting a new game.   I feel like some kind of mechanic needs to be implemented to bring the game to an end when it gets stalled in this way.  At the very least, players need to communicate how long they are willing to wait before abandoning the game.3) Limited flash light usage.  When I first read about this in patch notes, it sounded exciting and a way to make the game more suspenseful.  In reality, it seems to bring the game to a grinding halt for all parties.  As a human, when your battery dies you cease making progress, and end up walking in circles aimlessly.  As the monster, your prey becomes harder to find, and the game reaches another stalemate.4) Anti-climactic endings.  Regardless of which side wins, the game often ends with a yawn.  If a monster sneaks up and kills you from behind, you just fall over dead with out much idea of what happened to you.  If the survivors win, you just abruptly get notified that the game is over and are sent back to the lobby.  It would be nice if player deaths had a little more animation or violence added (it is a horror game after all), or if the survivors attempting to open the last door triggered some kind of global warning that would give the monster a brief moment of opportunity to get to the exit and stop them.I really hope the developers will address these issues, as I've been a huge advocate of this game to many of my friends and coworkers.

												Played with a full group of friends. Everyone, including the monster - on Skype. We figured we can't really tell each other where we were because of that, so I came up with the brilliant idea of using turning on and off my flashlight to indicate to the others. We proceed to find a bunch of keys and stuff - so far so good.5 minutes later one of my buddies is dead and another one has splitted off the group so it's just the two of us searching the level. Shortly we find the key to the exit, my heart is racing, all excited and stuff when the one who went to search alone starts shouting on Skype that the monster is chasing him. We two decide to let him die, since he is distracting the monster anyway and we can escape meanwhile. I run to the other side of the room, open the door and see the 'being-chased' running past me, monster following. Well, not exactly. I died in a split second and the other two followed shortly.Pants were♥♥♥♥♥♥ Will play again.10/10			"

								Very suspenseful and exciting. When played at night with friends, Damned is incredibly entertaining. The immersion is accentuated by 3D directional voice communication, which is honestly one of my favorite features for a game to have.Visually, the game isn't ridiculously impressive; although, its graphics and effects do fine at achieving the game's spooky atmosphere.My only qualm is with the volumetric fog. It looks great but it brings the performance down by a factor of ten on my system. I've played plenty of games with the same feature, and I hardly lost any framerate. Hopefully the developers find some way to better optimize the fog for performance.Overall: Great game, very spooky 8.5/10			"

												Very spooky and fun to play with your friends.But there's a lot of bugs, the game sometimes crashes after the loading screen without a message, and in some places you can't for example walk between two tables, even though there is plenty of space. You may also not be able ot walk over the slighest obstacle, an Ouija board for example. Theres also no level editor, which makes me sad.Doors, drawers and lockers can be very difficult to open, as the game has a very severe case of mouse acceleration, along with a bit clunky controls.It can be EXTREMELY hard for the survivors to complete a match, since some of the maps are very VERY linear, and with keys being difficult to find at most time. The phantom monster is very OP, since you only have to camp at a door in one the linear maps to win the entire game in just a few seconds. I highly suggest you play with life mode and set max deaths to 6.The game has a real neat 3D voice feature, which means the host can change it so that you can only hear people speak if they were close to you. This can be frustrating though if you're playing a large map with many ways to go.Totally not worth 20 euro in it's current state, but if its on sale and you get it for 3,99 as I did, you should totally get it.I rate this game 6/10			"

												Once you know what strategies to follow for each monster, the game becomes far less scary but even after 40h of playing, i still get fun and even tense sometimes, thanks for the community who tries their best to dub the monsters with passion, and even talent sometimes.Phantom used to be a absolute threat before, and now, i find myself winning against him around half the time. Globally, the mechanics behind the three monsters are well tought, and i really love Mary.I may reproach the lack of real diversity in the maps, but the main scratching part of this excelent game is the server stability, as many games may begin or finish by a crash or deconnexion.Still, i would recommand this game, just for the pleasure of being haunted by a sad Mary, singing in german some lullabies.

												The good:-Freaking scary. Really.And it gets a lot scarier once your mates die. The fact that the monster isn't some dumb AI that you can habitually outplay makes it more scary than anything. You truly do not know what to expect.-Very fun with friends using Skype, TS or something similar. More on that later.-Very-very interesting, unique gameplay. This is the biggest point for me.The bad:-Sometimes too scary. This wouldn't be a point if there weren't some group pressure on you to open that door behind which there MAY be a monster. In single player, you save or simply go out for a drink if you had too much. Here, there is no getting away from the fact that you HAVE to keep going, even when you feel like you just can't take it anymore-Much-much worse without voice communication. Apart from the practicality of not being able to scream : ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURN AROUND AND RUN!!!"" You can easily get lost and separated from your buddies, and not being able to communicate fluently makes the game irritating instead of terrifying. Lack of communication really hurts your experience, and not having people to play with can be bad, because random people won't talk to you.-You're kinda not supposed to actually win as a survivor. The point is the promise of survival which you can actually google or find on youtube: is possible. But there is an invincible monster that 1shots you between you and victory and this turns the odds heavily in the monsters favour. So although you CAN win, I wouldn't count on it happening more often than 1 in a dozen games or so (I still haven't won). So while you are actually terrified, the one who gets the most 'fun' out of it is the monster.-Bugs, crashes everywhere. I have issues starting the game about every 3rd match.-THE DOORS!!! HOW HARD CAN IT BE to code them properly? They are a real struggle to operate. I wish they just abandoned the idea of making them drag-or-push based and instead just click on them to open, at least I could open and close them whenever I want to with security.-Some levels are just crap. Some of them are very-very simple where you progress from room to room, say, you need to find key 1 in room 1 so you can get to room 2, where you need to find key 2 to room 3....the problem with this is that the monster knows EXACTLY where you will be, and apart from juking him around the tables there is very little you can do. (As the monster: They will be in room 2. Just go there and kill them)-Mary is just unfair. You can play around the other two, and if you get killed you can find an error in your gameplay. With Mary, you die because she ported next to you. GG.That's about all I could think of. And while I listed more bad points than good points, the good ones still weight more heavily than the bad ones.Get this game if:-It's on sale-If you have friends to play with-If you are a hardcore horror fan and can stand the pressure-If you are a lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and count on being the monster more often than not-If you have the nerves to grind out the neccessary game experience to win despite paralyzing terror.-If your name is Mary.Overall: great game, but not without buddies, and not so much if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me. :(			"

												Damned is super fun when you play it with friends.There are only two cons I've experienced:  It can be a little quirky sometimes. For example, I find it difficult to open/close doors for some reason. (You have to click & pull or push on them or something, but they don't always move like I want them to)  In-game, I experience minimal lag. Yet in the menus, the mouse cursor is sluggish & laggy. I looked it up and it appears to be a common problem.			"

								Dispite all the negitive poo-poo people have been ""JUST LITERALLY"" throwing at this game, old uncle Star will tell you how it is.This game releases about a year ago and it was really buggy and had very few features. Dispite all that it was actually really good and had a nice simple concept, let your friends fear you and you fear them.The game features a lot of awesome horror aspects that you can't often find in other multiplayer games. At the very least its a really good cat and mouse type game. I encourage you to at least give the devs some time to fix the bugs in the game, they've worked really hard and I know usually I'd toss out devs that do nothing but bug fixes on a game but this is whole-heartedly me stating this ""this game is worth it"". I know a bad game when I see it and this is not one of them.I encourage you to either wait to play or add me to talk about it. Its a good game thats slowly coming together			"

												One of the scariest games I've played since the original silent hill came out. Now the level of freakiness completely relies on the group you're playing with but if you put some extra work into it (ex. singing ring around the rosy, and giggling as Mary) the experience is elevated tenfold. Also if you’re playing the monster take some time and don't just go in for the kill ASAP, toy with your pray, pin them up against a wall and laugh before you disappear. This improves every player experience and makes players evacuate their bowls.Highly recommend this game for both solo players and groups of friends. Also really hope they put more into the development and produce some different maps and more monsters.			"

As a side note, I don't even play horror games due to being a scaredy pants in general, but this is the kind of spooky that I can get behind. The uncanny, the tension, it's real! I still have to play it with the light on, and I definitely look over my shoulder inbetween matches.			"

Suddenly I hear the death screams of one of my spanish brothers. Mary can actually kill? theres no way......Then after 10 minutes, Im the last one. I can hear the crying around the corner.  I turn the corner and there she is. This time I walk away. Then I hear this loud♥♥♥♥♥scream and what do you know? Mary is dashing at me like a mad Kenyan. I juke hard to the right and dodge her, running like hell. I close the door on her face and hide in the corner. Sad thing is she can open doors.

												If you're interested in Damned, then you have to be ready to put up with a handful of things including, but not limited to, that one missing key, the fact that the game doesn't always 100% work for everyone consistently due to bugs or other nonsense, and last, but not least, the fact that mary is scary. This game is an exciting horror escape game that feels kind of like a point and click game given a first person engine, only because you're running around to specific rooms and running through them to grab at keys to open new rooms etc. Knowledge is probably the most valuable weapon in this game because an inexperienced player is almost always going to lose, but that's all part of the horror fun as the monster gets to toy with them a little bit beforehand. All in all the game has its unique charm, but you will most likely have to have a group of 5 friends to really enjoy the game to its fullest.			"

												Worth it on a Steam sale when all your friends buy it and play together. HOWEVER I have a very important issue with this game that other people have as well. The Insanity System is literally one of the most annoying and disappointing things I have ever seen for a game. I hate horror games, movies etc, but I love it when the scares derive from the PLAYERS in the game, like in this one! But just less than an hour ago the Insanity System has caused me to stop playing due to fear. I didn't even know this feature was in the game until earlier when I was hiding from a friend playing as Mary (who is TERRIFYING) and a CREEPY AS♥♥♥♥♥♥FACE FLASHED ONTO MY SCREEN and I think I pooped myself. Yes I get scared a bit easily but again, this had the potential to make me enjoy a horror game which I usually don't like as a genre. I play Depth, a game with sharks and the ocean, when I am terrified of BOTH, and I love it, because the scares are natural, balanced and fair.The Insanity System saps all fun from the experience as the scares are no longer being produced from a balanced, real system. When someone is playing as the monster and you get scared, it's OK because you know they were simply using the game's features, which you understand and have the ability to counteract based on your knowledge of the monster.Now it's not ALL bad. Some of the features include strange noises/music playing, the lights flickering, and even your keyboard keys losing response. Despite the keys thingy, I think those ideas are alright as long as they create TENSION and not FEAR. The one feature of the Insanity System that RUINS the experience are the face jumpscares (I think it's the people who have died flash onto your screen?) that occur when you have been alive and hiding for a while.When a face flashes onto your screen, you have absolutely NO idea when, where or why it appears and it's not even controlled by the player as the monster. It's an unfair system that ruins the balance. The monster and humans have an equal environment to win. A face flashing onto your screen is random and unfair.Overall a very fun game but the Insanity System is making me fear playing it again in case it shows up again. If there was an option to remove it, I would love this a lot more. Would love if the faces got removed or turned into an option, considering how the devs have been aware of the dislike for this feature for about seven to eight months.			"

								A true horror at the core for a game this earily in development, never will you have the same game with the keys and locked doors being random, but the monster being a player really excells in random events. If you get a buzz from being scared just a little bit, grab this great game!!  :)			"

												15 hours in with friends, I must say that I heavily enjoyed Damned. This is coming from someone that normally hates first-person unarmed horror games on PC. The concept of the game is honestly brilliant. Each monster has mechanics that are unique to them and make all of them interesting to play as (although I think Phantom needs a bit more buffing in order to be more balanced).As for survivors, it's interesting how the way the game works encourages people to work together BUT not stay close. That could mean immediate disaster, especially against the likes of Lurker or Mary. The sanity meter is also very neat and adds to the intensity. I also like how the doors work in this game. Makes it MUCH more challenging to escape from nasty situations.The only thing I think needs a LOT of work is sound design. The game itself can build tension in many situations and is scary in certain ways, but sound design is very choppy and some of the sound effects they chose are incredibly cliche and immediately take me out of the game (randomly heard an Evil Witch laugh that I swear I heard on one of those Halloween spooky sounds CDs you can get at convenience stores). Mary's music is also very cheap-sounding and generic. I'd honestly turn the music volume to 0 if it weren't for the rest of the soundtrack being solid.The game also still needs polishing. I've ran into glitches where we were unable to actually complete the stage, people would be stuck in the lobby despite the host starting the match, and Mary has been able to siphon energy off dead bodies and regain frenzy almost immediately after using it. I understand this game has recently stopped being Early Access? I still think they need to fix a lot of things before deciding that. Still, I'm sure they're working on it! Just 7 folks with a great concept, after all.This is honestly one of the best horror games I've played in a long time. It really makes me glad someone can use this 'helpless defenseless first-person horror' genre to make something actually very enjoyable.			"

												Gameplay wise, this game is very fun and unique, creates great moments with friends and is actually scary. HOWEVER, it is very buggy when trying to start a game, it will often freeze up and be very difficult to close out and start back up. If they fix this major bug the game would be amazing, but right now I would only say its worth a buy if you play it with friends and can handle the lobby bug.			"

												Hello gents, I have been playing this game quite a bit I know every map like the back of my hand, I have every achievement minus 1, I have loved this game and even admit an addiction, I play this on a daily basis, I make sure I get my hour's worth of game time every day.   Enough about me ^_^This game is ridiculously amazing, being the survivor is difficult and thats where all the fear happens, when you're the monster a little part of you comes out and acts it over voice chat, always  ""SHOW ME DAT BOOTIE!!"" and when you have it on 3d attenuated mode for voice chat, it actually comes from the monster so it makes it completely worth.Anyway I find that the lurker brings forth the most horror out of everyone.  He has this ability to set traps so when a trap goes off you're in a state of panic wondering if he heard his trap go off, because if he did, he will soon spawn.  Anyway so mary is the runner-up bc she can teleport in the room your hiding in etc.  Look this game is buggy it is, but even if it never changes even if I have some kind of random issue this game will always be played by me - note: this game averages 70 rooms of 5 so activity is very high, even at nights ^^ thats when its best			"

												This game as of the time I'm writing this is not in a playable state. Me and four friends tried to create a game and play together, but it took us half an hour just to all get into a single lobby without one of us crashing or not being able to join. Once in the game, there was nothing but freezing, massive desync of minutes difference causing others to stand or walk in place, and more crashing once in game. On top of that, the game froze when resizing it and placing it to fullscreen, and was not allowing alt tabbing, ctrl+alt+del or any method to reach task manager to close the game, resulting in having to shut off my PC. It isn't even ""unpolished."" The game is unplayable from my experience. So be warned when considering it.			"

								So far I've been very impressed with this game. At the time of this review it's still in early beta, so has definitely had it's fair share of bugs and crashes and can be very unstable at times. Regardless it's a ridiculous amount of fun to play, especially if you can get a full group of 5 friends. Who doesn't like scaring the hell out of their friends?! I've played each of the maps and monsters a ton of times and it's still always a challenge and always a good time. The recently added monster (Mary) and insanity system added a lot to the game. It makes me very excited to see what the game will be like at launch. It's already a lot of fun, and definitely has a lot of potential!			"

My group initially spent an hour trying to get a working server set up, and the game randomly crashes, but when it works, it fully immerses me in my role as a defenseless survivor. It's equally thrilling whether I'm one of the lucky ones to escape or I've devoured all the survivors as a monster. I can't wait to see how this game develops over time!			"

												Ohh my God, this game is absolutely flipping amazing.  Buy this game if you have friends who play it (or are willing to play),  as this would probably be a lonely experience single-player.  In the Lobby, you can choose to be either a Monster or its potential Victim.  Right now there are only three Monsters to choose from, so I hope that will change.  Of the Monsters available I've played as Mary and the Lurker.  Mary is your typical ghost girl, slow-moving, but get close to potential Victims and you can enter a Frenzy mode in which to attack.  As the Lurker, you can activate objects within the level that will set off traps/cues if your potential victims walk near or activate the items themselves.  Victims are invisible while you are in ""normal mode,"" but you can manifest physically and hunt your victims down.A lot of the fun of this game will likely come from playing with friends and using the voice-chat.  The buddies I game with all use TeamSpeak, and whenever I played as Monster I either groaned or spoke in a sing-song voice, and my friends were screaming like young girls.One thing I don't understand is whether a potential Victim can actually survive.  There seems to be no way for potential Victims to defend themselves against Monsters, so it's down to hunting for the right keys as quickly as possible.  It also seems that, once a Monster closes in, it's a one-click attack and you go from potential Victim to actual Victim.I would request that a third-person mode be made available, because what's the point of being a Monster when you can't enjoy the look?In all, I really got into the role of Monster and actually felt a little anxious as I ran around as a potential Victim when it was my friends' turns to hunt.  This has all the qualities of a good ""scary story by the campfire.""  It may not be a ""true"" horror game like the Silent Hill franchise, but it's still a pretty damn neat idea.			"

												Well, it's riddled with bugs, game freezes and connectivity problems. I still bought 3 copies. It brings a fun twist to the, I guess ''slenderman'' games. You search keys with 3 other players and 1 player is the monster who's trying to get you. The monsters are spooky and pretty well balanced. The controls are pretty fiddly and it's sometimes hard to open doors and stuff, but once you get used to it, it becomes alright. It's just a cool little co-op game. Not sure if it's going to hold up much more than a few hours tho.			"

Early Access Review
								BRIEF SYNOPSIS: You can have great jump scares with this beta 3D multiplayer horror adventure where you play either one of four survivors trying to escape, or a horrifying monster attempting to kill the survivors; recommended despite bugs (see forums). * Spoilers below *GAMEPLAY REVIEW:Summary:My childhood nightmares come to life. I'm a wimp when it comes to anything horror, but the multiplayer adventurer in me as drawn me in. It is brilliant to have four different human survivors as a team versus one human-controlled monster. And the three current monsters are terrifying, along with the ten existing levels full of creepy ambiance and atmosphere.Escape is difficult but not impossible for the survivors, who need to find keys and codes to unlock and open doors and safes, use batteries to power their flashlights, grab a crowbar or hammer to smash wooden boards, and eventually escape the monster or fall victim to it. The longer it takes to complete a level, the more the survivors become insane and the more difficult it becomes to escape.In game chat:I really enjoyed using the 3d audio with a microphone headset. It makes a huge difference in the game. Everyone can hear you speaking, so if you want to keep the monster guessing use the in-game text chat (brought up with the enter key). It's also good with chatting in-between rounds in the lobby.Game play seems to favour the monsters, but smart survivors will be able to team up to outwit their pursuer to escape. Even in death, survivors can text chat with the living to give helpful hints, such as “You missed a key in the sink,” or “I have a crowbar with my body on the main floor.”Lobby:After logging in you can setup your options and either join or host your own game. Hosts can have an open game lobby or set a password to have a private game amongst friends only. Some people have complained about being kicked out of games but I think most people who want private games have figured out how to the use password now. Those of you still kicking people, stop being so lazy and use a password for your private games (May the Lurker devour your soul...). The people hosting and the people I've played with in this community have been courteous and fun to play with. Thanks people for making this game even more fun! Most people seem to be on the servers during the weekends.Life mode seems better if you are casually hosting players – people can join in whenever they feel like if there is a spot. Normal mode is more hard core with only one life to live or die with.Levels:There are currently ten levels consisting of three hotels, three asylums, a hospital (asylum set), a restaurant (hotel set), a warehouse (hotel set), and a factory. Each are different sizes and have different strategies. Some have two exits which help prevent monster camping at the exit. Some have stairs and different levels. Some have too many damn tables. Each level is creepy and atmospheric. I AM HOPING FOR GRAVEYARD TYPE LEVELS FOR A FUTURE UPDATE. There are only three different set types for levels (asylum, hotel, or factory).Survivors:There are four player controlled survivor models:Mia the emo; she appears to be Asian and wears miss-matching shoes.Scott the jockey, sporting his Eagles college jacket.Jacob the nerd; he is of African descent and a little stout.Father John the priest; he totes a Bible but it's not compelling monsters to go away.The survivors typically start in a room and have to find keys and codes to unlock doors and safes that will eventually allow them to escape from the level. The survivors are equipped with a battery burning flashlight that needs to be replenished or they will be forced to grope around in the dark. The longer the survivors take to complete a level, the more insane they will become. Others tools survivors will need include either a crowbar or a small hammer to remove boards from exit or storage doors. [A shovel is needed in the graveyard level.] - oops, sorry, don't know how that got in there... There are no weapons or way to attack the monster, which makes then all the more scary. Repeat, there is no BFG to save you!Monsters:There are currently three monsters that one player can choose to hunt down the survivors. I feel the monsters are generally well-balanced. Some people feel the Phantom is still overpowered, despite all the tweaks it has been receiving as of late. Survivors must adjust their game-play for each monster in order to escape.Mary is the scariest monster and my current favourite. She is a great monster with pretty blue eyes, but she has some posture issues. She seems well balanced with her movements and attacks. Her walk mode is a little slow, but her attack is long reaching and swift. Quick manoeuvring for survivors is the key when you hear her scream. Mary has some movement issues over objects and the Factory catwalk.The Lurker is a muscular hulk with two forms. The first form is spiritual and allows the Lurker to freely roam the level, unencumbered by doors. In this mode it can set sound traps that go off when a survivor is nearby to help it locate the players as it cannot see anyone in this form. Once the Lurker is powered up by time it can enter its physical form where it can visibly stalk and kill remaining survivors. After a while the Lurker will revert to its spiritual form where it will have to wait until it recharges and takes physical form again. The longer the Lurker remains in physical form, the longer it take to recharge in spiritual form.The Phantom is a roaming skeletal ghost (the creepiest monster for me until Mary joined) that can see survivors via sound such as the clicking of flashlights, running, or setting off a trap. Then it's either run away for the survivors and try to escape the Phantoms detection radius or get eviscerated by it. When the Phantom hears a survivor, it can see a white shadow, even through walls or different levels, of where the player is.Traps are set automatically for the Phantom and Mary, whereas setting traps is part of the Lurker's strategy. They are generally objects strewn about the level. Each trap makes a different sound to alert a monster to where a survivor is.Sound:The music is great for a horror game. Each monster has its own terrifying theme music when it appears near a survivor. Ambient sounds like footsteps, breathing, traps, and screams add to the atmosphere. The 3D audio chat really adds to the game-play; it is great to taunt the survivors as a monster. Dead players can only text chat.Insanity system:The insanity system increases game difficulty by darkening a survivor's screen to the point of complete darkness, making the flashlight flicker on and off, causing the player to hear random sounds, losing hearing, losing colour vision, having arms emerge from the ground that slow or halt a survivor's progress, randomly disabling a directional key on your keyboard, and flashing images of possessed survivors across your screen. The effects are temporary but potentially deadly.The insanity mode is a great idea and has been toned down from beta 1.0 to occur less frequently. It serves its purpose of making the game especially difficult the longer the survivors take to exit. Apparently the jump scare faces have been fixed so that they don't blind you, but I have yet to see the new effect since my game currently freezes before it occurs. I feel the jump scares are not necessary in this game. Also annoying for fair game-play is the keyboard/mouse movement disabling effect.CONCLUSION:Despite bugs being ironed out during the beta period, I feel the game is a very enjoyable if not a mildly terrifying experience. It's best played with all five people, and the up to four survivors really need to cooperate to escape from the monster. Recommended for beta and if all bugs (especially game freezing/crashing) get squashed for the retail release.Edited 2014-08-26 - [Version Beta 1.12a]			"

								A simple but brilliant game. Although it is still in Alpha, it has an eerie atmosphere and keeps you on edge. The basic plot is to find your way out of the building using keys and codes. At the same time, you must be stealthy and aware of the monsters. This can make gameplay very fun and strategic, and certainly gives you chills. In my opinion playing with a headset on mic with your teammates is the best way to play this game. Despite its simplicity, it does take a lot of effort to finish the games. One particular monster is OP which makes gameplay mostly irritating but sometimes fun. There are a lot of annoying bugs, the most significant one being not being able to log in and having to restart over and over again until it works. Also, you get disconnected a lot and your whole computer will freeze.			"

												Gameplay is neither fun, nor scary. Hide and seek where getting 'tagged' means an insta-death. Which could be fun, but for survivors, gameplay consists of wandering around looking for keys, and trying them at random in doors until more of the level is unlocked.Not worth $20. Barely worth $5.

Early Access Review
								While I find this game really fun, especially in the first time in the areas, I was so unfamiliar and getting horribly frightened especially when the lurker set off item traps so everything started dinging and going off around me.As fun as it is, I feel the level variety and maps could be a bit more mazelike, confusing to both the monster and the humans, making it harder to track as well as potential changes to monster styles. As stated in another players review, they recommended a way of allowing the Lurker to interact directly with objects to scare people, without actually being able to kill them. Beyond that, I find the Lurker insanely fun with setting traps and waiting for the careless humans to set off my traps to alert me to their location. I remember once I waited for the traps to alert me, and as soon as one right next to me went off, I turned physical, staring face to face mere feet away from 2 humans, who both panicked in their attempts to run away.In addition, I feel that the Phantom should have its range reduced a bit and if possible, sound waves emanate from the area sound was made, whether from a trapped item, or from a persons steps, and make it easier to track a person through small bits of sound, but in areas where theres lots of sounds going on, it could become confusing to the phantom what sounds are actually people or are the items. Either that, or make it so the phantom has to actually attack like the lurker does to kill, and not just walk through the person.Another suggestion I would have at the moment (not knowing if/what monsters will be added as well as maps) is to have specially designed large maps that can support up to 10 players, and 2 players play monsters. Imagine them working as a team, the Lurker setting traps and turning physical right in front of people, and in their panic, they run away, attracting the attention of the Phantom or continues the chase. I feel it would be a much more intense experience for people if it were balanced properly.Overall, I feel the game has immense potential and am really excited to see the game grow.			"

The first form is spiritual and allows the Lurker to freely roam the level, unencumbered by doors. In this mode it can set sound traps that go off when a survivor is nearby to help it locate the players as it cannot see anyone in this form. Once the Lurker is powered up by time it can enter its physical form where it can visibly stalk and kill remaining survivors. After a while the Lurker will revert to its spiritual form where it will have to wait until it recharges and takes physical form again. The longer the Lurker remains in physical form, the longer it take to recharge in spiritual form.The Phantom is a roaming skeletal ghost (the creepiest monster for me until Mary joined) that can see survivors via sound such as the clicking of flashlights, running, or setting off a trap. Then it's either run away for the survivors and try to escape the Phantoms detection radius or get eviscerated by it. When the Phantom hears a survivor, it can see a white shadow, even through walls or different levels, of where the player is.Traps are set automatically for the Phantom and Mary, whereas setting traps is part of the Lurker's strategy. They are generally objects strewn about the level. Each trap makes a different sound to alert a monster to where a survivor is.Sound:The music is great for a horror game. Each monster has its own terrifying theme music when it appears near a survivor. Ambient sounds like footsteps, breathing, traps, and screams add to the atmosphere. The 3D audio chat really adds to the game-play; it is great to taunt the survivors as a monster. Dead players can only text chat.Insanity system:The insanity system increases game difficulty by darkening a survivor's screen to the point of complete darkness, making the flashlight flicker on and off, causing the player to hear random sounds, losing hearing, losing colour vision, having arms emerge from the ground that slow or halt a survivor's progress, randomly disabling a directional key on your keyboard, and flashing images of possessed survivors across your screen. The effects are temporary but potentially deadly.The insanity mode is a great idea and has been toned down from beta 1.0 to occur less frequently. It serves its purpose of making the game especially difficult the longer the survivors take to exit. Apparently the jump scare faces have been fixed so that they don't blind you, but I have yet to see the new effect since my game currently freezes before it occurs. I feel the jump scares are not necessary in this game. Also annoying for fair game-play is the keyboard/mouse movement disabling effect.CONCLUSION:Despite bugs being ironed out during the beta period, I feel the game is a very enjoyable if not a mildly terrifying experience. It's best played with all five people, and the up to four survivors really need to cooperate to escape from the monster. Recommended for beta and if all bugs (especially game freezing/crashing) get squashed for the retail release.Edited 2014-08-26 - [Version Beta 1.12a]			"

								A simple but brilliant game. Although it is still in Alpha, it has an eerie atmosphere and keeps you on edge. The basic plot is to find your way out of the building using keys and codes. At the same time, you must be stealthy and aware of the monsters. This can make gameplay very fun and strategic, and certainly gives you chills. In my opinion playing with a headset on mic with your teammates is the best way to play this game. Despite its simplicity, it does take a lot of effort to finish the games. One particular monster is OP which makes gameplay mostly irritating but sometimes fun. There are a lot of annoying bugs, the most significant one being not being able to log in and having to restart over and over again until it works. Also, you get disconnected a lot and your whole computer will freeze.			"

												This game could use a tutorial despite how much I hate tutorials.  You walk around for a bit not knowing what to do and then die.  Door mechanics are a little odd / bad.  One guy with voicechat started explaining the game to me a bit which helped, though a lot of the mechanics are closing a door and standing next to it so the monster can get in... When in reality you'd like to run.  Anyway, after learning that I closed myself in the bathroom stall with the monster trying to open the bathroom stall, the door glitched, I got stuck / locked in the stall with no way to exit, had to quit, kind of lame.

												I hate to give it a no because it has so much potential. Right now the game is excessively difficult to play and unbalanced in the favor of monsters. There are two types of characters, the survivors, who search for things such as batteries (to power your limited flashlights), tools (to help you open barricades) and keys (to help you open locked doors). To open locked doors, you have to hold left click, then push or pull the door in the direction the door opens. This is cumbersome, and with all the other issues in the game, such as the extremely imprecise cursor, it is a feature of the game that really should have taken bakesat to fixing other things. Doors should just open and shut.I am a 260 pound man and I think the survivor characters run like a bunch of chain smoking grannies with rusty walkers. I could outrun them after a night of no sleep. That's saying something. Ultimately, the game has a lot of potential, but right now, the difficulty of finding the tools you need to escape, the anticlimactic escape situations, the absence of a story line and voice acting, the poor. In time the game might become playable.			"

												Gameplay is neither fun, nor scary. Hide and seek where getting 'tagged' means an insta-death. Which could be fun, but for survivors, gameplay consists of wandering around looking for keys, and trying them at random in doors until more of the level is unlocked.Not worth $20. Barely worth $5.

								     This game was mean't to be played with your friends. Hands down, one of the most fun games I have ever played before. There is nothing like getting 4 of your friends together in a voice chat and playing this game. Everyone is laughing, panicking, and needing time after each round to change their shorts. 4 of my friends, including me, bought this game, and in our first session of playing... we played for 6 hours straight!     The game is still in Alpha, so some bugs here and there are to be expected, but overall, this game is so much fun. Can't wait to see the improvements the developers are going to be putting into this game going forward. A must buy for sure.			"

								Imagine the survival-horror and puzzle solving of Amnesia but there are 4 people trying to work together and survive in a multiplayer map.  The survivors must find their way out of the map (dungeon, asylum, etc) by finding keys to open doors, find crowbars to break open secret areas and much more.  Instead of various AI monsters you have to avoid there is a fifth player who plays as a single monster who works to kill you.  One monster can walk through doors while the other one can lay traps for the survivors.  There are a few more buffs and negs to the monsters such as movement speed and one monsters 'mortal form.'  The map is randomly generated at the start of the round so no two matches feel the same.  This game is very fun and intense.  At the time of writing this it is in alpha so it is buggy for now and needs a few balance tweaks.  There are two types of monsters that players can play as and each one has their pros and cons.  Buy the 4 pack and make that friend you don't care for to much pay for it himself and kill him or her over and over again.			"

												Damned is a flawed game with a tremendous amount of potential.The basic premise is an asymetrical multiplayer FPS horror game.  Four players play people and one person plays some sort of monster.  The monster is invincible and can kill any of the players instantly.  The players need to navigate their way through frequently labyrinthine levels full of locked doors and... well locked doors.  If the monster kills all the players, the monster wins.  If the players find the exit, the players win.  The monsters can only hunt the players at certain times in certain circumstances.  The rest of the time they are trying to keep tabs on the players if they can, and generally keep the players as scared as possible.The things about this game that I love:- As a player, because you have no real defenses of your own, the monsters are terrifying.  Seeing one always elicits an immediate and frantic attempt to escape.- The 3D attenuated sound means that the monsters can really add to the experience by acting in scary (or funny) ways.- The complicated level layouts leave lots of time for the players to get lost, get separated, be hunted, etc.  Games almost always last long enough for quite a few good scares and intense moments.The problems with this game: - Horribly buggy.  We have never had a gaming session that hasn't been marred by game crashes, freezes, etc.  It can be tricky to recover from some of these crashes, and sometimes they'll require a hard reboot.  Also, the game requires a login, and if you crash sometimes that login gets locked in a session meaning you can't rejoin for a while.- The monsters have very little to do in the periods when they aren't being a direct threat.  Sure you can ""place traps"", but that entails nothing more then clicking on objects.  Not particularly exciting.- The players have only one puzzle to solve.  Find the key that fits the door.  And there are no clues as to which key is for what, so not only is it a very boring puzzle, it's extremely tedious as you try every key you find on every door that's locked.  Sure, there are also boarded doors and safes, but they are still the same mechanic, it's just that the key is named ""hammer"", or ""crowbar"" or ""safe code"".  - The maps and monsters are terribly balanced.  Some monsters will wipe out the players very quickly.  Others will make for excellent experiences.  Some maps fit certain monsters very well, but fit other monsters very poorly.All in all I want to recommend this game, and have marked it as such.  However, it has some serious issues, and I would caution against buying it without being aware of the issues it has.			"

Product received for free
												I got this game from a friend and we played like 2-3 rounds of it.I was a human every time (all random) and we managed to find a server with 3 more guys in it so we had a full group. This 3 guys were the only other players we found, so we joined them to maybe find out what our objective was (they had no clue as well).The objective is still not clear to me, my friend told me that we would have to look for an exit? im not sure, but the only thing i ever found was a battery, to interact with, everything else was just decoration and nothing innovative. Closed doors, random barrels stairs, sinks.. in every room on the map. QUALITY. There are a few more maps but i can imagine them all being build by the same lame structure. Even in the trailer with the girl there was NOTHING, 2 lockers and EMPTY corridors, thats pretty much every map in a nutshell.The atmosphere of this game was pretty scary at first, because i didnt know what would happen to me, only that a real player is controlling a monster, so anything could happen at any time. After a while it became annoying, because there was not much to do. The trailer makes the game look scary, and it can actually be scary, because everything can happen at any time, but it WILL be the same over and over again and i got used to one monster in the same round, so i doubt that the other 2 or 3, monster will change much about it. (One is just a statue who waits in a room and chases me when he finds me. How he works, no clue, but after a while he disappears and waits somewhere else for me)The maps are very, very limited and there is barely anything to interact with. I mean, nothing, only picking up keys and batterys. The game is full of dead ends and i was dead whenever a monster would corner me in there.Also you can do NOTHING as human, only run around and sprint for 1.5 seconds.The animations are very stiff and just a pain to look at.No hiding or anything to protect myself as human...I played demos with more content then this.All in all it was a huge disappointment. It still bothers me that the developers want 20€ for this piece of uncompleted garbage,My friend payed 6€ for both games together and it was still not worth it. Dont buy this. Seriously.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Damned is a great first person survival horror, played best with close friends. Four survivors are forced to try and escape, as a monster with unique abilities is trying to hunt and kill them.With a variety of eerie level designs which forces you to explore and find randomised items to escape, Damned will have you running for your life in fear as a survivor, or laughing maniacally as a monster as your closest friend screams in terror as you chase them down.I had brilliant fun playing this game with my friends, I am sure you will too.The Game PlayAs a Damned survivor your aim is to escape by finding keys, unlocking doors and finding an exit. Whether you work as a team with your friends is up to you. As there is nothing like running from something that is trying to kill you, and closing a door before your friend manages to make it.Ultimately killing your friend, although don't expect him to hold the door in the future.The monsters of Damned work differently but all have the same goal kill all survivors and stop them escaping.With four monsters to choose from each one works differently, giving different ways to hunt down your friends. Let their screams echo throughout.DifficultyThe difficulty of this game is based on the skill of the person who plays the monster and how good you are at surviving.This game also becomes easier when you start to familiarise yourself with the maps and locations of items spawns, items are still randomly spawned.A few options the host can choose to make this game more challenging such as giving survivors only one life.Controls & InterfaceGenerally keyboard and mouse is what the game is geared towards although I am aware there is partial to full controller support. (Have not tested this)AchievementsDamned has simple achievements that won't take long to unlock if you really want them.StoryThere is no story for this game or single player.Combat System Only monsters can engage in combat with claws, talons and touch. Once a survivor gets hit you die.Run, run, run don't look back.Skills & TraitsNo skill trait system.Sounds & EffectsHaunted house ambient style music keeps you immersed.GraphicsGraphics are nothing amazing, but the designs of the maps set the scene quite well.Only thing I would say that bothers me is some jump scare effects that sometimes pop and break the immersion.Random scary face, for the win. - This may have been changed.Although the lighting effects and the hands are okay although could be tweaked.MultiplayerThis game has a fantastic multiplayer, but I strongly recommend playing with friends as I found it very enjoyable this way.I can definitely say they had me running for my life. Personal Experience: - Courtesy of my friend WeaverWhen you think your safe in a room, with Mary creepily looking at you through the window as you hold onto the door hand for dear life. Suddenly Mary disappears (Randomly teleporting is one of her abilities).... Phew I am safe. ....Wait what's this, I can still hear her sinister whispering. Turning around to see her behind me I freak-out and try to escape.... I never made it out alive.As I then hear my friend laughing at me on teamspeak.Bugs - ImportantUnfortunately this game does have a few bugs here and there, some of them add to the charm but some can be a little annoying. Such as items not spawning and such.Also some rare issues of the game crashing and or not starting, make sure to verify game integrity, also check your firewall settings as this may help.I know the devs are working on fixes and updates but it seems to be a slow process.ConclusionSo overall I found this game terrifying and great to play with friends, playing a few games with random people was less immersive as I didn't know them.This game is great for a good scare and can make you jump or screaming out loud for your life. As I am sure your neighbours or someone you live with will possibly think you are being murdered in real life.If you love scare genres, par the bugs and minor issues you will love this game. I hope the developers will release more content and keep any fixes and updates coming. Or a Damned IIHope I helped, good luck.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												This game is still early access, so this review is subject to change/additionsDamned is basically what it says on the Tin. A survival horror game for 5 players (Maximum) where four play scavenger hunt Point A to point D item findings, and one player plays one of (Currently 3) monsters to murder your friends. Fun for everyone, especially if you have friends who enjoy screaming very loudly at your music-cue arrival. Lets get down to it.Gamplay involves item-based problem solving. Simple stuff. Find key, key goes to Locker, locker goes to safe, safe goes to kitchen, kitchen goes to crowbar, crowbar goes to wood over door, escape through door. Not always that simple, but basically always that formula. You have to find keys, unlock doors and safes, and escape out of the final door while eluding the monster player. Not always so easy.The Monster player has 3 monsters to choose from (At the time of this review) being Lurker, Phantom, and Mary. Lurker is your tall and gruesome skinless hulkbeast who spends a majority of the game in ""Phase mode"" which is where the player will move around quickly, phasing through doors (Cause you cant see them) and players (Who you also cant see) and setting traps. Since you can't see players, you need to use the traps to figure out their locations. Once they set one off, and it lets you phase in, you pop in and slice them to ribbons.The phantom is like a satanic stevie wonder. A floating torso who is completely blind to anyone unless they make a lot of sound. This means running, and clicking your flashlight. And getting too close. Make too much noise, and you'll show up in his vision as a white life-form that he can go maul. It's a fairly simple system, and I've nearly had it gotten around when I played him.Mary is your near-typical japanese-horror esque girl. Similar in design to popular ones like the Ring, or grudge. For a majority of the game she moves slower than a 95 year old man walking through hot tar. She also randomly teleports as a way to balance and make your life easier. You might teleport in the same room as the players, might not. You can also manually teleport, but we'll get to that in a second.Mary has the ability to enter a /frenzy/ mode when her meter (Which you dont see) fills. Stare at the players enough, and you can activate frenzy mode. a 10-15 second burst of quadrupled speed in which she screams violently, goes all scary faced and comes bullrushing you. You can also exchange a bit of the frenzy meter for another teleport, if you dont wanna wait for the freebie random one.There are about 12+ stages right now, with the most recent (At the time of this review) being a forest/camping area. The game does have some flaws, like optimization issues, data leaks, and minor coding bugs. Updates are also somewhat slow, but when they come around they are very nice. Running on my toaster I get about 25-30 frames in a map. Apparently a high-end gets about the same, due to optimization issues. It happens.I can't really rate it with a number right now, but I am giving it a yes. It's a nice game, for a beta.			"

												This is proof that a game can have co-op/multiplayer and still be incredibly scary.There's a good variety of maps in the game, and the developers seem to add more and more every once in a while. There's a lot of variety in the monsters. One person gets to be the monster while the others are humans trying to escape. The monster player can choose from a handful of monster types, including a blind ghost who can only see by sounds (like sprinting, opening/closing doors, etc.), a ghost girl that's basically Samara from The Ring, and a large brute creature that can turn invisible.Sadly, the game seems to be dying. The last few nights that I've tried to play, I haven't been able to get into a single match. There's always a private server with 2 or 3 players in it (the game is 5 player max), and then one sole person sitting in a server, but no one else joins (and 1v1 isn't very exciting in this game).It's a great game, and by far the best multiplayer horror game (White Noise Online is the only other one I can think of, though), but while I do recommend it, I only recommend buying it if it's on sale (meaning there'll be more people playing it while it's on sale) or if you have at least two or three other friends wanting to also play it with you.

												Horror type of game, if there is something I'm sure of - it's that if you play with your friends (as I am), you will and I am not joking - hate these friends once your done playing.Damned is a very intense horror game where you are a survivor that need to escape from a monster  by finding keys to find your way out, or you play as the ghost and your objective is to prevent the survivors to escape.Since Damned is still under ""production"", the game has come very far if you ask by me and it seems as I am not the only one that experiance great gameplay by this game. I hope that it gets more attention by us, fellow gamers and community that is Steam.Definitely worth buying. A perfect christmas present if you want to scare a friend! x)//Ankh			"

								I know I've only played 2 hours, but it's an alpha and currently there isn't much new past 2 hours.This game is fun as hell. Disclaimer: I play with a set group of friends who are guaranteed to communicated well & effectively, your experience with random public players will likely be less than satisfactory.This game is really fun, especially when you know everybody. When you're being hunted by the monster you get frantic looking for keys, and when you're the monster it's amazing just trying to plan out when you're going to get survivors or if you just want to scare them for a little bit.Since this is an alpha, there are a few glitches. Some people have issues with alt-tabbing, other times players apparently can't connect. There is also the occassional crash (I haven't crashed or experienced any bugs except the following one). The only game-breaking bug (as in you have to go to a new round) is when you spawn in a room and cannot get out or if you cannot continue, however this is extremely rare.This game shows a lot of promise and is currently extremely fun. There is proximity chat which can be hilarious when the lurker uses it!			"

								This game is very very fun.  And gameplay is simple yet very complex.There are 4 humans trying to escape a building.  Throughout each map are keys and other items that the humans need to find in order to escape.  The placement of the items and paths randomize on each map so you have a different experience each time.  As a human you use a combination of left mouse button and mouse movements to open and close doors and drawers.  You also get a flashlight and you can sprint for short periods of time (with a slow regen of sprint).  You can't fight the monsters; all you can do is run, hide and die.There are 2 types of monsters with very different abilities.  The basic mission for the monster is to kill all the humans which is often easier said than done.This game is very fun to play as people will regularly freak out and scream sounding like a little girl.

After waiting for the sale for so long and for some features to be added I finally got this game and I've enjoyed it a lot. Aside from the fact that I enjoy scaring people, the gameplay on both the monster side and the human side are definitely both enjoyable. This game would probably be even better buffed if it had more features added in the future.Try to grab this game on a sale and definitely look at some gameplay videos before you buy it.

												Do you like horror puzzle games without weapons like Amnesia, Penumbra, or Outlast? Do you like co-op games like Left 4 Dead, or Payday?Then this great but limited game of cat and mouse might be for you. Playing as one of 4 survivors working together (or against each other) is terrifying especially when players start dropping like flies. Playing as one of 3 selectable monsters is extremely fun if you've read the guides to learn how they work because each one has different strengths/weaknesses and the game doesn't tell you anything. Downsides:Limited monsters to selectVery small amount of players on at any given timePoor server browser with no ability to filter full or private matches (and no single player)Prone to crashes and players drop out of matches too often, causing everyone else to leave. Some graphical imperfections that take away from the experienceStill love it, and would like to see the game progress in future.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												It's not at all as scary as you might think. Knowing that your friend is playing the monster really takes the edge off. Playing 4 guys against an AI would be a lot scarier tbh. Also servers seem to crash fairly often. We had ""server maintenance"" most of the night, then finally got to play for about an hour until we got ""sever maintenance"" again. For 50% off it's not terrible value, but don't expect more than one night's worth of entertainment.			"

												In Damned, four people play as survivors and one as a spooky monster. There are three monsters implemented so far to choose from, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The survivors collect keys and batteries and try to open enough doors to get to the exit. A very simple premise to a game that can be loads of fun, but also equally annoying when you meet someone who just uses the monster to wipe everyone out in the first minute.Damned is a game about chilling fear, amazing atmosphere and occasional jump scares. I think a lot of people underestimate the value of stalking a completely frightened prey, instead of killing it immediately. It’s priceless. I’ve seen things in this game that only happen in the best Horror movies, and have left me spooked to death.Let’s be clear, it’s not perfect. There are still numerous bugs, sometimes the map or a character will get bugged and you won’t be able to progress. Is it still worth the money? For the full price, maybe (simply because it's buggy and laggy). For the 50% discount that happens pretty much every month, definitely.			"

								As much as I enjoy playing this game, especially with friends, I find that this game shouldn't have been released until they've put more work in it. Still lots of crashing and connectivity problems causing it hard to persuade others to buy the game thus creating more active servers. Ghosting can be an issue, which is why I always ask others to join VOIP and also makes it alot more fun.			"

												I have less than an hour on this game, and I have already got a huge problem with it. Let me just say I think that this game could be VERY good. But at the moment? It's unplayable! Before even getting into the game I had to battle with a server. I can't click leave lobby, I can't click choose a character and I can't even click start a game. My only option was to join someone elses server... There I also couldn't click leave or choose a character. So I went into the game as a random character. The 'helpful text' flashes up and disappears before you have a chance to read it and understand anything. Other than that (which isn't very useful anyway) you don't get any kind of tutorial, nothing else will tell you how to play the game. Because of this I died the second I entered the game - and let me clarify this was a server with new players on it.It activated my microphone, so I was talking to my boyfriend at the time of playing and random people could hear me talk!! I'm not happy about this!! This should be changed!! I purchased a 4-pack for me, my boyfriend and two of our friends, and I am not happy. I wish I hadn't. Although the game looks very good (as I've already said) it's just totally unplayable right now!! I haven't even been able to see who any of the characters are, what any of the monsters do or what the actual objective us (although I guess it's purely to survive and not stab yourself from pure frustration).Don't buy this game, unless it's on a REALLY good sale. Then don't play it. DO NOT PLAY until this game is ACTUALLY finally fixed. It's just impossible.			"

												Damned Pros and cons and overall thoughtsDamned is a fun, multiplayer survival horror game where 4 people (Or less) play as survivors while the 5th player chooses one of 4 monsters and has to try and kill the survivors, each monster being unique in it's own way.===Pros*Cool Music/Sound Effects*Allows Co-Op which most horror games do not have*Nice Push/Pull system with doors and drawers. (Like an Amnesia: The Dark Descent)*Unique Character models and graphics*Tons of maps*Unique and easy to pick up mechanics*Simple hosting/connecting to friends*Good Sp00ks with insanity effects*Literally like goosebumps the game. (The goosebumps theme fits so well it's not even funny)===Cons*Some maps and monster combinations make the game extremely difficult or too easy*Some monsters are more overpowered than others*Some maps are very hard to find keys on. Ex: Black Lake*Performance problems on the highest settings (And I have a decent gaming computer)===All around very fun and unique game experience. 10/10Will play again. "

BETA REVIEWPlaying Damned has been almost a very positive experience for me so far.there is plenty of maps and 3 different types of monsters by far i would have to say the Lurker is very easy to play and would probably be the best monster to start with if you want to make a grown man screamThe atmosphere of the game is perfect and if you are truely looking for scares turn the lights off in your room put on a headset and get ready to scream.Playing this game with friends is absolutely fantastic i end up screaming like a little girl alot.if you are having problems like frame rate issues when you first play the gametry restarting your computer if that doesnt work than unistall the game and reinstall it and restart your computer it worked for me i just hope it works for other people.overall this game is a 8/10 for me.

												Absolutely a fun game with friends-- especially if they have microphones. Three types of monsters, each with their own playstyle that the survivors will have to adapt to in order to survive.But surviving is not enough, as the longer you take, the less sane you become. You not only imagine sounds that others cannot hear, but you see the faces of the dead, your flashlight flickers without cause, your hearing becomes impaired, and worse.Your ultimate objective is to find a key to unlock another door that hopefully has the one key you need to unlock your only escape. Be sure to check each drawer, stove, counter top, table, and bucket, because the keys-- and batteries for your flashlight-- could be anywhere, just like the monster.Did you see Mary when you turned that corner? Hopefully not, because that means she saw you. Did that clock make a loud noise as you passed it? Hope you are just going crazy, because that means the Lurker found you. Did that strange apparition spook you as you turned the corner? Hope not, because any noise you make as a result brings it right to you.While the game itself is extremely fun with friends who have microphones and with a monster who would rather toy with you than kill you right away, there is a noticeable lack of optimization. I used to be able to run this game well enough 45+ FPS normally on my mid-end system, but it suddenly dropped to 15 and less. Many solutions did not work, but one did; uninstall, reboot, reinstall.

												This game had great potential. Turns out it's just a great scam. Game only worked less than a quarter of the time I tried to play, and it's been nothing but constant framerate issues and impossible to even open. The Developers don't listen to the players and when(if) they update it, it's with whatever some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t no one needs.			"

												-----------------------------------------------------------------Damned-----------------------------------------------------------------Damned is a multiplayer horror game, where 4 players play as survivors and 1 player plays as a monster. in the same vain as Dead by daylight, but one of the differences is that Damned takes place inside a house/asylum, while DBD takes place mostly outside. another difference is the gameplay is Vastly different, so much so that you cant even compare them. for instance, Damned is much, much, much, much worse. The controls are clunky and uncomfortable. And the door controls are HORRIBLE. they try to be like amnesia, in the way you click and drag, but they somehow screwed it up. its unresponsive and when you finally do get it, it goes a bit too far and you get stuck. Waiting for the monster to come and eat you up.Some good stuff is that the monsters powers and model are very well done and well thought out.but thats not enough to save this game from its rating.-----------------------------------------------------------------3/10-----------------------------------------------------------------			"

												It's worth it. I had waited so long for a sale and it was definitely worth it. After waiting for the sale for so long and for some features to be added I finally got this game and I've enjoyed it a lot. Aside from the fact that I enjoy scaring people, the gameplay on both the monster side and the human side are definitely both enjoyable. This game would probably be even better buffed if it had more features added in the future.Try to grab this game on a sale and definitely look at some gameplay videos before you buy it. Don't take anyone's word for it. You should definitely consider your options before buying it.			"

												Do you like horror puzzle games without weapons like Amnesia, Penumbra, or Outlast? Do you like co-op games like Left 4 Dead, or Payday?Then this great but limited game of cat and mouse might be for you. Playing as one of 4 survivors working together (or against each other) is terrifying especially when players start dropping like flies. Playing as one of 3 selectable monsters is extremely fun if you've read the guides to learn how they work because each one has different strengths/weaknesses and the game doesn't tell you anything. Downsides:Limited monsters to selectVery small amount of players on at any given timePoor server browser with no ability to filter full or private matches (and no single player)Prone to crashes and players drop out of matches too often, causing everyone else to leave. Some graphical imperfections that take away from the experienceStill love it, and would like to see the game progress in future.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

								Awesome game,The same fear levels & enjoyment as with Slender Man, The only difference is, it's one of YOU who is the monster!...The only thing wrong with this game I can see at the moment is the player pool!...Where is everybody? This game has so much to offer, yet so little people are interested.Maybe they should try giving a free for 24-48 hour opportunity.The maps are lovely & spooky, the monster is really creepy looking, and theres more monsters to come!,the music drives you slightly insane, and there is nothing worse than being on your own for too long.I'm really looking forward to this new insanity system, I think it will really give players a chill while being the last survivor!I hope to see more of you creeping down the halls!Fully recommend this game!

												This game is clearly a cash in on other  a-synchronous multiplayer games being conceptualized off of popular board games. 1 monster vs. 4 survivors is a great concept that this one doesn’t fully realized.The monsters are fine but the only object for the survivors is to find keys to open doors. THAT IS ALL. Me and my friends would voluntarily sit and do nothing as the monster to find all of the keys or get to the end. After 2 hours we gave up. It very much feels like a game that cannot be won on the survivor’s side because the win state and objective for them wasn’t fully realized.The maps are either too narrow or too large and all of the environments feel recycled and with irrelevant obstacles in them.If this concept excites you play board games with this premise or wait for “Last Year”.

								Damned takes the best parts of TTT and mashes it together with Prophunt, Darkest Days, and The Hidden. It's legitimately terrifying, and has randomly generated maps and objectives. A player is randomly selected to be the monster, and each monster requires a different playstyle both to hunt, and to dodge.Objectives are random and strewn across the map, but scripted  in such a way that that requires you to cover the entire map to escape. You'll never spawn in a room you can't escape from.			"

Apparently they've been down for 24 hours with no word from the devs. Why do they need their own authentication servers in the first place?After careful review, I decided to close the game, although not after feeling a small twinge of pity for the poor sod who bought it for me.I recommend this game to fans of intrusive DRM and login screens.

												A great idea for survival horror, and one I hope continues in its development.  The problem, though, is the VOIP feature which rips the atmosphere right out of the game, coupled with the god-awful framerate which makes playing as a survivor difficult, and playing as a monster impossible.  Great concept, not quite ready for commericalization.  Do not recommend at this time.			"

												The game requires you to attach your account to your product key, but God help you if you forget that information. Purchased an additional copy for my alternate account and now it's impossible to login to it, and as a result is impossible to play it because I don't remember the account info. Ridiculous DRM for a steam game because the devs can't be bothered to incorporate steam logins directly into the account info.			"

												This is basicly Dead by Daylight but it's actually scary. In all honesty though, this is one of the most wonderful games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It is in my opinion, the paramount of Multiplayer Horror and it is one of the few in that Genre to be honestly scary. The game would be very close to perfect, but if I said it was I would be lieing. There is ofcourse as with any game, the occasional bug and at times it may be hard to find an open game for you to play due to the occasional lack of games and players. But the game itself is simply impecceble, the atmosphere instills genuine feelings of suspense and fear and the monsters are as ingenious as they are terrifying. And this game accomplishes all of that on Multiplayer. It's a shame it isnt more popular but honestly; buy this game. It's a must have. You'll be looking for keys for weeks!			"

												The game includes a community which, doesn't make an aweful lot of sense.  They mic spam, complain endlessly, and kick you if you kill them as the monster for most of the games I've been in.   Atop of that, sometimes it can just be incredibly boring wandering aimlessly not knowing where the humans are for significant periods of time.  I initially gotten the game before it came to steam, and was rather into it at first; but I never really could sit down and play it much ever since till recently.Other issues I have with it, the sound effects are bad, the music is bad, the hit detection is bad, the server choices is garbage, as well as the active community I've encountered, and the gameplay is significantly below what you'd expect out of a $20 game.

												Damned is a survival horror game where Humans are trapped inside a map for example a asylum and have to escape. While theyre trying to find keys to escape theyre not alone, Theyre being hunted by monsters (Lurker, Phantom or Mary) All monsters have advantages and disadvantages. For example mary is a very slow moving character but when you stare at humans for a certain amount of time she will be given the option to go into frenzy mode meaning she will then be really fast and then will be able to kill the humans. The goal is to escape as humans or to kill evey human thats trap inside as a monster.This game is alot of fun especially with groups of friends in a skype or steam group call which can make games insanly fun and alot of funny moments. I would give this game a 9/10 and definatly recomend it to anyone.			"

												This is my first review but i hope this helps other people see how awesome this game is. I know I have only played this game for like 2 hours but thats all you need for such an awesome game however there were some parts that were annoying but wasnt enough to destroy the game play.Outside of gameplay:+ I experienced that the cursor was guite laggy (slight stutters)+ If you did not put full screen on your cursor could not click the side options (so put fullscreen on)+ Sometimes Alt+tab would glitch my resolution or just crash the game so I just avoided that.Gameplay:+ Fun to play (if you have friends)+ The maps are good but if there is not time limit it can get a bit boring as some of the maps are big making it hard and iritating for anyone playing the monster.+ The monsters are cool and its nice they have some handi caps so they are not too OP + I feel there should be more than 3 monsters but the game is still tons of fun just with 3 because they all have their own unique ability.+ More monsters to choose from would be nice+ If normal characters had special abilities assigned to them would be awesome.Overall, this game is fun even for someone like me who hates these kind of games but its just a great way fro you and your friends to engage with each other, if you like thrillers/jumpscares.

For this uncompleted buggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in Alpha version? Much mods from half life 2 are free and works much much better without bugs (for example no more room in hell) ....About gameplay, it´s just about survivors who need find keys and get away, against them is 1 monstrum (controlled by player)  and the monstrum is trying to kill the survivors with traps or just with hands.The worst thing is PvE doesn´t work here ..... The AI of monstrum is not working, you can hear him but the monstrum is just staying somewhere and AFKing .....No more comment for this game, the price is real 19,99 euros it doesn´t worth for it. It´s just another uncompleted bad Mod from Half Life 2 with lots of buggs and low framerates. My friend owns gtx 980 + I7 4790 16 GB ram and he can feel little stuttering in some areas, that optimization is really terrible :(  BAD GAME, get better Contagion instead of this and You will be Happy!4/10 (4 points for cards and horror atmosphere)Thumb Down For ME.

												Can't recommend it at this point in time. It's got some real entertaining moments, but there are too many little things that ruin it. The game is heavily biased in favor of the monsters. It's very rare for the survivors to actually win the round. The maps are garbage and cluttered with too much stuff that gets in the way. And the biggest issue is that when people leave the game, which they do frequently, the character they were playing as goes away, but late joiners can't replace them. So usually the game quickly turns into a 1v2 instead 1v5. Maybe they'll improve it in the future. Like I said, it's fun. Anyone who wants a quick fix survival horror game will enjoy it for a while, but it's got too many problems to last.			"

												This game has great potential. My friends and I enjoyed a couple of play throughs, but it quickly lost its appeal. The monsters lack a lot of animation and are more of jump scares than anything. Monsters from other games have more animations and scares than this, even for other indie games. It looks more like stiff zombie monsters gliding towards you. If they had more animations and better sound, then I would easily recommend this game. It honestly feels like the devs halfassed it and put it out just to see how it went, after that they barely improve anything. In the end, if you enjoy cheap thrills and playing with friends, this game works for you. But if you want something worth your time and your friends, then don't buy this game, especially not for $20.			"

												Unifinished and frustrating.Once you're in the game: it's amazing. As a survivor, you're scrambling, looking for the keys out of the haunted area while freaking yourself out as every sound and odd sight could be sign of the monster coming to kill you in one hit.As a monster, it's an incredibly fun game of hide and seek, where you're trying to get in the head of survivors and figure out where they're gonna be, Monsters are slow, so kills are almost always accomplished by laying out an ambush.The problem is it crashes and bugs out so often, usually leaving you hanging on a screen with no notion of what's happening. I figure about 25% of my time playing this game is spent dealing with crashes, bugs, and looking for viable online games to join. This game should still be listed as Early Access, caveat emptor.			"

												If you're the kind of person who gets frustrated by bugs preventing you from playing 50% of the time, please wait until you try Damned. Otherwise you'll get to enjoy 10-15 minutes at a time of a fun, engaging experience trying to outrun a creepy monster that makes you afraid of even using your flashlight.Except, then you die, you try to find another lobby to keep playing..... aaaaaand you crash/freeze.In all of 1 hour's play, my personal experience was:- Multiple ""Server down for maintenance"" messages preventing connection.- Multiple ""Your account is already in use"" messages when trying to reconnect after a crash.- Connected to lobbies without seeing anyone when the player count is above zero.- Connection causes a crash.- Game load causes a freeze. Arriving in a game right after load = also a freeze.- Graphics flickers on older (3 year-old) systems, really affects the experience negatively (I was on a LAN with a friend whose computer is not powerful enough to play this simple game well).Get past the above and the game is fun, although so short, it's always a gamble as to whether you'll be able to reconnect without a crash or a freeze and play for longer than one session.I'll edit this if and when they fix the bugs... until then, will not be touching it again.

												This a great fun game for anyone that enjoys getting scared. Every playthrough is different, and thus, the chills are as effective as the last game. Nothing is predictable.The only con is I want more monsters and fixes. It has become alot more stable though, so I enjoy it <3But more monsters! More stuff!!! :D			"

												The game is quite fun. However, just as other players have suggested, some of the monsters need to be better balanced. Some monsters are way too OP (Phantom and Lurker especially) while the others (May and Fallen) are very hard to play with. I like the idea behind Fallen especially, but only having 7 seconds to attack a running player at walking speed after spending 5+ minutes trying to get energy is taxing on the fun. I am also slightly concerned about the price of the game given the amount of content that it has and also how the product itself appears in its current state. There is much potential to this game as it is very unique in that it gives a personal horror experience that is fun with your friends (which you can have up to five of them playing including yourself). However, in its current state, it is not worth $20. I got the game on sale for around $7 and I don't feel I wasted money, however, if I had paid $20 for it, I may have been slightly disappointed. I think $10 would be a fair price for the game in it's current state. Some suggestions that I have personally is adding some new monsters, like maybe a clown (an omage to Pennywise from IT), warewolf, alien (like alien vs predator)... the more options the better. That goes for the survivors as well. While there may only be 4 survivors total in a given game, giving more characters too choose from would be awesome. There is only one female to choose from in the list of survivors, while there could be an all male team, or an all female team. Giving more options allows players to connect better through the character they choose. Another critique is that some of the locations are identical. While there are plenty of locations to choose from, the hotels look very similar to each other, and so do the hospitals. It takes away each location's uniqueness. The forest and the diner and warehouse are good locations. But if there are going to be multiple hotels and multiple hospitals it would be wise to consider making them vastly unique from each other. Overall the game is great, but I would say that the biggest con is that it is overpriced given the amount of conent that it has. When this game is on sale, I recommend getting it, as it is fun to play with friends.			"

Early Access Review
								Though this game is in alpha I've sinserly enjoyed the idea of playing through a horror survival game with friends. The fact that you can play as a survivor or play as the monster murdering everyone is just as exciting as it is terrifying. The sounds are decent, though could use much improvement to create a better ambience and create that paranoid feeling we all love in our horror games. Very excited for the final release, until then happy hunting! *Muhahahahhahaha...* "

												Love it. Even with all its glitches I've been playing this game since it first came out on steam or very close to it when there were hardly any maps. Have fun with it! It's a game to play with your friends but I have enjoyed a fair share of games alone on my own with strangers and had just as much fun.Love the maps and the replay value of the game since every map the keys are different locations and doors are unlocked at different times during playing. I'm excited to see what new spooky locations they add in the future and different monsters they add. If you can look passed the glitches of this alpha game its great.			"

												A fun, yet bone-chilling experience which will easily give you the shakes, especially when you can't tell where certain ""enemies"" are. -And despite the fact that the enemy is controlled by a Player, it makes the experience MUCH more difficult.Damned offers a small selection of characters and monsters to play as, one player will be chosen or chooses a monster character. The rest choose which of the four characters (hiding their names to prevent spoilers.) they would like to play as.With chilling scenarios and levels, filled with multiple ""traps"" which spring to life when close to them, the monster could be anywhere, and could start their rampage against the survivors in order to prevent their escape. I suggest this game to anyone who's willing to frighten themselves or... play a horror game worthy of clothing change. highly recommended XD			"

												Do NOT buy this game.Go look at the forums please. I got this game on sale a while back and it was a big mistake.The idea of the game is fun, but the idea has been done much better on other games. This game rarely gets updates. The community on the game is not high. The monster selection is low and the surviver selection is low. If you play one to two matches with each monster then you will get the game. When the monster you would think it is fun, but no it isn't. As the monster you spend most of the time running around hoping to bump into someone. As a survivor you run around hoping to find a key. You will only get a fast, maybe interesting, game if both monster and players know the map by heart and memory and where stuff tends to be located. Sometimes the game will bug and you can't pick up a key you need or open a door even if you have the right key. Also, if you are playing and the person as the monster leaves the game your entire game is ruined and you are ♥♥♥♥ed. The game wont end automatically nor will it put someone as the monster like any good game mechanic would do.The game itself is really buggy. The engine this runs on is apparently poop so thats a thing.Here is their official website:http://www.9heads.com/games/damned/This link should illustrate the quality they put out. Here is a quote from the devs, ""9heads also uses free programming libraries and engine such as Ogre3D and Bullet Physics proving that you can achieve very nice results with exceptional free/open-source stuff out there.""

								After 59 hours of gameplay, lots of hours of watching videos and reading stuff about the game, I'm ready to write a review.This is, so far, the best survival/horror game I've played in the past few years.Even though it's an Early Access Game I can absolutely say it's worth the price. 9heads (developer) keeps looking at the feedbacks in the Steam forums, and updates the game regularly.Most bugs and glitches can be fixed, and 9heads keeps releasing fixes.One of the best games to play with your friends. Me and my friends had awesome nights playing this, also made some friends in this game.A few things need to be balanced, and 9heads is taking feedback on that.			"

												I'm not really sure what to give this game. The past month I've been losing connection in every server I join, and I know it's not because of my connection.If I had to give it a rating based off my previous experience? I'd give it an 8/10, because the only issues I have are the lack of monsters and the spectating.If I had to give it a rating based off of the last month of me trying to play it, I'd give it a 2/10, because I still got to play in a server for like two minutes before diconnecting.

												I picked up this game a couple years ago and it showed a lot of promise, as this type of game wasn't terribly common. The whole one monster 4 survivor thing. My friends and I played it and had fun, but I've since discovered a much better game that's the exact same price. If you're looking at this game chekc out the game Dead by Daylight. It's a much MUCH better game than this is. Maybe if this was more like $10-$15 it might be worth it. But the $20 you'd spend on this you'd have a much better time with Dead by Daylight			"

												It took me a while to get this game to work since i had the issue where my FPS would not go higher than 15 FPS but after some tweaking and one good reboot later i got it to run smoothly and i enjoyed the game alot. It is specially fun if you play with your friends and i'd imagine that one can easily spend some time playing this game during weekends for jumpscares and laughs. This game should not be taken too seriosly since the survivor goals tend to feel a little bit tedious and frustrating at times. Clearly it is much more fun to be the monster than a survivor but if you are playing with friends it really does not matter what happens.The game itself is buggy and still as it seems a work in progress but if you can make it run good you are about to have some good time.So i would say 3/5 for the overall experience and 5/5 for the spooky atmosphere and that is where this game is at its strongest. I strongly recommend trying this one out specially if it's on sale,			"

								This game is still early in development, but man is it alot of fun! Scary to be the humans, and super exciting to be the monster as well. The constant updates are infused with input from players themselves, making the developers probably some of the best that exist right now in my opinion. A great game for a group of friends to have heart attacks together.			"

												Cannot recommend this enough for a group of friends if you can buy it for all 4-5 people. Even 3 if you have to. Great time. Maps and graphic optimisation drag the game down a bit, there are a couple that seem identical, if not deserve to just be merged into a bigger one because they look very similar in terms of color, style etc. Graphic optimisation here is tough. Not something you should worry about though because the graphics aren't much even on max, and you aren't here for that anyway. The horror is good enough to give this game about 7/10. Above average and greatly worthy of your money and time if you can round up at least 3 people including yourself. If not, you're not a big loss as you can always find good people to play with and the population of lobbys never seems to have decreased. I do feel however that the monsters you can play as, need very VERY close watching from the developers. There looks like there might start to be this trend of: monsters that are just out to kill, not scare the players. This is why I fear the Lurker more than any other monster in the game, because killing the survivors in this game isn't the prime focus, it's more of a balance between wanting to scare them too.I want people to note that the game's soundtrack is by far one of the best I've seen in a while. For a small time composer, it definetly in my opinion rivals the soundtracks in bigger ones, because the composer (Matt Collins, whom if you search for the Damned soundtrack on youtube, you can find) has just a vast knowledge of how to orchestrate such dynamic, classic and grand pieces.. pieces I hope to see more of, but I doubt I will. Quality soundtracks are hard to come by, not every game's complete soundtrack is actually worth listening to. That being said, please give this game a try if you can gather 2 friends to play with, I promise you're in for a treat. And please remember to note down and give credit to Matt Collins for the game's score, he's talented and you'll see.			"

There aren't many Co-op games i can think of that scare you silly, but this does!I have a highlight video on my profile if you want to see what the game is like.The rat in a maze mentality really helps to put you on edge. I've been playing with friends and whilst you're frantically searching for items to aid your escape nothing quite prepares you for the moster to suddenly appear.Yet to escape... but i'm having a fun time trying.

												This game is amazingly fun and the best of its specific  ""coop horror/player as monster""  genre. You might say, you only have an hour, how do you know?Well its because it was 2am and my friends were all horrified after 3 rounds, and refused to play anymore that night.Either way, its not a cheaply designed game that could just be a gamemode in Gmod (cough dead realm) and there is strategy and cooperation which is really fun. If you have friends (I know doesnt apply to everyone), get this game.  "

												Damned can be a tough sell, and for good reason. Back when I bought it, sitting in a lobby for over a minute without the host starting the game basically guaranteed hard crashes for all involved. This has been (mostly) fixed, the game will still randomly kick people for no reason, and isn't very well optimized, but if playing with people you know you'll be hard pressed to find a better multiplayer horror experience when everything DOES work.Gameplay:The game is multiplayer slender with amnesia click-and-hold door controls and a battery/flashlight system that would make Jim Sterling cry. You find keys (rather than notes) and use them to open doors to find more keys until you escape, all while being hunted by one of the various monsters (played by a real person). Each monster has their own little twist on gameplay, and by far the most tense moments of the game are when you're limited in where you can travel (no keys) and don't know which monster's playstyle to counter.That's what the gameplay is, but is it fun?: Yes. Play. Damned. With. Friends. Hop in a VC, que it up, and make the monster mute himself except for the occasional brag directly after scoring a kill. You'll be amazed how quickly you can betray someone, locking them out of a room and leaving them to die in order to ensure you stay alive. You'll feel genuine relief when you cycle keys as a team to finally open that last exit door. Resource management with batteries usually feels like a tacked-on timekill mechanic, but in Damned you have to share those resources amongst 4 people, which adds to the urgency quite effectively.Playing as the monster is a blast too. Sometimes you'll get a series of bad ports as Mary, or noone will hit your traps on Lurker, but setting up a legit jumpscare makes it all worth it. My friends and I have tons of stories along the lines of ""remember that time I made [friend] scream like a little ♥♥♥♥♥?"" Very few games give you that opportunity.Graphics:Meh. Mary and Fallen work well because they are meant to look stiff and plodding, but lurker looks like the monster from ""Boogeyman,"" and only will make you jump if he pops up right on your♥♥♥♥♥(which he often does). Character models are functional, as are animations. Environments are sufficiantly mood-supporting, but a LOT of the levels are ""re-arranged assets from our asylum level."" The most important thing is that the graphics rarely detract from the horror experience.Audio: Absolutely essential to have a good headset in order to get the full experience with this game. Most monsters set ""traps"" by interacting with objects in the environment that give off a sound que when the players pass by them. There is no worse feeling than stumbling through a hallway and triggering 3 or 4 traps in close succession, basically ensuring the monster knows exactly where you are. Ambient sound when the monster is close or is attacking further crank up the intensity, and the plinking minimalism of the rest of the audio just accents these bombastic moments even further.Overall: 6/10, 8/10 with lobby of friends. If you can, buy it on sale or in a 4-pack with friends pitching in, but $20 is a relatively fair price on its own.			"

												I picked up this game a couple years ago and it showed a lot of promise, as this type of game wasn't terribly common. The whole one monster 4 survivor thing. My friends and I played it and had fun, but I've since discovered a much better game that's the exact same price. If you're looking at this game chekc out the game Dead by Daylight. It's a much MUCH better game than this is. Maybe if this was more like $10-$15 it might be worth it. But the $20 you'd spend on this you'd have a much better time with Dead by Daylight			"

								This game is still early in development, but man is it alot of fun! Scary to be the humans, and super exciting to be the monster as well. The constant updates are infused with input from players themselves, making the developers probably some of the best that exist right now in my opinion. A great game for a group of friends to have heart attacks together.			"

												Devs where you at? Its an amazing game even better then Dead by Daylight but theres been 0 progress on the game for over a year now. Food for thought if you were to make this game into a hd remake, keep working on it from there, and advertise a lot more then you did for this game because almost everyone I know and talk to online think Dead by Daylight is the first game to do horror 4v1, the game would be a selling hit giving Damned the respect it deserves.For people out there looking into buying this game get it if your into horror games, its a blast when you first get it and you'll feel you got your moneys worth but just know its not Dead by Daylight graphics, it has a lot more to offer with its variety of maps and ways to escape.

												Very suspensful gameplay, even as just me and one other friend. The AI doesn't seem to work 100% (once that is sorted out, god help the solo-artists) but the ambient sounds and use of music is very impressive. It certainly creates an immersive atmosphere that makes the game incredibly unique. Not for the faint of heart, some of those that are easily scared will probably not fair very well after playing a round with Mary! But nevertheless, it is an incredible game that has got loads of potential! The fact you can't do anything, even jump makes the game so much more surreal. It's survival horror, without the killing and with more fear factor than you can imagine!			"

												The sensibility or insensitivity of a human, often considered with regard to a particular kind of stimulus, is the strength of the feeling it results in, in comparison with the strength of the stimulus. The concept applies to physical as well as emotional feeling. Stimulus may consist of any or all types of stimuli, including political, nationalistic, religious, physical, mental, emotional, etc. In the political sense, perception of and reaction to stimuli is often inculcated by - and for the benefit of - power holders.Sensibility of explosives is the degree to which an explosive can be initiated by impact, heat, or friction.Sensibility, along with stability and brisance are three of the most significant properties of explosives that affect their use and application. All explosive compounds have a certain amount of energy required to initiate. If an explosive is too sensible it may go off accidentally. A safer explosive is less sensible and will not explode if accidentally dropped or mishandled. However, such explosives are more difficult to initiate intentionally.The sensibility of an electronic device, such as a communications system receiver, or detection device, such as a PIN diode, is the minimum magnitude of input signal required to produce a specified output signal having a specified signal-to-noise ratio, or other specified criteria.

												This game is very fun, though the fun is shortlived. This isn't the game's fault though, the game is very interesting and unique, but the graphics are a little on the low side and the community is rather small. I highly recommend that if/when you play this, you gather a group of friends. A key part of this game is exploration; you have to run around the area to collect keys and batteries for your flashlight. There are cabinets and drawers you can open, and each building has a nice theme and design to it, The monsters are all unique and are each equally fun to play as. The trap system might take a little bit of time to get used to, but the audial cues are easy to hear.As a human, your character has no effect other than aesthetic. Being the black guy doesn't mean you will die first. "

												Game is hilarious, scary and most of all, fun! I'm only 6 hours in at the time of this review. It definitely has some bugs, most obvious is crashes at map load. It seems like sometimes you can wait 2-5 minutes and the map will load but someone or someones will always leave at that point. Sometimes the maps load within 10 seconds. Not sure what the deal is. I'm sure it'll be patched. Make sure you report bugs! I bought this game on sale during the christmas sale and honestly would have given full price for it. I'm having a blast.Gameplay wise seems decently balanced except when it's 1vs1 as mary. It seems like it can be impossible sometimes. Maybe I need a better strategy? Still a thumbs up!Thanks for the fun!			"

								Am I seriously missing something here?I'm not having a whole ton of fun with game. Tons of bugs and glitches everywhere, really bad performance issues. There is no tutorial or anything to help you, well you wont really need any help because all your gonna be doing through the whole game is PICKING UP KEYS AND UNLOCKING DOORS!!!!! Where is the variety guys? C'mon....The maps are decent but not too special, and how come being a monster just really sucks!?! You would think that you would feel pretty cool being a monster but in this GAME you feel so cheap and pathetic. I was hoping you could do many cool things as a monster like trigger things, make people hallucinate and like fly around and drop in right behind a dude and scare the living daylights out of him. BUT NO! You can't do that, well atleast from my playthroughs I couldn't. As a monster in this game, you run around the area searching for people for hours and hours and hitting them then in one hit, they're dead. Very misleading... I wasn't frightened one bit in this game, the only thing I could say that scared me much was the freaking music that plays when a person is running away from you while your the monster, it just suddenly pops in, scaring the bajeezus outta you. But one poor decision that I hate in this game is that when your the lurker, you can't see anybody until you manifest. I find it very stupid but some people might disagree with me. Only my opinionAll I can say left about this game is that the premise of it sounds incredible but the dev's executed it poorly. I know it's in a earlier stage of development but still feels like a very VERY earlier version of the game that the dev's should only have. PLEASE DEVELOPERS LISTEN OUT!!! Sorry for being harsh but please change some of these decisions that you've made, it would definitely change my thoughts about this a lot. Wait people, till these get fixed, I just can't recommend just yet.			"

								Unplayable.The potential is there- when and if you can connect to a game. However, this is seemingly impossible. There are maybe 3 hosted games at most at any given time- and there's a good chance only one of them is public (the full one.) Hosting a game is a futile gesture because no one is playing, no one is joining, and you can't play a game alone.I tried, and I ran around as a ghost with no one to scare or kill for 10 minutes. After I exited the game, Damned didn't understand that I couldn't die (as the ghost,) and therefore couldn't disconnect from the server... ever. It took me 45 minutes to get back to the lobby and then only after restarting my computer, which isn't really a viable option to use in order to shut down/restart the game. Especially a game which requires so much restarting to begin with. This isn't a beta, it's complete undeveloped and broken. The concept gets a gold star, though.			"

												I am re-writing my review.  The game FINALLY works.  I still cannot recommend it as the fact that you have to log into thier servers is so 1990's it is frankly offensive.  Expecially when you host the games on your connection.  I think if they remove that and finish optomizing the code I would recommend it.			"

								I really wish i could say that this is a good game, unfortunately I was never able to play enough to see. This game crashes at startup, at login, while connecting, etc. I believe this was a large waste of $15. To make matters worse, I couldn't even tab out to close the game. So, unless you enjoy games that crash after every little thing you do, don't buy this game.			"

												This might very well be the very worst Steam game I have ever played. One hour tops is all it takes to see every single detail this game has to offer. Nothing can compare to the disappointment of the moment of finally getting far enough to get the hammer or crowbar (did I mention this game is nearly impossible for the survivors to win?) only to find out that they aren't weapons, they're just glorified keys, used only for opening doors. This game has no spark of creativity, and no loving touch at all, it's just half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥garbage with as little actual content as physically possible, in the form of a barely playable game. Even managing that, the game still is riddled with bugs. The fact that this game is being sold for 20 dollars on Steam is an insult to cheaper games that vastly outshine it, and an insult to the customer, who won't get more than an afternoon out of it. I didn't even buy this game, I got it as a gift from a friend, and even I'm insulted.			"

More so, if you are sitting there playing the monster! Listening to friends on teamspeak scream when they see you in the distance or if they set off a trap you put down. Ide deff recommend this game, more so with friends. Again as something to go to once in a while to basically scare the heck outa ya!			"

												This game is creepy. To practice I will create a game and lock it so no one else can get in to play, Just to be able to figure out how to solve it, and it still creeps me out. Now add other players with one trying to kill you. or you can play as the monster and try to kill everyone. That's a bit more fun.Depending on the monster is how you will get through the map. Some require you to be quick, some require you to be stealthy. Is it better to stick together or split up? download the game and find out...			"

You've gotta ask yourselves who is f*cking who for RockPaperShotgun/Kotaku and Eurogamer to recommend this piece of sh*t game.  Gamergate,yo! ******DONT BUY THIS GAME.****  Maybe at a sale where's its like 1 euro.. maybe. I bought the pack and for 5 a piece.. Yea haha not worth it. The gamer experience, you may encounter when playing this game.Start up game, have a tiny window. Go to settings, selecting 1920x1080 does not mean fullscreen apparantly. Drag window after you manage to unstick your mouse. Select 'Full screen' aaand- CRASH.  Looking promising already. When killing the program dont kill the 'Game' kill the other 'Game' in your programs, killing the first one doesnt solve jack sh*t. Restart the game, oh! Full screen! .. But why is the image so small? Check Gamma settings, drag it ALL the way up to high in order to see all the individual slabs of gray, go back to the home screen and .. Woa, there was another image here? No, nope, its one image, just dark as f*ck which made you think 3/4 of your screen is just black by default. Alright! Initial grievances are forgiven and forgotten, lets do this sh*t! Start a game, looking for the lobby created by a friend. Er... its here... SOMEWHERE... FOUND IT! Locked the lobby with a password so we can be noobs amongst friends. Fill in password... Nothing happens.. Did I misspell it? I guess I did, lets try again.. Nope.. I spelled it right but it wont let me in. Its not even giving me a 'this aint the password, you fool', the password screen just poofs .. Did I crash again? Oh, nope, and you can start your search for that one specific lobby all over again. Restart the game. Alright, all in Lobby, lets do this. First impressions of the ingame enviroment. This is dark as f*ck! Where's my flashlight? Its not F, not E... Where dafuq is it? Right click?! What? .. Oh okay then. Picking up items, E? Nope. Left click. Opening doors, E? ... No.. more clicking. Well, not so much clicking as dragging apparantly. Okay I got keys, I got batteries, dont know what the hell is going on but lets do this. How do I acces my inventory? Can I acces my inventory? I cannot acces my inventory, but then how will I know what i've picked up? Dont question this sh*t, just roll with it this game will not explain sh*t to you. Mash your face against all the doors because its a hassle to try and open them and to figure out if you have the right key for this door or not.  I have 3 keys, can I toggle between them? No? So, should I assume that I use all the keys that I have on this one door that I'm currently humping? The door may be partially open, you may smash your weight in full against the door. That thing aint opening till you click and drag its♥♥♥♥♥open. HOLY SH*T WHAT WAS THAT. I am legit scared.. Why are there hands coming out of the floor?!Mini heart attack because my friend killed us all. Start a new lobby, now filled with extra randomers, it's all good. Start game, repeat. Running around the game for a full 20 minutes only to realise that our monster left, or disconnected or maybe more likely, crashed. Find out that you could open cabininets 'n shizzle, did I mention this game doesnt tell you sh*t? Start a new game, choose to be a monster this time. Got to be a Monster for a whole 5 seconds before CRASHHH. Not even 1 hour of play time, 3 crashes...  I'd grade this game a 2/10 would crash again.  "

												It is a decent game but it is still very buggy. The groups can be glitchy going into a game and starting a game. The game does not tell you when you are waiting for the group you joined to be out of a game. Sometimes players are stuck in limbo for long periods of time at the start of a game, even when others have been started. Some mosters move suuppperrrr slowlyyyy so it takes a while to get anywhere. some monsters dont kill when you press the button to kill. The only monster I have an issue with this is mary, but when she goes into frenzied mode you can kill others.			"

								Do NOT buy this game if you intend to play with friends, you might face unsolvable connection problems. These problems do not matter that much if you play alone with random people.1. We can not connect to each other despite port forwarding and such.2. ""Host Time Out"" or something. Yes, we googled and browsed the community hub for fixes. lol nope. No solution.3. Game randomly crashes when starting or exiting an ongoing match.After 1.2 hours of troubleshooting, we were not able to fix any of said problems.I played a quick game in a random lobby but got quickly turned off by some weird mouse stuttering. The game felt like its locked at 30 FPS because of this.I can not tell you anything about the gameplay though, because I did not actually play the game yet.I strongly suggest to wait until full release or at least until the beta launches. This game is way too unstable right now. "

								This isnt so much early access as ""early early access,"" or as normal people call it, ""scam""There are no explanations to CORE GAME MECHANICS. ""You want to know how something works? ♥♥♥♥ you, we arent going to tell,"" the game says. Speculation speculation speculation, that is what this game seems to go by. Anything pretty much goes in this game, there are no set rules. ♥♥♥♥, it even had an identity crisis upon launch as it said ""You have no activated your copy of TERROR yet."" Even the lobby is bugged, when the text box appears to be at the middle of the screen, but in reality, you have to type from the bottom left corner, where it looks like it is just empty.I really wanted to love this game, but right now, all I can feel is ""meh,"" borderline ""give me a refund""There is early access, then there is throwing out a barebones game and disregarding how rushed and empty it is just by saying ""hurr durr, its an alpha."" I wouldnt be surprised if they completely stopped development and ran off with this money.I'm still going to play it and try to convince myself it was worth it, while getting in the world's top scientists to determine what the ♥♥♥♥ the rules are in this game, because nobody else can seem to do so			"

								Game has a good concept, but the monster is overpowered. It's extremely easy for the monster to just sit and wait on the survivors to come and then it's a quick kill. The items you have to hunt are too ambiguious and you spend the majority of the time running from room to room looking for a very small item that is easily missed then running back to EVERY door and safe you have come across to see if it opens the said door. If it does, there's a 75% chance that the door you just opened has nothing of value.Great concept, but the items you have to find need to be made simpler because right now it just goes on forever looking for items and it's way too easy for the monster to find and kill the survivors.

												I never thought I would enjoy a game that treads to close to the ""note collector genre"" so heavily, but here I am. Damned is  an asymmetric 5-player multiplayer game where one player controls one of three different monsters, each with different abilities and methods of detecting the humans, and the other players play as humans trying to escape by finding keys and tools in the environment to make it through to the exit. The game has 12 maps, giving it a good amount of replayability. The voice chat system was one of my favorite parts of the game, featuring a 3D audio option that makes each player's voice come through their character's position instead of being global, encouraging them to stick together in standard horror movie fashion while also allowing the monster to taunt them.The thing that I like about this game is that unlike other asymmetrical games like Evolve, Damned isn't afraid to kill off players. It treats the humans the same way that any horror movie would, and if they don't stick together and find a way out quickly they aren't going to survive. The keys can be pretty well-hidden, and Damned is the only game where I've ever seen a group of players slowly succumb one by one to the realization that they might not ever find the key they missed somewhere, if the key even existed at all. The tension of new players figuring out what to do and what not to do to avoid alerting the monster while finding their way out is a lot of fun, and while I haven't played past that point to know what it'll be like once I know all the tricks, I think there's enough content to it that I would still enjoy it.The big problem with the game is that it's pretty buggy in its current state, despite no longer being in early access. When I first started playing the game it had capped itself to 15 FPS, and the only way to fix it was to restart my computer. Even after that, the game is generally poorly optimized from what I've seen from other players (I was able to run it at a pretty consistent 80-90 FPS, which isn't really ideal since I have a 144 hz monitor and a computer that should be running it at far past that framerate, but oh well). The other issue is that the game isn't exactly populated. A quick look at the server list showed 7 lobbies, 3 of which were public, and 1 of those had a ping of over 1000. This is the sort of game where you should buy a bundle and play with a group of friends instead of relying on random players, but it's more fun with friends anyways so I didn't mind.In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game at all for $20, but it seems to go on sale in various indie bundles fairly often (I bought a four-pack of the game for like $1 or so at some point or another), and if another four-pack deal comes up and you can get it for cheap it's a great way to spend a few nights with a few friends.

It's fun to appear right in front of people, scare them, laugh in a dark voice changer, and then disappear.However, if you want to download the COMPLETED game, go look up ""Dead by Deadlight"", the COMPLETED version of this UNCOMPLETED game that is COMPLETELY COMPLETED.Or you know, don't.Recommend if it's on a $1 sale for the lols, otherwise, eh.Have fun!

												I wrote a full review that you can read here: http://rgz.ca/gaming/damned-review-stereotypical-horror/tl;dr:I won’t deny that the game had potential. The fact that it is doing something similar to Evolve, one of this year’s major titles, but in more of a survival horror setting and less of an eSports setting shows that. The fact of the matter is that it is poorly designed, slow, isn’t scary, rehashes survival horror concepts that are both lamented and don’t make a lot of sense to begin with, and is unpolished on top of that. It is unpolished to the point that you may be completely unable to play the game for hours on end or give up on trying before you even get to play it at all. I had a hard time getting the other members of the team I played with to stick with it for this review. That should say something about it there. It had potential but it missed its mark by a long shot.			"

												Damned is a 3D horror co-op multiplayer game.After many normal horror games I have encountered a multiplayer version !!To begin with, you do need a separate account in order to play online. (I hate that)Personally, I would only want to play this game with friends.Playing with unknown people sometimes ruins the horror experience.It is a game where a few sessions are fun.Unfortunately, you run into problems quickly.Game looks pretty good.Control are fine and you get used to it after a short time.Unfortunately, the game has many errors / bugs.And it sometimes ruins the game a little bit.AI does not function properly and that is a shame.Game is already very extensive.Various monsters and some maps, but.... I want more !!!Unfortunately I don't think there is enough considering the normal price.This is not an FPS so no weapons and only a flashlight.Understand also that horror game as it should be and therefore this is not a game for me.The price is very high for this game and I'll hope it will drop in price or get frequent sales.And especially for a 4 pack would be important since this is a multiplayer game so that you immediately can play with your friends.Hope that the makers fix all bugs so the game is a fun experience for everyone.I give it a 7/10 and fairly high because it is quite original concepts is that you do not see much.I think this game can be very good.But I stopped playing after a few hours.I wanted to to shoot some freaking zombies / monsters..... !!Let me at least kick someone their♥♥♥♥♥?? with a flashlight !!!If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

No tutorial or instructions, just some intro text telling you to open the exit. Monster abilities aren't explained, no one really playing it.

I'd wait till its finished... plus its just plain ugly. Annoying hedbob. Few maps... Id wait a year or so, and by then it will be out of date looking. All about unique gameplay and I played both classes, monster is just weird, ran around seeing nothing, supposedly setting up traps, spawning, still seeing nothing... hard to tell if its even working. No customization. no lights anywhere really. just wait a while for it. as is, not worth 8 bucks on special.			"

												This game sucks. It made me so angry. I have not been so angry since I played forced. The scary character moves so slow, that I thought I was having a stroke. In real life, for the reals. And apparently there are doors, but I can't confirm, as I was only able to open one of them, once. And there was no feed back that the door was locked, or that I could not open it. Thus, I do not know if it was a door, or a bug. I would only recommend this game if you wished to torture terrorists. This game often caused my frame rater to dip into the single digits, and thus it ran worse than Crysis. think about that one for a moment. Do not buy unless you are stupid, or crazy.			"

Graphics are decent and the only character worth playing is Jacob (because his face is priceless) but the gameplay is very smooth bugs are there and in large numbers but mostly very minor things. I need to recomend this game just because of the humor.			"

								Incredibly fun. Sort of a multiplayer Amnesia with how the monsters are unstoppable and need to be avoided. Since they're players too, you can even fool them in more interesting ways. Survivor gameplay is a key hunt with randomized key locations, in which you slowly unlock your way through the stage, which usually ends up being a sprawling complex. The game manages to make you want to stick together and split up at the same time, as staying with your friends means the monster can kill all of you at once possibly, while splitting up means you get insanity effects such as losing your light almost entirely or hands reaching from the floor to slow you down. The game is very intense as the last survivor alive, and you feel like you earned it if you make it out.As the monster, gameplay is also tons of fun. There are three different monsters you can be: Lurker, who needs to set traps so he can hear where the players are, and then switch into his physical form which can actually see them to kill them, the Phantom which can't see much and needs to listen for the player's footsteps to figure out where they are. Finally, there's Mary, who is a spooky lady like the usual stringy-haired cliche is, and she moves very slowly, but drains power if she gets near to the players, and when she's full she can go crazy and start tearing up everything at lightning speed. Traps work against her, since she activates them by being nearby, thus alerting the players, and she will randomly teleport after not teleporting for too long, which can save a survivor from being killed. On the other hand, she can also teleport herself at will every minute or so which can help her get around.Honestly, this game is very fun, and I recommend it. Even playing with random people in public games can be fun, thanks to the way the game works.			"

								Don't buy it. All you do is wander around an ugly dark maze trying all your keys on each door, and walking around in big circles. It's entire focus is on noisy jump scares. The monster is easy to outmaneuver because he can only stay in a physical form for maybe twenty seconds, and he can't open doors.Seriously, the dumb little scripted noises that happen scared me more than the monster segments ever did. The game runs choppy at lowest settings on my high end gaming PC.A good idea completely ruined by the fact that they had to ""be like minecraft"" and release the game in a (barely playable) alpha state. Theres zero fun to be had here.			"

								Damned is awesome.  Simply put, it's hide-and-seek with five people, one being the monster.  The survivors hunt for keys, and the monster tries to kill them before they can escape.  As of this review, there are two monsters with very different playstyles: a ghost that tracks by sound alone and a skinless horror that switches between two dimensions, only one of which it can kill you in.  As the game is still in alpha, updates are constantly being made, and many more maps, survivors, and monsters are sure to come in the future.  I'll update this when the game is actually released, but it's still definitely worth buying now. The devs are actually open to input from the players, and the alpha itself is very playable (though not without some bugs/inconveniences).  Anyway, I write this so more people will play it.			"

								All I know is the first attempt at this game that me and some friends tried, my friend didn't understand the controls, and so my first view of the phantom was a man frantically and uncontrollably spinning and shouting, which, somehow, ended up with one of the people on our team being bonked in the head so hard she died.GOTY.

								Damned is a really fun Survival Horror game where both the survivors and the monster are players. The (maximum of 4) Survivors run around the map rushing to find the different keys/codes to open doors/safes whilst trying to avoid the Monster, who is trying to kill them (there are only 2 types of monster at the time of this review). This can lead to some pretty tense moments of blubbering in a corner whilst the monster metaphorically sniffs around trying to find you. The surprising thing about Damned is that even though it's in alpha, it's still a really good game! Yes, they have bugs to fix, but lately they have really gotten around to fixing a good majority of them.At the time of this ""review"", the game has a relatively small playerbase outside of the swarm of players every major update. If you're going to buy this game, the best way to do enjoy it would be to buy it alongside your friends, or to get the multi-copy pack so nobody gets left out.			"

								A wise man once said; ""Nothing is less scary than a co-op horror game."" I believed that until now. Tense, surprisingly atmospheric and heart-poundingly paranoia-inducing for an alpha game at such a low priceThink ""The Hidden"" meets ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" and you'll have a fair idea of what the deal is. 4 Players look for keys to escape an area while a 5th player controls a monster (two sorts currently) and has to slay them, the monsters have different mechanics and rely on sound, light and surroundings to land a kill.With a player controlled monster with varying, interesting mechanics, Damned is surprisingly frightning and even in Alpha, it's worth a pick-up if one can overcome the bugs.

								I have only played this game under 2 hours at this point when i'm writing this review and i can quarantee you that there will be many hours more to come. Damned is a multiplayer survival horror game where there is 4 surviors and 1 ghost/lurker hunting the surviors as they try to advance through different maps with several different items for example: keys, notes (safe combinations), crowbars etc. What i really love about this game is the feel of terror knowing the fact that there is something overpowering hunting you and playing with you until finally killing you if you don't manage to avoid the dangers they posses and escape. Although this game is at Alpha stage it works and plays pretty well in my oppinion also it gets updated pretty frequently. I personally loved this game from the moment i started playing this and if you are a survival horror fan i strongly recommend this game to you.			"

								Damned, though currently in Alpha, is shaping to be a great multiplayer horror game. I'm surprised by the amount of scares this game has given me. No other game have I found myself screaming like a schoolgirl while running away from a monster. Think of this game as an online hide and go seek. Players must try and escape a house with 3 other players while a 5th player plays as either a Phantom or Lurker. The Phantom/Lurker player can instantly kill other players if they sucessfully find them. However, they are limited by their visionary differences and will have to set traps and listen to sounds to find the players. For example, players are invisible to the monsters unless they trigger sequences that will allow them to hunt these players down.The players must find keys, safe codes, and items that will help them open doors and advance to next rooms. The game is randomized so every level will have their items placed in random drawers and rooms so there is replay value.Ideally the the real fun is a monster player who paces themselves and does not instantly kill all players if given the opportunity. I prefer to scare players and leave them alive just as they think I'm about to kill them. I hear their screams and that alone gives a different kind of thrill I've never experienced in any other game. This game is more fun if players focus more about the experience instead of the objective.Best of all, check out the forum. The developers have been listening to fan feedback and have tweaked and altered the game accordingly.Try it out, there's a lot of potential, and be sure to talk to your teammates. Most of the fun is based on the interaction with the other players.			"

The sense of dread this game has given me is unrivaled. Everything from the sound of other player's interacting with objects to the the clamor of a radiator that the monster set up as a trap have set me on edge.

								Damned is really rough around the edges, but I think it deserves a lot more love than its getting. In Damned four players need to work together to escape a house (or hotel or mansion or...) while a fifth player chases them around as a gangly♥♥♥♥♥monster. It's a co-op slasher and its glorious, one of those games where it's less about the gameplay and more about the experiences you have playing it. There isn't any VOIP yet so to get the full experience you should probably play it with people you know, but it's an absolute joy.			"

You get dropped into an area, sometimes parted from your group, and scamper around to find randomly placed keys and lock codes and other such to get out of whatever spooky location you've been dropped into before the ghost player finds you. You can't fight, you can only run and hide. It's an alpha so it's not without bugs, but the game as-is is VERY playable.			"

								If you have played Amnesia: The Dark Descent and, maybe, you wanted to play it with your friends, then you can imagine the same game mechanic but with 3 more survivors and 1 monster, who is controlled by a player. The monster is very much like the Amnesia's monsters, except with supernatural powers. And it is still scary as hell, tho the playthrough is very different each time, which makes it a more interesting and challenging and a scary game to play.			"

								Ho man, do I love this game.  At the time of writing this review, the game is still in alpha.  That being said, for a game at this stage of development, it's a solid game.  The concept is original and the execution is already good and still morphing into something even better as the developers receive feedback.  It's fund being both the humans and the monster, though between the two currently available (lurker and phantom) the lurker is definitely the favoured one.  The challenge exists for both the humans and the monster since the humans always have that feeling of dread that the monster is around every corner and struggling to advance while the monster is actually on the other side of the map desparately trying to claw his way out of a closet trying to find the last survivor.  I would say it's a definite winner with a good amount of replayability either with friends or online with strangers,			"

								What the developers have designed here is a Slender type game where you scamper through a house/hotel/asylum looking for a way to escape. The caveat here is that one person plays the monster. It's brilliant and novel.  As an Alpha it is very playable, though there are some balancing issues as they continue to develop.  There are currently two monster's available the original Lurker  and the phantom.  I have found that the Lurker still is the more enjoyable of the two, as the Phantom doesn't seem to be balanced yet. Either it's too weak or too powerful.  Hopefully sometime in the future they'll get it right.  If you have the friends to play it, and can stomach the growing pains of a developing game, I highly recommend it.			"

								This CO-OP survival game is shaping up to become something that I've been longing for on any platform. Up to four players trying to survive certain doom in different maps and searching for keys with only a flashlight in hand can be really intense. Especially when you know the enemy (a player-controlled monster that can go from invisible to visible in the blink of an eye) is lurking around every corner. Might even be walking right behind without you knowing it. This is a game that needs the players to cooperate to survive. As a monster your sole purpose is to make sure the humans won't get away. Afterall they're yours to feast upon. The game is still in alpha and needs more work and polish. There are not many maps or monsters but they're coming. The developers are hard at work and I've seen this game change since I first bought it. Even though it's still in alpha this game delivers plenty of fun, especially for LAN with friends. While playing with random people can be fun this game really delivers when playing with people you know. This is where Damned really shines! If you, like me, is longing for a cooperative, atmospheric horror title which is not centered around shooting things this might be for you! If your tired of being able to kill everything in your path, no matter how great the danger, and want something that can keep you on the edge of your seat, delivering a different experience every time this is for you. If you enjoy being able to rip every other player apart this is also for you! I'm really enjoying this game and I'm looking forward to see it evolve into a finished product.			"

								A nice game for friends. Though still in alpha at the time of this review, this game seems to have overtaken the amount of time I've put into other games on my list. Its potential, as well as its ability to scare with a human directing the actions of the antagonist really make this an enjoyable game to be play-testing. More content's to be added, and while the competitive portion of the game is lacking with some obvious issues, the spirit of the game is clear; many of those problems apart from the wonderful wealth of bugs are solved by playing within that spirit, which is to have a great time scaring the hell out of your friends. The premise of the game is simple. One player plays a monster, or Haunt rather, and attempts to hunt down and scare the hell out of four survivors trapped within the location. The survivors' goal is to get the requisite items they need to escape, whether that be keys, codes to open safes, crowbars, or hammers. It's an interesting experience, and the fear of the monster is compounded by the lack of weaponry on the part of the survivors. Anyone who's played Amnesia will appreciate the blessing and curse of the control scheme and the helplessness of the survivors who are forced to either run or hide. I reccommend this to anyone willing to lay down the measly asking price to give it a chance and live within the spirit of Haunted House on the Hill and the B-movie slashers.			"

								Damned is awesome.  Simply put, it's hide-and-seek with five people, one being the monster.  The survivors hunt for keys, and the monster tries to kill them before they can escape.  As of this review, there are two monsters with very different playstyles: a ghost that tracks by sound alone and a skinless horror that switches between two dimensions, only one of which it can kill you in.  As the game is still in alpha, updates are constantly being made, and many more maps, survivors, and monsters are sure to come in the future.  I'll update this when the game is actually released, but it's still definitely worth buying now. The devs are actually open to input from the players, and the alpha itself is very playable (though not without some bugs/inconveniences).  Anyway, I write this so more people will play it.			"

								A wise man once said; ""Nothing is less scary than a co-op horror game."" I believed that until now. Tense, surprisingly atmospheric and heart-poundingly paranoia-inducing for an alpha game at such a low priceThink ""The Hidden"" meets ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" and you'll have a fair idea of what the deal is. 4 Players look for keys to escape an area while a 5th player controls a monster (two sorts currently) and has to slay them, the monsters have different mechanics and rely on sound, light and surroundings to land a kill.With a player controlled monster with varying, interesting mechanics, Damned is surprisingly frightning and even in Alpha, it's worth a pick-up if one can overcome the bugs.

But never have I seen an indie game developer work so hard to fix every bug that comes up. These guys CARE about their product.Onto game play. 4 survivors and 1 monster for a total of 5 players. Playing as a survivor is incredibly nail biting, as all the keys are randomly generated and the monster can spawn anywhere at almost anytime. 10/10 would recommend this gamePLEASE HELP THE INDIE DEVELOPER!

								Game is still in Alpha development but is SOoo much fun, expecially if you have a group of friends you know who can play with you. Its a simple game really, collect the keys to unlock the 'safe room' and escape (surviors win). If all the survivors are killed, then the monster wins. There is no AI in this game, at the moment, so the game is purely multiplayer based and has so much potential for further development.			"

Graphics are decent and the only character worth playing is Jacob (because his face is priceless) but the gameplay is very smooth bugs are there and in large numbers but mostly very minor things. I need to recomend this game just because of the humor.			"

								A nice game for friends. Though still in alpha at the time of this review, this game seems to have overtaken the amount of time I've put into other games on my list. Its potential, as well as its ability to scare with a human directing the actions of the antagonist really make this an enjoyable game to be play-testing. More content's to be added, and while the competitive portion of the game is lacking with some obvious issues, the spirit of the game is clear; many of those problems apart from the wonderful wealth of bugs are solved by playing within that spirit, which is to have a great time scaring the hell out of your friends. The premise of the game is simple. One player plays a monster, or Haunt rather, and attempts to hunt down and scare the hell out of four survivors trapped within the location. The survivors' goal is to get the requisite items they need to escape, whether that be keys, codes to open safes, crowbars, or hammers. It's an interesting experience, and the fear of the monster is compounded by the lack of weaponry on the part of the survivors. Anyone who's played Amnesia will appreciate the blessing and curse of the control scheme and the helplessness of the survivors who are forced to either run or hide. I reccommend this to anyone willing to lay down the measly asking price to give it a chance and live within the spirit of Haunted House on the Hill and the B-movie slashers.			"

								Don't buy this until it is out of ""Beta"". I say ""Beta"" because this feels more like an alpha release. Keys are often left in rooms that you can't get to due to buggy key spawning, and if one of your teammates dies in a room with a key that unlocks a door that others can't get to, the monster is guarenteed a win.

								What the developers have designed here is a Slender type game where you scamper through a house/hotel/asylum looking for a way to escape. The caveat here is that one person plays the monster. It's brilliant and novel.  As an Alpha it is very playable, though there are some balancing issues as they continue to develop.  There are currently two monster's available the original Lurker  and the phantom.  I have found that the Lurker still is the more enjoyable of the two, as the Phantom doesn't seem to be balanced yet. Either it's too weak or too powerful.  Hopefully sometime in the future they'll get it right.  If you have the friends to play it, and can stomach the growing pains of a developing game, I highly recommend it.			"

								Are you an Amnesia fan? A Penumbra fan? Take the sense of helplessness those two games give, replace the monster AI with the mind of an actual living person, and make it multiplayer, and you have Damned. The sense of dread this game has given me is unrivaled. Everything from the sound of other player's interacting with objects to the the clamor of a radiator that the monster set up as a trap have set me on edge. Even in its Alpha state, Damned is very much worth the buy.			"

								Damned is really rough around the edges, but I think it deserves a lot more love than its getting. In Damned four players need to work together to escape a house (or hotel or mansion or...) while a fifth player chases them around as a gangly♥♥♥♥♥monster. It's a co-op slasher and its glorious, one of those games where it's less about the gameplay and more about the experiences you have playing it. There isn't any VOIP yet so to get the full experience you should probably play it with people you know, but it's an absolute joy.			"

												FNaFYou have met your match.10/102spookySoiled pantsEDIT: FNAF is♥♥♥♥♥♥so it's not really a big surprise why this is better than it.|SERIOUS REVIEW|Damned is a multiplayer survival horror game based around finding keys that are swapped and moved around before each match. As such, the game relies heavily on of quick thinking and teamwork to cover as much ground as possible whilst also avoiding one of three monsters: The Lurker, The Phantom, and Mary. All three have different advantages and disadvantages.PROS+Game is fun and stays interesting+Controls are intuitive and easy to get used to+Maps are balanced to allow either the monster or survivors to win+Actually spookyCONS-Game runs strangly, even on high-end machines-Requires a free, seperate account created in-game to play-Eventually becomes stagnant and boring if you end up playing for too long-Outdated visuals and average audio componentsOVERALLAudio-7/10Gameplay-8/10Visuals-7/10Multiplayer-9/10Overall, Damned is a fun and fairly cheap horror game made for a few fun nights with friends or strangers. The game changes itself enough to avoid boredom after one or two games, but eventually you will want to take a break from the game after your 5th match of the night. The audio and the visuals are unassuming, neither terrible nor great, and the strange performance lapses make the game far from perfect.Final Grade-7/10			"

												So to be fair this game had a rocky start.  From a pretty God Awful menu to crashing after changing graphics options. My friends and I were feeling beat down before the race had started.  That was quickly erased after we managed to get our first match up and going.  With friends dropping left and right forcing you to run away getting separated from your only living companion to see his demise broadcast for the game to see.  In these moment you find yourself hiding hoping that you will just fall down dead.  The objective a trap a terrible idea why move im safe in this room i can survive for possibly two days in here.  Yeah!!!! I am going to wait here no problems could be fall me......... whoa!  That was weird my heart just stopped.  No matter can't be anything to worry about.  Ill just peek out the door's window see what its like out there in the hellish hallways.  Just as i suspected gloomy yet oddly inviting a complete trap.  Ill just turn away from this forsaken window.  After all its just a portal to horrors that await me.  Turn Away.   WTF NONONO OH DEAR MOTHER OF SWEET LORD JESUS SAVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The installer is broke!I wrote a scathing review about what a pile of garbage this game is because I initially found it completely unplayable.  After reinstalling and some other finnicking, I got it to work.It's everything it claims to be, if you can get it to hold together.  For those with techinical issues, don't lose heart and see if someone else has solved the problem you're encountering.			"

												This game relies on tension over graphics and game physics.  There are plenty of 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments to make up for this, but it will remind you of counter-strike source, or more dated, graphic engines.  I've only played a little, but it's too terrifying at times to play for hours lol.  What's nice about this over Outlast, is that there are other players, so you get this false sense of courage.  Really, you're a buffet for that monster haha!Lots of fun			"

												This game is a very awesome game!!! It's actually a really scary game. it's not a horror game that is labeled ""horror"" but really isnt scary. The game is thrilling to play with friends and sometimes even strangers. A lot of jump scares and things to keep you're blood pumping throughout the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has friends that are up to have a lot of fun and pull all nighters or just someone that likes their adrenaline going through their body. BUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTTTTTT keep in mind, this game is not finished. There are numerous of bugs through out the game. ALTHOUGH, sometimes it really isnt a bug, theres something in the game called ""insanity stages"" that makes your game seem all buggy and stuff but really its not. It's the game messing with you. But yeah there is still a lot of bugs. so if your not patient, i dont recommend this game. just wait for it to be dont but other than that, this game is pretty underrated for how well this is. Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!			"

												I don't recommend buying this game.  It runs at like 5 fps on certain video cards, there's very little in the way of UI or explanation and not particularily in an enticing way, everything feels budget and there's many issues with game lobbies.  Most Damning is that the game itself isn't particularily enjoyable for either side- everyone pretty much stumbles in the dark including the monsters, and when the survivors are found the game pretty much just kinda ends.  You can't climb objects, even with the flashlight on it's very difficult to tell what anything is and picking up keys and safe codes to obtain more keys and safe codes isn't the world's most compelling gameplay paradigm.I have no idea why this is rated so high, but it's not very good.

												Damned is a game that is indescribably fun with a bunch of friends. Playing with 5 other friends on a game of Damned is so ridiculously enjoyable, I've bought 5 copies in total for me and 4 friends (the ones that weren't convinced to buy it themselves). It's very fun and can get really scary in the best way possible. My only complaint is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ server issues (it takes an hour just to get a server going that won't break). If they could fix that I would scream how great this game is from the top of the world. Welp, now I'm going to go buy another copy for my girlfriend!			"

												Damned has the potential to be a good game, but it isn't. Atleast in it's current state. The game still has some annoying bugs. Whenever someone hosts a game, they choose when to start the game. If the host starts the game before everyone has loaded in, the game crashes for whoever has not loaded in yet and their character instantly dies. It took us a little while to figure out why this was happening, but once we figured it out the bug was easy to avoid. Also, I noticed the game tends to crash if you choose to play multiple rounds within the same lobby. Aside from all the bugs, the gameplay isn't anything to write home about. The monsters/ghosts kill the survivors really easily, but the monsters can choose to drag the match out and attempt to scare the survivors before slaughtering them. In most of the public matches I've played, the monsters just straight up kill you within the first few minutes of the match. They don't attempt to scare you whatsoever, which makes for some lackluster gameplay. If you somehow make it past the ten minute mark, your character starts to have a psychotic break. The longer you go without beating the game(escaping), or getting killed, the symptoms intensify. For instance, hands start to come out the floor which prevent the player from moving. I won't spoil anymore of the symptoms for those who choose to buy the game. One weird thing about the whole psychotic break thing is that all the symptoms are completely clientside, meaning your teammates can't see any of the symptoms you are currently experiencing. I guess this is because it's all in your head, right?If you choose to buy this game, I suggest you play it with a group of friends. If you don't have a group of friends to play with, then don't bother with this game.			"

												First, let me state that I was following this game since Early Access, but waited for ""Full Release.""  I was exceedingly hopeful for this game.The reasons I CANNOT recommend this game are the following:It is horribly incomplete and one-dimensional.There is but one thing to do in the game: Run like a moron and hope you don't miss a vital key in a bucket or some crevice while the already-lethal ghost is chasing you down, clicking their mouse button til you get close enough for the kill shot to register.There is no depth to this game in regards to gameplay.  There are no complex objectives requiring any kind of cooperation among the players.  The monster/ghost role is as simple as just left clicking and holding down W.This game has so much potential, but I fear the developers aren't able to provide anything more than a short-lived atmospheric bore-fest.

												Well, the creep factor is there. And the idea for the gameplay is kind of unique. The graphics need some work, for example some of the monster trap/ visual effects were a little too corporeal or cheesy. Being the monster is super fun, but a little frustrating at times. The scary sounds and general audio stuff if really cool. I would recommend that the developer add some more variety and add some bass/ super low sounds. Bass and sub-bass have been used to build horror tension for years in film. This game could benefit from that.Overall, I'm good with this as at $10 or less, much more than that isn't really worth. The reason for this is that the graphics are dated, the gameplay mechanics need tweaking, and the game likes to crash :/About the crashing... I've played 4 matches, but  have suffered 2 crashes requiring task manager to end task/quit. One match ended with the player characters (using a 3rd party voice chat) straight up telling the monster player where to find them, as the map seemed glitched... 4 players spent 30 minutes and only could find batteries.  We suspected that the map glitched or that items didn't spawn. The maps are really awesome and typical horror locale tropes. I'm loving the maps. What I don't love is that the searching for items gets a little boring if you've stayed clear of danger. I mean like 20+ minutes of wondering around. I had like 8 keys one time and had no clue what to do. As the monster, you spend a lot of time just wondering around... ""where... what... arg""- moving too slowly in these gargantuan maps and feeling like you can't really get anything done. I feel like the monsters need more keyboard interaction, like some extra abilities to mess with people. Mary could use something for sure, like maybe the ability to make the walls bleed or turn invisible for a few seconds. The Lurker really needs a way to keep track of traps and triggers. As for the Phantom, the character model is horribly cheesy. It looks like a ghost of of an old n64 game or something. As I've not tried Phantom yet, I can't say what could improve game for it.If this game gets some crash fix and some gameplay tweaks, then I would highly recommend it. Until then, meh. Grab it if it's cheap, at least to try it and support the developer.			"

												\\\\Down below is my review from 24 december 2014//////I can't recommend this game at its current state, even though I really want because it has so much potential! Here are some major flaws that needs to be fixed:1. 20$ price tag and claimed to be a release? This game is very buggy and the worst part is that it's most game breaking bugs, so get used to alot of crashes. 5/10 lobbies I create end up crashing for all other players than the host, so everyone disconnects and I have to start all over (crashes confirmed by friend). This game should be marked for early access because it is not finished in any way. I bought this for 1/4 the price, at that cost I can handle it. But buying this for 20 euros is a rip-off.2. Strategies. If you play this game with 4 friends over skype, you'll be fine. But if you play it with any amount of friends or any other players and talk in game you won't be fine. The fatal flaw is that the ghost can hear you talking. May I ask why? Ghost can't see you write in the chat, but it can hear you talk so it defeats the whole purpose of talking in game. And writiting out strategies is not as useful when you have Mary running amok behind you.3. Pretty unbalanced and dull rooms. This game is really hard as survivor, I completed this once when the ghost was AFK and it took around 20 minutes. I can just imagine doing all that key searching while there's a ghost active aswell, gotta take atleast twice the time. Playing this with random people is almost impossible, especially since the ghost can hear you. There is one room at one map were there are about 20 wardrobes shaped as a mace. What's the fun of looking through 20 wardrobes? One a final note, this game could become something huge. This game could very well be worth 20 euros in the future, because the dev keeps pushing out updates now and then, which is very nice. But I can't recommend this at current state. It's is not a full release.^^^^Above is my Review from 24 december 2014^^^^^I am now changing my review to recommending. Since I started to play this game a week ago (This is written 11 June 2015) I've had no problem with crashing and lobbies that don't work. They've also added so that you can join in game session even if they are running, making the spectating a bit shorter. Game still has the same price tag and the monster will still hear you. But atleast the game works now, so that's why I am changing this review.			"

												My first review for a game on Steam, and I can't start my history off with a non recommendable game. I am only recommending this by it meeting its bare requirements to me for an online horror game as well. It is definitely a unique game, but the bugs in the game are just downright stressful. If you make it into a game, your ping will be determined by the host, which you can't even know unless you ask that person right there. The community, or the players in other words, are the only redeemable aspects of the game. I'm also recommending this so that more people will start playing as well, and when you find a good team, it becomes an enjoyable team experience that makes you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants every monster sighting.

It needs work and a lot of polishing and I don't like the fact we have to pay for a beta/alpha; that's a little cheap and South Park has a good quote for this scenario.  But the concept is solid and I know that improvements to the gameplay will make it a wonderful co-op/killing game.  It needs balancing, graphics work, brightness issues, fix game breaking bugs like broken keys, and for the love of all that's decent please make instant open doors.

It's quite slow paced and can get a little frustrating at times when you're looking for that last key and have checked every room twice, but the  game is much more enjoyable when played with a decent group. It would have been nice to have a single player offline option as well, but I personally didn't mind this too much.

I recommended this game because it is actually fun (Even though my friends don't have it, I still play online with others) It is an online game that will give you a few scares (that are better with close friends)Pros: -Fun to play with friends.-Scary game that will actually scare you.Cons:  -Expensive without a sale! :/-A few bugs every now and then.Final verdict: I recommend this game only if there is a sale - a less than $5 sale. Again this is my opinion, but facts are this game is really good yet buggy. So if you don't mind spending up to $20 for a buggy game then why not. Otherwise this game is not recommended.  "

												Creepy.  CREEEEEEPY.  While playing as each of the monster types really takes getting used to, it is most gratifying when you succeed in your objective.  The only real down side(s) to the game are playing as the survivours, such as when you're the first one in the party to be killed by the monster, and one or more of your team-mates succeeds in evading the monster for a much longer period of time.  You spend a lot of time in spectator mode when that happens.  They can also be at a disadvantage (aside from dying on one hit) when the insanity effects crop up and leave you either slowed down or unable to move, but given the monster weaknesses, I think that can be worked through with practice.

												The game is Ok... New players would definetly get a few scares here and there as they get used to the random things that occurs, mostly jump scares, but after an hour or so the fear glamour is gone. And that's when the flaws are more inherently noticeable. In this game survivors are suppose to interact with items in order to find keys to progress further and escape, however for new comers, those highlighted interactive objects are almost unnoticeable even if the player is right smack infront of it. So unless the player already spend alot of time playing the game or seen a video/read a guide of some sort prior they would most definitely miss it. Sad to say half the games I'm in  players eventually gave up the hunt and dc after 10 or so min being stuck. At least the monsters are flushed up somewhat better with a more unique style of play. There's a bit of a learning curve, mainly b/c there's hardly any notifiers or a tutorial of sorts to explain what to do or E is the transform for monsters, but the players should be able to grasp it as they're somewhat simplistic. The bottom line is this game is at a beta stage, there are still lots of  bugs here and there (take a look at forum lots of people can't play lan with same IP, can't even load the game despite an old engine, and random item clipping/crash galore), and needs alot more tweaking to call it a game in it's final stages. Not worth the full price , but if you can get it on sale, I did, $5 sounds is just about right for this unpolished game.			"

												All these bad reviews. I bought this game when it was first in Beta. This is my girlfriend's, and my go to game when we have nothing to do. The game has come a long way featuring two new monsters, and a few new levels. New effects like film grain, and depth fog help the atmosphere of the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who is into this genre. People will talk about the atmosphere being ruined once you discover the patterns and tactics of the monsters. I have accumulated almost 50 hours and I still can get scared and want to run from a monster. Overall 8/10. Solid game with slight bugs. I would recommend buying on sale if you do not thoroughly enjoy this genre.			"

												There are now several horror games where you find yourself alone in some building with a monster that wants to nibble your giblets. So why not make it a multiplayer experience where a group of a maximum 4 players need to escape that same building, but with a player being the monster? That's Damned for you.Damned is a First Person Multiplayer Survival Horror in its early phase. While at a first glance it might not look more interesting than Amnesia or Slender, I can assure you, being against a human monster is completely different. The dev team thought of almost everything in this game so far. With multiple usable types of monsters, randomized item layout, appreciable graphics for an early game and terrifying sounds and soundtracks, this game manages to stay fresh even after several matches. The amount of situations that could occur is enormous.There still are some bugs to be worked upon, like a certain instability on most computers and some problems with randomization that will rarely make a map ""unbeatable"" from the Survivors' point of view, and the monsters are currently a bit overpowered.However, the Survivors can beat the monster, oh yes. How? Teamwork, communication. This game forces the humans to communicate, even though they could be heard and detected by the monster. The game won't take you by the hand, there's no tutorial to be learned.All you'll know about this game will come from guides and experience.If you like horror games with exploration features, it's completely worth a try, especially if you have up to 4 friends to play with.

												TLDR: Great co-op atmospheric horror game.  Play with friends. Pick it up on sale.  In a lot of ways Damned is a little bit of a hot mess.  Past versions have been buggy to a sometimes unplayable degree (We've had required keys and items not spawn on maps, in the most recent version of the game this hasn't happened.)  But as it stands, Damned is easily the best co-op horror game on Steam, and I think it will probably stay this way for awhile.What Damned gets rights is the atmosphere.  Most of the levels are genuinely creepy, especially when the longer you play on the levels, the hallucinations such as hands rising from the floor and slowing you down, flashlights flickering, your screen going black and so on become more and more frequent.  There ends up being a real sense of danger the longer you play.When the game really shines though is when the player that's the Monster doesn't just go into it to win, but rather they attempt to create an experience for the players as well.  Ocasionally Mary will get a lucky teleport and end up right in front of, or behind the group.  They don't instantly go beserk and kill the players, they'll just stand or follow them, then go beserk or teleport away once they're seen.  It adds to much to the experience for the monster to toy with the survivors as opposed to just kill them and end the round as quickly as possible.  Even better to pick them off one by one.I have a really hard time reccomending Damned at full price, but when it's on sale it's absolutely worth a pick up.  "

												This game has a really amazing concept to it. It has great horror factors to it, hardly relying on jumpscares as its main focus of fright. It also has unique types of Monsters you can play as; the Lurker (completly blind, but can set audio traps to pin-point where survivers went and manifest into a solid being), the Phantom (another blind Monster, but you can see surivers hinding behind walls or objects once you first see them) and Mary (a spectral girl similar to the Grudge spirit that is always visible, walks very slowly, but has a frenzy attack if she focuses on a surviver for a certain amount of time). Alas, this game is still ridden with terrible flaws that make it hard for me to recommened this game to anyone.FIrst off, they made the mosters waaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.  They can kill you in one hit and there's no life meter for the survivers. You can set how many lifes you have, but they're shared with the other survivers. Secondly, the survivers have absolutly no way to defend themselves. All you have equiped is your flashlight and whatever you find while scowering whatever place you spawn in (keys, hammers, and crowbars). There are no weapons for you to get to defend yourself from the Monsters. Thirdly, respawing is broken. There's been a few times while playing this game with some of my friends that one of them respawned right next to the Monster. Lastly, there's hidden effects that happen to you, while some are accecptible, others are not. One I think is okay is where your character will start halucenating if your flashlight's battery is low. The other is how stamina is both there and it's not. Sometimes you can run just fine, but then you halt to a walk and can only sometimes run. There's also no meter for your stamina.If this game could get some fixes, I would recommend this game. As it is right now, I just can't justify it as a good game.			"

												This is a horrible tease. I see what it wants to be and it's so close to being so scary you can taste it. But it falls short.The Beauty:The concept is one of the strongest things this game has going for it. Multiplayer survival horror is great by itself, but add in that one of your irl friends is working against you as this terrifying thing trying to kill you? 5/5 stars. It's working both sides of haunted houses: actors and patrons. The monster usually has something that makes it distinct as a terror which adds to the goosebumps. This game does deliver scares.The Ugly:The survivors' confusion doesn't clear up as they explore. I have played as survivors and monsters on every map. I have yet to see survivors win. Ever. Or make any remarkable progress for that matter. Sure, sometimes you get a key that unlocks a chain or door and now you can move around a little more in this new area, but chances are it still doesn't help you get anywhere. I've played passively as the monster just to see if it was possible for survivors to win. I used the monster to scout out maps to help a little. My team gave up. It's too one-sided. Monster can win easily enough (I wouldn't change much to balance that), but survivors just can't win (I would change this significantly). Monster controls are also bizarre. Lurker is most logical, but the other two could use some instructions so the powerful monster actually feels powerful. There should be no confusion there. Throw in a few glitches and it isn't playable.			"

												I love the style of the game. It's horror meets escape-the-room; two of my favorite types. It's a bit like Amnesia, only you play as either the monster (one of 3 choices) trying to kill everyone, or one of four ""survivors"" trying to escape the place you're trapped in by collecting keys to unlock doors. A few problems with game bugs - getting stuck in walls, game disconnecting, dying sometimes produces two dead bodies or a live body running into a wall, but otherwise the game is playable and worth the $20 if they fix the bugs. Best played with a group of friends, in a dark room, with voice chat. Really adds to the creepiness, or hilarity (if you have friends like mine).			"

												I would not reccomend this to anyone. It's a laagy nightmare (despite using virtually no resources) even just trying to navigate the menu. It's virtually unplayable for the same reason. Before trying to blame my computer, I'd like to point out that it can run games like Dying Light. I've seen better games on steam for WAY less money, and I'm rather shocked that something like this that barely runs is going for as much as it is. I had it gifted to me and I would still return it for refund if I could... I lack words to adequately describe the frustration the mere attempt of getting into the game, and then trying to move (only to find that it was just as bad as the launch screen) caused. Interesting premise or not, the core aspect integral to a game's success is its playability, and if it is unplayable, then it has failed at the most important objective.			"

												Once you get ""used"" to the monsters after enough play you still get those out of nowhere scares time to time! Nothing is greater than being a monster and coming up on someone that's using a mic scream in fear. There's something satisfying scaring that stranger or friend 5/5.			"

												READ BEFORE BUYING! I bought this game and it is constantly having issues starting as it tends to immediately shut down. This is an issue for many players for various reasons and so do the research before buying it. My issue is that their software seems to have issues with my graphics card; a card capable of running Star Wars The Old Republic, Skyrim, etc without issues. I will link you to a video of just such a person having a hard time starting this game:

												Scary as Mary can get (You'll know if you get the game). If you are a little whimp like me who can't even step out of a corner and do something then don't get the game, and believe me if you think you can, when you get into the game itself you are going to be paranoid. It is scary and spooky and creepy, it surpose to be like this, very quiet sometimes but has creepy music with it. Totally have an awesome time if you have other people to play with though! You scream the hell out of each other and never going to escape because it's almost impossible to, but you ended up with lots of spooks and scares though if you in to that sort of stuff. It's really satisfy to play as the monster itself (rekt helpless players and all). I don't want my friends to have heart attacks and blame it all on me so yeah, don't recommend to play it and have nightmares about it.			"

												This game is NOT worth it's listed price.The idea is brilliant. Co-op horror games can be loads of fun when executed correctly, however this game does suffer in the execution aspect. Game is buggy, graphics are poor, gameplay is very clunky and there is very little explanation given to the infected in terms of how to use their character. You might get a few laughs with some mates but after a couple of rounds you will tire of this game very quickly.If it goes on sale for a few bucks, then sure, give it a whirl, but I would strongly recommend staying away from this game as it is just not worth 15-20 bucks in its current state.

												Bought this game during a recent sale and tried to make it work for 3 other friends. I really wanted to like this game.The concept of 4 survivors vs. 1 monster on a server game was very appealing to me, and for $5 a person (during the sale) how could I really say no? The atmosphere is creepy, the sound is great, and once you understand the controls it plays well. Sure the elements get reused so you can't tell a level apart from another level and THE FOREST just crashes the game, but it's not that bad design-wise.The direction in this game is lacking, playing as a survivor is confusing and difficult. Winning as a survivor requires finding a silver key and a crowbar/hammer and having all living survivors in the escape room for 10 seconds. Finding a key can unlock a door that does nothing or unlocks multiple doors and in almost 3 hours of playing we found 1 hammer out of 5 maps as survivors. It's frustrating walking around for 4 or 5 minutes and not being able to go anywhere if you don't find the right key in the right order.Playing as a monster has its drawbacks depending on the monster, but it's still the most fun part of the game. The 'phantom' appears to play the easiest when it comes to finding survivors that aren't careful, the 'lurker' is the most terrifying but require the most guesswork when turning on/off corporeal form and 'mary' is irritating when she isn't charged and moves as slow as she does, but teleporting can land you in the best position or set you back at the worst time.Also creating a profile and setting up a room/finding one can be annoying, but it's not Uplay... so there's that.TLDR: Great look and feel, confusing and unbalanced gameplay2/5 - Not Worth $5			"

								Mary needs a lot of improvements. Me and my friends were so hyped to play and it turned into a game of actually trying to FIND the monster. She teleports like every 20 seconds automatically no matter what the circumstance. Every time me or my friend were the monster we would finally find a survivor and then boom, we would teleport a mile away again so we get to walk 1 mph across the map all over again. Not to mention you have to look at her for about 6 seconds before she can charge you which I doubt people will do. Here's my opinion on what should be changed:-You aren't forced to randomly teleport and you can do so on your own will-Mary can charge you as soon as your crosshair goes over here therefor actually making it a challenge and not just strolling away-Make it so you can't teleport into locked rooms. Once a room is unlocked than it becomes part of the random teleport options. I spawned in a locked room and had to wait for the charge about 85% of the game.-Her slow walkspeed makes her more creepy so as long as she can charge you better than I don't think that should be changed as long as you don't have to stroll across the map for an hour.I love the maps and Mary seems to be the only true horrifying monster so we really wanna do a game with her without these problems. Otherwise this game has a good concept and is really fun to play with friends.			"

												I've played this game for many hours with my friends and it has been amazing. However, I feel that by playing with my friends we've made the most out of it ourselves, rather than the game doing most of the talking for us. And if I didn't have anybody to play this with I do think the game would be left gathering dust in my steam library. But this being said I believe the game is aimed towards friends playing it together ( Unless you want to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people being the monster).The diversity between the maps, spawn locations are completely unique which does contribute towards the ""never playing the same scenario twice"" theme which is always a bonus. In addition, a lot of the maps are just rearrangements of each other. I want a few more options to chose from, how about a map thats half outside? Or a map based in an abadoned school/circus? I don't know if there is currently new maps under construction as it still is in early development, but im slowly growing tired of the rehash of a large amount of the maps.Also I would like more monster variation, the currently ones are good but once you suss out how to beat them it loses its scare factor in a way. And some of the character grab and pull/push mechanics are a littly bit flunky and robotic at times, but they're nothing major to worry about because im sure they'll soon get sorted.Don't get me wrong im not critising the game because I really enjoy playing it, I just want it even better. It was definitely well worth the money.If you want to watch videos on the game my friend recorded us playing - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZYMt8Etov6DyoudwQF5_hA "

												my previous review was bad because when i first got the game the game was broken. the game wouldnt launch. after weeks of emailing back and forth with 9heads, they finally sent me the files that were missing from my game to get it to work. even though it took a while to fix, they were quick to respond to all my emails. now that ive gotten a chance to play the game, heres what i think. the idea here is really cool. however, im not so sure this game is even beatable. and can get a little boring if you're playing with randoms. i suggest playing with friends! oh and  the way you open and close doors in this game sucks.

												Very unique idea and excellent game. If you enjoy getting scared and scaring people then this is the game for you. There is a max of 5 players per game. Four play as survivors trapped in a hotel, asylum, etc. The other person plays as one of three monsters. The survivors goal is to find keys and other object to escape, while trying to avoid getting killed by the monster. Of course the monsters goal is to kill all the players. Definitely worth the money!			"

Multiplayer only horror gameEven if i don't like horror type of games at all, i do like this one.5 players = 1 monster, 4 preys, simple and effective.Teamwork, panic escape, and this feeling of ""it can be every fuken where"" makes it enjoyable.Being the monster hunting trembling players is quite a fun part too.This is clearly not a game in wich i'll spend huge amount of hours, but it's totally a ""hey, let's do few rows of Damned today"" type of game.Give it a try			"

												Interesting idea, horrible execution. The game is completely unbalanced. As the humans, there is no endgame explanation. What are you gathering these keys for? Is it just time based? As the monsters, each one is different, but they're all pretty easy. The phantom especially is broken and is a complete joke to play as. On top of balance issues, the game suffers from some serious connection issues and bugs. I don't think there's really a solution to the balance issues so I would just steer clear of this game entirely.			"

												Great game idea plagued by gimmicky gameplay.I'm disappointed in how annoyingly dark the game is. I cannot see anything unless I have my flashlight directly pointed at it. I turned the gamma to max, which changed the lamp light from 'dim candle' to 'poor mood lighting'. There was a few times I collected every key I could possibly find, but they didn't open any door that I could reach. So I spent the better part of an hour wandering, attempting to prod the monster with my flashlight until she would randomly teleport away. The only thing I found scary is the amount of bug crashes I got. I can't change any video options without a crash, using monster attacks often killed my framerate, and loading up levels could result in a crash as well.Overall the experience left me frustrated and annoyed.

												Picked this up yesterday (18/12/14) in the Winter Sales and a few other copies for friends. Wasn't really expecting a great deal from it but I was pleasently surprised. It's a fairly simple game but that's not to say it isn't fun and attention-grabbing. Having a full lobby (5 Players = 4 Humans + 1 Monster) made for a really tense atmosphere as one by one we were picked off by the monster and grew more and more ready to brown our trousers. I Haven't exactly played a lot (1 session) so this is more of a first impression. I may add to this review as I play and discover more. For now I shall leave a few Pros & Cons: PROS:- Simple yet fun- Immesive/ atmospheric music, scenery, sounds and lighting.- A nice (albeit small) veriety of Monster's abilities, they aren't just different skins- Decent graphics (helps with immersion, for me)CONS:- The lobbies can be somewhat buggy, people not appearing/ unable to see other players- No explaination on how to use Inventory items (a little note in controls or a tool tip would be grand)- No way (that I can see) to tell when your Monster's Transformation skill is ready (a little HUD bar?)- Flashlight battery seems to drain even when left off (creeping in the dark with it off and it suddenly flickers)SUMMARY:A really fun game to burn some time with friends. A good deal of tension and atmosphere along with the screams of your mates makes for some scary good tiimes. Seeing as this is on sale I recommend you grab a 4-Pack and dish these out to some pals ASAP.  "

												FIRST VIEW (12th of June)   To be honest, I'm not sure if it's possible to write a helpful review for an Early Access Game.But I'll do my best.   I played this game while it was on Alpha and while it was on Beta and here's what I can say. Now there are a bunch sad things in ""Damned"". It lags, freezes, crashes and stuff. There are just a couple of servers, so it's almost dead online. Also there are several bugs like doors getting stuck and items which can't be picked up.   So that really can disappoint a player.But on the other hand ""Damned"" has good original concept. When I managed to play a couple of rounds it was pretty fun and scary. The atmosphere itself is creepy, but people's reactions, commentary are making gaming process pretty fun.I bet when you play with your friends it's even funnier.   So is it good or bad? I don't know. But I hope that developers will fix all the troubles which players have right now. And if they do so I'm pretty sure the answer will be obvious. :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          UPDATE (24th of July)   Well now we're talking! Developers updated game pretty well and I'm really happy about it! :)So the reason I checked the game again was patch which added achievements and trading cards. Which is pretty cool I think. Makes gaming process little more interesting. But when I played the game itself, like for real, I was surprised.    ""Damned"" became even more scary that it was! And by ""scary"" I mean horrifying! Now you can get scared even without a monster. The atmosphere of the game is way more creepier: developers added some jumpscares, some spooky events and other stuff.   Another good thing: more people play this game now. So you actually can play this game even if your friends don't.   The amount of bugs is reduced, but there are still few of them. At least it's obvious that developers DO work and they DO try to fix them.    Looking forward for other updates. Good luck to developers. Now I can recommend this game with even more passion!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          UPDATE (19th of December)   Haven't been able to play this game for like 4 months. Just can't lauch the game.Well, what can you do about it.			"

It has so much potential which is why at this point in time, I recommend this game to people who like a bit of fun, and a good scare.

												After reading some of the reviews I was a bit skeptical, but this game is fun. While there is not an abundance of maps or monsters the game does not feel repedative at all. This game will have you tense and give you a bigger heart attack than a chicken at a poultry processing factory. I would reccomend informing yourself about the basic monsters before you play as each is very different  and knowing how to play each one can save your life. The one thing I dislike is that is buggy, but otherwise a great deal when on sale. You will get at the bare minimum 10 hours of fun from this game. I would love to see it expanded with more map, more monsters, easier door mechanics, and possibly having the survivors have different strengths (EX: mia can run 10% faster or father jacob sees objects highlight from 10 feet further). The sound track could be higher quality as well.Great game overal given that i paid about five bucks for it, one of my most cost effective games. 7.5/10			"

Unfortunately, I have yet to get it to work, even a little.Every time I try to host a game, it somehow manages to bring my home network to its knees, completely killing my router, forcing a reset. Even attempting to connect to another game fails 99% of the time, and if it does connect, I can't see anyone else, or start the game. I'm no slouch when it comes to computers and networking, and everything is configured properly.I have a very high end gaming PC, and even the menus slow to a crippling 5 fps or less. I've asked for help from the devs on the forum, and have not been helped at all. This game is completely broken, and I only found out after buying a 4 pack. Games like this are a prime reason why Steam needs to offer refunds for broken products. I will definitely be demanding a refund on this one.This doesn't even deserver to be on early access. This isn't even alpha quality. This is junk that doesn't work at all.			"

I think you will enjoy this game if you aren't expecting AAA polish and are interested in having a lot of fun getting into your role as either the monster or one of the survivors.  This game relies a lot on the monster to create a fun experience for the survivors.  It's so important to mess with people before you kill them.  If you are having a bad experience that isn't related to bugs, try playing with friends on a private server, it is a lot of fun. "

												Very good concept and decently executed. 7.5/10, not bad for an indie alpha game.  It needs work and a lot of polishing and I don't like the fact we have to pay for a beta/alpha; that's a little cheap and South Park has a good quote for this scenario.  But the concept is solid and I know that improvements to the gameplay will make it a wonderful co-op/killing game.  It needs balancing, graphics work, brightness issues, fix game breaking bugs like broken keys, and for the love of all that's decent please make instant open doors.  But for all of the above, definitelty a long lasting fun game that makes people social *faintsfromshockattheconcept.			"

												Creepy.  CREEEEEEPY.  While playing as each of the monster types really takes getting used to, it is most gratifying when you succeed in your objective.  The only real down side(s) to the game are playing as the survivours, such as when you're the first one in the party to be killed by the monster, and one or more of your team-mates succeeds in evading the monster for a much longer period of time.  You spend a lot of time in spectator mode when that happens.  They can also be at a disadvantage (aside from dying on one hit) when the insanity effects crop up and leave you either slowed down or unable to move, but given the monster weaknesses, I think that can be worked through with practice.

												For like the first 5 minutes of playing this game with two friends this game was scary, and then that all kind of just flopped after a while. the monster wasn't so scary any more. it was more like just a simple survivor game with annoying instances of your light flashing, things going dark or the weird waving arms coming out of the ground that were easy to walk around. all in all, a great game idea, but poorly executed and maintained. NOT worth your money.			"

I love joining games where the people roleplay their parts. This game is a must have. But forewarn, it actually is more fun to play with friends. Unless, you get lucky and find a game where the players talk. Otherwise, you're pretty much on your own.			"

												ok, so this game, for me, has been bittersweet. i really want to love it, honest. Theres just one HUGE issue. Most games i join freeze up. The game just crashes. i dont know if its a common issue, but its annoying. When the game works, however, it is a blast. The gameplay is fantastic, and having a monster that is played by an actual player adds a new element of intelligence that a AI just cant bring. The person controlling the monster can learn and adapt to your escape strategy. I would recomend the game, just dont be surprised if it crashes alot.			"

												Love the idea of the game and the execution is pretty good considering, but unfortunately it's extremely hinged on the monster to keep things interesting. So while the game itself is pretty good, all the games I've played become very stale very quickly, either the monster is terrible at being the monster (thus making being a survivor boring) or the monster is signifciantly better than the survivors (making being a survivor difficult). In short: Love the idea, Pretty good execution, but unfortunately it's a very hit or miss experiance if you're playing with random people over the net.			"

												OH THE HORRORS OF SEARCHING FOR KEYS!!  So many keys, so little time.  It's true, there has been a trend in multiplayer horror games lately, namely rogue-likes, that force you to quest for keys. Here's an example, namely of Damned, but for this kind of game in general:>> KEY1 - Unlocks DOOR1>> DOOR1 - leads to KEY2>> KEY2 - Unlocks DOOR2>> DOOR2 - leads to.....wait, no friggin' key, are you serious?!Backtrack a little, oh there's a key you overlooked.  It unlocks a drawer back in the room DOOR1 leads to, thereby       giving you KEY3.>> KEY3 - Get a crowbar.... : /   and where the sh*t am I supposed to use that?! (HINT: when you finally find KEY10 which will ultimately lead you to a special SILVER KEY, then you'll find the boards you're supposed to pry off with said crowbar)All this fetch quest madness leads to a greater sense of fear and unease in the player.  I have to admit, I found that gameplay mechanic annoying and overly tedious at first.  Since then, it's grown on me.  I realize now that if I were in this situation, with 3 strangers (other Steam players) being stalked by 1 of 3 types of monster (another Steam player; that's right: 4 'survivors' and 1 monster make up the basis of the game 'FIND STUFF TO USE ON THINGS AND AVOID GETTING KILLED BY A 'THING' ALONG THE WAY') that I couldn't possibly know where the keys were to get out of wherever it is that we're all trapped in.  So I guess you could say the fetch quest just makes the situation more realistic. All in all, Damned is a pretty fun game and there are trading cards and achievements too. Don't worry, the achievement for successfully completing a certain number of maps goes both ways - you can do so as the monster (so much fun!!) or as a survivor.  Also, the person that plays as the monster doesn't have the advantage you'd think he/she would have.  The monsters have their own strengths and weaknesses, such as the ghoul not being able to see anyone until it's right on top of them + plus it floats around very slowly.  Mary walks slow, but she can teleport too (but even then that's only so many times until the ability has to recharge, in a manner of speaking - you get more charge/uses the more times that you see survivors) and can only go into a 'frenzy' which allows you to take them down by keeping them in your sight long enough to allow it to activate. The 3rd monster can set traps that allow it to pinpoint where survivors are, as it can't see them until it can go into a stalker/kill mode, which of course you have to wait for between each use of said mode.So Damned is pretty balanced as far as this kind of game goes and will offer far more hours of gameplay than alot of other indie/horror games.  Even more fun if you play with friends (which I haven't done personally, but I think it would be fun).			"

While there is variety it isn't that much, but I still find the concept unique and fun on occasion (especially when played with people you know).  Not something you can get lost in (yet) though, hoping that the developer doesn't just stop here and decides to push out some more content, this game is in dire need of it!			"

												This one of the very few reviews I've written. I am annoyed enough to actually write one.A number of my friends and I acquired this game through a recent Humble Bundle, expecting a few hours' fun with what reads like a really nice idea for an asymmetric multiplayer game. What we got was a bug ridden, slowly performing, confusing mess across multiple different systems. Let me explain.The game has many problems, most obviously bugs: menus appearing unexpectedly and staying there throughout gameplay; unexpected freezing which forces a quit to menu or process kill; bizarre drops in mouse sensitivity or input tracking; variable framerates; disconnects from multiplayer games yet remaining in the player list; minimal feedback on player/monster actions; the list goes on. We were playing on a mixture of systems, some with NVidia cards and some with AMD, all using Windows 7, and I can say now that we've not had anywhere near as many problems with any other game. The next bunch of issues relate to the game design itself. The basic elements of the gameplay are there, but they seem to be at the level found in a lot of early version mods available for other games. Playing as any of the monsters is actually very shallow in terms of gameplay, and playing as the survivors doesn't really feel like anything beyond semi-coordinated trial and error. There's barely any interaction with levels beyond picking items up and opening doors, the latter of which has a needlessly awkward grab mechanic that in practice doesn't justify its existence. The items are difficult to spot as well, which results in the survivor's role rapidly becoming one of frustration and confusion, especially when playing a new level. As a group Damned sounded fun, and we play in a LAN environment so we hoped the horror aspect would make it a good investment. As it turns out the gameplay is barely fleshed out, and when the game does run it either runs very badly or encounters problems. I just can't recommend it, not with many other games offering much better for a lot less than the Steam price at the time of writing (£15).The worst bit? We experienced all the above in an hour. A single hour. It literally took 60 minutes to exhaust patience of five PC gamers who are happy to mod, tweak, upate drivers, and customise controls, in order to get something working. Did we give it enough time? You decide; we found something else to play.			"

												First off, let me say that this game has a GREAT premise. The whole idea is genius. But there are just way to many issues with it right now to make it even enjoyable to play. Me and a buddy bought a 4 pack for a cheap date night's with our spouses, and after nearly an hour of frustration we couldnt take it any more. Though I really hope that after a while, and new patches come out, that they can perfect what they are going for.Way too many Glitches. WAY WAY WAY to many glitches. I understand that this is under development, but to let people buy a game that is this sketch with as many bugs and bad quirks and lag issues as it has, if I was the developer I would be personally embarrassed that I am chargeing $20 bucks a pop for a fundimentally broken game, that even for a beta game is bad.If the developers read this, these are the few things that would make it better.1. I shouldnt have to hold down the action button and then move or drag my mouse to open things. Just make a click do that. Even if you have to hold down the button to open in slowly (so you can peek out or whatever) That was just really annoying to constantly be moving my mouse or my position to open a door or a drawer or closet. this was a major problem especially when you take into account the next problem of FPS.2. Frame Rate issues all around. I have a amazing laptop that I built for gaming. The thing is a beast and can handle the newest games, such as farcry 4 for example, at max settings. This game, had issues like crazy, jerky, even on the lowest settings. especially on the main screen. The mouse had lag like nuts, and it took me five mineutes to even change the settings. Eventually, almost like a buffer on the internet, the game got smoother.I really hope that they fix some of the problems with this here in the next year. Because I could see that there was great potential in this game. Something that has never been done before, and it did give us a few screams even with the issues it had. So for the time being, I am going to have to say NO on the recommend this game until it gets further into developement. Once that happens, I would totally recommend this game.			"

												Ok, so I only have a couple hours on record, but this game has the potential to be AMAZING.  Keep in mind that the controls are a little awkward (especially for the monsters) and that each monster plays entirely different.  Also, the AI is basically non-existant it seems, so count on playing it with friends (to include a monster).  Also, the secret to each monster is to be patient, if you aren't patient, don't play a monster.This game is excellent though, I definitely recommend it.  I've played (in the same room) with 2 different friends, and both of them have screamed.			"

												I've played this game on and off since the alpha stages. I've had some good times. It can be an excellent source of amusement for you and some friends at the right times. But the problems that plagued it during the alpha stages are still there in its present state, and I just cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone, especially not for the price it has. Among other things, it suffers from a few serious bugs - the most prevalent of these is that you cannot change between fullscreen or windowed mode without the game suffering a complete crash, or even crashing your entire computer. There are connection errors, there are times when you get stuck moving (or being unable to move), times when the menu overlay will stay on your screen forever...the list goes on.It is also sometimes far too dark, which could work with being an atmospheric experience, but when you're looking for tiny items or checking to see if something can be opened, it's just an exercise in frustration. The gameplay itself is balanced terribly against the survivors, which, again, could be made to work as a mood and atmosphere feature, but instead ends up making it so that the monster is guaranteed to win 90% of the time. This isn't helped by the fact that the person playing as the monster can hear what the others are saying in voice chat - you can't plan or talk to anyone without giving it away. What's the point of a voice chat if its main use is to inform the enemy of what you're doing?On top of everything else, the game is horribly optimised, and with its simple graphics, still manages to demand more processing power than, say, running Skyrim on ultimate settings, or Dragon Age Inquisition, or various other graphics-intensive games. I had some real hopes for this game and unfortunately was let down. I didn't even notice that it had gone to full release, just assumed that it was still in beta because of the many obvious issues and bugs with it. Bit sad that it turns out this is the ""final"" product we get instead.  "

												Written for AbsoluteHell.netDamned is, at its core an asymmetrical multiplayer-only experience that contains some incredibly effective tension and dread as you and your group skulk through darkened corridors in hopes to avoid an onslaught of death at the hands of a malevolent supernatural being.Damned successfully taps into that primeval fear of 'what you can't see can kill you' as it will have you more paranoid than David Icke himself. Chiming grandfather clocks, whistling radiators, creaking doors, flickering lights and laughing jack-o-lanterns all play their part as you move cautiously through each of the eleven different environments hoping not to touch uglies with that thing that goes bump in the night.Each of these come in a variety of flavours - from abandoned Hospitals, Asylums, Hotels to Factories; all oozing with an eerie atmosphere that isn't seen nor felt in any other horror based multiplayer game. The scares and true terror rival that of any single-player experience you can have and the fact that it can do this with a multiplayer only game is truly an astounding achievement in and of itself.You control (in first-person) any one of four stereotype survivors found in a haunted house scenario, A Priest, School Jock, Scene-Girl or fabled black-guy-who-dies-first, each armed with only a flashlight and your dwindling nerves. Who you choose to play as, is completely arbitrary as no one survivor has any type of skill set or play style to help aid your team, as all players can equally carry any amount of keys, safe combinations and interact with the environment. As the Survivors, it is up to you to help your colleagues escape the nightmare you have found yourselves in by scouring through cupboards, desk drawers, iron safes and anything else, in order to search out your ways to freedom.On the opposite end of that spectrum sits one other player who is in control of the ghoul/ghost for any chosen scenario and their objective is to simply wipe out all survivors before they can reach the end, the unique twist is though, that the monsters come in three variations and each variant of ghoulish terror requires a different strategy to conquer and overcome as you (the survivor) cannot deal any damage or defeat this player in any way. I will break down the Survivors versus Monster like so:MARY (GHOST):Mary is a scary Asian ghost girl who has the ability to randomly teleport anywhere in the vicinity of the survivors, but not close enough to be within immediate visual range, this can be initiated either by the player or automatically if they spend too long searching for a victim. She can open doors, stalk the hallways slowly and calmly, sobbing with tears; the best strategy for survivors is to run the hell away because simply gazing directly at Mary or being too close in her proximity will trigger the hunter players ability to send her into a screaming rage, who will then run at you and eviscerate you from the inside out. Bar the doors and do not let her in. When she teleports, best to check behind you....LURKER (GHOUL):Looks a lot like Pumpkinhead or a really tall guy who decided that wearing his birthday suit was too much effort. This Ghoul can move between Spectral and Material realms much like Raziel from Soul Reaver, only with a cool down timer and while spectral, cannot see the survivors but can move at speed, pass through locked doors & rig sound traps so if someone stumbles past, say a grandfather clock then it will chime triggering the Ghoul to materialise and slowly, VERY slowly chase after the unlucky individual.PHANTOM (GHOST):Is omnipresent, this ghost can move through any locked door and drift around at terrifying speeds. The only way to avoid this one is to remain silent and move slowly through the level, keeping a visual on it at all times where possible. The only way it can detect a survivor is by sudden noise, such as turning the flashlight on and off or by getting too close to it, thereby lighting that survivor up in an aura that only then can the Phantom detect a presence, other than that it is essentially blind, but the hardest to compete against. Stay away from the centre of the rooms.If any of these creatures manage to catch you it is a one hit kill with no coming back and if you were the one carrying all the keys, you have just made everyone else’s day a whole lot worse.Now, not that I mean to end on the negatives but there are some issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there are no dedicated servers as it is only a peer-to-peer service meaning that game sessions can range from stable to downright jittery with latency playing a big part of that problem. The game itself is already ill-optimized and framerates can differ heavily depending on what kind of hardware your rig is running. You can have a budget six core processor or a monster expensive processor, you will still see many of the same issues so I would feel terrible with anybody 'meeting' the actual specifications required to run this game as opposed to surpassing them and I mean, it is not exactly the most demanding game out there, regarding hardware requirements. It doesn't even LOOK all that spectacular to begin with. It absolutely is not horrible, but the fact it has issues, requires some serious attention from the Developers if they hope to iron out these flaws and beef up the stability of this product.The animations for all characters border between offensive and hilarious as many, if not all of them look like imposable action figures, with the bare basics required to call them 'high-poly' models. They portray little to no emotion, physically, the audio doing all the work it needs to do and thank christ there! Because when you are trudging through these dank environments which are so beautifully, crafted and rendered, to see John the Priest, complete with missile launching action, running out of a room then being chased by the Lurker who looks as stiff as super glued lego you cannot help but either smirk or run in the opposite direction terrified of either the animations or the monster chasing you at the forefront of it all. It pulls you almost straight out of the experience and the immersion of it all but not enough to justify it as truly terrible.With a little more time spent developing and fine-brushing some animations and textures, Damned can be a lot of things that many games are not and you can really sense the quality under its garbled hood. However, right now, there are a lot of things it is not and given a lack of content and game modes you really see all there is to see within the first ten to twenty minutes of playing. It is really only saved because with friends, it can be an absolute rioting good time full of scares, tension and laughter.Get this to experience it with friends, because finding a server where it is stable or the lobby leader will not kick you out come few and far between. Damned is an enjoyable if not, short lived package that deserves your support and with that, will with any luck come a much better game down the line.SCORE:[76/100]- Daniel Kerr Spendlove			"

												Love the idea of the game and the execution is pretty good considering, but unfortunately it's extremely hinged on the monster to keep things interesting. So while the game itself is pretty good, all the games I've played become very stale very quickly, either the monster is terrible at being the monster (thus making being a survivor boring) or the monster is signifciantly better than the survivors (making being a survivor difficult). In short: Love the idea, Pretty good execution, but unfortunately it's a very hit or miss experiance if you're playing with random people over the net.			"

												ok, so this game, for me, has been bittersweet. i really want to love it, honest. Theres just one HUGE issue. Most games i join freeze up. The game just crashes. i dont know if its a common issue, but its annoying. When the game works, however, it is a blast. The gameplay is fantastic, and having a monster that is played by an actual player adds a new element of intelligence that a AI just cant bring. The person controlling the monster can learn and adapt to your escape strategy. I would recomend the game, just dont be surprised if it crashes alot.			"

												10/10. Simply playing this with friends and online players gives you an un describable sense that strikes your soul to the very core; formed by the horrors and excitement you experience in game. Playing this game provides you with the chance to experience the most popular theme of all time first hand. The  theme, ""fear of the unknown""; which was the main theme in the famous book, ""Dracula"". You will understand it when you play it. Watching play throughs just wont be enough...			"

												This one of the very few reviews I've written. I am annoyed enough to actually write one.A number of my friends and I acquired this game through a recent Humble Bundle, expecting a few hours' fun with what reads like a really nice idea for an asymmetric multiplayer game. What we got was a bug ridden, slowly performing, confusing mess across multiple different systems. Let me explain.The game has many problems, most obviously bugs: menus appearing unexpectedly and staying there throughout gameplay; unexpected freezing which forces a quit to menu or process kill; bizarre drops in mouse sensitivity or input tracking; variable framerates; disconnects from multiplayer games yet remaining in the player list; minimal feedback on player/monster actions; the list goes on. We were playing on a mixture of systems, some with NVidia cards and some with AMD, all using Windows 7, and I can say now that we've not had anywhere near as many problems with any other game. The next bunch of issues relate to the game design itself. The basic elements of the gameplay are there, but they seem to be at the level found in a lot of early version mods available for other games. Playing as any of the monsters is actually very shallow in terms of gameplay, and playing as the survivors doesn't really feel like anything beyond semi-coordinated trial and error. There's barely any interaction with levels beyond picking items up and opening doors, the latter of which has a needlessly awkward grab mechanic that in practice doesn't justify its existence. The items are difficult to spot as well, which results in the survivor's role rapidly becoming one of frustration and confusion, especially when playing a new level. As a group Damned sounded fun, and we play in a LAN environment so we hoped the horror aspect would make it a good investment. As it turns out the gameplay is barely fleshed out, and when the game does run it either runs very badly or encounters problems. I just can't recommend it, not with many other games offering much better for a lot less than the Steam price at the time of writing (£15).The worst bit? We experienced all the above in an hour. A single hour. It literally took 60 minutes to exhaust patience of five PC gamers who are happy to mod, tweak, upate drivers, and customise controls, in order to get something working. Did we give it enough time? You decide; we found something else to play.			"

												Damned is a game that is indescribably fun with a bunch of friends. Playing with 5 other friends on a game of Damned is so ridiculously enjoyable, I've bought 5 copies in total for me and 4 friends (the ones that weren't convinced to buy it themselves). It's very fun and can get really scary in the best way possible. My only complaint is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ server issues (it takes an hour just to get a server going that won't break). If they could fix that I would scream how great this game is from the top of the world. Welp, now I'm going to go buy another copy for my girlfriend!			"

								Jugastes Penumbra? Amnesia? Este es tu juego para jugar con amigos o no :D Pues bien, este juego tiene ese trafondo y tipo, salvo que aqui no hay un enemigo controlado por el juego, uno de los jugadores TIENE que ser el cazador de los sobrevivientes o sea... es el mountro de turno que se encarga de eliminarlos uno a uno para ganar. Como la modalidad de juegos como el amnesia, el mounstro es indestructible (por ahora esta el tipico mounstro de Amnesia y ahora el Fantasma, que posee otras a habilidades; se esperan mas a si como otros Personajes/Sobreviviente), y los jugadores tienen una sola opcion, correr y esconderse... Mientras se abren paso a su escape, por medio de conseguir las llaves y codigos numericos que abren puertas... plus conseguir elementos como un martillo o barreta para liberar la ruta de escape.Hay muchos servidores para jugar, la mayoria yankis, pero eso seguro, siempre esta lleno de gente para jugar, asi que no hay problema de quedarse sin jugar, muy concurrido.Muy recomendado, mientras mas son mejor es. Recomiendo que lo compren entre varios, cuando este en oferta, como el hallowen pasado. Costo por pack de 4, cada uno pago 6 dolares.			"

												Damned is a Co-op horror game that focuses on searching and hiding.  There are 5 players in one game, 4 are the humans and 1 is the monster.  The humans have to search for keys and open doors to try and escape the monster.  The game is pretty fun until you hit the 10 hour mark and all the maps and monsters start to feel old and boring.  This is a decent game and i would love to see them add just a few more maps or just a few more monsters to spice things up.  There are some issues for this game.  Be warned that the game does freeze at times and you have to restart the client to fix this problem.  It becomes a nuisance at times.My overall score for this game is a 6/10			"

												A game that is fun with friends, and not much more. At least, when the game works is it fun. Joining a game with friends and making it work is the definition of frustrating. Some party members cannot join properly, causing the host to disband and recreate a party several times before getting a functioning game. After 10 minutes of unsucessful tries, when you finally get in game, it's an enjoyable experience. The game however, runs horribly, even on a GTX 970/i5-3570k I feel lucky to even getting 30 fps at times. Gameplay; finding keys and batteries just to see is definitely a horrifying experience; the ambience of the game is phenomenal. With any of the monsters chasing you, it's definitely a terrifying experience.  Spawning system is wonky and occasionally on several maps you're stuck searching for a key that just doesn't exist. The basic premise for the game is decent, it's a shame that the developer didn't expand on it any more than that. At a five dollar price point, if you and a couple friends want to have a devent spooky time, then I recommend it. At a higher price, I would not recommend it. The frustrations to get an enjoyable scary experience are just not worth it.			"

												First, let me state that I was following this game since Early Access, but waited for ""Full Release.""  I was exceedingly hopeful for this game.The reasons I CANNOT recommend this game are the following:It is horribly incomplete and one-dimensional.There is but one thing to do in the game: Run like a moron and hope you don't miss a vital key in a bucket or some crevice while the already-lethal ghost is chasing you down, clicking their mouse button til you get close enough for the kill shot to register.There is no depth to this game in regards to gameplay.  There are no complex objectives requiring any kind of cooperation among the players.  The monster/ghost role is as simple as just left clicking and holding down W.This game has so much potential, but I fear the developers aren't able to provide anything more than a short-lived atmospheric bore-fest.

												My friends and I spent an evening playing Damned and it was absolutely worth the money.  I think you will enjoy this game if you aren't expecting AAA polish and are interested in having a lot of fun getting into your role as either the monster or one of the survivors.  This game relies a lot on the monster to create a fun experience for the survivors.  It's so important to mess with people before you kill them.

												Honestly, this game is one of the best co-op horro games I have ever played. The game had some great mechanics, and it's so fun to play with your friends. Yes, it is very obvious that there are many bugs and issues that need to be fixed, and some nerfs and buffs to certain elements of the game. It has so much potential which is why at this point in time, I recommend this game to people who like a bit of fun, and a good scare. I must state that it seems to be more fun with friends, and many may find it now without playing with mates. Rate: 8/10.			"

												I would not reccomend this to anyone. It's a laagy nightmare (despite using virtually no resources) even just trying to navigate the menu. It's virtually unplayable for the same reason. Before trying to blame my computer, I'd like to point out that it can run games like Dying Light. I've seen better games on steam for WAY less money, and I'm rather shocked that something like this that barely runs is going for as much as it is. I had it gifted to me and I would still return it for refund if I could... I lack words to adequately describe the frustration the mere attempt of getting into the game, and then trying to move (only to find that it was just as bad as the launch screen) caused. Interesting premise or not, the core aspect integral to a game's success is its playability, and if it is unplayable, then it has failed at the most important objective.			"

												I love the style of the game. It's horror meets escape-the-room; two of my favorite types. It's a bit like Amnesia, only you play as either the monster (one of 3 choices) trying to kill everyone, or one of four ""survivors"" trying to escape the place you're trapped in by collecting keys to unlock doors. A few problems with game bugs - getting stuck in walls, game disconnecting, dying sometimes produces two dead bodies or a live body running into a wall, but otherwise the game is playable and worth the $20 if they fix the bugs. Best played with a group of friends, in a dark room, with voice chat. Really adds to the creepiness, or hilarity (if you have friends like mine).			"

												Searching for keys in a dark room. See mary at the door. Close and block the door. Turn around, see mary again, get killed and then laugh/cry/rage about it.This is probably the scariest game I've played so far, mainly because it's an actual play controlling the monsters.Each monster has different play-styles and the survivors have to learn to adapt to them. If you don't, you'll die.This is one of those games where you get the four pack, give it to your friends and start playing it. I've played many hours of this game and I'ts STILL scary. The ambience doesn't help much either.The mechanics of the game are very fun to play with while being difficult at the same time. You're always running back and forth finding keys and trying to figure out what opens what. That doesn't sound scary, right? Try adding a monster that you can't effect in any physical way.This game is lacking in content for the price, but more content will be added eventually, probably a new map or monster.I continue to play this game, and I will for a long time. Great work 9heads!(And those who are complaining about low FPS, try restarting your computer and running it again, it's most likely a bug in the version of Python they used)			"

								damned is an absolutely terrifying game that really pulls you in with its groundbreaking story. you play as a flashlight with no memory of his tragic past. you wake up in a room and make some friends controlled by strangers because you don't have any friends in real life and you all go on a fun scavenger hunt looking for items such as keys and crowbars and combinations to safes that contain items such as keys and crowbars and combinations to safes. however, it's soon discovered that you are trapped in a spooky kitchen and all of this fun you're having is just delaying your inevitable excruciating death. there's only one way out of this twisted funhouse and that's to be massacred by being left clicked once by someone playing as spooky ghost or low textured meat man. but don't worry, when you get left clicked you can spectate from your comrades' perspectives so you can watch them get left clicked and live the thrilling experience again and again key elements include smooth jazz that plays whenever spooky ghost or low textured meat man are near youeven YOU can be spooky ghost or low textured meat man and YOU can left click people and if they have a heart attack and die because of how absolutely scary this game is then their blood will be on your hands and you can live with that fact until the end of timealso you have to make an account after buying the game so make a username that you want to be stuck with forever because if you want to use another username you'll have to buy the game again for that username too			"

The survivors goal is to find keys and other object to escape, while trying to avoid getting killed by the monster. Of course the monsters goal is to kill all the players.

								Gonna give it a fast review based on beta as pro/con list:Pros- Unique idea.- Lots of scares with friends.- Mary is the most fun and neat monster to play with or against that produces the most scares.- The settings are nice.- Full random! The keys spawn randomly (although crowbars don't on few levels).Cons- Connection issues and game crashes. The game crashes a lot and the connection seems faulty, it really needs 3rd party servers instead of a host server.- The game is too hard for the survivors, nearly impossible to get through it without dying if the monster knows how to play.- Mary is the most balanced character now. As this is spoiler free, the 2 others can get to the starting area and just kill off everyone in under 2 minutes.- The game NEEDS you to play with friends, you have a very slight chance to have fun with random people.To put it bluntly, the game is nice to play with friends and it's a unique piece of horrorgaming. If you want scary fun with friends, this might be the only game to allow that. It has it's problems but it's still beta! If you can't sit through game crashes or connection issues, then I'll say to wait for the full release.Beta gets about 8/10 =D			"

												This game has a really amazing concept to it. It has great horror factors to it, hardly relying on jumpscares as its main focus of fright. It also has unique types of Monsters you can play as; the Lurker (completly blind, but can set audio traps to pin-point where survivers went and manifest into a solid being), the Phantom (another blind Monster, but you can see surivers hinding behind walls or objects once you first see them) and Mary (a spectral girl similar to the Grudge spirit that is always visible, walks very slowly, but has a frenzy attack if she focuses on a surviver for a certain amount of time). Alas, this game is still ridden with terrible flaws that make it hard for me to recommened this game to anyone.FIrst off, they made the mosters waaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.  They can kill you in one hit and there's no life meter for the survivers. You can set how many lifes you have, but they're shared with the other survivers. Secondly, the survivers have absolutly no way to defend themselves. All you have equiped is your flashlight and whatever you find while scowering whatever place you spawn in (keys, hammers, and crowbars). There are no weapons for you to get to defend yourself from the Monsters. Thirdly, respawing is broken. There's been a few times while playing this game with some of my friends that one of them respawned right next to the Monster. Lastly, there's hidden effects that happen to you, while some are accecptible, others are not. One I think is okay is where your character will start halucenating if your flashlight's battery is low. The other is how stamina is both there and it's not. Sometimes you can run just fine, but then you halt to a walk and can only sometimes run. There's also no meter for your stamina.If this game could get some fixes, I would recommend this game. As it is right now, I just can't justify it as a good game.			"

												as most people say this is like amnesia but with co-op. Even though half the games i get people just go off on there own the other half i get people who want to work together which is really fun. i thought it was worth it!			"

												Love the idea of the game and the execution is pretty good considering, but unfortunately it's extremely hinged on the monster to keep things interesting. So while the game itself is pretty good, all the games I've played become very stale very quickly, either the monster is terrible at being the monster (thus making being a survivor boring) or the monster is signifciantly better than the survivors (making being a survivor difficult). In short: Love the idea, Pretty good execution, but unfortunately it's a very hit or miss experiance if you're playing with random people over the net.			"

												Best Pitch Black Room Simulator of 2015, bar none. Let me tell you.The best part of the game is that it is aparantly built entirely in Python. All the stability and speed of an interpreted language is on display here. THe server list helpful lists games in alphabetical ascii order, where lowercase a comes after uppercase Z. Can't find game aaron aardvark? that's because it's below Zombie Zoomba. Join a game if you dare!Imagine you are in a dark room, you can hold up a flash light, that illuminates a narrow cone for you, but no one else can see it. Now imagine crawling around on your hands and knees though a house looking for tiny keys that open random doors. Which keys open which doors? I have no idea, sometimes you get a decription on the key, but the doors have no names. If you are lucky enough to open a door, hold on to the click button and move back and forth a bit until the door physics freaks out and opens in a random direction. Sometimes you hear scary music which means it is action time.Begin action time. If they are a powerful monster, you are should immediately turn off your flashlight and run in a random direction. You are dead anyway, but this might make them waste 0.03 seconds which might allow one of your friends to escape. If they are a weak monster, turn off your flashlight and run in a random direction. You will sometimes live, beacuse the monster will get caught on a jagged edge and spin in space randomly. Success! Please note, unlike humans, monsters CAN see flashlights. They have monster eyes.Ok, you have been crawling around lost in the house and/or creepy woods (you can tell it is creepy because there are jack-o-lantern's every 17.2 feet in every hallway, that's how you know it's scary) for a long time, and you have not seen a battery to click on in a while, and OH NOES YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD. Begin pitch dark screen simulator. On the macbook pro it is especailly convincing, because the monitor doesn't even turn on! You are in the pitch dark, you can see nothing, hope is lost, except that it might take the monster another 20 minutes to find you because he has a hard time seeing you because he only sees flashlights (monster eyes). If you are very lucky and at a LAN party and another dead survivor is in the room with you, he can spectate you and you can screenlook on his screen to help you nagivate. Or he can yell directions to you. My friend Jimmy did this for me, Jimmy you are the best.If you are the monster, life is great, even if you are a bad monster. Walk around randomly. Sometimes a survivor walks in front of you. Turn into a real monster, and click on them. They are dead! Do this 3 more times. You win! Acheivements for everyone! Well, not everyone. Just you. Those poor saps were crwaling on their hands and knees trying to figure out how to open a cabinet with the wierd door physics trying to find a key which may or may not exist for the unlabeled door. Puny scum! Also, half of them probably have crippling graphical glitches, like a serverlist of games to join blocking most of their screen. That's the breaks! After 7 games of the survivors never managing to open more than a few doors, convince the monster to stay put and try to let the survivors win one game. After an hour of trying to find keys with 4 survivors and no monster, turn off game, unable to find door or even begin to understand the win condition. You are a winner! "

												This is my first review ever. I gotta say, that I love this game. The atmosphere, cooperation needed, and monsters make the game so much fun. I love joining games where the people roleplay their parts. This game is a must have. But forewarn, it actually is more fun to play with friends. Unless, you get lucky and find a game where the players talk. Otherwise, you're pretty much on your own.			"

												ok, so this game, for me, has been bittersweet. i really want to love it, honest. Theres just one HUGE issue. Most games i join freeze up. The game just crashes. i dont know if its a common issue, but its annoying. When the game works, however, it is a blast. The gameplay is fantastic, and having a monster that is played by an actual player adds a new element of intelligence that a AI just cant bring. The person controlling the monster can learn and adapt to your escape strategy. I would recomend the game, just dont be surprised if it crashes alot.			"

												This one of the very few reviews I've written. I am annoyed enough to actually write one.A number of my friends and I acquired this game through a recent Humble Bundle, expecting a few hours' fun with what reads like a really nice idea for an asymmetric multiplayer game. What we got was a bug ridden, slowly performing, confusing mess across multiple different systems. Let me explain.The game has many problems, most obviously bugs: menus appearing unexpectedly and staying there throughout gameplay; unexpected freezing which forces a quit to menu or process kill; bizarre drops in mouse sensitivity or input tracking; variable framerates; disconnects from multiplayer games yet remaining in the player list; minimal feedback on player/monster actions; the list goes on. We were playing on a mixture of systems, some with NVidia cards and some with AMD, all using Windows 7, and I can say now that we've not had anywhere near as many problems with any other game. The next bunch of issues relate to the game design itself. The basic elements of the gameplay are there, but they seem to be at the level found in a lot of early version mods available for other games. Playing as any of the monsters is actually very shallow in terms of gameplay, and playing as the survivors doesn't really feel like anything beyond semi-coordinated trial and error. There's barely any interaction with levels beyond picking items up and opening doors, the latter of which has a needlessly awkward grab mechanic that in practice doesn't justify its existence. The items are difficult to spot as well, which results in the survivor's role rapidly becoming one of frustration and confusion, especially when playing a new level. As a group Damned sounded fun, and we play in a LAN environment so we hoped the horror aspect would make it a good investment. As it turns out the gameplay is barely fleshed out, and when the game does run it either runs very badly or encounters problems. I just can't recommend it, not with many other games offering much better for a lot less than the Steam price at the time of writing (£15).The worst bit? We experienced all the above in an hour. A single hour. It literally took 60 minutes to exhaust patience of five PC gamers who are happy to mod, tweak, upate drivers, and customise controls, in order to get something working. Did we give it enough time? You decide; we found something else to play.			"

												Ok, so I only have a couple hours on record, but this game has the potential to be AMAZING.  Keep in mind that the controls are a little awkward (especially for the monsters) and that each monster plays entirely different.  Also, the AI is basically non-existant it seems, so count on playing it with friends (to include a monster).  Also, the secret to each monster is to be patient, if you aren't patient, don't play a monster.This game is excellent though, I definitely recommend it.  I've played (in the same room) with 2 different friends, and both of them have screamed.			"

												This game is like putting a blindfold on a horse in a small room and spooking it, so it goes around and kicks everyone. Basically, no one wins. The game is the horse, and the players are the people being kicked. It is unbelievably glitchy. Sometimes the mechanics just don't work. The maps are too large and the objectives are too vague.

However some bugs in the menu are so damned annoying that it kinda ruins it. Still 6 of my friends got this game and we have had really fun playing it so it's probably worth it.			"

But when you are invisible you can`t see the other players. There is no reason to be invisible. Marry can teleport to random places, but she walk like a snail, can`t decide were to teleport and teleports randomly even though you did not want to. Phantom. Phantom is just horrible. He have no powers at all. He can`t see players, walk, can`t run and the only good thing is when you are basically inside another player you discover them, and you have x-ray vision for like 10 seconds before you can`t see them anymore. 3/10			"

												While this game is fun, it needs to be remade with a different and better engine.The monsters need to have different variables when it comes to each stage. Some stages are very narrow making monsters (especially the Phantom) way too powerful. What I'm trying to sya is that mosnters aren't overpowered- It's just certain stages are not appropriate for select monsters. Monster abilities/stats be allowed to make friendly changes would be nice.			"
