												Grimind is a game that tries to do too many things and ends up doing none of them well.It starts out simple enough, with simple clear platforming and goals, with a creepy vibe to the environment. Then mechanics start getting complicated; the puzzles start to hide the fact that they're puzzles, enemies begin to swarm you, deathtraps pop up that you couldn't possibly have forseen. This would be excusable, but then the game's core components start tripping over themselves.The platforming ends up taking a backseat to once-a-level gimmicks, none of which ever come up again once you've finished them. At one point, your character pulls the ability to create an astral projection to take over an enemy's mind out of his♥♥♥♥♥(and never uses it after this one time, mind you) but needs to be guided to the enemy first, with the most godawful controls I have ever seen. The rest of the game is playable with the controller, this section cannot be done on a controller because you have to do too much twitch aiming for the controller to handle.The horror dies quickly once you realize all that's happening is that you're dying over and over again not because of a lack of skill but because your light source decided to arbitrarily change direction or shut off for no reason, or you had to spend a bit too much time underwater because that's the only place you could get a necessary item which slows you down when you carry it, or the enemies' movement patterns are all but completely unpredictable and cannot be reliably dodged. The final boss is especially guilty of this; he spawns hordes of enemies completely at random from the center of his only weakness, which you have to come into direct contact with in order to damage. Have fun instantly dying because the boss decided to spawn five enemies right as you were jumping up to hit him.The last few levels are an exercise in frustration, forcing you to fight large numbers of enemies simultaneously with a control scheme that wasn't designed for any sort of fighting, in areas devoid of reliable ways of killing them (and only containing one or two unreliable ways to do so), without taking any damage whatsoever. Sure, you can take more than one hit, but without mercy invincibility it doesn't matter as the enemies cling to you like you're made of flypaper. These levels also have sections that don't have enemies, but I don't feel they're worth mentioning and neither does the game because you will not be given a single indication as to what you're supposed to do to progress. Meanwhile, have fun dying dozens of times in a row because the checkpoint system decided to spawn you right next to an enemy, and then not give you another checkpoint until you've successfully competed 5 minutes of needlessly obtuse puzzles.The story...the story's a mess. You never find out what's going on, your character pulls new abilities out of nowhere just so the developers can shove in another single-level gimmick, the grammar is horrible, and to top it all off once you finally finish the game it turns out everything was pointless because you end up back where you started and then die, never having figured out a single thing about yourself, your opponents, the setting, or anything else.If you want a horror game, a puzzle platformer, or a trial-and-death game, there are much better games out there than this.

												I say yes, but only to a point.You play as an amnesiac dinosaur like creature who is terrified and alone in a temple or city in a state of decrepitude. A simple platformer that never asks for very much in the way of challenging jumps, always lead you on where to go with how the stage is laid out to lean into or highlights with colour, and whose puzzles are never quite as complex as you might originally think they are. It falters a bit in the fact one should always have the ""grab/hug"" button pressed down so that when running or jumping you will get where you need to go more often than not, even if you fail to see what you are grabbing onto. To try and stand out gameplay wise it uses a physics engine. This comes into play as you swing across vines, rocks crumble, water flows, creatures bounce off each other, and you the player picks up and throws balls. While okay, it's competent only and perhaps frustrating in the first few tries to figure it out at different points (a ball that explodes needs to be grabbed carefully). Never does much or asks for much. Yet, it is still a game I took quite a bit from and enjoyed my team with up to a specific point. The atmosphere and theme of the game is that of horror. The fear of being alone, of not really understanding what is out there in the darkness, and being dropped down into locations with rarely a reason why or what to do until you get close to the end. For this the creators of the game ask you to play in a dark room and with a good set of headphones and I dare say it accomplishes this task of making the game stand out far more than it would if played brightly and in silence. To bring this into game play often you can be in the dark, shivering or moaning in fear, where that ball of light is precious for survival. Where if there is no light and you make a mad dash to freedom or follow a chance of survival, you look for the smallest of colours beyond the pitch black in near blind hope. I however never completed this game despite my thoughts above. For while it does stand out and I recommend at least early on for those seeking good sound and atmosphere examples, I never felt satisfied with the platforming and a change in game play in the second half of the game resulted in great frustration where I had to move a floating ball between obstacles and the mouse controls were simply not helpful and just plain annoying in how simple it was to fail due to the layout, floaty physics used, and ""one touch to anything is a restart of the puzzle"". I completed it mind you, but I simply stopped caring at that point. Later I saw it would often default to limited time of light available and follow the leader trial and error which without challenging platformer I've never cared for. I did enjoy it's use of achievements. Rather than ""complete this chapter"" or "" jump 10 times in a row"" they used a set-up of secrets in the game with the Achievement picture being a small close up picture of where to go to find said secret. I went to locate them simply because I enjoy this type of challenge and a few were clever in their hidden paths. Simple in most regards, worth trying out for what it attempts to do more than what it accomplishes, and perhaps you will not be as annoyed as I was in Chapter 8 to discover what this game is about and the amusing secrets it has for achievements which I found rather clever. As part of a bundle, that is to get cheap or as a gift, it's worth trying out. If seeking out a platformer or horror game to really get into or at full price, I say nay.			"

												If you're a fan of smart puzzles and love games with a grim atmosphere - this is a game for you. You will die countless times trying to figure out physics, visual and sound puzzles in this dark and disturbing world. There is a platforming element in this game, but it doesn't get too much in the way - you just need some timing, but it's your brain which will do most of the work anyway. The game is unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand when you play it, exactly like the good old games.Get it and play it!			"

												With 185 deaths to my record on one single game, I must tell you something right away : Death is inevitable. You will die. A lot.But nonetheless, this is a really good game for some reasons : The story is simple. There is little dialogue and when there is some, it is always useful to the story. The soundtrack makes you feel like you are in an outworldly place, deep into the rock. The contrasts of light and shadow is well done, making you feel sometimes that creepy feeling that you are being watched. Some puzzles will make you sit for a while and think what is the next step to do, so don't be afraid to take your time.An overall good game that I warmly recommend.			"

												This game is amazing. That's as eloquent as I can say it in one sentence. The theme is fantastic, the horror builds as the game continues, the atmosphere is perfect, the controls are smooth and intuitive, and I have enjoyed being able to play this game in the time that I have gotten the pleasure to. I played the version that was available on the website before I played this version, and the updates make the game so much smoother and more exciting to play, while still maintaining the challenging intellectual aspect that is required to solve the puzzles. If I had to go with a number score, Grimind definitely gets a 9/10			"

												Grimind is an atmospheric horror platformer puzzle game.  While an interesting concept, it is not executed very well with frustrating physics-based puzzles, boring writing with possibly the least satisfying ending to any game I have ever played, and a not terribly interesting art style.  If you play this game, expect to restart certain puzzles and sections many times due to their physics-based nature.  Games that use physics as a gameplay mechanic yet don't bother testing to make sure that moving platforms that are required to continue don't randomly throw you to your death make for very frustrating experiences that are not at all fun.  It is rather unfortunate because some of the other physics puzzles are quite creative and interesting.As another note, if a game has a player escort section where you have to stick close to an NPC or you die, don't have the NPC take random detours from the path just to make it more difficult.  It turns the section into more of a trial-and-error frustration than adding any real difficulty.While some people might enjoy this game, it's too boring and has too many frustrations for me to recommend.

												I don't even know what to write on this one. It's so fundamentally mediocre that I don't feel anything towards it either way. It's entirely lacking in fun but there's not really much frustration to be had either. The enemies are a bit unfair since any hit is basically instant death. The puzzles are often anti-puzzles or otherwise pointlessly obscure. The game's not too terribly long (~4 hours the first time through for me) and it does a lot of different things, I guess. The art style's alright, kind of reminds me of Knytt Underground to some extent. The game wants to be LIMBO, also, with the atmosphere. The problem is that the narration... uhh... is unnecessary, and on top of that badly translated. Kind of ruins the plot, it's supposed to be dark and depressing but I'm giggling too much at the bad grammar. Also the ending is pretty stupid, you die, the end, you can't not die, so yay. Hope you had fun. But you probably didn't. I'm mostly rambling because I don't have many organized thoughts on this game. It's a game that exists but has no reason to.			"

												I had an old review about the game, complaining about weird lags in the gameplay - I don't know what changed during the past one year, but the problems completely disappeared while I'm using the same computer. So, a normal review!TLDR part: A crudely drawn, not too pretty platformer with really well-done physics and puzzles, with puzzle-oriented gameplay. Was featured in 14 bundles up to this point, the lowest price was 0.88€ - during a similar discount I really strongly recommend this unpolished gem.This game is weird - it has simple looks, the character looks  no better word, weird, like a potato-hedgehog, the sounds are repeating and simplistic, but the game still works, for me in a really compelling way. The graphics are simple, but the physics behind it work pretty nicely - you need to throw items, activate machines, roll wheels, pull carts to solve puzzles. This is a puzzle platformer, and as each level takes around 8-10 minutes to complete, it's more centered around 1-2 puzzles a level, than platforming for a longer time than a puzzle ; also, trial and error elements are present as well because enemies can drop on you, or you take a wrong turn somewhere.Each level has multiple checkpoints - I think the most time I needed to work to reach after my previous progress after dying was 2-3 minutes at max, so in this terms the game is well-balanced. Another strong positive aspect is the hidden little secrets on each level, usually something funny and unexpected.For the biggest negatives of the game I would mention:-The lack of proper animations and UI; while there is strong audio feedback on everything, it's hard to see if our character hold the rock or not, what way he's turning ; looking around is not really useful, but there's a part when you need to use the mouse / right stick to maneuver a little ""ball"" around a pretty hard environment - I repeatedly lost focus on the cursor because it has almost the same colour as the background. And with a controller, I'm pretty sure that that part would be troublesome with the controller.-Basically the design of the game. It's a clear, focused background, with platforms, presented with silhouettes, and a LOT of back- and foreground. I found myself numerous times not sure if it's spike or grass, solid wall or foreground, and sometimes the puzzles are needlessly hard because it's simply hard to know what are you looking at it.The happenings during level reflect the previous ones so there is at least some causation presented, but the game doesn't have a real, meaningful story - I don't feel like it's really missing. The game is more about going in a level, looking around, finding a physics-based contraption very likely haven't come across yet, make it work, go to the next level. And in my opinion, it works in a fantastic way, if you don't *want* to have a solid story.I do can only recommend this game - despite the weird past I share with this game and headache it caused, I started it again with clean sheets and it proved to be a really, really pleasant surprise.

												Challenging, atmospheric puzzler.I really liked this game, mostly because it was decently challenging and actually engaged a few brain cells. Most of the negative reviews, I quickly glanced at, appear to be players who struggled with the difficulty; this is not an easy game, you have been warned.The puzzles are varied and nicely separated by good old fashioned platformer fun.Along the way the story is narrated, by short text, I found no fault with it. The ending made me chuckle darkly. There are some funny moments and the secrets are worth finding.Graphics are simple but well drawn. The game warns you to play with sound on, this is necessary as it helps with some of the puzzles and also it really adds to the atmosphere. I love the noise the little baddies make.Recommended for those that can hack a bit of frustration whilst figuring things out. Not for crayon eaters.			"

												Grimind is the story of a creature lost in a darkened underworld. Without a single memory of his life or his place, the creature must navigate through a series of mysterious caves, strange mechanisms, and horrifying structures. Knowing he must remember to survive, he sets out to illuminate the darkness not just of the scary world around him, but of his very mind. In the immense darkness lurks something even more diabolical than simply not knowing who he is or what he is, for he is hunted. Red eyes and snarling screams echo off the cavern walls and pierce his very soul, shaking him to his core. Fear the dark, find relief in the light, and escaped the closing corners of your mind. Your Grimind.			"

												Bought this game for a mere 2.99 on sale.For that price, it offered 5-6 hours gameplay and some replayability. It is an Indie game, and I will treat it as such.The developer markets Grimind as a horror/physics puzzle game, and that is about as descriptive as it gets. The gameplay is centered around completing the puzzles without any instruction or hand-holding. Not to say the puzzles are unsolvably difficult, but there are a few moments in which I scratched my  head in frustration and uttered a soft ""what the hell do I do?"" to my computer monitor. Once you get the feel of how the game operates, the puzzles start to become clear. The physics are also quite well done. I understand the developer reworked the inertia of objects and some other parameters for the game's Steam release, and the attention to detail shows. It seems more polished compared to early alpha footage (as one would expect). Objects can be picked up and thrown, liquids respond to disturbances, and soft-bodied pieces like vines move as they should.The strong point of the game is the lighting. Beautifully done point lights and both ""baked"" and active shadow casting as well as ambient gloom in certain points lends to a strong setting for a horror scenario. Many levels throw the character into the darkness with nothing but a lit torch, and as everything in the environment is opaque black, one understands that death may be around every turn.As for the ""scare factor?"" Some reviewers have thought the game is as frightening as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is not necessarily true. The scariest part of the game is the environment itself. The player is pursued by malevolent little--welll--boxes (with no animation) that may only be vanquished with bright light. The enemy design is unbecomingly bland for a game that seems so well-put-together in every other regard. The chase sequences get one's heart pounding, but it is not fear. The character animation is perhaps a little poor as well.The sound work in the game is mixed. The background music/ambient noise are very impressive, and those elements are quite unsettling for the game. They chant at the player like spectral moans from an unknown source and never failed to cause my hair to stand on end. All other noises sound as though they were recorded by a desk mic in Audacity, like the growls of the monsters, drowning noises when underwater, and thunder of fallign boulders or objects. Their lack of quality just doesn't seem to fit, and they certainly didn't scare me.Lastly, the game's story and dialogue were originally written in Polish. (I believe?) The English translation is rough around the edges, but I could understand what was being conveyed with a little bit of pidgin translation. The story begins with no scenario, and ends with little more. It was more depressing of an end than a satisfying resolution. Perhaps there is a metaphorical message to it all? Nonetheless, I would have preferred to see a more complete story. Maybe in the sequel we can see more character development.I give this game 7.5/10. For what it was, I enjoyed every bit of it, but I also see room for polishing all around.			"

												Well, I've had this game in my library for a while, so I decided to give it a shot. My laptop is not particularly fast, but I can play games like Skyrim and have a smooth and completely enjoyable experience. This game however, runs at such a low frame rate that's pretty much unplayable.

												''You have no memories...You don't know who you are...You don't know where you are...That's all I can tell you right now''Grimind is a 2D physics based adventure, platform game in horror/creepy theme. Grimind casts you into forgotten caves and ancient crypts, without memories. While being there you have to demonstrate great manual skills to pass obstacles and solve non trivial puzzles to get out of scary environment and additionally discover what are you doing there alone? but is it certain... that you are there... alone? Features:    Dynamic gameplay combined with a frightening experience    Physics based gameplay - It gives you the possibility to do whatever you want. Every single dynamic object can be dragged, carried or thrown which gives you enormous freedom.    Narration - While playing, the character is talking, telling the player what he feels, if he's scared, or what he thinks about the current situation.    Challenge! - Grimind isn't an easy game, so you can forget about holding just one key and passing through the levels. Besides dexterity and input skills, there is also a large number of logic puzzles to solve. Your brain will be tested and you'll not get bored.Release day: 18.12.2012 - Out now!

												Physics and platforming are fun and well done. Sometimes the grabbing onto things can be glitchy. Basically no story, and the little there is tries to be too existential and vague and it just comes out bleh. The ending is dumb. Biggest problem is there is no direction and the game is too ambiguous in its puzzles. You will be in a giant dark level and there are 5 ways to go and you are somehow supposed to know if you grab that green ball in the top right area and throw it into blue water in the bottom left corner that is how you move on. Tons of times I had to look up how to beat a part and would say to myself"" how did they expect you to know it worked like that?"". Sometimes what you are supposed to use looks like part of the background or you have no idea it works and so you shouldn't know you need to use a certain item a certain way with it, without any clues or information leading you to the conclusion. Hate when games do that. But besides puzzles that usually dont make sense the rest of the game is fun. 6.5/10			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/grimind-first-impressions/Grimind is a great game. Great atmosphere, great visuals, sound, etc.The gameplay itself is rather simple, but with the added aspect of terror. The game slowly builds on this as you progress and, I can admit, it was a bit scary to play at times (especially when you got little creatures running after you making horrid noises). They certainly got that aspect of the game down.On top of the already fantastic gameplay, the game also presents fluid controls, aside from a design flaw that forces a controller user to use the second analog stick as a cursor, which can be a tad annoying at times (rather, all the time). The lack of real controller support was very disappointing.Overall, Grimind is an excellent game. Definitely recommended, but do remember to play with headphones (and in a dark room, preferably).

												tldr; Challenging but rewarding puzzle game, I really enjoyed it and the story line. Pay attention, be curious, and you'll have a blast. I'd highly recommend this if you like puzzle games that aren't easy! It's great!Fun game, very difficult puzzles in places but not ever impossible. I don't find myself getting truly frustrated most of the time, it's a lot of trial, error, death, and more trial. But the pace at which you achieve victory vs the time you spend dying on each puzzle feels nicely balanced, I only felt once or twice I had to stop and take a breather because of frustration, which is less than most other puzzle games I play. The mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn, even as they quite often throughout the course of the game throw new mechanics at you to use on more and more difficult puzzles. And I really feel proud of myself when I finally beat a puzzle or learn to use a new mechanic. The story line is pretty good too, considering puzzle platformers don't tend to have much in the way of plot, so that was a nice surprise. I really like the main character.			"

												Enjoyable puzzle game that had me hooked until the end. Some slight annoyences along the way. But overal good use of light and ambient sounds to create a mood, although the mood is quite depressing. Not giving too much away, but I would not recommend this game if you already are down in the dumps, as playing this would probably depress your mood even further.If you are however looking for some interesting puzzles to solve and do not ""live"" your game characters that much, this could be worth a play. Be warned though, impatient gamers have been known to rage quit as some puzzles do require some skill to complete.			"

												Despite its obvious lack of visual perfection, this game features a great deal of physics-based puzzle solving in the convincing atmosphere of darkness, loneliness & despair. There are some places that are really annoying because of using the checkpoint system instead of normal saves, but also there are places that I loved, especially wondrous flying vehicle in the last but one chapter. The game's length and difficulty are quite normal for this type of game. Not a bad game, I don't regret time spent on it.			"

												Like many minorities, Polish people have had quite a bit of♥♥♥♥♥♥dumped on their heads.  This game seems like it translates perfectly to a Polish perspective.You're a grim, ugly little thing thrown into a large, hostile world with little explanation or support.  Everything wants to kill you, and only by being clever and quick can you avoid danger and maybe even come out on top.It's definitely not the most polished game ever, but it's got a nice atmosphere, the puzzles are just hard enough to be enticing without being impossible, and it's not too expensive.

												I bought this game on sale, looking for a nice horror platform. Unfortunately, this just wasn't it. The atmosphere and sound are wonderful, but it lacks anything else to make it good. The controls are basic, the physics sometimes go crazy, the grammar is weird at some points, and there is no plot whatsoever. That's what really disappointed me about this game. You don't know what you are, who you are, and by the end, none of those questions are answered. You don't even know the motive of the little ghost thing that helps/hinders you. At the end, I was completely disappointed in this game.			"

												I say no. Grimind caught me because 3 things: indie platformer style & storyAuthor of game tell us: ... and additionally discover what are you doing there alone – but is it certain... that you are there... alone. So the most frustrating thing, that you will not discover that. Who you are, what are you doing there, where is  exit.  You don't need that. Jump, fight, run. The game generates even more questions and don't give answers.Maybe not to bother and play only as platformer.Level design is very poor. Just stupid dark tunnels. The level design will not change from beginning to the end. Even playing in the mind of creature, we can't find any difference with other levels.Audio- same thing.Last fight with friend -really аwful, frustrating thing.All gamers, who expect a lot from a storyline, amazing indie, and horror story just pass by.There was a promising idea here but nothing in the game came together to make for an interesting experience. Only disappointment ending.0/10			"

												As a curious gamer, watching the trailer left me very enticed; there are lots of interesting questions, about who you are and who your enemy is. But more than anything I was curious about the horror billing this title has; the majority of horror games take place in a first-person perspective so what kind of scares could be generated from a side scroller? The answer? Mostly jump scares.To start let me mention that while this game has controller support, I would still recommend playing with m+kb. The gamepad just remaps the mouse and keyboard controls (which means no analog movement), with the right stick taking the place of the mouse, which is actually always on-screen. This isn't so bad for controlling the camera, but later in the game when you need more percise mouse movements (by the way precision mouse gameplay has never been fun) the analog stick won't be able to keep up. The Steam controller should be perfect for it, though.I guess the game could be described as a mix of LIttleBigPlanet's game feel and grab mechanic, Yoshi's Island's secrets, and a touch of Limbo's atmosphere, puzzle solving, and trial-and-error.At its core this is a physics-based puzzle platformer. Like LBP, the movement and jumping feels floaty and unresponsive; this doesn't have Super Meat Boy controls but then again it doesn't necessarily demand them. Also like LBP it has a grab mechanic, but it actually does a bit more with it from a puzzle standpoint, as you can only grab one item at a time. It's especially interesting when you learn how to fight your enemy as that ultimately requires the grab too. The puzzles are good enough but definitely have the problems that come with physics; it's a little hard to see where the line is drawn as far as what they demand you to do with the physics, especially since nothing is easy. The puzzles can be a little obtuse at times so don't be afraid to think outside the box.It has Yoshi's Island style hidden passages, which I've never been big on but they make a little more sense here with the darkness and shadows. Most of the secrets are pretty uninspired but they're structured pretty well, with one per level. This game works well as a level a day game.Visible checkpoints are cool.The sound design is pretty good: sounds fade in and out as you move closer or further from their source, and heart throbbing won't abruptly stop at death, but linger onto the next life.But the game's main selling point is horror, so how's that? Well like I said it's mostly jump scares, and even those only last for the first few levels. The game actually shifts from a corridor game to a multi-room puzzle game, which is kind of cool that they didn't feel married to their structure, but at the same time it evaporates a lot of their horror potentials. I wouldn't call this game scary.One problem that lingers throughout this game is it works outside of its established rules often: I don't mean stuff like platforms that should be stable but aren't, but more like how jump scares will generate a noise that comes seemingly from nowhere, or how you're taught through tutorial text that you never see anywhere else in the game, or how sometimes the game just doesn't let you move even though you should be able to, for cinematic effect. It's just a lack of creativity, or laziness.The main reason to play this game though oddly enough is its story: while it never answers some of your more pressing questions it does tell a nice story about overcoming your fears, friends, and all that. It's a little juvenille but it's cool, and it all leads to a twist that changes the fundamental gameplay of the game. That section is the best part of the game, and while I was impressed by it I ultimately can't recommend the game just for that twist. It's just really average, nothing offensive or frustrating except sometimes the physics but nothing too inspiring either. It would be good as a kid's first horror game.			"

												Grimind: My honest review.1. The game wants to be LIMBO way too much     which for me ruined the game.2. The graphics make me wanna vomit. Not muchtime spent. Just looks like the devs got lazy half waythrough development and just blacked it out.3. I got very annoyed starting off because the game resolution    seriously is a living breathing joke. The game has not been    optimized what so ever!4. After finally guessing where the options were I managed to    change the resoloution but STILL they never changed!!!5. The game claims to be ""scary"" or ""creepy"" but it is more funny than anything.6. Like I said before the game wants to be LIMBO and I had a hard time    enjoying what this tries to be a *game*7. In all honesty not a bad game, just not a good game.8. The pricing is terrible. A reasonable price would be dropping    the price by ATLEAST %80 but even then it would be hard to    actually say that this game is worth buying.9. The game does not take a high end PC to run however, even on    a low end pc the game won't look any worse OR better.10. The game whether or not it tries to be LIMBO, it still makes it different      in its own way.Final Verdict.Question: What would you rate this game out of 10?Answer: 3/10Question: Do you think this game deserves a GOTY?Answer: HAHAHA! You have to be kidding me right?Question: Is this game good?Answer: Nope.Question: Was buying this game a good idea?Answer: Nope.FINAL Question: Would you recommend this game?FINAL Answer: No.			"

												Grimind was an awful, shoddy crapfest of a game.  It purports to be a physics platformer/puzzler, a genre which I enjoy; unfortunately, the poorly-made engine and Do It Again Stupid gameplay completely torpedo any chance I might have had to see any redeeming values.  The majority of my deaths felt like they were due to engine inconsistencies rather than player error, as my character let go of the vine he was hanging on for the twentieth time for no apparent reason or went one pixel too close to spikes.    Contrary to the game's marketing claim that I ""wouldn't get bored"", I got bored very quickly as I found myself replaying each (relatively long) segment between checkpoints over and over due to frustratingly loose controls.Also, the game doesn't appear to have any sort of volume control whatsoever, which is annoying when you've given up on it and are just farming it for Steam cards.

												Fun little game. I've had this in my library for ages but only just got around to playing it through - I'd previously played the first level and thought it was alright, but perhaps something worth coming back to. Well, now I have. And I'm glad I did.The graphics aren't great and the controls take some getting used to...but the sound design is excellent, and the puzzles are well put together, with plenty of variety - the game is always introducing new tricks and abilities to avoid repeating itself too much.Despite the bad grammar and the lack of explanation, I really did end up feeling for the little guy...and the ending was kind of sad :(			"

The sounds and visuals are very cool. Very cool. The lighting is amazing. Regardless, I hate platformers and have no idea why I play them. If you like platformers then I highly recommend this game. I'm having difficulty recommending the game because it was so frustrating but it's advertised as a platformer so I suppose I should recommend it.Pros: Sounds (not really music), lighting, unique platformer, frequent checkpoints. Cons: It's a platformer so it's incredibly frustrating.			"

												Before I start the review proper I just want to mention that it's rich that the people part of this community that gave Goat Simulator overwhelming positive reviews and got Grass Simulator on Steam because they're stupid enough to be bribed with keys think they have any right to judge a game with barely a plot harshly. Really amusing.Anyway, yes the plot is thin. Annoyingly so. I didn't get to see just what kind of creature the protagonist was nor why he was there and the ending was basically a downer of epic proportions similar to Hellraiser but from the start it was quite obvious this would be one of those ""The journey is the story"" games. I'm pretty sure that the ending is intentional since the game has ""Grim"" in its name though.Otherwise as far as gameplay goes I'm in love with it for similar reasons I was in love with Amnesia and Penumbra. The physics and world interactivity is awesome. So is the lighting (Those warm and cool color combinations look so damn pleasing to the eye).  I'm not really one that cares much for puzzles but in this case I just like seeing physics objects bounce around and there's plenty of that here. Kind of makes one wonder where the complaints are coming from since if I can manage to negotiate a puzzle in a game I'm pretty sure anyone else can.The game is also technically interesting because of the engine the author wrote. It's a really simple one that just uses SDL, Bullet for the physics and TGA based sprites. I love it when people do stuff like this. So easy to just squeeze out a turd with Unity these days so it's extremely refreshing to see someone take a design and make it their own from the bottom up. This sort of thing is exactly what makes me remember the good times I had in my gamedev stints and makes me want to get back to it.I did a series on it here. Beware though, there's a whole lot of complaining from me about the morons that infest this community in it.			"

												Paweł Mogiła is probably the sloppiest game developer in history. Who has the nerve to release a game in such a despicable state?This game is abominable. As soon as you start the game, the first problem you will notice is the awkward broken English and laughable monologue. Everything about this game is painfully amateurish, the art style is hideous, and the sound effects are repulsive, for example: when you spend too long underwater you start hearing a man gulping water, it's absolutely ludicrous. The art style is not consistent, the backgrounds are stretched and blurry but the most pathetic of all is the grabbing animation which consists of 2 single frames.This guy failed miserably at everything but the level design which is decent for the most part. Avoid at all costs, even if you can get it for free.			"

												Conclusion:+Captivating graphics+Good sound design+Good creepy atmosphere+Some good puzzles-Game mechanics can get relatively tedious-Story is very meh-""Puzzles"" that rely too much on platformingBuy it on a massive sale if you really like indie-puzzle-platformers.End of conclusion.I'd start by saying that Grimind is by no means a bad or a terrible game. It's a somewhat interesting indie title, which is clearly not done with a massive amount of money, and I tried not to raise my expectations too high. And I didn't. But it still wasn't that good, and towards the end I just wanted it to end already. And that's not a good sign.Grimind is supposedly a puzzle platformer, and there are plenty of puzzles indeed. Some are really good, but some are based more on the 'platformer' thingy and the game, meaning that it depends more on you're timing and pressing the right key at the right time, rather than you're puzzle-solving skills. The controls of Grimind were basically alright but not 100% fluid, and this fact together with some level-design decisions made me often get to a point of feeling nervous and irritated as I simply couldn't get through a certain section of the game, again and again and again... Until it stopped being and fun.I could forgive this, though, but unfortunately there wasn't much to keep me intrigued and motivated to actually want to finish this game, aside for a slight curiosity about how the story would end, and my terrible tendency to finish whatever game I play even if I don't enjoy it.So, I did finish the game, and unfortunately I didn't reach any satisfying conclusion to the game. Found out the I missed one secret and that finding all the secrets in the game would grant me an additional ending.Went to look for that missing secret, made it to the ending again, and got an even less satisfying conclusion.Grimind presents you questions and wanderings throughout the entire game but leaves you with no answers, no real conclusion, no real story.So, unfortunately, awkward story + awkward gameplay equals not such a good experience.And that's a shame, because Grimind does show potential, there were some entertaining moments, the game had a brilliant sound design which fit the creepy atmosphere, the graphics are very simple and yet captivating, dark and gloomy and yet colorful.This indie title does have some good features and could be really enjoyable if it only wasn't getting so tedious as the game progresses. It is rather short though, so you could probably get it on a massive sale if you really like this type of things.			"

												A quirky but very enjoyable platformer experience.  As my play time no doubt reveals, it doesn't take very long to get to the end of the game AND 100% completion.  (There's a guide.. but it's much more rewarding if you just get yourself killed over and over until you find all the secrets.)The English might be a bit off for some of the ""dialogue"" but that's okay as it didn't really feel offputting or hard to understand.The puzzles, while few, are nicely done and if you're a fan of the Puzzle Platformer genre you'll probably enjoy the six or so hours you spend playing this.All in all, would recommend.
