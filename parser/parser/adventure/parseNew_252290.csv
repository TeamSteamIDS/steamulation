												Let me preface this by saying this is actually a really cool idea and it is with a heavy heart that I don't recommend it. As others have mentioned it's a little side scrolly thing where you explore an uninhabited little world via side scrolling, and there are writing promps, and you look at the background and stuff and invent backstories to write and you can read other people's stuff. It's not a 'game' in the traditional sense but it lets you be creative in ways the traditional video game can't, and it's a bit more stimulating than just firing up a word processor.The reason I don't recommend is because there are 3 worlds that each take about five minutes to get from one to the other, tops. Of course you're writing for much of it, but still, you're talking about MAYBE squeezing 3-4 hours out of it. I mean look at all the other reviewers: as of now there's one guy with 7 hours played out of the 29 positive reviews, and nobody else has hit 4 hours.Considering they aren't much more than slideshows that are a few minutes long, it breaks my heart that there are only 3 of them. Of course they are interesting and engaging and beautiful but seems like there are a lot of games that are all that and have MUCH more content. Might as well just browse art websites with a word processor window open for free,			"

												The game is very innovative I must admit. The basic conception of writing your own story as you travel around in abandoned planets is amazing! The developers also added the feature of sharing these stories with your fellow gamers which is nice. So why am I givin a negative review?Because the actual content in the game could barely be any lower. There are 3 planets and each of them can be finished in a couple of minutes. I spent only ONE hour with the game and I even had time to read the top rated stories written by users for each of the 3 planets. This gets even worse if we consider the realatively high 15 € price tag. You should ONLY buy the game if you want to honor the developers for their original idea because you won't spend much time enjoying it.			"

												Elegy for a Dead World is basically a themed writing contest.  There are different ""modes"" which ultimately boil down to ""caption contest"" and ""madlibs"".  If you are someone who enjoys writing, this game might appeal to you.  If you are asking, ""how is this a game?""  Well I would agree it wouldn't be a game up until they added the achievements.  There are only three, but they require you to get 1,000 commendations within each themed portal.So there definitely is a game here. And it's definitely unique.  Just one I know for sure I don't have enough skill to compete in.If you'd like to see my Let's Play of it.  You can see it here:

												Elegy is a simple concept executed well: you walk around a beautiful dead world, full of vistas and abandoned structures, and you write what you see. The default writing guides give you a framework to write in (eg. ""The first settlement ended because ____""). It gets your ideas going, but it doesn't ever constrain you to a particular story. That's all up to you. Or, you can turn off the writing guide and write freely.The genius of the game is meticulously designed ambiguity. In both the artwork and the writing guides, there are loads of things to get your mind going, but none of them have an explicit meaning. Like a Rorshach ink blot, everyone will see something different. So you aren't so much writing a story from scratch, as seeing a story unfold in front of you: one that the designers didn't necessarily intend, but that will have meaning to you. By the end of it, if you took the writing task seriously, you will feel like a moving story has been told to you, and then you realise that you told it yourself.A big part of the game is the sharing and reading experience, and it's also the most flawed. The game lets you share stories in public and read other people's stories. It's fun to see other people's interpretation of the same visuals, but the reading experience is greatly hampered by its presentation: instead of seeing the full scenery to accompany the text, you see one or two small windows of objects in the scene. You see so little that you basically have to remember what you saw when you played it, or the text will often make no sense. The other thing is that the game seems to ""score"" you based on how many people commended your work, and this suffers the same problem as all user-created content systems: that a few popular stories will rise to the top, while the vast majority will never be read at all. This leaves the dream of reaching the game's stated goal of 1000 commendations well out of reach to most players.The game is best enjoyed without any expectation of others reading your work, or by comparing stories with a friend. I think it would make an excellent teaching aid for creative writing in the classroom. A highly recommended experience.			"

ELEGY FOR A DEAD WORLD MIGHT NOT BE FOR EVERYONE! - PLEASE READ AT LEAST THE TL;DR OR WATCH THE VIDEO TO UNDERSTAND THIS REVIEW! THANKS!


YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Elegy for a Dead World Critique (In-depth Review) 

			Views: 2,846		

			An in-depth critique brought to you by SwashbucklingSir of the artistic Elegy for a Dead World. A creative interactive experience about writing your own short stories. Check it out!		

Elegy for a Dead World is not exactly a game in the strictest sense. There is not final goal to achieve, there is no failure state and there are only barebones in terms of its mechanics. Elegy for a Dead World really is more a way to explore your fantasy. More specifically, by offering all kinds of writing prompts and premises for you to bring your ideas into short stories. But let us start from the beginning. You can currently choose between three portals, each with a selection of writing prompts, which range from humorous, like quickly finishing the homework on the way to school, to serious topics, like analysing the downfall of a civilization or the extinction of a race. Additionally, all worlds also offer free form writing, without any prompts at all. Once you selected the basis of your short story, you are thrown into one of the three beautiful worlds. Aesthetically, they remind me of Banner Saga, as the layers of two dimensional artwork slowly pass by while you walk and enjoy the environments. Your character constantly breathes audibly and while it might sound confusing and annoying, it actually is quite atmospheric, especially coupled with the underlying music, that changes depending on where you are in the world and creates an unsettling alien mood. At certain points, a feather asks you to fill in the blanks and thus your story begins. If you so choose, the given writing prompts themselves can also be changed, to alter the story to your liking. I do not consider myself a great writer at all to be quite honest with you, especially in terms of creativity, I always need a nudge in some direction to get going. This is why the formula of Elegy for a Dead World works so well with me. It took me about thirty minutes to go through the first world, writing a short story from the top of my head, and I quite enjoyed reading it again afterwards as well. The quite simple concept of providing writing prompts, combined with audio visual input works wonders in triggering my imagination. Well, at least once for each world, as now I am always thinking of my earlier stories, even with the new writing prompts underneath, and thus I find it hard to grasp new ideas and attach them to the world in the background. Some writing prompts especially seem very disconnected from the world you are exploring.If you ever feel exhausted of writing yourself, you can just read what others have produced. The attached Steam Workshop makes sharing and reading other stories very easy, however I also find it quite difficult to browse through the massive amount of stories already. As you can only see the title and the first few words in the game, and no sorting or rating options are available in-game, finding interesting reads could be quite tedious in the future. In my honest opinion, the interface and the accessibility of other stories overall should be improved, since a mere list with titles is quite tedious to go through. I would love to be able to sort by views, recommendations and writing prompts used as basis. Ideally this browsing of other stories would use the whole space available on screen instead of just a measly list of a few titles.Another gripe I have, is that when reading other stories, you only get simulated book pages, instead of the interactive walk through the story experience, which takes away so much of the atmosphere, especially since the pictures in the book cannot be controlled in their shapes, sizes and the like. I understand that when reading through multiple stories on the same portal, it might get very repetitive to go through the world over and over again, however I think that there should be an option to read a story either in the fast, booklet form, or in the exploratory, walking experience.TL;DRTo sum it all up, Elegy for a Dead World is a truly unique interactive experience that might trigger your imagination towards writing short stories to unknown levels, however it also has problems in terms of its interface and its content overall. Three short worlds with two handfuls of writing prompts each make it a tough sale, if you are not heavily into writing or reading sci-fi already. If you love to sit down and think about stories, while needing a little bump to get going tough, Elegy for a Dead World is probably the best option you can currently get your hands on.			"

												I found myself quite let down on this game. The concept seems stellar as a writing exercise, but then I completed it within a hour and a half. There are only three planets you can document, with little variety to find inspiration in. Replayability is nearly nonexistant, so I quickly uninstalled the game. If there were more areas to explore, this would be a more positive review. Go spend your fifteen dollars in a bookstore, and you'll have a much better experience.			"

												As a writer, sometimes the words don't come to you. Elegy for a Dead World is a game that gives you great visuals and haunting audio. There are so many types of prompts, all of which have helped my creativity flourish. I find myself getting ideas every time I sit down to type a few sentences. Plus, it's worth flying around these dead worlds, exploring and wondering what they are all about.As a writer and someone who appreciates beauty, I recomend this game as a great and fun way to do some writing exercises and enjoy the scenery along the way.

												As a father and an educator, Elegy stoked the interest of both. I first went through one of the worlds with a writing prompt, and then had my 9 year old daughter do the same. She couldn't really understand mine, but was quite pleased with hers. I enjoyed both.There are some potential limitations in gameplay replay if there are only the three worlds, which are rather short to play through, but the writing possibilities with the many different prompts available are varied and deep. I would love to get this into my school, but as in most schools in this era, administrators, (including, ironically, directors of technology) stand as guardians of the status quo and block anything that is not Brainpop, or the like.In time, I see Elegy and other digital game-based learning becoming commonplace in education. Elegy's merits are clearly superior to the ubiquitious worksheets of today. Any teacher with an open mind should be able to see it.			"

												As someone who does quite alot of creative writing, I was extremely intrigued by the idea of this ""game"". After giving it a try, I've got to say that whilst the concept is great, in practise it is a huge failure. There is hardly anything to this program! Sure, it's sort of interesting to look at - what there is of it, anyway. But  there is nothing there to even remotely justify the relatively hefty price tag. There is hardly any content at all. Very disappointing. Quite frankly, I've received better inspiration for stories whilst sitting at my desk and staring out of my window into the street. Thank goodness I got it included as part of a Humble Bundle - If I'd paid full price for this I would feel REALLY let down.If you're an aspiring writer, forget this useless program. Get out into the world and look at what is going on around you.			"

												Calling Elegy for a Dead World a game isn't quite right in my view.  There's no opposition, no story save what you create, and no competition.  Rather, it's an exercise in writing.  You travel across one of three worlds, all varied, and write.  You can either use prompts supplied by the game, or, if you already have your inspiration, you can go without, writing whatever you like.  Once you finish, you can put your work online for others to read.Ultimately, it's a rewarding experience.  It probably won't make you enjoy writing if you don't already, but if you like exercising your literary muscles, it's a good way to get some inspiration, put out something others may enjoy, and see what the same images and prompts inspired others to write.

												Don't write much sci-fi?You will.Initially, I saw ""Elegy""'s greatest strength as a weakness, from my perspective as a teacher. Not enough of my kids found the atmosphere particularly appealing, and the prompts/fill-in-the-blanks-style activities, they complained, often pigeonholed them into writing ""sci-fi"" stories.I agreed with them. Writing this review fresh out of the game, I still do.But I don't see how this is entirely negative.I'm a sci-fi fan, and a writer, but I've seldom actually crossed both. A few of my students have felt similarly, too.If ""Elegy"" as inspired at least one of us - as it has - then, I recommend it.			"

												In this game, you read and write. You read by absorbing the environment that your character is exploring, and by actually reading ready-made phrases with blanks to fill. You can replace the entire text if you so choose.This game is more of a creative writing framework. If you enjoy writing, or you would like to get started with writing and need a nudge, this is the right place to do it. The three worlds, while short and static, provide a scaffolding on top of which you can build as little or as much as you want.I think this is best played in short busts. Once you've let a new take on the world flow out of you, I think it takes a while before another worthwhile one pops in your head.On the other hand, you can easily spend an hour reading other people's contributions, and this I would say amounts to 50% or more of the game's value.It looks beautiful, by the way. It's kind of a shame that only three static worlds are available. I am hoping for more to come as free updates. No wonder the game was released three months in advance.So to sum things up, this is for people who enjoy imagining, writing and reading. This is for people who like looking at a painting and imagining a story to go with it, then another, then five more, then hearing other people's stories about it.			"

												Imagine going to a museum and seeing an enormous, beautiful painting of a long-abandoned alien world, and having a notepad with a few abstract sentences and some fill-in-the-blank mad libs to encourage you. That's essentially what this game is; you stroll through the world, observing, and occasionally are prompted to write something, anything, about it. You also have the option to read what other players have written. I was hoping for more, so my one playthrough (so far) left me feeling unsatisfied; but I seem to be in the minority, because a lot of people have said this helped them. Give it a try! Maybe it will unlock the writer within you?			"

There is no fun for the joke was told centuries ago.1. You mourn everything you imagine;2. You're alone.3. If you cry, don't be ashamed. It's your imagination at work.Note: the game supports Russian language. Just switch to a corresponding keyboard layout.Made a short story in English, check it out.

												Elegy for a Dead World let me experience one of the most beautiful and unusual games of the year. Instead of leading me through a fix script with some choices for the players, this game leave the writing of the story to the player itself. An empty text box is a kind of freedom that can be almost frightening, even after visiting all the non linear games if the last decade. After an hour on the lonely planets of Elegy for a Dead World you probably had the most introspective gaming experience of 2014.			"

												Consider this a neutral review.Elegy for a dead world is interesting in concept, the visuals are stunning and I had some fun with it but at its current state it's more like a proof of concept and given its steep price I can't fully recommend it. I don't get a negative vibe from the developers, they seem sincere enough so I don't count the pricetag as a conjob for a snack-sized creativity tool.I would just like to see this concept expanded. We need a wider variety of locations (maybe procedurally generated) and connectivity with other players beyond merely reading their short stories. I know the task of running massive servers is too much for a small developer to shoulder but I'd find the idea of expanding this game into an mmo intriguing. Unlike conventional mmorpgs that don't have a story you could connect thousands of people who all write a part of a bigger story, their own or others'. This is all off-topic and purely speculation but I can count it as a big plus when a game despite its flaws make me ponder untapped concepts for games.For a brief moment I was enchanted though. Get this one on sale if it intrigues you.			"

From these very pretty worlds, yyou write a story.  The story can be about anything you want.  I personally have written about both goats and revolution in my stories.I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys writing or reading, and to anyone else who just likes exploring!

												I sat down and played through Byron's World once last night.  I ended up writing a pretty neat story that I was happy with, but I felt pretty worn out afterwards and wasn't sure if I would come back.  However I got home today and felt like pulling it up again... and I played through Byron's World again with different writing prompts, and wrote something just utterly different and also awesome.  I feel like this game is something I'm going to keep coming back to over time... I haven't even started on the other two worlds yet, and I could definitely spend more time on the first.This game does a great job of providing you lots of creative cues and stimulation without pushing anything specific on you... the result is an incredibly wide variety of pieces generated by yourself and the community, sharing a handful of symbols and themes.  It seems suited to gradeschool classrooms, but it is certainly not juvenile.  I think the concept is an excellent one, and I'd recommend the game to anyone willing to put some creative effort into it.It does have a lot of downsides, however.  One, the menu system is not great.  Publishing your stories and reading and voting on other people's stories is confusing; it's difficult to search through other people's writing (there's basically no tools for doing so, just one view showing most recent works and one view showing most voted for works); there are bugs and/or just poor behavior (like being shown the same story again and again even after voting on it).  But at the end of the day, once you figure out how it works, it is not too big a deterrant.Perhaps more frustrating is the disconnect between reading and editing your story; you write and edit your story while walking through a richly illustrated landscape, and then when you are done you can read your story in a sort of picture book format, with images taken from the landscape automatically populated in your book.  However, you can't edit the story from the picturebook view as far as I can tell, and reading the story while walking through the landscape is slow and awkward, since it takes quite a bit of time to get from one place to another.  Looking back on it now, it is fairly easy to switch between book and landscape, but I just get a general feeling of clunkyness and frustration from the post-experience editing.In conclusion, I think this is an excellent, novel idea, good for adults and children alike, and with beautiful artwork and well chosen, stimulating writing prompts.  It lacks a lot of UX polish, but definitely still worth the time.			"

												I'm upset that I can't recommend this because it is such a great idea. The execution however is really really poor. I'd only recommend this to people who are REALLY REALLY into writing creative stories. People who can be captivated by writing a story for hours and hours. I say this because your £10.99 will get you three planets (or landscapes would be more accurate) to write on. 3 landscapes that take about 10 minutes each if you are writing a simple story. Would it be overly harsh to say that the asking price is kind of greedy when you consider how much content you're getting? Probably, but that's sadly how I feel. I feel like this game is only worth £1-£2 minimum. Speaking of which, the game is on sale as I'm typing this (£2.74). I reommend it during a sale but not at its normal price. Also, the reading experience could be way better. I find it odd how you explore a landscape to write a story but don't do the same for reading other people's stories. I would be so much more engrossed (and probably would've played for a bit more) if I could explore the landscapes while reading the notes that people have left behind (Dark Souls style). I think that would've been a far more interesting way to read stories. I also think that the stories submitted are kinda samey, I wish there were more less serious jokey stories submitted. It seems as though everyone takes this game and their stroies too seriously. In conclusion, don't buy this game unless it's on sale.			"

												I recommend this game for writers, not for gamers. Yes, it is a game. No, it is not a typical game. It is a 2-D side scroller where the objective is to write. It gives many writing prompts to help warm you up to the concept (mostly from romantic poets Byron, Keats, and Shelley in the public domain). This is not the part I like about the game. I like the freeform writing option. You are not limited to certain spots to write, and you are not confined to a previously written prompt. You can stop wherever you want and write whatever you want. The art and music are minimalistic yet stimulating. I find myself staying in one area and writing for a bit and then moving to the next area to seek more inspriation. This works, because the music and scenery change as you wander through the areas. Neither are overpowering and act as more of a white noise to help you maintain focus.I recommend this game to any writer. I would say it isn't necessarilly a $15-quality game, but if you are a writer, and it inspires your writing, then you cannot put a value on that.			"

												Elegy for a Dead World is not a game but an interactive tool for writing short fiction. You explore three different worlds while either filling in the blanks of an existing story or writing your own tale from scratch.The locations themselves are beautiful and the existing story stubs are pretty decent. Unfortunately the game suffers from lack of content. There's only three small worlds to explore and they are all tonally rather similar. Dead worlds filled with the ruins of ancient civilizations.While I found the idea great, I still wouldn't recommend Elegy for a Dead World. The full price on Steam is extremely high for the limited amount of content you get. And besides, at least for me it wasn't even that good as a source of inspiration.The good:- Interesting concept- Beautiful worldsThe bad:- Limited amount of content- All the locations are rather similar- There are much better sources of inspiration out there			"

												Less of a game than a series of writing exercises structured around a largely minimalist game framework, I nevertheless found myself sucked in rather rapidly. With three relatively small worlds to select from, and with a small number of writing objectives for each, the strength of Elegy isn't its gameplay, but rather its use as an artistic outlet. You get to create the story as you wish, either rigidly adhering to the framework they provide or starting from scratch, with nothing more to use than the aural and visual stimuli they provide.  Ultimately, at the end of each exercise, you then get to submit your work to be ""published"" throught the Steam Workshop of the game, where others can read and commend (or not) your efforts.  Likewise, you can read the interpretations of others for those same worlds, and commend them (or not) accordingly. It's a surprisingly engaging experience.			"

												The concept of this game is freaking awesome! I do write a little myself and im really into literature studies (im a student). But this game is unfortunately a let down. There is simply not enough input for my taste. Its minimalistic approach is fine, i do like that, but its lacking content and inspiring visual and musical themes. I stick to real pen and paper and leave this experimental game alone. I imagine that this game is great for people who are interested in writing but didnt have the courage/motivation to write until now.			"

			I'm checking out Elegy For A Dead World by Dejobaan Games. This awesome game lets you become the storyteller and write your own lore and tales.		

I was allowed early access to the game some time ago to see what it was all about. I really enjoyed my time with this game and found it captivating and thought provoking. You choose a world and begin exploring, writing your own lore and story as you go. You can make any kind of story you wish the backdrops are beautiful and I found myself when I first played it just stopping to stare at them. Being able to share and read others stories is great. A simple concept that I absolutely loved!			"

												It's pretty neat.  Good tool for itty bitty prose inspirations, but 37k words into a novel and 20k into an anthology, it's not going to be helping me much with *becoming* a writer.I'm conflicted about the price tag, honestly.  The art and music are phenomenal, and I've often paid more than $15 for single-character commissions from individual artists.  On the other hand, while landscapes take incredible amounts of time and effort, it is still being packaged as a game, and there are different expectations to be set there.This is definitely a cool program, and it's nice to read other people's interpretations on the same scenery I've already explored.  My friend asked me to help him get into writing, and I've already loosed him into these worlds, but beyond an introductory course and some beginning ideas, it falls a bit flat.Most of the other revuews seem to agree with me that what's there is nice, but there isn't much of it.It's gorgeous.Not $15 gorgeous.

												Elegy for a Dead World is one of the most interesting game concepts I've seen in a while. The key mechanic is inspiration. Through vivid imagery and carefully developed atmospheres, players are encouraged to write and share their science fiction themed creations with the community. Whether you are a seasoned writer or someone hoping to develop their skills, this game provides an excellent outlet to gain inspiration and improve. I had fun envisioning different planets and the uniqe inhabitants that called this place home. Let your imagination lead you beyond the stars and experience the beautiful worlds of Elegy fora Dead World. Highly Recommend!			"

												I wanted this to be as awesome as I thought the idea was. I really, really did. The idea was different, intriguing, and I couldn't wait to combine my two favorite hobbies in to one. Unfortunately, my excitement fell apart after I explored the game. There are some prompts that can help you get started, but I was really hoping for more thought-provoking tid-bits and something to keep me flowing and excited to get my ideas out in words. The worlds are very short and don't do much in the way of inspiring unique story lines. I bet if you lined up all the story lines that users have generated, they're all going to be pretty much the same. It's a great tool if you already have a pretty detailed idea in your head, but if you're just coming in to it casually, there won't be a lot of 'spark' to help you create something cool. It's a very unique concept and it definitely has a place in the community, it just needs some more help before it can really take hold. If it had more to help along new writers and didn't cater so much to people who already had detailed ideas prior to booting up the game, I'd have shifted my review to positive.			"

You can even just write without prompts if you prefer. If you're into creative writing, this is a great little game that I will keep coming back to.			"

												REVIEWED 10/12/2014REVIEWED WITH A PRESS KEYElegy For A Dead World is a game about creative writing but more specifically story writing which lets you tell your own story about certain worlds that the game gives you access to each with their own unique backgrounds. You are given the option to change a story already set in stone, create your own story or use a workshop item such as grammar to improve your grammar. But if you're more into reading stories then you are also able to read other users stories and if you like it then you can commendate it which lets the writer know you enjoyed it.---Gameplay---The gameplay consists of walking right along a beautiful background and making up what happens, if you are free forming it then you can place story marks anywhere you like and when you come around to reading it whatever is in the background where the marker is you will see a small snapshot of it. Otherwise you will be editing markers places around the map.---Conclusion---The game is a nice turn on the gaming market and is a fun relaxing experience. I give it a 9/10 for being greatly executed, fun and a unique take on gaming.---YouTube Video---

												What an absolutely fantastic experience! I used to write when I was young and in school, but eventually I stopped. I never had time for it, even though I loved it.  (Whether or not I was any good at it is another story...)  Its something I've often wanted to get back into, but there always seems like there's something else to do. This game offers me a wonderful opportunity to get back into writing, and it makes the whole thing so effortless.  There's a variety of prompts in each world to get you going, but I have to wonder if you even need that.  Each location that you wander through is so evocative and was clearly created with a lot of care and attention to detail.  Its easy to forget that these strange lands aren't real when you get caught up in the art direction and haunting ambient melodies.  Finding some still functioning relic or some drawing scrawled on a wall is thrilling. I'm so, so glad I backed this on Kickstarter and I couldn't be happier with the end result!  Thank you Dejobaan Games for hitting another one out of the park!If you've got any interest at all in writing or reading (and maybe even if you don't and just want a new and interesting experience), you owe it to yourself to try this game out.  Its well worth the asking price.			"

												This is a really amazing idea, and the game as it is provides a wealth of inspiration and enjoyment - but be aware that there are only three unique worlds to explore and you can only explore them in point to point fashion linearly, over and over again. There's so much potential here, and the artwork really is superb - unfortunetly it seems that the developers, being personally satisfied with their creation, have little interest in expanding the game and adding features. I don't feel that my $15 was in any way wasted on this game - I'll keep playing it until I've at least had fun with some of the writing prompts, but for anyone thinking about buying: be aware that there are limitations to the game that may not be apparent simply from glancing at it or watching the trailer. Really what this feels like is a super polished beta of a real game - totally servicable, but refusing to live up to its potential.			"

												~Only recommended for those interested in writing, and want a framework/inspiration to build that writing. Elegy for a Dead World is a game that I'd had on my wishlist for some time. It intrigued me as a writing prompt with incredible images, beautiful and captivating settings, and interesting outlines to fill in with stories. In practice it's somewhat interesting but there isn't a lot of reason to utilize the game in order to write*. It's a nice looking game, and does it it sets out to do. While I recommend it, I don't think it's something that I'll return to very often. I'd rather just write without the use of this game. *As a side note, and has been pointed out in the discussion threads, the developers really missed a great chance to get more people writing by including three impossible achievements instead of smaller ones that people may have actually pursued. Receiving 1000 upvotes across ten stories requires an awful lot of participation from the fans of a game that is about writing and, not reading. Sure, you want to share your stories with people, and you want people to read the stories and such created within the game but that number is absurd. There are a great many better ways that the achievements could have been implemented to engage the player base in a way that would prompt participation - completing stories using each of the prompts, sharing your stories or other's stories on social media, upvoting, or even running a writing contest using the game as an engine. Unfortunately none of that is realized and the game is unfortunately, much like the shells of the civilizations you explore in-game, left empty and lifeless.			"

												Disclaimer: I’ve been provided a key of this game for free.  My comments are my own.Elegy for a Dead World is not about action.  It's about the adventure.  The adventure of exploration and imagination.The setup is that you're the only one that can write about three civilizations.  You can write about their history, write about how horrible your vacation is on it, or you can just write whatever you want.  This game allows you to go without any writing prompts if you do not want any writing prompts when you are exploring the planet.I wrote a story on Byron about how the people were addicted to water and how water eventually destroyed them.  It is a ridiculous read but entertaining one.Gameplay video:

												Ever wanted to take charge of a story? Or wanted to write fanfiction, but can't find the inspiration to write? Elegy for a Dead World gives you the space to write. No matter if you are a writer or not.GameplayElegy for the Dead World has three worlds, each having ten prompts you can choose from. From correcting some grammar for practice to telling a speech to your fellow citizens, each prompt takes you on an adventure. Before entering a world, you choose between the prompts, which has the structure of a Mad Libs book. Each varying in input, whether it calls from it in the prompt or you wish to put in more input. ""They covered their planet with ____ and created ____"" can range in input of entering a few words or adding in more and more till it's a paragraph or more. It's structured in a way that you can put as much input you want, and the story will still go on. Each prompt, you travel through the world, sightseeing as you find the feathers indicating you can write; if you are doing freeform writing you can pick anywhere. Once you wrote in each section, you go to the edge of the world where you can publish, edit, or exit. This is where you see your story on the page, as you don't travel through the world like you did when you wrote it. Instead each page has the backdrop of where you were with the text. It may have been more interesting if you actually traveled into the planet, with the words fading in as you walk towards them. The achievements may be the worst thing about Elegy for a Dead World as it goes against what it's about. Being a reader of fanfiction, I always appreciate the writer as they are not doing it for money but to put something out there. This seems to be the case as well, but focusing on trying to get nonwriters to write. Having achievements to get 1000 upvotes (or commendations) is not only impossible, due to the lack of a playerbase, but can set a wrong impression. Why play Elegy for a Dead World if you can't possibly get 1000 upvotes? Maybe if the achievements were more towards publishing stories it would be fine. Art StyleThe art in Elegy for a Dead World is amazing. Each world has a different look and color pallet, along with a varying number of enterances you can go into. Each having their own breathtaking areas and backgrounds as you walk through each writing. Your character standing out as you walk or fly through. The area where you choose a world also has a unique color pallete, varying in pink with a bright white light outlining the area. I only wish there were more worlds to explore than three, as there is not much to motivate the player to do more prompts as you see the whole world in one prompt. The scenery doesn't change with a different prompt, having the player motivate themselves to write rather than exploring and writing.SoundMost of the sound is varily well done as it gives each area it's own personality. Each having a main sound, which can follow by sounds of rain or hums from objects. Even the area where you choose a world has it's own sounds as it has hushed voices talking over one another. The only gripes I have with it is that sometimes the sound isn't cancelled when you exit out and the sound where you can teleport to a feather is a little too loud.Performance Elegy for a Dead World runs really well, having little to no lag. The only problems was the loading speed of both the prompts popping up before you select it and the stories. As you can find yourself waiting for the next pages to load or the pictures of where it was written to load.Overall+ Gorgeous art+ Provides an area for people to write+ Interesting prompts +/- Some sounds are too loud- Limited- Achievements could have been handled better- Not much of a player baseElegy for a Dead World is great for those who like to write, or want to write. If you want a muse to write about, this has three world you can take inspiration from. I would wait for a sale, however, as a $15 price tag may be too steep for what it provides.			"

												Recommended for anyone with an interest in writing or just a creative spark. Don't expect a game in any conventional sense. The game provides you with three beautiful settings based on the works of romantic poets to act as your muse and provides you with a variety of writing prompts. Using the prompts you can fill in blanks to create a written story and share it with the world. For those who want more of an artistic challenge, you can go without the prompts and write about whatever you desire on a blank canvas.There's not a whole lot more than that, but as long as you have an idea in your head, this game can continue to inspire.Full first impressions can be found here:

												Preface: This is a very SHORT ""game"". It honestly feels like a preview rather than the whole product. It's also certainly not for everyone. It's geared more towards the type of person who writes long headcanons for their villagers in Banished or create elaborate backstories for their Bioware characters. For people who have used programs like Zen Writer, this gets you into the same kind of simplified mindset-- there's nothing but you, the art, the sound, and the words. You won't get the editing and organizational capabilities of programs like Scrivener, but it's extremely useful for allowing you to write without the distraction of fiddly program features. That said, there's a lot to recommend it to gamers and writers alike.PROS+ Beautiful artwork. Like absolutely stunning.+ Great prompts-- just enough to get you thinking if you need them, but without guiding you too much+ Export option-- love the ability to export your stories, though only as HTMLCONS- Too short! Needs many more worlds, with more complexity- No spell check- Space available for writing is limited to 1000 characters per prompt-- definitely not enough when you're on a roll!- No ability to export as a simple word or txt document- Atmospheric sounds are good, but repetitive (and loud!)What I would dearly love is a game that expands on the worlds available by tenfold, and that gives a more comprehensive writing program with adjustable capabilities.SUGGESTIONS (just in case the devs ever want to expand or someone wants to make a similar program)* Add a lot more worlds* Spell check during edit mode* Quick access to each prompt area on a world from the end menu, with short previews of each prompt text (so that users don't have to read through each area chronologically to find where they want to edit).* Include a manual save option so that we can simply press, say, f11 to save without closing the prompt box* Unlock the word limit for each prompt area* Allow users to import music from their hard drive into a ""writing playlist"" (like Zen Writer) to use when they don't want to listen to the in-game music/sounds.* On-Screen volume control* Export to text document option			"

												Don't get me wrong. I like writing (though english is not my main language), and have even published a few short stories, and was really looking for this, but as quite a few people have already commented, I find the ""game"" quite disappointing.It's supposed to come as a help for inspiration, but the few oniric scenarios  (with buggy keyboard control) and the few precreated stories with blanks don't justify the price. The content is quite poor. I'd rather play random in youtube ""oniric songs"" or something along those lines.I think, as everyone does, that the idea is cool, but I found the implementation quite poor. Proof of that is that most of the people reviewing the game haven't amount to more than 5 hours of play almost 2 years after the release.			"

												The concept of Elegy For A Dead World is fantastic, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired. I found the writing prompts to be limiting and more akin to ad-libbing than truly creating my own stories. I highly commend the developers for their effort, though, as this serves as a sort of introduction to creative writing for many gamers who would otherwise not try their hand at writing fiction; it encourages players to use their imagination and share their work. The amount of content is lacking for a $15 game, though on sale or as part of a bundle, it's worth it for the unique experience, combining cosmic visuals and a great atmospheric ambient soundtrack with a focus on writing prose fiction.My recommendation is a mixed one, as many will not like this - gamers may find it boring and too non-gamelike while writers may be disappointed in the manner in which it delivers prompts, only allowing you to fill in the blanks in set phrases instead of composing your own prose from scratch. Regardless, Elegy For A Dead World is interesting and inspired, breaking the mold of what's expected of videogames and encouraging creativity above all else.			"

												This game cotains almost no content, all three ""worlds"" are tiny, I takes 2-3 minutes to fly through. Essentially the only things to visually stimulate you are a few beautiful landscape backgrounds with a few moving parts and a handful objects. The idea is fine, but the content means that the game provides very limited stimulation. Other activities plus writing are just way more stimulating than this game designed for that purpose.			"

												This is a game about walking the ruins of empty, dead worlds and writing about what you see and what you feel. It's a good introduction to writing from a prompt, and the three worlds presented all have somewhat different styles that suggest different storylines. Each also has several prompts, providing structures for your writing from prose to poetry to comedy songs, so even though there are only three worlds there's plenty of replay value in each. You can also read other people's creations based on the same prompts as you, which can be an interesting window into the writing of others and sometimes lets you stumble on a small-scale masterpiece or two.My only complaints - and they're trivial ones - are that the game does nudge you towards a somewhat melancholy outlook when writing, and if anything the visual cues are too good at guiding people in their writing, leading to similarities in the stories written about each world even when using different prompts. But these really are minor issues.Also, I want more worlds to explore - but that's just me being greedy.If you're interested in writing, or just unusual games that are a step outside the norm, pick this up. Play once or twice through each world, read what other people have written, and you'll have your money's worth in no time. "

												So, this is less of a game and more of an experimental interface whereby you ""walk"" through a series of paintings and tell a story about the things you find.  The game offers you samples where you can ""fill in the blank"" or you can obliterate those altogether and do your own thing.The game then allows you to upload the stories, view other people's published stories, and rate the stories on whether or not you like them.I enjoy the weirdness of this game and that it allows me to impress people with my creative writing talents, so I'm all for it.  But there are literally three mechanics in the game -- WASD to move left/right, up to enter/exit a room, and tab to leave behind a nugget of story for the next guy to find. No action.  Also, the paintings are inspired by three famous writers.  I didn't get into all that, but the scenary is quite beautiful.The interface is raw and the game smacks of being someone's first go with GameMaker but the idea is unique to say the least.  Expect about an hour or two (depending on how creative you are and how fast you can type) to finish your creative writing piece and 15-20 minutes to walk through someone else's story.			"

												Elegy for a Dead World is awesome because it unleashes creativity that you never knew you had! I didn't know what to write, so I just started filling in blanks with random things like aardvarks, and a few minutes later I had a story that had me laughing out loud. Are you curious what I wrote? You can get my story through Steam workshop! (Disclaimer: I make no claim that anyone else will find my story funny) The prompts are really well thought out to help you create something interesting and entertaining even if you are completely uninspired. I will come back to this game when suffering a creative block because I really think it'll help me. I strongly recommend this game!			"

												This Is a brilliant concept for a game, How often have you gone through a game, finding that the options open to you just don't fit the style that you want to play, no longer is this a problem in this game, as you wander through the inspiring landscape, you find points where prompts open up and you are free to write, that is right, you write the story. at the end of the Level you can publish your story onto steam where others can read your story and you can read theirs. This is a magical game that brings the imagination back to playing video games			"

												Not recommended at its base steam price. I got this on Humble Bundle thankfully.I like the idea of it. Honestly it's not bad, there's just not much content. Three worlds to explore and write your story about. As someone not much into writing I found it quite interesting to play through each one once but that's about the extent of my playthrough.			"

												A walking simulator with science fiction writing prompts. The three landscapes are in a visual style that I personally find very pleasing. Plus, there's enough visual detail for many possible interpretations and focal points to draw out several stories from these three planets. I wish there were more planets to explore and write about.The jetpack is the only way to get around. Walking is way too slow. I also encountered a bug in the Three Ruler's world when I left a building I couldn't use my jetpack anymore and each time I pressed TAB, the game sent me back to the first writing prompt location. I had to shut down the game to set it back to normal.The writing prompts are interesting. The prompts give you different perspectives from which to write that ought to influence the story to have another outcome. It's clear that the person who wrote the prompts had students in mind, and as a teacher, I appreciate the effort. Creating a cohesive history between the three planets with the writing prompts is a fun challenge as well... though that was a self-imposed challenge on myself.I really enjoyed playing this game. I love writing and I love science fiction. However, I'd have a hard time recommending this game to most gamers, especially for three levels at 15 euros. I would recommend this, but only to select individuals, and would further recommend grabbing it on sale for yourself or someone who you think could appreciate this game.			"

												Creative writing is a pretty daunting activity to get into at first, since as the overused saying goes, the possibilities are endless. To see a game revolve around this is unique, but the execution is rather dull.Walking simulators get a lot of flak for lacking gameplay, but I enjoy them because often a story is there in place of the interactabilty. This however lacks both: gameplay wise you are stuck holding D to your next destination, Tab to start writing and thats it. The story is as good as you can make it and that's where my gripe lies; the foundations given are so bland.I only wrote one story, but checked out another story stucture to see what they are like and they are extremely generic. ""There was once a world created by ___. It was ___. Suddenly, ___ happened. In the end the world was ___.""The concept of a game to enable people to start writing creatively through visual and auditory aids, offering a platform to compare and rate other peoples stories and have them do the same to yours is fantastic, but when the gameplay is so slow and the foundations are so boring it gives you little to no reason to not simply load up word and write freely.I will add that visually the game looks great. The game uses shadows and colour really well to emphasise the tone of the world your on (however this does work against it since you're meant to be setting the tone...). The sound is also a strong point, but again, it seems to dictate the tone it wants you to write in.Overall, I appreicate the effort but I don't see a reason to buy this at full price when you could just as easily submit your writings to forums and discuss them there.

												This is not a game. It's a writing prompt and frankly, an author's nightmare!!! The vistas are beautiful but too sparse and the writer in me is just underwhelmed and uninspired. The price is really much much too steep for the lack of content. Basically, you are paying to kick start your own writing. You write the content; you pay to have nice scenery to help you write the content. I can get that any time of day by sitting in my room. Thanks but no thanks.			"

You are given three worlds with about 6-7 prompts each. While these prompts are very creative and enjoyable, it feels much too small and limiting. If it would be too much to add an entire world, then even adding a prompt or two to each world would help, i think.Excellent work! I hope to see a sequel ^^			"

												The concept is excellent: present the player with a beautiful, intriguing world and offer them a chance write about it. The concept is well executed, and achieves its main objective: to give people who want to write some inspiration to start.On the downside, the editor is bit janky: the cursor disappears sporadically, the text editor seems to randomly go into select-all, and the squintworthy font makes spellchecking a bit tricky. Also, the explorable areas are quite small: I hoped there would be a much larger world to explore. Finally, the user interface is not well designed resulting in navigation not as easy as it could be. These are minor faults luckily. Overall, the game does what it sets out to do well. It is very pretty and the sound is evocative. Plenty to stimulate the imagination.  If you want to try your hand at writing and would like a bit of inspiration, this might be worth investigating.			"

												There is one problem with this game, and that is a lack of a significant playerbase.This ""game"" is essentially a few very interestingly detailed worlds to explore, but in actuality it basically a series of writing prompts.  For anybody who enjoys writing, it's incredible.  Very detailed worlds, nice prompts, and you begin to see how similar settings or similar experiences can spur on creativity in so many different ways.  It's fantastically fun.The issue is that there isn't enough of a playerbase to really read/write/comment on other people's creations, and it's a damned shame.  However for anybody that even has a passing interest in writing I would highly recommend giving this a shot.			"

I only wish that there were more worlds to explore - I could wander desolate landscapes for days on end if they kept going, but there's probably only a few hours of entertainment here for most players - soaking up the atmospherics and jotting down your thoughts. You play a solo explorer visiting three dead worlds in turn, composing short works of fiction from writing prompts at different points in the side-scrolling scenery. When finished, you can publish and share your writings with other xenoarchaeologists.If the concept piques your interest, I heartily recommend it.			"

												Ok, to start off: I had really high expectations from the game. The majority of the reviews are extremely positive, and I love to write. If my expectations were a bit too high, well.. Sorry.  Actual Gameplay: Lacking. Honestly, I was extremely excited when I first saw this. I started it up, and saw an impressive starting point. It seemed as though I was floating around in a nebula, with a jetpack to propel me where I wanted to go. 'Whoa.' Was pretty much my first thought. Then I jumped into a wormhole/portal and got down to the writing part. It turns out, it just shows you a 3D-ish landscape in which you can move forwards and backwards. Around the place are little 'Prompts' that start you off with a few words. You are supposed to continue on from these promts, or if you are unhappy with what they said, you can change it. Personally, I found that it felt like a joke. ""And here is a church where the worshipped-"" and you were supposed to fill it in. Another example: ""Here is a school were children were taught-"" Again, continue on. If you read through other peoples work, then you would see random words jumbled together, or lackluster 'Poetry'. This bothered me, as I'm a stickler for grammar, flow, and spelling.  Over all, the game is decent, but it felt like a joke in my opinion.			"

												I really deeply wanted to love this game. The very idea of writing as I progress and cooperatively creating a narrative with the world in a way that is more meaningful than simply interpreting the game world internally or writing about it afterward is amazing and speaks to me very personally. So regardless of being unable to recommend this game to the audience I imagined it was for, I do want to say that the idea was amazing, and that I very much wish there were more to this.Elegy for a Dead world does stand out as a teaching tool. You move slowly through superficial environments and are frequently given prompts to fill in the blanks, or if you choose to write entirley free form whenever and wherever you feel moved to do so. If I had kids, I'd love to have them play this and I'd love to play this with them as an exercise in exploring art mutually. However, as a solo exercise, this game lacks any ability to look deeper or to try to understand the environments and doesn't offer any rewarding exploration. There is no interaction with the world and no capacity to interact with the environments, so all interpretation is done from affar and entirely superficially.Because of this, Elegy for a Dead world totally fails as a vehicle for exercising curiosity. It lays the burden of creation entirely on the player rather than putting the effort to create cooperatively with the player. It gives nothing but a pretty landscape and leaves you wanting to touch and inspect what lays around you while asking you to tell it what you see. There is a ton of potential here which is very much unrealized. I hope that someone does much more with it in the future.There is an audience for this, however it does not extend far beyond the normal audience for basic educational games. The sad thing is that it very much could have.			"

												Magenta clouds, aqua haze, white spheres, and more, abound in this lovely writing-prompt experience. Beautiful sci-fi world in which to write speculative fiction. Wrote 2600+ words in one world. Really want to find a way to bump the per world max word count (and also, hopefully, learn how to clear a world to zero words without a manual delete) to 4-10K, as I can see using this for daily word count rough drafts. This product is likely to be a good investment as a repeated creative experience for serious writers, especially those wishing to increase their science-fiction writing output by writing in an atypical visual setting. This was very creatively stimulating and well worth the slight cost.			"

												This game is fantastic. When in doubt of your writing ability or if you've hit a creative brick wall, this is sure to knock you out of that funk. Let those brain powers flow! Also is aesthetically pleasing with a great atmospheric soundtrack so adds to the inspirational qualities. WELL DONE! I am officially addicted. Thank you!			"

												An unusual concept but I think the ""story rich"" and ""adventure"" tags are incredibly misleading. Basically it's a mad libs ""game"" -  you walk around a ""world"" (a few rooms) and at ten pre0determined points you fill in the blanks (or write freeform).  That's it.    While amusing it is NOT worth the price.    If it's $1 or less, great.			"

												Elegy for a Dead World, developed by Dejobaan Games, LLC and Popcannibal, is a unique experience to be had by anyone and everyone who has or had aspirations of becoming a writer. You will take on the task of writing the stories of this Dead World. You can either take on pre-created stories with fill in the blanks, or you can strike out on your own in several different areas and create a masterpiece with only your mind as the guide.Graphically you are given a soft and colorful world, devoid of any body, minus you. There are several different areas that you will be interacting with, and each piece can be the key to the next part of your story. If you are going the pre-created story route you will notice writing quill symbols appear where the next part of the story will take place. You will also be presented with a side scrolling flow, which is fitting since you need a beginning, middle, and an end. The really nice thing though is that there are different levels in the scenery, so there's a feeling of depth to the worlds that you will be walking through. To guide you along your journey you will be walking a person in a suit through the areas. To be honest weakest piece of this entire experience is the person that you will be controlling, especially when it comes to time to write something into the story, the arm just doesn't seem to act the way it should on the being, but serious that's about it for weakness.Since you will be penning much if not all of the story there's not going to be any voices to work with, unless of course you want to lend your voice as you type the story out (but of course that will be just for you, there's not option to record voices). There is, however, music, and it is truly haunting. I believe its that way to help add to the atmosphere of where you are, and allow you to think about what the next piece of the story will be.The controls are quickly explained to you, you are going to be moving from left to right, and you will need to hit tab to enter a writing piece. You will also need to press up in you want to go into structures, or down into different areas.You might have noticed that I've been shying away from the term game because this, to me, isn't a game, its a tool, and experience, that definitely deserves some attention. This is really a writer's sandbox. Sure there's a couple of boundaries you can't really break out of, the setting, and the overall theme (all though I'm sure if you really put your mind to it you could change the theme to whatever you want it to be). I've written a couple of stories, and to be completely honest every time I finish one I'm ready to write another. The experiences I have within these worlds stirs up my creative juices and I feel like I have to get more words out.Now that being said if you don't like reading and writing when you don't have to, then this is definitely not for you, but for those who want to see where your creativity can take you, you have to try this out. Seriously, I was a little hesitant when I heard about Elegy for a Dead World, and wondered how well it would allow me to write my own stories, but after going through the pre-created stories, I have to say that I'm not only impressed but blown away. The greatest thing is that it digitally publishes your work to their own little cloud where others can read it and then comment on it. It also gives you a story book form where people don't have to traverse the world to read your story, but do get what you are trying to convey through words and pictures of the area where you wrote pieces of the story. I truly hope that this takes off and that stories come pouring out of this. I would like to see more worlds to put my stories into, but as it is, this is definitely something that I highly recommend. This EASILY gets a 9.3 out of 10.			"

												A very cool concept!As a writer I found the use of multimedia writing prompts as unique both as a gaming conceit and as a method to supurr creativity. As you can tell I'm writing with a bit of extra wordiness. Just having used some of the starter prompts I found myself getting carried away with jotting down some drabble, much less imagining the free writing mode.That said I think this game could use something a little more, namely a little more in the way of backgrounds. While scarcity and pressure can be the seat of art, this is a game. Much as one can update the words for stories written and published here (and in many self publishing venues), one can update the electronics here. I would think adding a few more worlds with their own prompts would make all the difference here.That said as it is Elegy for a Dead World is an amazing experience, I think just about every gamer should at least challenge themselves to try this, especially younger gamers so they can understand what they can do with their creative writing (which is to say just about anything). All of my approval, seriously, just buy this game.			"

												With an atmosphere that will instantly hook you, Elegy for a Dead World is a delightfully novel way to approach creative writing. It really is just a series of writing prompts but between the sound and evocative environments, it's at once relaxing and creatively stimulating.I do hope that more portals are opened over time; the devs have added more prompts to each existing world but additional environments would definitely be welcome.

												This is more of an fun educational tool than a game since it's all about trying to get you, the player, to write! You can explore three beautiful worlds inspired by Byron, Keats and Shelley and then you try to write about these worlds! There are several different writing templates available or you can just write without one of course. Personally I liked to start with a template but change the text in it as I went, eventually ending up with something that was mainly my own story.The negative thing I can say is that the integration with the Steam Workshop could have been better. It would have been nice if I could've read other user's stories more easily directly in the workshop without having to be in the game. But as a whole I'd recommend Elegy For a Dead World to anyone who wants a little nudge to get their creative minds flowing!			"

												I really don't know what to think of this ""game"" - I had been eyeing it for some time and got it in a bundle - as I generally like titles by Dejoban Games and the writing aspect intrigued me. Your character walks or flies around different planets and stops to write stories Mad Libs style. I thought this was completely stupid and wrote in a lot of stupidity but after finishing the level and publishing my story ""penispump"" I found reading it was highly amusing.It seems like there are options for using this as more of a free writing project, or editing classic prose. If I had paid full price I would have immediately disliked Elegy For a Dead World due to its basic nature, but upon further investigation this is the sort of thing where fun is proportional to your efforts. Pick it up on sale (also aaaaaaaaaaaa) tho? Unless you have writer's block - it's probably priceless in that respect.			"

												Not so much a game as it is a creative writing workshop, with absolutely beautiful artwork and a nice easy to listen to background soundset. Each of the three scenarios has 8 or 9 prompt collections, a grammar workshop, and a ""free write"" mode that lets you write anything in any location in the landscape available in the scenario.  The 1000 character word limit for each section of the prompt is a little limiting, but is also a good exercise in not being too verbose, and the ability to read and ""commend"" other user's work is a wonderful feedback tool (although there is no proofreading function whatsoever, aside from the aforementioned grammar workshop which I admit I did not use, so I don't know if that has an actual checker or not).   All in all it's a good tool to practice writing with.  Whether or not you think it's worth $15 is up to you, but I do urge you to not get it for less than $10 if/when it goes on sale.			"

												I will be honest. The only reason I am here on Steam is because of Elegy for a Dead World.  I will first describe my motivations behind the said-sole reason a little bit, before I share about my experiences in the game and what I think of it.As a writer and casual gamer, I was absolutely thrilled to discover this game some months back. A game where one can write?? Who knew that writing and gaming would one day be so elegantly combined? I wanted it so much that it was at the top of my wishlist from the moment I read about its existence. I waited patiently until I had the right time to do whatever I needed to do to get my hands on the game. Install Steam, even though I never had plans to do so previously. Purchase Elegy for a Dead World, even though I had never purchased any games or in-game purchases. This was the game that would make me change my plans. And was the plunge worth it? Oh hell yeah. I loved the gorgeous visuals that greeted me when the game launched. I chose to enter Keats' world, and I was not dissapointed. It was simply breathtaking, so beautiful that I explored so slowly, just to soak in the views, notice all the little details.  The audio crept up on me, mysterious, subtle, haunting, but never too overwhelming, which helps to evoke the atmosphere of the world. All these little things add up to create a richly-inspiring landscape, which is very helpful to writing if you ask me.But the best bit was, of course, the writing. I was surprised to find that there are several types of prompts to choose from, which would definitely allow me to revisit the same world multiple times, because different sets of prompts would inspire completely different tales in my head. One of the choice of freeform writing is fantastic too. Even though I really appreciated the prompts triggering my imagination and creativity, I like knowing that I do have the choice to use the freedom to write whatever I want in that world. My first try was to fill in the blanks at Keats' world. Not only did I enjoy the act of writing a tale inspired by such a breathtaking setting, my brain was already coming up with ongoing streams of ideas even before I received each prompt. The prompts were at first surprising, but I went with the challenge to create a tale that was shaped by both the prompts and my own words. I was again delightfully surprised to learn that I could edit the given prompts too, which further spurred my creativity as I played with various ideas and phrases until I was satisfied. This took me approximately one and half hours as I crafted and then refined my story. Suffice to say, it was a real treat, happiness and satisfaction swelling in me as I finished that first story. I have since went back to Keats' world for a second visit using a different set of prompts. I still have several other ideas to write about that place. My plan is to try all the different prompts, and then attempt the freeform writing, and possibly go back for yet another try if I want to. I will do this slowly, over the weeks and months to come. I have yet to even touch Byron's and Shelley's world. I expect the other two worlds to be no doubt as breathtaking and inspiring as Keats', serving as the springboard to many more tales. Oh, and gameplay has been quite smooth. No major glitches. As long as I can write without disruptions, I am happy. One thing I will say about this game is that while it has been an enjoyable ride, I don't think it is for everybody. The reason why I enjoy it so much is because I derive a lot of pleasure from writing. My internal drive to write is why the gorgeous visuals and mysterious audio only added to the richness of the scene before my eyes, amplifying my enjoyment of the writing experience. How could I not enjoy the writing process when I could get inspiration in spades from this game? There are also, of course, some who will greatly benefit from the breathtaking visuals as a starting point and be inspired to write about it. But I doubt that everyone will enjoy the writing process as much. If you're the type to glance at a scene and want to move on to something different within a short period of time, this might not be the game for you. But if you're the type who could marvel and admire a richly detailed scene for a long time, or if you're the type who could come back to the same scene to discover something new every time, then I would recommend Elegy for a Dead World. And if you like writing or plan to try it, I would also recommend this game. It has been a rewarding journey so far, and I have just started. I cannot wait to see my future tales unfold in the three amazingly breathtaking worlds. I don't know the final forms of the stories, but I'm damn sure that I will find inspiration every time I visit one of the worlds.			"

Oh, and gameplay has been quite smooth. No major glitches. As long as I can write without disruptions, I am happy. One thing I will say about this game is that while it has been an enjoyable ride, I don't think it is for everybody. The reason why I enjoy it so much is because I derive a lot of pleasure from writing. My internal drive to write is why the gorgeous visuals and mysterious audio only added to the richness of the scene before my eyes, amplifying my enjoyment of the writing experience. How could I not enjoy the writing process when I could get inspiration in spades from this game? There are also, of course, some who will greatly benefit from the breathtaking visuals as a starting point and be inspired to write about it. But I doubt that everyone will enjoy the writing process as much. If you're the type to glance at a scene and want to move on to something different within a short period of time, this might not be the game for you. But if you're the type who could marvel and admire a richly detailed scene for a long time, or if you're the type who could come back to the same scene to discover something new every time, then I would recommend Elegy for a Dead World. And if you like writing or plan to try it, I would also recommend this game. It has been a rewarding journey so far, and I have just started. I cannot wait to see my future tales unfold in the three amazingly breathtaking worlds. I don't know the final forms of the stories, but I'm damn sure that I will find inspiration every time I visit one of the worlds.			"

												A very cool concept!As a writer I found the use of multimedia writing prompts as unique both as a gaming conceit and as a method to supurr creativity. As you can tell I'm writing with a bit of extra wordiness. Just having used some of the starter prompts I found myself getting carried away with jotting down some drabble, much less imagining the free writing mode.That said I think this game could use something a little more, namely a little more in the way of backgrounds. While scarcity and pressure can be the seat of art, this is a game. Much as one can update the words for stories written and published here (and in many self publishing venues), one can update the electronics here. I would think adding a few more worlds with their own prompts would make all the difference here.That said as it is Elegy for a Dead World is an amazing experience, I think just about every gamer should at least challenge themselves to try this, especially younger gamers so they can understand what they can do with their creative writing (which is to say just about anything). All of my approval, seriously, just buy this game.			"

												There is something so beautiful and simple about the concept behind this game. See images, create stories, share with others. While I feel there is work still to be done here (more worlds and an in-game spell-checker would be nice), there are few games quite like it and a lot of potential here.			"

												This game is not for everyone.You're a cosmonaut, and you go through dead places, with prompt of word you have to complete.Pro : superb places, the graphic are really pretty.Con : there is only 3 places.You can choose different types of prompt of each places, but clearly if you don't have a soul of poet, you will do each place once and that's it.You can upload your work, and read the work of other people. That could have been interesting, but sadly there isn't much poet on Steam, and the text are most of the time boring.			"

Get it when on sale, and only if you're a writer.Not a game, but a writing tool (I say that as someone who classifies walking simulators as games, to give that statement some context). Interesting prompts, but not a lot: I've done two so far, there are about thirty. Only three worlds to explore (ten prompts per world). Certainly not worth full price. I'll come come back to it, though, because I like to write.			"

												This game is by far one of the more interesting games i've played. It's all about writing a story using the environment around you. It's actually a little hard to explain so I made a Let's Play of it. Feel free to check it out and hopefully it will help you decide if it's the right game for you.I personally love the game. From sound design all the way to the art style. It really captures you and helps drive out some of those creative juices.

												Well, it's an interesting idea. Basically a framework for writing fiction, ""Elegy for a Dead World"" is supposed to provide you with just enough inspiration to let you craft your own ideas without telling you exactly what to put. And for the most part, it works.Unfortunately the community is dead. A large part of the game is supposed to be appraisal of each other's work. Which is hard to do when NOBODY PLAYS IT.But it's still an interesting exercise.			"

 A few minutes of this game showcases most of it's depth, and that isn't a bad thing. Elegy for a dead World removes the narrative element, one that I consider to be the most important in a game, and mostly puts it in the hands of the player. I say mostly as, the beautiful art, sound and music of this game greatly enhances your ability to build this narrative and somewhat guides you. There are actual guides as well, as the writing prompts often have suggestions of subjects for the page you are to write. Don't be scared to venture away from these, as the environment the game puts you into provides you with a vast amount of emotions that propulse your writing.You don't really have to have an interest in writing or even be good at it. The lack of interface and introduction ""menu"" does great at putting you within the atmosphere of the world. Obviously, if you  hate writing, you aren't going to be pleased by pretty skies and noises. If you are open to try however, I have a hard time believing that this game will fall short of producing enjoyment.Overall, the experience given by Elegy for a Dead World is really meant for anyone who has interest in exploring their creative mind. It's not a large expense and it breaks most game design conventions, but it does provide a fulfilling experience and a similar feeling of achievement that traditional gameplay elements would.			"

												It's a way to write short stories about alien worlds.You can either free form them, or have the program prompt you at various places to write along precreated lines.As such, I wrote something about how awesome my jetpack was.If this is something that you think would be interesting, well then, there you have it.Definitely not for everyone, but it's a fun little diversion.
