												I'm a huge fan of the original game and I can honestly say the Director's Cut is much worse. The only difference is an added voiceover and story, but the gameplay and content remains much the same.The story, however, is unnecessary and unfortunately, bland. Part of what made the original so great was the lack of any background. It was a blank slate and very mysterious, and so you put your own imagination and own story into the gameplay. I loved it. The Director's Cut forces you into a, quite frankly, stupid story that is nothing compared to what your imagination would give the game were you playing the original. The voiceover is more annoying and distracting than anything. It's like having an audio book playing in the background while you play the game: completely unrelated to what you're doing and ruining your concentration.			"

												Why, devs? WHY?!Why have you tainted down the game's original atmosphere with such irrevelant narration? The original release was awesome as it was! The lack of explanation or lack of narration was part of the dark feeling! It was great! Lots of people reviewed it positively and gave it great scores because of it! And now... it's ruined! People who never played the game before will probably enjoy this version... but it is now a mediocre title since it was implemented with a blatant plot/twist/whatever that have absolutely no valuable addition to the game.For people who already purchased the first release, its a dissapointment! It feels like having the original Star Wars rewritten so Greedo is now shootting first. What the hell, devs? I gave QUBE a good review when it came out on Steam, but now i just can't. It has been turned into a mediocre game. Unless you manage some options to play the game in its original version (without the voice over and all that), i'm no longer going to recommend it to anyone.Damn i feel ♥♥♥♥ed. And to approximatively quote someone on the forum: ""Turning a GREAT game into a mediocre one is a greater sin in my book than making a bad game""			"

												A short but fun indie game, quite similar to Portal but have far more difficult puzzles at times.If you're an achievement hunter (like me) BE WARNED, the achievements for the extra content, such as completing bonus levels with the minimum number of moves or beating the developers time on bonus levels are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, I have managed it and I celebrated so loud I woke up my whole village.There are also very grindy achievements like aquire 10,000 powerups, which I recommend working on last, and if you do please put on some music as it will be very repetitive and will turn you insane otherwise.Still, good game, would recommend, price goes very low on a sale			"

												I can only truly recommend this game if you've played the original. There's controversy that this could have easily been released as DLC, but I'm not reviewing the politics of game admissions.With the Director's Cut of this game comes a brand new narrative as well as a new soundtrack. They are both welcome additions to the game, alongside reworked puzzles, new secrets, and the previously released DLC. There's not a lot of extra things to see or do, but for a returning player who wants a bit more of the Q.U.B.E. universe, $5 isn't a big hole in the pocket.However, the reason I prefer the original over this version is based on two things; the first being the actual lack of story in the original. There was almost a haunting mysteriousness to it, in the sense that you never truly understand the game as a whole. You pick up bits and pieces of things, formulating and speculating the who and what and where and when, but in the end, there were no concrete answers. These are the elements that made the game enjoyable for me beyond the gameplay. It was the time I spent wondering, ""what really is behind all of this?""The second reason being the soundtrack. The original game has a much more upbeat, ambient electronic score. It's catchy, it's fun to listen to, and I found myself listening to it even outside of the game. While the new soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, as it has been tweaked to fit the new found atmosphere that coincides with the added narrative, it simply just isn't as memorable. There were a few tracks that I did enjoy, but in the end it cannot compare to what was.If you haven't played Q.U.B.E. do yourself a favor and track down a copy of the original. It's a short, simple, but entertaining and involving. If you're a returning fan who doesn't mind throwing a fiver down to replay and re-experience the game in a different light, go for it. It's not the best five bucks you'll ever spend, but I personally don't have any regrets. It gave me an excuse to have some fun with it again, and most importantly enjoy myself. After all, isn't that the point?			"

												I played Q.U.B.E. and the Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut back-to-back in a weekend. I have posted this review for both versions of the game so you can decide which you'd prefer to play. They are essentially the same game, but the Director's Cut adds two characters that talk to you, the silent protagonist, throughout the game. These characters serve to tell the story of what the hell is (or isn't?) going on, which, while not particularly deep or even explained at all in the original version, is interesting because it had me waffling back and forth between what I thought the ending would be... or if there would actually be two endings. Spoiler: There's only one ending, but the game really should have had two, depending on a final choice you had to make. A huge missed opportunity, IMO. At first the narrative seemed cliché, but considering how many times I changed my mind as to what the conclusion to the game's story would actually be... that was unique. I was satisfied.I understand why many judge this game superficially as Portal-esque, and aesthetically, it is quite similar. And it's a first-person puzzler. And there are very few characters. And it's not a very long game. And there's no combat. The voice acting in the Director's Cut was well done (although sparse), and the music was pleasing as well. Controls, movement, etc., were nothing to rave about, but not really worth complaining about either, considering the type of game. I just wish buttons activated and deactivated much faster. Making a mistake because of the delay just irked me.The puzzle content from the original and the Director's Cut is essentially the same, but I noticed in the Director's Cut they removed at least one puzzle that players of the original despised (myself included; I wanted to kill the planet after fumbling with it for half an hour and then looking up the solution, taking solace in the fact that I was not the only befuddled player). Took me roughly 4 hours to beat the original (which includes banging my head over two puzzles in particular), and then, once knowing all the solutions to the puzzles, it only took me 2.5 hours to breeze through the Director's Cut. I feel like the original game had more difficult (in a bad way) puzzles which were removed from the Director's Cut, but I did stumble upon two hidden puzzles in the Director's Cut that I didn't encounter in the original. I'm sure there are other nuggets hiding somewhere I missed.To put all my thoughts into a tidy, six-sided package: If you're a fan of Portal, A Story About My Uncle, or Quantum Conundrum, check this title out. Short, sweet, and satisfying. The original feels a bit longer and more difficult, but the Director's Cut felt less frustrating and more interesting.			"

												Q.U.B.E is quite a neat and interesting game. Some puzzles can really make you rip your hair out, it's not the ones that are hard that drive you crazy, but the ones that you have to try over and over again to get the right timing. But in the end it's quite fun. Took me 2.7h to finish the main story (without Extras and DLCs and without the hidden area in Sector 5)I liked the story that really makes you think about whether you're doing the right thing or not during the game, even though you don't really have the choice not to, but yeah... :DTo be completely honest I don't know if it's worth the 10 bucks as for so far as I've played it. But in a sale, why not?The only thing I found quite bothering and a bit annoying about the game was the lack of control-settings. I personally preferred it, if I could've switched the mouse buttons, because for me, the other way round it seemed more intuitive but that's personal. What disturbed me even more, was that I personally am someone who plays with a slow mouse-sensitivity, and I found that there should've been a better range of setting the mouse sensitivity in-game (specially towards the lower sensitivities), since as I said, I don't like playing with high sensitivities.In a nutshell it's not a bad game and with 3h of main story, you're quite fast through it, so you decide what you want to pay for that. PS: The hardest puzzle in the game as it's called by an achievement is actually one of the easiest in my opinion :P			"

												Q.U.B.E is a game full of cubes in which you move cubes, jump on cubes, get tossed by cubes, choose the size of the cubes, into a room full of neutral cubes that are grey cubes unlike the other cubes that you move, jump on, choose size or get tossed by and those cubes are colored because cubes with colors are good cubes unlike Minecraft which is also a cube game but all of those cube things remind of portal because you're trapped in a huge cube and must go past those tests but portal doens't contain cubes that you jump on, move, get tossed by and choose size. The story reminds about the movie ""Cube"" which there are some people trapped in a huge cube full of cubes that are rooms but cube shaped like walls and that's why it's called ""Cube"" anyway in those little cubes you have different themes and ways to die and in the game ""Q.U.B.E"" you don't die you just smash yourself with your keyboard (With cube shaped buttons) because you are trapped in a room and the cubes are bothering you but unlike in the ""Cube"" movie which doesn't have anything to do with the game at all well the game doesn't have cube shaped rooms but it's built with cubes so you know.I found a bug to get ""outside"" and actually it's not a huge cube containing you, it's just a closed corridor built with cubes in space with no stars which aren't cube shaped like.But I like this game because it's a great puzzle and you know cubes are good (Comes with a few bugs if you discover them).11/10 would cube again.

												After Portal shocked the world and quickly ascended onto its thrown as one of the greatest games ever made, it was inevitable that other developers would step up to the plate and attempt to recreate the magic that Valve had. Among the earliest of these was QUBE, an acronym I don't care to spell out (largely because I still do not know what it stands for) and a minimalistic puzzle game focused around manipulating the different properties of cubes as you make your way through a starkly colored labyrinth with a vast assortment of puzzles standing between you and your goal. It sounds familiar to be sure (change a few words and I am describing Portal almost exactly), but QUBE manages to set itself apart in the areas that matter, though ironically winds of bringing itself down in the end by playing things too close to the chest.The parts that make QUBE interesting are also the ones most in need of some room to breath. Throughout your three hour trek through the mysterious structure you find yourself in, new mechanics are introduced and discarded with almost every other puzzle. This is good in the fact that you're constantly being given new tools to work with and new ways to think about how to progress through the level, but also a double edged sword in the fact that at least half the time you spend with a given mechanic is used up just figuring out how it works. Just when you get the handle on how to use one and feel you're ready for some more challenging puzzles, it's swapped out for something new which then restarts the learning process over again, repeating up until the very end.It's not so bad as to make QUBE unenjoyable, but it does fall rather short in comparison to its contemporaries, and feels as if the developer felt they would only get one chance and as a result had to put every idea they had into this one game. It makes for a rather erratic experience that never quite finds its footing.The most prominent addition to the director's cut version of QUBE is an entirely new narrative, but unfortunately it's as half-baked and tacked on as you would expect for something that was added years after the original game released. It's inoffensive and decently acted, but adds nothing to the experience except needless questions that go nowhere and some outrageously long elevator rides.QUBE isn't going to be remembered as a modern classic, perhaps not remembered at all, but for a first person puzzle game it's just decent enough to be worth checking out. The framework that's here could potentially be turned into a much better sequel, which hopefully is in the pipeline, but as it stands I don't regret the time I spent with the game in any way. If you've already played the original, feel free to pass up the director's cut. You aren't missing anything, and might in fact have a better experience playing the original sans the awkward story, left to create your own narrative out of the events transpiring.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												EDIT: I have finished the game now, and I can honestly say the story in this is far less interesting than the original premise of having no story, and letting the player intepret it how they want. I will however still recommend purchasing either this, or the original (whichever is cheaper) and playing it because it is a good puzzle game.The following applies to both games, original and directors cut.Neat puzzle game, decently challenging. Stark black/white visuals with occasional splashes of color to seperate the puzzle elements.Now, if you have never played this game before, I'd recommend buying the original (especially if it is cheaper). The reason being, the original is a good PUZZLE game with an interesting backdrop. The directors cut feels the need to tell a story, that frankly, has been told a thousand times.Techincally this version has more content, but honestly I felt the original had a better feel to it simply because it gave you no pretext. It didn't give you a subtext to what was happening, this shoehorns one in for frankly no reason.So in short, if you can ignore the blatant voiceovers and both are the same price, buy this since it has more content. If the original is cheaper, buy that.SPOILERS BELOW (not that it matters honestly):Seriously? A kid broke into your house because there was a fire? Why not call the fire department? Why not yell ""Hey there's a fire! The second he broke in? How the hell did you manage to get downstairs without seeing/hearing/smelling a fire?Seriously?Also the ending of this game is incredibly concrete (as in there is no room for interpritation) yet it leaves a LOT out in the open. What happened to the player character? Did he live? Did he die? Was this all a dream? Was the end sequence just something he created in his mind, or did all of that actually happen?If the end was completely literal, why did solving cube puzzles destroy the ""ship""? Why was there not a single inhabitant on the ship? Who built it? Did it just build itself and set a collision course with the earth? Why would it do this? It's clearly been made by something, the entire thing is made up of cubes (sans the television screens and shuttle in the last scene). Which brings up another point, why were there television screens and shuttles in something only made of cubs?The only credit I will give the story in the Director's Cut was that they turned the whole ""crazy man tells you the truth about a goverment consipiracy"" cliche on it's head by revealing it was just a stranded man who wanted company. I guess that's something.Either way this was wholly unnessicary and a large waste of resources for the developer. They should have just put all this time and effort into developing another title instead of writing a mediocre story for the existing game that was actually pretty atmospheric with no dialogue.So again, buy whichever is cheaper, but honestly I'd recommend the original over this any day.

												A first person puzzle, similar to Portal but here you use some gloves to modify different colored cubes, each one having a different behavior. Most of the puzzles are easy, except a couple when you depend of clicking in the right time, someting that could be a bit frustrating for solving them. The only thing that I really hated was the ""transitions"" between some puzzles when most of the narrative takes place, it really bothered me having to wait standing there, just waiting the dialog to end, making me losing interest in them most of the time. Also you can't run, isn't necessary for the game at all, but after those boring moments I just wanted to go more quickly in some places. Still an interesting and enjoyable game.Only played this DC version so I can't compare with the original one.			"

												I loved the original release of this game.  They ruined it with this Director's Cut.  The story is dry, boring, and full of plot holes.  The new ""soundtrack"" consists of sound effects and ambiance, not music.  The original OST is far, far superior.  The woman who dryly delivers exposition into your character's headset is monotone and annoying and it distracts from what little atmosphere there is.  All of this combines to change a very fun, atmospheric game into sleep-inducing tedium.  What could be more exciting than listening to a story read to you in a monotone voice with no music in a grey vertical shaft?  Sigh.  Just play the original.  It's far, far better.			"

												People like to compare this to Portal because of the similarities in first person puzzle and level designs, lighting and more, but those do Portal injustice because Q.U.B.E. doesn't have an overlying story narrative, you never break out of the ""test"" environment, and there is usually only ever one way to solve each puzzle. With those things said, Q.U.B.E. is still a fantastic puzzle experience, and other than some frustrating moments in harder puzzles towards the end where you have to repeat gameplay too often, it does a great job at gameplay, and stands alone.HighlightsI think the reason Q.U.B.E. works is that it knew it probably couldn't beat Portal in terms of story, design and gameplay, and instead focused on just making the puzzles and experience simple and focused, but fun.* Great use of lighting and colour which keep a minimalist feel, similar to that of Mirrors Edge, but allows for some more interesting art style when needed* The nice ambient soundtrack and lack of rush or impending action keep things mellow and smooth and match the visuals* Tutorial elements and introductions to the mechanics feel natural and are well implementedMistakes* It's a short game, but still feels slightly repetitive towards the end due to the lack of variety in mechanics. Breaking up the puzzles with more platforming, or more interesting segments would've went a long way* The narrative added in the Directors Cut is a pointless addition and takes away the atmosphere and isolationRecommendationsAvailable on Steam for £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 at the time of review and clocking in at around 4 hours of gameplay, it's a fair deal when on sale.There were originally two versions of Q.U.B.E. available, the original and the Director's Cut which added Oculus Rift support, a couple new puzzles and the 10-level time trial mode DLC. Unfortunately it also added a poor narrative, which adds very little and takes away from the games mysterious, isolated nature. Copies of the original Q.U.B.E. may still be available on other sites and, if you can, I strongly suggest tracking it down instead. It's an annoying and frustrating business practice when a publisher adds things that actively harm the game, then forces you to buy them over the original, especially when it's nearly twice the price. An optional DLC would've been a far better choice here.However, Q.U.B.E. is still a good game and remains fair value for money, if it's on sale, it's a great buy.* A sequel, Q.U.B.E. 2 is being developed in the Unreal Engine 4, the details of which are being kept closely guarded			"

												You awaken stranded inside a structure made from millions of interlocking cubes with no memory of how you arrived.  A woman's voice sounds over a radio.  ""Fingers crossed you can hear me. You are in a large ship in space headed for Earth. You are humanity's last hope for survival.  Solve some puzzles, destroy the cube.""As the story progresses another voice crackles across the radio in your suit.  ""The woman is lying. Her fingers are crossed behind her back. They stole your memories and trapped you in an underground test facility.  Do you really think solving tests will somehow save the world?""The puzzles are fairly simple in design, though solving them can and does become very complex by the end of the game.  You're limited to 5 abilities: red cubes expand and contract, blue cubes bounce objects into the air, yellow cubes transform into stairs, green cubes create blocks that can activate switches, and purple cubes rotate sections of the room.The game is fairly short, which is good since the mechanics don't really allow for much variation in puzzle design.  The solutions become more convoluted as the game progresses, but ultimately you're doing the same thing over and over again on a grander scale each time.Aside from the new story, the director's cut also includes 3 beta puzzles that were note included in the original game.  These puzzles are essentially 3D tilt labyrinths and they add a tiny bit of variety to the game.  There are also some speed run levels to see how quickly you can click your mouse on colored blocks as you run forward through a level, but I don't much enjoy those types of challenges.			"

												You know what's worse than not trying?  Succeeding well for 90% of the task and then flopping miserably at the end, and that is sadly what the Director's Cut did.  The gameplay is identical in every way to the original version and is enjoyable as always; the only major change (in the story mode) is a refined ""story,"" which as been added solely by the addition of voiceovers.  What's amazing is that they actually manage to set up a fairly interesting story, rife with contradictions (trying to remain spoiler-free here).  Unfortunately, when the entire game builds up a dichotomy of impressions, making you guess what is true and real, at the end, it falls flat.  You aren't given a choice, you're force to pick one of the impressions as ""true,"" and the game unambiguously shows that you were correct.  This isn't even the ILLUSION of choice, this is shoe-horning us in to a meaningless ending.  It's like playing a puzzle game and simultaneously watching a completely unrelated movie; on the one hand you're playing a game, and on the other merely along for the ride as a dispassionate observer.  The protagonist's doubt isn't your own, because you don't ever act on it.  You're forced to just sit back and watch as he picks correctly.  As such, I can only say that you should play the non-director's cut version, 'cause honestly the game was better when it lacked story than when it insulted its players with this.			"

												The puzzles are quick and intuitive, with only the odd one requiring real thought. The narrative is fairly insignificant, though it does make the ending interesting and better than nothing. There's a heavy amount of padding surrounding the Time Trial mode, but that's purely optional if you don't mind not getting all the acheivements.Finished in roughly four hours over a few days. Worth a look if you want something vaguely Portal 2-ish.			"

												Although simplistic in gameplay and aesthetics, QUBE is a very fun, albeit short, puzzle game.  In the game, the player has gloves which allow them to manipulate colored blocks around the bleak environments.  The blocks have different effects, some acting as magnets, others acting as jump pads, etc.The difference between the original and the Director's Cut, at least in single player, is some new and improved puzzles, alongside a new story with narrative by two voice actors.  Despite already knowing the solutions for most the puzzles, the new narrative was engaging and made me feel much more connected to the world of the game.I would recommend QUBE to any puzzle game fans, especially those who enjoyed the Portal series.

												The comparisons to Portal are obvious but I nevertheless enjoyed it. The puzzles were not too hard or frustrating and as the game progresses it introduces many different mechanics which were refreshing and kept myself playing.I discovered that the story was not originally part of the game and was added in the director's cut which makes sense to me now as I felt that it was the weakest part of the game and come to think of it having no story would've made it much more scary and atmospheric; sometimes the questions are more intriguing than the answers basically if you want me to get all Sigmund Fruedy up in this cube. Overall if you love games such as Portal you'll find this enjoyable and worth your time.			"

												I went into this one with far too low expectations. I figured it was another one of those indie puzzle games.Wrong. This is the best first person puzzler after Portal, both in story and gameplay.The gameplay was fun and refreshing. It's challenging, though at the same time remarkably intuitive.I found my own subconscious solve the majority of the puzzles without having to actively think about it.The puzzles keep throwing refreshing new gameplay mechanics at you, it never gets stale, but it never gets confusing either!Verdict:Worth €10? Personally I'd say no. It's about 3 hours of gameplay, maybe more if you try the additional content.I got it for €1 in a Humble Bundle, and I sure am glad I did!8/10 - Surprisingly fun! But for 3 hours.			"

												I really, really, really, really, really want to like Q.U.B.E.We're never getting a Portal 3, but I still desperately want a new Portal game- and all the mods coming out (I.e. Thinking With Time Machine) just aren't doing it for me.So the idea of a Portal rip-off based around a set of gradually building unique mechanics was really appealing to me.If only it had the same expert execution Portal did.The core mechanic of block moving isn't that great, but the game tries to amend that by adding on various mechanics as the game goes on.Which would be totally awesome!But most mechanics are used for one level, then never again.The story isn't great, but it's all plot-twisty and narrated and cool.Which would be totally awesome!But the story is more-or-less ripped straight out of Portal.I think you get the point.The game's one redeeming quality is that it feels genuinely /difficult./When you finished a level in Portal, you'd think ""oh, duh, how dumb of me, anyone could've figured that out.""In QUBE, you think ""THANK. GOD. YES. I DID IT. JESUS CHRIST.""So you feel accomplished. Yay for that!On the other hand- it made me just want the levels to be done with. Portal made me want more, but finishing QUBE-Portal is sorta like finishing a small-serving gourmet meal. It was delicious, and you wish you could eat it all over again.QUBE is sorta like getting cut- you just desperately hope for the bleeding to stop, and when it does, you feel thankful.That may be a bit brutal, but meh, so was playing it.If QUBE was just $2.50, I'd recommend it. That's how much I got it for, so I didn't feel all that cheated.But for anyone who spends $9.99 on it-You could've bought Portal.Or any Half-Life game.Or pretty much any good indie game ever.You have made an error.Final Score: 7/10Letter Grade: C-Verdict: Not worth two footlong sandwiches, but easily worth a 6-inch sub.Play Portal. Play Portal until your fingers bleed.			"

												Q.U.B.E, aka Quick Understanding (of) Block Extrusion, is an action puzzle game where you control various rooms with blocks.This Director's Cut version is a small, but needed expansion to the game. Some of the wording may be similiar from my Q.U.B.E review.Graphics: The graphics is blocks. No seriously...what were you expecting me to type? Anyways, the majority of the rooms you go through will be made of opaque white blocks. The blocks you can control are in colors. Yeah, that's it. Just to put it short, it is simple.Director's Cut Graphics: In my previous review, some of the stuff gave me motion sickness. However, some areas such as twisting rooms and the rotating rooms are fixed to accomodate that. Also, there are extra rooms and designs so that you won't be walking the same path over and over. Overall, a good improvement in this version.Controls: The controls are simple. You use your mouse buttons to either pull the cubes up or to push them back in. Also, there is jumping involved. The gravity is a little higher than normal fps games, like from valve.Gameplay: The goal of the game is to find a way to the next room or to solve puzzles in order for the next room to open. There are various puzzles in the game. The puzzles are simply climbing up to the next room, directing a ball into a hole, dyeing a ball a certain color and putting that in a hole, magnets to move blocks, and using your memory to note where blocks are in the dark. It seems like a lot, but luckily, the game walks you through from the beginner stage to the intermediate.Director's Cut Gameplay: In my previous review, I mentioned about that super hard magnet puzzle with the four small blocks. This puzzle was removed-thank goodness! Also, the difficulty curve has changed a bit, but in the more easy way. There are new puzzles and some puzzles removed. Still, an enjoyable experience for those who played the original Q.U.B.E game, or for those starting new.Story in Director's Cut: Finally! Some insight! The story has two people to guide you, the one to encourage you to complete and the other to stop what you're doing. However, the story is only in audio. However, there isn't much complexity in the story that will affect your gameplay or is required.Music: The music of this game is mostly ambience. Now, depending for some, it can either be slightly annoying or relaxing. To me, it was relaxing (except when it came to that room I described above).Music in Director's Cut: The music is a definite improvement. It's not just ambience this time, but actual music and beats to accompany.DLC: The DLC, ""Against the Qlock,"" is a small expansion to the current game with new puzzles with pickups to make it more fun. The goal for each puzzle is to complete it with as few moves as possible and/or as fast as possible.Is this Portal?: While this game has an atmosphere feel and mechanics like the game, ""Portal,"" it is not. The similiarities are, again the atmosphere and gameplay (excluding portals), using least amount of moves and completing the puzzles as fast as possible in the dlc, and the difficulty curve of the game. You may get a ""Portal"" vibe from this, but again, it is not.Overall: Q.U.B.E is another great action puzzle game that is a great addition to your library that is recommended to all, even to those who enjoy ""Portal"" or did not enjoy it.Regardless of how bland the interface looks, the gameplay stands up and shines in this game. The difficulty curve is great, with an exception of that one room. While the design of the game is simple, the puzzles introduced can be complexed and require thought. However, with training and a good amount of thinking, you can surely be ""Quick"" in ""Understanding"" of ""Block Extrusion.""Overall Director's Cut: Director's Cut is the much needed improvement from the original version of the game. With new puzzles, much needed fixes, music, and a story, this expansion is like reading the minds of the players who played the first game. While some people may be bummed out by missing the original game, there is no need for despair. It is mostly the same game, but with some modifications and new additions. Director's Cut is what Q.U.B.E should have been: An enjoyable, casual experience with various difficulty challenges for all.Pros:-Great difficulty curve. From easy at the beginning to hard at the end.-Many unique puzzles.-With DLC, more puzzles and more challenges.Pros for Director's Cut:-Hardest magnet puzzle removed-Difficulty curve improved.-New puzzles.-A story-Improvement on musicCons:-No story.-Bland graphics. Majority of rooms are just white blocks.-That one magnet room. Yes, I will never stop talking about it.Cons for Director's Cut:-Still some blandness for graphics, but not as bad as the previous.			"

There is a story in this one, however it's just okay and probably unnecessary?Don't go for a 100% on this one because it's just close to impossible.Recommended on a sale.➡️️Final Rating: 7/10			"

												Q.U.B.E. is a minimalist first-person puzzle game. You wake up in a sterile environment consisting entirely of white cubes. There are a small number of colored blocks – when you point at them and press your mouse, you can cause them to extrude from the walls or retract back into them. There are four kinds of blocks – purple blocks, which rotate the environment (either 90 degrees or, in a small number of puzzles, 45 degrees. There are red blocks, which extrude a line up to three blocks long. There’s yellow blocks, which always come in threes; clicking on either end causes them to extrude 1 block on the opposite end, 2 blocks in the middle, and 3 blocks on the clicked block. And there’s blue blocks, which slingshot you (or any other object) when you touch them.There’s a couple other mechanics – there are some round marbles which must be navigated through environments by use of the block mechanics, as well as some autonomous robots which always turn left which must be navigated through the environment using block mechanics. Later on, there are some wires (which, when they contact pads, light them up – these are only used for a very small number of puzzles, as they are pretty limited) and a few laser light puzzles, where you must reflect a laser using mirrors to get to the final point.A few puzzles make use of tinting blocks – either to change the color of lasers or to change the color of marbles – which adds an additional element to some puzzles.While the game tries to do a lot with its mechanics, I have to say that a lot of the puzzles weren’t actually all that much fun to solve. The game was very fond of the marble puzzles, but I have to say these were my least favorite part of the game; some of them involved fairly exact timing, particularly on some blocks with some amount of delay to them (the yellow ones), and on at least one puzzle that involved rotation, I’m fairly certain I “cheated” the game and didn’t solve it the “right way”. It was also common to face several marble puzzles in a row, which made them feel a bit more repetitive than they might have otherwise.However, the game as a whole doesn’t have all that many tricks to show the player; it clocks in around four hours in length for the main game, plus maybe another couple hours for the various side challenges if you’re intent on getting a lot of medals. But the game simply doesn’t have all that many puzzle elements to it, and so after a while it feels like the game is just remixing stuff you’ve seen a bunch without doing anything particularly clever with it. The fifth zone – doing puzzles in the dark – was particularly notable in this regard, as the main mechanic was that you couldn’t see all of what you were doing at the same time. This wasn’t a particularly fun mechanic, but it didn’t really do anything new with the puzzles, just made it more inconvenient to solve them. The first couple zones of the game were basically a tutorial in the games’ mechanics as well, with a lot of very simple puzzles which weren’t all that interesting to solve.And unfortunately, this game doesn’t boast much else other than puzzles; whereas Portal boasted GlaDOS, Wheatly, and Cave Johnson constantly chattering at you, Q.U.B.E.’s “mission control” voices are somewhat more limited in their appearances. Worse, however, is the fact that they just aren’t all that interesting; one of them says you’re saving the Earth, the other one says that the first voice is lying and you’re imprisoned in the Earth solving puzzles for their sadistic satisfaction. The second voice introduces a fair bit of fridge logic to the game, but neither scenario being presented to the player ultimately feels like it makes much sense – the second voice points out the ridiculousness of the game’s premise, but the game never really to justify why someone would be doing what they were doing. And unfortunately, in a non-comedy game that seems to be taking itself seriously, that’s a bit of a problem; why am I supposedly in some sort of alien spaceship solving puzzles to destroy it? How does that make sense? How does the player character solving these puzzles have any relation to stopping the ship? And, assuming that mission control really is telling the truth, how do they know that there is an escape shuttle waiting at the end of the ship for you?There isn’t even any real attempt at explaining all this made by the game, which seemed to be trying to be cleverly ambiguous but instead simply undermined itself.The one thing that I can say that the game did well was its graphics; Q.U.B.E. is an indie game, but by making use of the extremely minimalist environment composed almost entirely of white cubes, the producers managed to make a game that looks very good – I don’t think anyone would immediately identify it as an indie game just by looking at it, at least not at the start. The environments were very clean and were visually appealing, though unfortunately by the end of the four-hour long game the white cube walls had begun to get a bit samey looking, and mixing it up with ruined areas didn’t really work, instead making it just look kind of dingy.Ultimately, like a number of similar minimalist puzzle games (such as Quantum Conundrum, Antichamber, and The Talos Principle), Q.U.B.E. feels like it was emulating Portal, but failed to recognize that Portal worked so well in part because the new mechanic, the portal gun, was virgin territory. Nothing in Q.U.B.E. felt like virgin territory. And while the Talos Principle managed to carry itself with a clever story and worldbuilding, Q.U.B.E.’s attempt at a serious story didn’t feel like it ultimately made much sense or was particularly well-written. The voice actors did a decent job with their lines; the problem was that the plot itself made no real sense, and indeed, the game undermined itself by questioning its own nature and then not really resolving all the inconsistencies it brought upIf there was one mercy to this game, it was that it was short, clocking in at only around 4 hours to beat the main story, including all the side content therein. But without a really interesting central mechanic or plot, there’s not much here worth experiencing. My advice? Play the Portal games or The Talos Principle instead.			"

												There's two parts to Q.U.B.E.  Like most games, there's the story and then there's the gameplay.  The gameplay in Q. U. B. E. Director's Cut is actually quite good.  You start the game in a weird space built out of cubes, with a pair of gloves that allows you to interact with a small amount of the world, namely colored bricks. From this, the game is based on manipulating those bricks, traversing the levels, and exploring the world. And that's what Q.U.B.E. does exceedingly well.  I played this game back before the Director's Cut and remember one or two puzzles I had trouble with.  This time around, I only had a single problem with a puzzle (an annoying puzzle, but it's also the last one in the game I believe).    However the puzzles are a highlight of the game, and will make most fans of puzzle games or games where the goal is to merely traverse a level (like Portal) enjoy themselves. On the other hand there's a story, and to be honest, that's where the game falls apart.  The original Q.U.B.E. didn't have a story and I remember thinking ""Man I'd love to have some reasoning for me to do this.""  Hell I'm sure I suggested a portal-esque story. Unfortunately I got what I requested, and worse... well it's just bad.   The story itself feels disjointed, as if it was placed in the middle of an already complete game (which it was) and sadly the game isn't better for it.  The story, tries to be this deep probing or even contemplative thing.  But comes across as just manipulative and forgettable.  Even the ending is just there.  I like the puzzles, not the part where the game tries to talk to and interact with the player.I actually wish there was a way to not play the story (I still have Q.U.B.E. so I can just play the old version).  It's just not a good addition to the original game, luckily they have made it a free upgrade otherwise I would have been unable to recommend this version of the game. However with that being said, the gameplay is above average, there's some time attack maps that you can play that are actually quite difficult, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had on the first playthrough of the game.  Just don't expect an amazing story, or even a game you can play through more than once.   You'll spend a couple hours playing the game, and get a fun experience, but it's not going to blow any minds, and since it came out in the same year as Portal 2, it didn't win any awards.   That all being said, it's still a solid experience and quite enjoyable for fans of the puzzle genre.			"

You can spend much more time with the DLC's and (mostly) the achievements.A little interesting story is told by the game with not a big messege, but it's very good and impulsive.I can just recommend this game! :)			"

												Great game, love the overall design, look & feel. The game itself is pretty simple and I quickly reached the end wanting more, In game you move tetris looking blocks to progress onto the next area, eventually taking  a portal 2 turn & your out the game behind the scenes wondering who to beleive between the only two voices you hear via your radio (This is where having a choice between two endings/arcs would have been nice)Dislikes were the bright primary colour of the shapes (I would have liked a more grown up feel and alien look but understand that bright colours help distinguish them as interactive). Would have liked cards/badges to show of on my profile, just cous' I liked the game!Loved the game & cant wait for the announced sequel. Get it if you like Portal, Time Rifters, Talos Principle...

												Before I start on actual game you need to know that QUBE has serious issues with available FOV: is way too narrow and devs ignored multiple complains about it. Low FOV (below 80, game runs at ~50-60) may cause a headache and nausea. It is also unacceptable to have such FOV in PC title.Game itself is interestic logic game with decent artistic style (however may feel repetetive after a while) and soundtrack. It lacks personality, homour, message to player that usually other games offer. Director's Cut adds commentary and story that doesn't make much sense, has blank spots in it and feels like was added without deeper thinking. Puzzles are alright, but very little. QUBE has to offer about 1,5-3,5 hours of entertaiment - for some it might be good enough, but other similar games like Antichamber offer simply more interesting gameplay and are not that short. With standard pricetag hard to call that good.			"

												I liked so much the minimalist environment and the background music; it helps you to focus on the puzzles and chill. The story is not that good and there are things which are inspired from Portal, but I couldn't care less about it. I like a videogame for the gameplay and the fun that can be had, not the story. If I want a good story I go read a book or watch a movie.The puzzles are cool and some of them might be a little challenging. If it had some more levels, it would have been just perfect. I haven't found any bugs so far and it runs well on windows 8.If you like puzzle games, this one is a must.

												Elegant and short first person puzzle platformer centred around the extrusion of blocks. I reccomend getting this version over the original as it comes with the DLC included, as well as some added content (new puzzles, achievements, and an actual story line with voice actors, which the original didn't have).Pros:-Minimalistic. It's a nice break from games with complex intricate environments filled with detail. There's not much background noise to distract you.-Good puzzles. The hardest puzzles are a nice challenge but not super tough (imo). If spatial puzzles are your thing then don't expect to spend 30min stuck in a room.-Short. Again, a good break from that drawn out campaign you're going through in that other game. You can explore everything in the main game here in 3.5h or less. Secret areas included.-Against the Qlock. The DLC gives you a bunch of short challenges with a ton of achievements. They do have a stressful change of pace but you can play them in many ways.-Those elegant hands and forearms. I feel strangely attracted to them.-Cool environments. Not all of them but there's some screenshot/recording-worthy moments.Cons:-Slapped on story. This version is basically the original with voice acting to give you some sense of story. Personally it rubbed me the wrong way. I prefered the mystery of not knowing anything (in a Myst like way) rather than feeling like I'm in a bad stereotyped American film. There were so many things that made no sense, so many plotholes.-Preformance issues? I'm not the only one. I'd like to see what the highest settings look like while still being able to have a good framerate (or is this just lag? I can't even tell). And this game doesn't demand much from the graphical part.-Linearity. While I like games to be linear when they do have a linear plot, it was confusing to reach the only part where the other characters instill you to make a choice and yet... there's no choice to be made. You just keep going forward. It becomes irrelevant whom you trust because there's only one way to progress in the game. Even if that's against your wishes.-Unpolished environment. Elements without collision. Invisible walls. Strange transitions in the secret areas.-Unskippable cutscenes. But hey, at least they are short. Unlike the slow and painful elevator rides added in so you'd listen to the monologues. I get what the developers were trying to do but I believe they went a bit overboard. All in all I enjoyed itt. The story, as bad as it felt, was bad in a laughable way. There were gorgeous rooms and corridors to be seen. The athmosphere was serene and somewhat mysterious. And the puzzles were accessible enough while still having some challenge in them that you'd feel accomplished. Yes, there's a bunch of things that could be better but they don't take the fun away from this game.			"

												Pros:+Mostly satisfying and fun puzzles+Excellent organic teaching of the rules and mechanics of the puzzles+Minimalist but very appropriate and polished graphics/sound+Minimalist but gripping narrative+Has an ending (no cliffhanger for a sequel or “fade to white” cop-out)+Works great on SteamOS Linux with a Steam Controller+A fair length for my skill level (took me 5 hours)Cons:-Some puzzles can get frustrating-The ending might not be to your tasteI was very pleasantly surprised by Q.U.B.E: Director’s Cut. I had heard nothing and seen nothing of it before playing it (Humble Bundle syndrome) so I really didn’t know what to expect. I don’t generally consider myself to be a fan of first-person puzzle games because I do not consider myself to be very smart or very patient; whenever I pick up a puzzle game I expect to be bored while I figure out how to play, and as soon as I understand how to play I expect to be frustrated once the puzzles move beyond the easiest of the easy. Because of that I have abandoned many puzzles games soon after starting. Q.U.B.E seems to anticipate that mentality and provides an excellent learning experience to ease you in to every mechanic of the puzzles as they appear, without ever making you feel overwhelmed. Accomplishing that in the early part of any puzzle game is worthy of praise, but Q.U.B.E never stops accomplishing that as new mechanics and variations on old ones continue to be introduced throughout the game right up until the end, and never once did I feel like I was playing a tutorial. The puzzles themselves are mostly very well balanced in difficulty (for my personal skill lever). When a series of one type of puzzle starts to feel like a chore, the developers smartly introduce a new mechanic soon thereafter, which almost always managed to relieve my frustration by invigorating my curiosity. There were several times when I got incredibly frustrated with a particular puzzle and was feeling very prepared to call out the developers for cheap/unfair puzzle design, when eventually I “got it” and realized that the problem was me, not the puzzle. This happens most often on puzzles involving the physics engine, which did a few times “spaz out” and make objects bounce around in obviously unintended ways. But I realized later that this only happened because I was approaching a puzzle the wrong way, and I thought I needed to force my way through using some bizarre and implausible manipulation of the physics objects. The puzzles are thankfully not designed to rely on the physics engine nearly as much as it might appear they are, and once the right solution is found it becomes obvious that no “forcing” of the physics is necessary. It reminds me of a challenging jigsaw puzzle; sometime you really, honestly think you need to “trim a piece to make it fit” but that’s just because you haven’t found where it actually fits yet.The story is understated but excellent. Being told almost exclusively through voiceovers, it utilizes mystery, excellent voice acting, and simple but effective themes of faith that I found to be surprisingly compelling, and kept me motivated to complete the game in a just a few days. Considering the game’s style I was beginning to dread that the game would have a cop-out “ambiguous” ending with no answers, but thankfully that’s not the case. The ending does have answers for the player, but whether you find them to be satisfying or not is going to be a matter of opinion. I appreciated that I was given answers, but I personally didn’t like the answers very much. Whether you like the ending or not is going to depend much more on your personally held beliefs than on your opinion of the quality of the ending cinematic. But the very fact that the story manages personal involvement on that level at all is very impressive.Overall, for excellent quality and accessibility of puzzles paired with a very engaging story, I highly recommend  Q.U.B.E: Director’s Cut.

												The original version of Q.U.B.E. was published in 2011. Recently, about a month ago, a revamped version of the game popped up in my library, so I decided to play the game again and see how it goes.Q.U.B.E. is a puzzle game, with a visual style that resembles Portal, and as such it was largely lauded as a Portal-esque by the majority of the gaming world. As a puzzler, the game is great, albeit it could be considered a bit short. You use cube-shaped blocks of various properties to beat the consecutive rooms. The mechanics are simple, but the puzzles are challenging, as it should be; I finished the main campaign in three hours, although I did leave some secrets unchecked. This was my second playthrough though, so I would estimate the first to take about twice as long.The Director's Cut version added a story element, largely advertised by the developers... and unfortunately, it gives off a vibe of being a simple overlay on the original version of the game. The plot is mainly just snippets of voice transmission, and the information given to you by those voices is not only unconnected to the gameplay, but also a blatant attempt to evoke an emotional response... which is futile, as there is no relation between the story and the world the player is placed in. Not to mention that the whole story is just two characters trying to convince you that you are what they say you are, and the other person is lying. Not cool.The Against the Qlock DLC, which added timed challenges and leaderboards, also seems to be part of this release. However the gameplay of the challenges seems... not very well thought out - without spoiling too much, the puzzle-solving mechanics of the single-player are not the optimal strategy; to get a good time, you need to collect power-ups. Some of them are mandatory, and some of them affect your time, mostly positively; abandoning the crux of the game to use simple power-ups doesn't seem like a good idea to me. Although, I guess contrary to Portal challenges there's a lot less freedom, and in consequence the puzzles are more streamlined, so they needed to introduce something that could speed up the gameplay.Overall... Having played the original Q.U.B.E., it was a good puzzler. The Director's Cut didn't add any value to the game; it might have arguably removed some (the cheesy plot ruins the ambience the game had before). I'd still recommend it on its current price. €1.49 is not a big ask, and the game is genuinely rewarding. It's just... trying to be Portal a bit too much.			"

												Pros:- Interesting Story- Good Music- Good Atmoshpere- Great Voice Acting- Unique Mechanics- Pretty great, if predictable and slightly cheesy endingCons:- Weird physics- Overly long and slow elevators and doors that make you stand around for far too long- A few puzzles rely on you performing succesive actions quickly, while the character's animation speed is just slow       enough to make these sections incredibly frustrating			"

Utterly, utterly brilliant.I watched a gameplay video before buying it, and i honestly thought it looked a little tame, but the way the puzzles get more complicated by adding different elements for you to solve them with, is great. It's not the longest game, so it's not going to keep you occupied for long, but if you can get it in a sale, do it.Very underrated, and i would highly recommend, as this is a great (short) game.I have a big bushy beard, so i know about these things.

												10$ is a steal for this game.The campaign is relatively short, you can definitely beat it within 5 hours, but it is worth it. This game is based off clever mechanics and nice ideas that don't seem very apparent from the store page but actually playing the game makes it clear how good they are. The director's cut version adds (i think the time trials DLC as well) the story to the game. In-game dialogue that creates a story that admittedly seems very generic at first but actually gets pretty deep and interesting later on in the game. Unlike the original, it actually feels like your solving these puzzles with context rather than just mindlessly doing them. That was my only gripe with the original. Very nice art design, even if it is pretty plain, I've grown to appreciate it. (very easy to run as well) and finally the soundtrack they added to the game is actually very nice, adds tension where needed but also mellow relaxing music for puzzle solving. It just works so well.Get this game.			"

												Absolutely incredible gameTakes about two hours to complete the main story if you take it sorta slow. The visuals are very clean, fantastically pleasing and fit the game well.The puzzles are not too hard to be irritating, and are not too easy to breeze through, as such they are enough to be pleasantl gratifying to solve.The story is fine, and fits the game aptly, with a few drawbacks in a couple of line deliveries, but all around splendid.The controls are intuitive, responsive, and only at times annoying for clear gameplay frustration workaround reasons.In total, a great, short experience, buy it.

												I really enjoyed the original and this version of the game. However, this is very much like the original game. The puzzles are the same. There are a few changes and minor additions. The only major difference between this version and the original is that this one has a narrative. If you already have the original, do not bother with this. If you do not have the original, I would recommend this as much or perhaps more (if you prefer a narrative) than the original. The reason why I am not recommending this version is because there are no subtitles, so I could not understand what was being said which made this game feel exactly like the original. Otherwise, if you are not hearing impaired or from a non-English background, I would recommend this over the original. If subtitles are added, I will change this review to recommended.			"

												A very RARE game that was missed and quite fun to play. If you like games like Portal then this game is really fun. Abit short story mode but i didnt even expect that this kind of game should even have a story... But the game really starts after you finish it, when you start doing TIME mode... its really fun and just just wanna get better and better.			"

												Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut is a first person puzzle game that is as much Portal as it is NaissancE.It functions essentially like Portal, with sequential, and well defined puzzles. However, when moving from one puzzle to the next, you encounter some pretty huge monocromatic structures, very much like NaissancE.The difference between this version and the previous, is the addition of a story, through voice-acting... I don't think the story is very well put together, in the context of the game, though. It's not bad, but I don't think it is very important, aside from giving the player a break between puzzles.The puzzles are rather eclectic, drawing from several different types of puzzles. It certainly keeps things varied and interesting. Unfortunately, there will inevitably be sections with puzzles that many players may not like.A specific example I can give is some of the physics-driven puzzles... It's always the same problem: instead of very clear cause-effect, you sometimes get weird interactions that make the puzzle much harder and confusing than it should be.I'm also not a fan of sliding puzzles, of which there were a couple.Overall, nothing too bad! Most of the puzzles were pretty good! I liked it. Not much more to say about it, though.The visuals are great, and the music sets a nice atmosphere. It's around 4 hours long to beat the main campaign, but there are some time-challenges and other secret puzzles hidden around that may let you take something more out of the game.Finally, I mentioned the story. Not to spoil too much, it's mostly trying to get doubt into the player's mind, by having 2 people trying to tell him different sides of the story, seemingly leading to a decision in the end. Unfortunately, the game was designed as a straightforward puzzle game. As a result, the story is literally a few lines of voice-acting between areas. It never affects the gameplay. The player never actually chooses anything. Never questions anything. Never explores around to find clues. Nothing.It's just there! And what could be a cool thing, ended up being nothing at all. It's purely a distraction.But hey, this is all subjective. These were my impressions after playing through it. Although not as striking as either Portal nor NaissancE, it does manage a nice balance of both, and it's definitely a good game! Worth a try if you're looking for a first-person puzzle game.			"

												Fantastically stylized and atmospheric Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut, gives players the opportunity experience what made Q.U.B.E. so fun and challenging, while incorporating a compelling narrative that made this game even more rewarding. With Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut, the player is given essentially the same game (graphics, puzzles, etc...) with a voice over and story attached. If you like Portal, you're going to like this, its mix of challenges and minimal style make it addictive and appealing to look at, because odds are if you’re good at first person puzzle games, you'll beat this in one sitting. The controls don’t feel constrictive nor are they over whelming, simply put; you have a glove that manipulates blocks on walls, which sounds easier than it is. If you aren't one to nit-pick, the story is interesting for what it's worth and the buildup towards the finally is beyond worth the wait. The voice acting is also impressive considering this is an indie game that costs less than half of a regular title while managing to look better too. Visuals: 9/10The game does look good and when in optimal settings on the correct monitor looks near lifelike or at the very least will make you say ""wow"".Story: 8/10With the game being about 3 hours the first play through, the story is more than adequate, keeping the player guessing as to what’s really going on while still being interesting and exciting.Replay ability: 7/10Like other games of the genre it has speed runs, but that’s really where it ends, the stories ok a second time through but it doesn’t have the same affect twice.Challenge: 8/10It's unique, really. Being able to manipulate your surroundings isn’t anything super new or exiting, but the way it’s done is impressive. Some of the puzzles will be quite difficult the first time through while some are just down right fun and awesome, specifically the blue platforms. They aren’t so difficult that your get bored or angry nor are the too easy and just flat out lame.As with all games, the first section is to get the player oriented while the levels afterwords will put your mind to work.Would I recommend this game? An overwhelming Yes. Unless you were sucked into the original by its lack of a story and explanation, buy this game. It's a perfect example of what can be done with a good idea and the right elements. Personally, id put this up there with Mirrors Edge, Portal, or any highly praised indie game. The story is there, along with the visuals and game play, especially being that this game is only $10, it’s not Portal, but it’s right there with it.Solid 9/10 all considered.Many many times better than most big budget games being released every year.

												First of: I am a huge fan of first person puzzle games, the more mindbending they are, the more i enjoy them with Portal 2 and Thinking With Time Machine on the top of my list.The mechanism in Q.U.B.E. intrigued me, so i thought i'd give it a try. After waking up in completely sterile room you hear a voice over the radio telling you that you are somewhere in space, and you probably lost you memory of why you're there or even who you are. The only other thing they tell you is that the planet (or whatever it is you're on) is going to crash into earth, and you are humanity's only hope.... So, you know, no pressure. After that the game starts, you have these special gloves with which you can manipulate blocks.Pro's- Fun puzzles- Cool new mechanism to solve puzzles- Progressive build up in difficultyNeutral- Minimalist design. I guess if you're into that sort of thing you wouldn't mind, but personally i prefer a little more art directionCon's- Some levels require ninja skills, not pro ninja skills or anything, but i like my puzzles based on the ability to figure out how to solve them instead of fast finger skills- Barely a story line, although i haven't played it fully through so maybe it'l surprise me- Barely any sound designConclusion:If you're a fanatic puzzler and you're up for a refreshing puzzle game: go for it!

												I don't recommend this game for one simple reason - it's not worth the money. 10 euro is not enough for a game you can beat in 2 hours. If you can buy it for 3 euro or less it's worth, any higher price is not suitable for this game.Now about the game:[+] The director's cut has some sort of a storyline added. The story is not very interesting, but it's more than nothing... at least you're not feeling that alone.[+] The game lets you figure everything out by yourself which is nice, finally a change from all those games who narrate you trough the whole game and tell you everything before you have the chance to think about it.[+] The design is pretty simple and clean.[- ] At the end of every chapter there is a bright white light flash... no idea why did they decide to put that? Bad choise... it really hurts the eyes.[- ] The game is short[- ] The game is pretty much over after you beat it once. There is some thing called ""beat the clock"" where you try to run and get to the finish line in time, but in my opinion it's very boring.The game pretty much tries to look like portal - they kinda got it with the nice and neat rooms, but yet... kinda not there. Portal is the kind of game I can play more than once, Q.U.B.E is not. Again - if you can get this game for under 3 euro it's worth the 2 hours of fun.			"

												Q.U.B.E. (Quick Understanding of Block Extrusion) was always a favorite puzzler of mine. While bordering on the whitewashed, clean, and scientific feel of Portal in the visuals department, it still stood out on it's own, with fun and intuitive extrusion mechanics that made solving every puzzle both a learning experience and a reward. Unfortunately, the first game always lacked one thing: a good narrative. It was unfortunate that, as the protagonist, you made your way in complete silence through the abstract yet immersive environment of Q.U.B.E.Director's Cut addressed that.Director's Cut adds a touching and suspenseful narrative to an otherwise excellent puzzle game, to great success. I played the whole thing in one sitting, and never once did my poor posterior get a break fron the grinding point of the edge of my seat. The narrative keeps you guessing until the very end, and in that reguard, I happily hail Directors Cut as an effective and evocative replacement to the original Q.U.B.E.Now get out there and start extruding!

Product received for free
A deceptively short 3D puzzle game obviously themed around cubes and obviously inspired from the Portal series.This ""Director's Cut"" version should have been acquired for free if you have the original Q.U.B.E. prior to this one's announcement that this was being given out in that manner.Using minimalistic graphics, most everything looks smooth & clean. That said the levels will probably start to look stale since all you'll see wherever you look are squares. Later on you'll come across a couple of slightly different shapes or so but there are always going to be the same looking squares around.The single player campaign probably won't take even more than a few hours to beat and the puzzles themselves, while they can be pretty clever, aren't very hard on their own.The idea of this game is to manipulate colored blocks to solve a puzzle to reach the next room. Each specific color has a different function for that block which have to be used for a small variety of reasons depending on the situation whether it be as a means of adding a platform for jumping on or pushing something aside.There's no how-to-play kind of tutorials here aside from the simplistic first levels where you're to learn on your own how to manipulate the blocks. The controls are in the options menu and everything else is pretty much self-taught.There are a total of 7 sectors to go through with each sector being lengthier than the last either from the amount of levels in each one or because the levels are just larger. Could be the puzzles themselves just take longer to solve, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Each sector has a different theme to it though you'll usually be using the same assets and what you've learned from previous levels.I've experienced some bugs on a couple of levels where cubes are clipping through other objects and their sliding mechanics suddenly don't work as intended. If you've got the puzzle figured out or you're just experimenting with the objects given to you, the bugs can be a serious hindrance when trying to progress through the current area. You can keep screwing around until you eventually get whatever you need to to work but I'm pretty sure such problems shouldn't be there to begin with.In this version of the game they added a narrative storyline to the single player campaign, which I thought was absolutely unnecessary. Right at the ending there's a heavy implication within the narration of there being decision making, which turns out there wasn't. The entire game's linear, which is fine, but again I don't believe this added story was really needed.The silence & mystery I thought was a novelty of its own in the original. Here, it seems like they forced it in given how there are a lot of details mentioned with not a whole lot of connection with what you see & experience. You can't even turn off the narration since the only audio slider in the game is ""MASTER"". It doesn't help a whole lot that there aren't any subtitle options either in case you actually got into the added story.The ""Director's Cut"" also features the previously released DLC. They're just 10 extra levels that are more focused on speedrunning than puzzles, which aren't actually bad. If you're achievement hunting you'll be spending more time with the DLC than the campaign due to how grindy they can be.So the gameplay of this isn't bad as far as puzzle games go but really it's just too short, there's a shoved in storyline you can't turn off unless you mute the entire game, and physics bugs can be potentinally gamebreaking.

												Are you an analphabet? Worry not my friend, as this game proves that even you can make a good game if you try!Pros: - Interesting mechanics. The cube mechanic is really interesting and would've been good for a level editor, missed opportunity. - Good visuals. It's very clean and looks very nice. - Hard puzzles.Cons: - Hard puzzles. The puzzles may be a little bit too ♥♥♥♥ed up for a casual play, but if you're okay with this kind of game, you can ignore that. - Bad voice-acting and story. I would've prefered if it was completely silent, like, apparently, the original cut. - Cringy graphic options. It gives you limited options to change your graphic setup, so you need a mildly good PC to handle it since you can't tweak it to a less power-hungry setting. Claps for giving the Dynamic Lights option, even when it severely degrades the gaming experience, and giving the option to the player. But unfortunately, they forgot everything else. It runs roughly 20-25 fps on an Intel HD 5500/Intel i3 2.00GHz x 4 setup with Ubuntu 15.10. - Fullscreen options. And if things are already bad with the terribly limited console-like graphic options, they ♥♥♥♥ed with the fullscreen as well. The game won't run in any resolution lower than yours on fullscreen (at least on Ubuntu), which means you're SEVERELY limited if you don't have a good machine.Overall, the pros are really strong, but the cons as well, if you have a powerful machine, a brain for puzzles and can handle the voice-acting, it's a strong recommendation. If you want something better balanced, doesn't have a very powerful machine and is picky with voice-acting, I would recommend to take that Portal 2 out of the shelf.			"

												If you liked Portal, definitely pick this up. You're manipulating (parts of) your environment rather than creating teleporters, but either way it's a really fun first-person physics puzzle game. My only complaint is that it's kinda short...hopefully one day we'll see a Q.U.B.E. 2.This is the ""Director's Cut"" version of the game, which is almost exactly the same as the original, with the following differences:1) In the original, you're just by yourself with no idea of what's going on, where you are, why you're there, etc. The DC version has some ""narration"" that provides something of a plot. Whether this is a good thing is kinda a matter of personal preference; the game doesn't really need a plot, and some people like the mystery. Personally, I felt that it added an extra dimension to things, but I see where the other side is coming from; just look at the movie Blade Runner for an example of how adding a narration track can ruin the atmosphere.2) The hardest puzzle in the original game (Section 6 Puzzle 4, which corresponds to the original's ""Tough Going, Part 2"" achievement) is gone. Now, I can already hear the Super Meat Boy/Dark Souls fans who haven't played through Q.U.B.E. lamenting the ""dumbing down"", but trust me...this is a case for rejoicing and fanfare. The puzzle was really hard to begin with, which is fine; however, the game physics weren't (and still aren't, since that part of the engine hasn't been changed for the DC version) up to snuff for producing the required precision, so 75% of the time even when you did the puzzle correctly it still wouldn't work. For the curious, the DC version's ""Tough Going"" achievement is the same as the original game's ""Tough Going, Part 1"".3) A few extra puzzles (fun ones, but IMO no new noteworthy ones) and some ""filler"" areas were added to allow the narration to occur between puzzles without making the player stop.

												BEATEN - Time to completion - 4 hoursQUBE is a very portal-esque first person puzzle platformer. It involves you manipulating blocks to pass through rooms. The puzzle are creative, the music is pretty good, and the plot is actually more interesting than i would have expected it to be. Certainly worth a sale price, given the length. It does also have a time attack mode if you like that kind of thing.			"

												Out of the many puzzle games I have played during my 'gaming career', this one by far combines, beauty, challenge, and story in one very affordable package that I will never regret buying. It almost reminded me of portal, but with cubes. Much more cubes. 10/10 would recommend!			"

												Review for the original version, however I bought it before it went off the store: http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/203730/Thoughts are the same, however this version was more optimized for better performing computers. I have issues with frame-rate jittering to dropping below 30 (I prefer 30 minimum or steady).The additional story it offers is good, but I'm torn of which version I prefer: story or silence. It did give context of what you were doing there and such.QUBE:DC does provide the Against the Qlock DLC in it instead of sperately, less money spent for achievement hunters, however the original version requires a purchase and I don't know if current owners can still get the DLC for it.Despite all that, QUBE:DC is still good and enjoyable if you liked Portal.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												For my review about the previous version, click here.http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtyfishy/recommended/203730/Right, this is the updated version to QUBE, this version adds the full game and the DLC as well, so it's a pretty good deal (if you like time trials). More importantly it adds a narrative, You start the game with amnesia and a broken radio (which is a good way of explaining why the protagonist doesn't speak although waking up with amnesia is kind of clichéd, but whatever) THe voice acting for the most part was surprisingly good, the male voice actor especially should be commended, however a few lines for the female VA were a little naff at times and I cringed at the part where she starts (she's a Astronaut/scientist by the way) crying when she heard 'God is dead' Both characters try to convince you that they're telling the truth and the other person is lying, which they do both make good points, which led me to incredibly uncertain on who to trust.Unfortunately, there is only one ending this time around, which with both characters trying to persuade you, you'd think there would be two choices at the end.Due to the fact that you wake up with amnesia you aren't really told why or how you've got those gloves or what you are really doing there.Due to spoilers, I'll have to be pretty vague but apparently doing puzzles helps you 'complete your mission' (your mission is revealed about halfway through as the female on the radio explains every 30 minutes or so (depending on progression) once she has a clear signal to radio you). Overall, there are some improvements that are worthy of taking a look at if you have never played the original or if you are just curious. However, there isn't much to warrant a purchase if you have already spent the money on the original/DLC. "

												The game is ok but it could be much better. first of all there are 7 chapters in the game (15-30 minuets per chapter) which is very short as shown by my above playtime. the game play is good however very basic the first 4 chapters (out of 7) were poinless, boring and way too easy almost no thought went into solving those puzzles but the last 3 were much better. the acting was ok tho the story was dumb and not very well thought out as i thought the story should have been told throu each level via collectables and writing/drawings on walls.there is also not much to do after completeing the game only a few speed runs pros:chapters 5-7the conceptsome vairation is puzzles cons:story lineplaytime  lack of contentoverall i would advise you to get this game IF it were on sale but otherwise don't there are much better puzzle games than this one			"

												Let's start with the end of a review. Should you buy this game? Yes, even at full price.  I first played this game when it first released on PC. I did not come around to finishing it. A couple of weeks ago though, the Director's Cut edition got released (and added for free in my Library, loved that) so I decided to give it a go again.  The game has a clear story now and it's an awesome addition. It kept me going, until I finished the game in one sitting. It took me 2-3 hours. For those who think that this is not enough, there are challenge missions to keep you busy for quite some time.  Back to the story part, the story itself was good. It felt like a psychological/mystery thriller and not a predictable one! Also the whole game gives you a sense of isolation, even though there are people talking to you through your character's communication thingy.  When it comes to the game's visual assets, the models look really good. The textures of the other hand vary. Your hands have great textures, the textures of the rooms look good too but they are really plain and simple and some textures are just ugly and look really old. Thankfully the ugly ones are rarely seen. Also, it run butter smooth on my machine (Quad Core @ 2.8GHz and a GTX450) with all the settings maxed up, unless the game had to render flames, when the fps dropped to hell.A problem I had with the game, was its lack of an FOV Slider. The stock FOV was really low for me and the only way to change it is by tweaking the game's files. I played it with the stock FOV and I got used to it, but I would have rather played it with something I find more comfortable. The voice acting was excellent! I was really surprised by its quality! Especially the main two characters where completely believable and full of emotions. And the music really set the tone of the game, spooking you out all the way, start to end.  Finally, the puzzles themselves where really varied. You did not have enough time to get bored of one kind, because a new one appeared, taking the spotlight, until the next one appeared. Sadly, I considered them to be on the easy side, but I had the same problem with Portal 2, so if you've played that, expect a similar experience.  The game seems to have been heavily influenced by Portal, at least during it's really early stages. Despite that, it manages to differentiate itself, slowly at the start and stronger as the plot moves on.    TL:DR  Puzzles: 7.5/10, Aesthetic: 10/10, Graphics: 6.5/10, Music: 8/10, Voice Acting 10/10. Overall a must play if you like Puzzles and thriller-like stories. 101% worth its full price. "

												I have never played Q.U.B.E before.  But judging by my playtime I seemed to have been very good at it.  Maybe it's that I'm good at puzzle games.  Or it could be that I had a natural intuition for the mechanics.  Either way, I could imagine that some people who aren't as good at puzzle games as I am would have trouble and wind up having double the amount of playtime I had.  The most troubling thing for me is the pacing of this game.  I understand that part of that is for the sake of the puzzles, but it really could've been made a bit faster so that we don't feel like we're plowing through molasses.What I don't understand is why people compare this game to Portal other than the fact that they're both first-person puzzlers (well, this game is more of a puzzle-platformer than a puzzler, but I digress).  Let's be clear: this game is very different from Portal.  It has no portals, unlike Antichamber for instance, and it has no buttons and very few lasers, and so the puzzle mechanics are flat out different.  That being said, I will say that this game resembles Portal in its tiled and behind-the-scenes environments.  But even there you'll find differences, I can guarantee you.And speaking of game mechanics, there are 5 main mechanics in this game, but there are also plenty more underused ones, encountered in the latter half of the game.Next up: the story.  It's a simple story told through two voices — not entirely unheard of.  At times it did make me wonder what the ending was going to be, but otherwise it only helped enhance the increasingly bleak and freaky environment in the latter portion of the game.The UI was simple — perhaps too simple.  Even Antichamber (another UDK game) had more flexibility.  At least it had some basics.Overall: 7.5/10UPDATE: I just realized that this game include the Against The Qlock DLC as part of its deal, so now you can complete all of the achievements if you try hard enough.  However I have to say that this game, with its semi-irresponsive clicking, is not particularly friendly for speedrunning.  If I could post a review there as well I would.  At any rate, don't let this discourage you from the main game.UPDATE 2: Now I recently saw some playthroughs of the original Q.U.B.E.  I only wish I could've been able to buy that version on Steam instead of the Director's Cut, as it seemed was better.			"

												QUBE has a nice aesthetic, and uses simple, easy to understand pieces to build complex and often devious puzzles. When things click for you, it feels great. However, some bits in the game left me frustrated, rather than interested, and I admit I turned to a guide once or twice in the later stages just to advance. (Of course, that may be a reflection on my abilites rather than the game's difficulty or quality of level design.) The narrative was interesting enough and well presented, but somehow lacking at the end. There are a couple of secret areas you can go back to, and the Director's Cut includes some DLC with time trials and the like if the gameplay continues to interest you after completing the story.Being a first-person physics puzzle game with a glossy, stark art style, it's hard not to compare Q.U.B.E to Portal; if you enjoyed those types of puzzles, you will find things to like in this game, but without Valve's level of polish. Despite recommending it, I felt as much relief as accomplishment when I finished; it was entertaining, but I was ready to move on.			"

												This game could be a very good one, but instead it fails in some important points. The good:- Interesting concept, Portal-like puzzle, although much smaller world in every way. The bad and ugly:- Controlling the environment is grumpy and tiring. It is because the control is not responsive as fast as you would imagine it should be. You can guess what is the result: as you progress the game, the game gets more complex, but then it is more tiring to control, which is not fun or relaxing in any way. - I found the narrative quite disturbing, it was hardly interesting and mostly pointless. I would say this even, it has some revealing of story at the end. It just not worth your energy following narrative.- background music cannot be turned off, which is very annoying when you spend a couple hours in game. It gets monotone early, but if you switch off yound completely, then you are not able to hear environmental noises, or control effects, which can be help.Overall, I would only recommend this game if you want to see something refreshing, then is may worth a try. But the full game experience (without me playing DLCs) just lack fun overall, and lack the rewarding feeling or at least self-development in solving puzzles. Sorry QUBE. :/			"

Q.U.B.E.: Director's Cut			* 7/10I was looking for a puzzle game in the style of Portal and I came up with this one.+++Pros+++- Puzzles. They made up a very nice and intriguing set of puzzles. If you're expecting the classic 3 colour platforms you're wrong. Soon there will be more platforms in different colours and with different funcions improving the depht of the puzzles.- Setting. The ambience is always made by minimalist white padded rooms, but there are some rooms and passagers that show a very beautiful and intricated level design.- Story. Lost in space, without memory and your base trying to drive you to safety. Nice setting...---Cons---- ...But I was expecting a Turning Point that never happened. So the end is quite simple and predictable.- Quite ShortThey could have put a little more effort in this title. If they did this game could have been a little gem emerging from the mass. Too bad.

THIS ISN'T HOW COLORS WORK 
A Screenshot of Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut
By: Turnoverman




A simple and relaxing puzzle game that plays upon plenty of intrigue for it's short, yet enjoyable duration. Playing in the same vein of Portal solving puzzles room by room, the game beautifully teaches you the mechanics of the game and ever so increasingly ups the antics per chamber. A short review for a short game. But if you are at all interested do pick this one up. The game is fun, the story is intriguing and it's a great way to relax after a long day.			"

												Q.U.B.E., Portal but different.Q.U.B.E. is a wonderful little thing that takes a bit of inspiration from portal through its mechanics and setting and puts out a solid 3 hours of puzzling and interesting puzzles and plot. In this game you get plonked into a room wearing some form of suit that has the power of interacting with the blocks (Or should I say, Q.U.B.E.s) that you come across. There are various types with various applications and they make up the puzzles.Gameplaywise, this game is excellent and makes you wish for more, as these mechanics feel like they could be expanded upon a lot, or complicated in a lot more ways than the game actually does. It never gets stale during the 3 hours or so you'll end up spending in it, and difficulty hikes up well. There is one puzzle that spikes in difficulty way too much, however, and it slightly ruins the pace of the game. The bugs this game has are minor, and none are gamebreaking. All in all, gameplaywise, this game is very solid.Storywise, this game is lacking a bit. There's some nice storytelling done, making you question what to believe, but it also sets itself up for you to end it in the way you want it to. Unfortunately, the developers did not include a second ending route for you to take, and you're forced to go with one character's will. This little bit completely messes up the story, as whatever you do, whatever you think, it's all linear.It's still enjoyable however, and the time you spend thinking about everything whilst solving puzzles is bound to be a great one if you're into these types of games.The biggest issue I personally have with this game is the default pricepoint. I can live with 3 hour games, definitely. This game, however, charges too much for the 3 hours it can provide you with entertainment. I'd prefer to see a pricepoint around 10€ or the regional equivalent, but for now, I recommend you buy this during a sale.			"

												Tries hard to be emotional, but I do not care about the character at all.Puzzles rely a lot on 'timing', which would be fine -- except Box2D physics + timing puzzles are relentlessly buggyThe game gets really dark about 2 hours in, and I don't mean dark as in mood, I mean dark as I can't see where I'm going, which I'm assuming was meant as an atmospheric component, but in reality just becomes incredibly annoying.

												At first I really enjoyed this game, having loved every moment of portal this game seemed really promissing and fun. That was until the game started to introduce more physics elements. The second level with cables was more frustrating than fun since I knew the solution to the ""puzzle"" (as an introduction level it was quite easy) but I could not get the cursed cable to get enough momentum. It worked after repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again and that was not how I want a puzzle game to be, it should be challenging not sheer frustration. Another example is a magnet puzzle in Sector 6 where you just have to move cubes by attracting them to different magnets. I have tried that one a couple of times now, the solution is easy and would work but one cube always glitches and hops around rendering the physics puzzle unsolvable since the physics don't work.Edit: After my fourth restart it worked and didn't glitch anymore - yet it was still frustrating and I would give it a mixed raiting since the game is nice for it self but I don't want to be frustrated by a game like this.

												Q.U.B.E is like a cookie, being that it's small and short-lived, but also delicious and something you want to relish. Essentially a first-person split between story and puzzles, Q.U.B.E is an easy recommendation for fans of the Portal series. The Bad Puzzles lack difficulty for the first 3/4 of the game - difficulty scaling simply doesn't ramp high enough to meet the player's level of progression. Each stage has potential to test the players problem-solving abilities, but this potential goes untapped until the last leg of gameplay. On the flipside, the easiness allows story developments to unfold rather quickly, which I was actually greatful for. Oh, and achievements are also nightmarish. The Good Enjoyable, memorable story. I particularly enjoyed the game's end-quote which captures the scene - and overall experience - perfectly. Beyond being an enjoyable passtime, this game offers a lesson on choices and what they mean to us as individuals and as human beings. I have little doubt the developers borrowed ideas from Cube, a cult film with similar themes, however this title still stands on its own. Beyond that, Q.U.B.E offers extra content in the form of time trials, and it's final few stages in the campaign are more memorable than earlier ones. In all, I enjoyed this game wholly and would recommend it to casual players and puzzle-gamers alike.			"

												Whenever this game is worth buying or not depends, pretty much, solely on the fact, whenever you get the original version of the game or not. I'm saying that because Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut is probably the worst developers' spent time and money I can think of in gaming history of remakes and rereleases. What we had was a really nice, chill and clever first person puzzle game, with very distinct look, complete lack of narrative (but a lot of environmental narrative, which left all to your imagination) and beautiful soundtrack. There was also a DLC pack released, which decided that it would be smart to remove the ""chill"" part from the gameplay, and I personally could never get into it. Then, for some reason beyond my understanding, developers decided that having no narrative and great soundtrack is bad, so a lot of time and effort was spent on creating Director's Cut, which undermines some of the better things about the original game.At it's core, the game is pretty much exactly the same, down to me getting slightly stuck in the same place of one secret area in the original and the re-release. Two new simple and not very exciting optional puzzles have been added and one really tough puzzle near the end of the game was removed. A lot of people, including me, didn't like that puzzle, even though the concept behind it was cool, but, thankfuly, the simpler puzzle with the same concept is still in the game. Controls and interface are almost identical, with the biggest and weirdest change being, that instead of three separate audio sliders in the options, there's only one now. Which is especially strange, given that you'd expect there to be an additional fourth one instead - for voice. But then again - developers didn't consider including subtitles into the game, despite making such emphasis on the added narration.And the narration is the weakest point of the entire re-release. Original game, if you need a comparison, reminded me more of Kairo and Antichamber, rather than Portal, with which Q.U.B.E. was often compared (to be fair, those game were released after Q.U.B.E., so no suprise there). As such, it felt like the game was telling the story, without actually *telling* the story. It could slightly break the forth wall, and it would be fine, but then it could constantly evoke feelings of being in an cold and alien environment alone, and it would make the experience special. What added narration tries to do - is *say* the exact same things the game *implied* in the original version. There are two problems with that - 1. The story they try to tell makes no sense in relation with what you do in the game. They try to even mock that with narration itself, but that only shows how they knew it doesn't work and still left it like this. 2. The narration as a whole is not very well written. There are several bits of dialogue (well, monologue, actually) that were written and voice acted in a fantastic and emotional way, but as a whole, it's just crap. It also doesn't help, when the script tries to reverse evoke some parts of Portal 1, and what's probably stupidest thing of all, is the final ""today we learned that"" speech, during the moment, which felt really grand and exciting in the silence of the original version of the game, and here just falls flat due to how cheesy and stupid all of that sounds.Sadly, to fit the tone of the narration, music was also changed. Where it was really nice and fit the mood of puzzle solving in the original, here it tries to follow the narration and, as such, at best feels okay, at worst feels annoying and doesn't fit the gameplay at all. The final parts of the game, for example, feature harder puzzles, which might take some time to figure out, but the music in the rerelease tries to do the ""you have to fight for the future of mankind"" kind of music, reminiscent of some parts of Mass Effect 3 soundtrack. Which feels like the game being ""come on, figure the puzzle out already!"", which is more annoying than anything, as I've said.So, since you can't get the original anymore, it would be nice to get it while buying this version. And playing the original, instead of this Director's Cut. If not... Well, the gameplay is still very good, of course, but narration and music make it a lot less enjoyable.			"

If you have a fix please respond I have investigated google and there are multiple posts regarding the broken head tracking. "

												This game has some interesting ideas and tries to give the player a good puzzle-solving environment with series of rooms per chapter. Unfortunately, the ""progression"" it shows you are just linear stepping stones towards the end of the game.The puzzles seem to make an effort at being difficult but end up just being tedious and frustrating. Completing one never feels rewarding and instead leads to more frustration because it turns out it took a couple extra minutes to solve because you were looking at something from the wrong literal angle. When they have you do the poorly-physics-based puzzles with the damned green marble... God help you.The only time it really mixes anything up is in the fifth series where you have to solve problems in the dark. None of the usually-vibrant blocks are lit up by default and instead you have to click on buttons that will make them light up. Since you can do this at-will but can only have one lit up at a time, it takes recycled early puzzles but makes it take /maybe/ a full minute extra to finish them. There are a couple hidden extra puzzles which are mildly fun and were a nice distraction from the rest of the game, but if you need a distraction while you're playing a game there's most likely something wrong with that game.Basically, this game is Portal without the portals, with a not-really-GLaDOS narrating the game, culminating in  another ""the puzzles are broken, now you're 'behind the scenes'"" twist in gameplay. I picked it up in the Humble Freedom Bundle and really wanted to really want to finish it, but it doesn't scratch any puzzle-solving or story related itches so I doubt that I ever will.			"

												Q.U.B.E. is an excellent first person puzzle game, and this Director's Cut is a great excuse to play through it again. The basic gist of the game is that you have a pair of gloves that allow you push and pull blocks in and out of the walls of the strange location you are in. The game adds new mechanics throughout the experience to keep things fresh, and the puzzles are consistantly excellent. If you enjoy first-person physics puzzle games such as Portal and Quantum Conundrum, you'll undoubtedly like this. The Director's cut adds the previously released time trial DLC, and adds a storyline to the main campaign (the original Q.U.B.E. didn't have any kind of plot). The new story isn't anything earth-shattering, but it is interesting and the voice acting is very well done, so it's a pleasant addition to the game. In terms of gameplay differences, I believe they changed one or two of the harder puzzles (there was one I remember being extremely frustrated with in the original, but I didn't come across it in the director's cut), but it's mostly the same. Overall, this game comes highly reccomended for any fan of puzzle games.			"

I won't say more.Now, the new soundtrack:A new soundtrack, completly redone, that fit really well to the story and the atmosphere of the game.It might be just a bit... but trust me, I had a whole other idea in my head with the first one, and what appear to be the true story is way better that my idea was.

												The original Q.U.B.E is one of my favorite puzzle games, and the only criticism I had with it was that a couple of the puzzles were disproportionately hard; one so much so that even when watching a walkthrough alongside it I couldn't get the timing right and so never actually completed the game, getting so frustrated that I had to watch a playthrough just to see how it ended.When I saw that there was a Director's Cut in my steam list I was a little excited because I imagined they might have balanced these puzzles a bit and maybe I could complete it myself this time? So I eagerly fired it up, but oh no. Ohhh noooo. It's like they had a competition to fit as many bad storytelling tropes as they could into a game that *doesn't have a story*. Now there's a poorly-acted disembodied voice in your ear telling you what to do. You have amnesiea. You've very important. Follow their instructions. Oh, and did I mention that they SPOIL THE ENDING WITHIN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THE GAME. I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would have thought this was an okay thing to do. It's a horrible and unecesscary perversion to what was very nearly a perfect little game. Play the original, it's fantastic (right up to a point) but give this version of it a wide berth unless you're interested in a good example of how not to handle exposition.			"

												Interesting game - until I got to Sector 6. A certain puzzle was literally impossible there (at least for me). You have to move some ""things"" via magnets, but the game keeps bugging out - some the ""things"" sometimes move on their own, get stuck in a wall and bounce out randomly... good luck arranging them correctly like that.If it wasn't for that, I'd probably recommend it, but well... literally unplayabe uncompletable.

												If you're debating whether to play this or the original, they're both fantastic games. The main difference in this one is a new soundtrack and a story. If you're only playing it for the puzzles, the original might be a better choice.*STORY SPOILERS AHEAD*I liked the story at first, but it was obvious that it was somewhat shoehorned in, as there are a large amount of inconsistancies. The man Jonathon Burns managed to convince me that I was underground, as he actually made some good points as far as the symbols on the walls being recognisably human, and there being no windows. I was actually looking for something else to do other than take the escape pod at the end. It seems a shame that his paranoia actually made more sense than the rest of the game. Now that he is pointing these thing out, we can't dismiss is as ""video game logic"", they now become serious flaws in the game's story. *END SPOILERS*With that being said, the delivery of the story is well done. Both of the main voice actors did there jobs very well, and the writing was spot on as well. It's almost like they set up this story to fail, as if they had spent a little more time on it ironing out inconsistancies, maybe making an alternate ending, it would have been a really great game. In it's current form though, I would recommend the original over this one, but both can certainly be enjoyed for the puzzles.			"

												So what's different about the Director's Cut?  Well, it has a narrative now.  Instead of the calm and isolated atmosphere, there's a tacked on narrative that reduces it to a panic.  It may be interesting to listen to the cliché drama on a second playthrough of the game, but it's nothing special.  Get the original version, it's a much more meaningful experience over there.			"

												As a fan of Portal and Portal 2 I was looking forward to this game as more first person puzzles.  However this game is no Portal.  The narrator has none of GLADOS's charm, the story (The game takes place in some sort of asteroid hurtling toward Earth and the PC has amnesia apearently) is just pain-inducing awful, to the point where I muted the narrator even at the cost of potentially missing vital clues just to make it stop.  The puzzles start out fine, but halfway through you get into a lot of rolling ball puzzles that require precise timing that the controls just don't support well enough.  Overall, the ""pile of shifting white cubes"" loses its appeal very quickly and you are left with a very very bland environment.  I'm having a hard time believing it myself, but I really dislike this game despite the fact that it should have been right up my alley.  When the puzzles stop being fun AND the story isn't engaging, you have a complete failure of a puzzle game.			"

There is a narrative which is entertaining, though I wish the 'decision' at the end really was in the hands of the player. The controls are good, the puzzles are varied and will make you think. It's a good way to kill an afternoon.			"

												Lends too much importance to exact timing for a puzzle game. In my eyes there's nothing more frustrating in a puzzle game than to know the exact solution to a level or section but then to fail repeatedly on getting the very precise timing wrong again and again. (A.K.A. the Lemmings syndrome)A very minimalistic aestetics which is somewhat pleasing to the eye at first ends up confining the player more than comforting them. Games like NaissanceE or Antichamber pulled off the minimalism a lot better and actually provided something like an engrossing atmosphere.In terms of vague story relation. the movie The Cube wants to spring to mind very hard here. (Partial) Amnesia of the protagonists, the uncertainty of the location of the Cube (space? underground?) and the purpose of people waking up in that construction (being test subjects, etc.) are recurrent themes compared to the game. The rest is rather obviously a love-letter to games like Portal. While not bad in and by itself, the game doesn't really compare which makes it a tasteless move in my eyes.Throw in some very unresponsive controls (controlling the blocks -see other reviews for gameplay details) into the mix and a story that is on the far side of reminiscient to something like Portal or the aformentioned movie, which ultimately ends up in cookie cutter land and you got something actually promising, but partially very frustrating, partially bland and frankly, not very fun to play.

												Throughout the game, I couldn’t help but think of Portal.   They’re both first person puzzlers in a white washed testing facility where things aren’t quite what they seem.  Unfortunately, for Q.U.B.E, the comparison isn’t a flattering one.  The art design is less sleek, the puzzles are less engaging, and the story line is less interesting and feels contrived.  For a game released seven years later, it feels like one large step back.			"

												I do not want to recommend this game, but unfortunately, the original Q.U.B.E. is not available anymore.However, I am recommending it because it has enough of the original in it to still be worthwhile. The mechanics are the same, most of the areas are the same, and they even added a couple new areas. The block extrusion mechanic makes for some rigid (yet still thought provoking) puzzles, that have a decent amount of variety to them. A lot of the environment is very reminiscient of Portal, but it does still have its own feel, and the way the facility operates is certainly unique.The narration, though (The main focus of the Director's Cut) is cringe-worthy. It is as cliched as possible (You have amnesia, your communications are out, you're on a mission to save the world), with plenty of cheesy one-liners. The story is flat, incredibly direct, and offers very few moments of mystery. It very rarely gives you reason to care for the characters, and emotional scenes are thrown in abruptly, for the sake of emotion.While the original version slowly unfolded the story in pieces as you explored your environment, and left everything open, this version just throws exposition at you around every corner. It even takes the ultimate reveal at the end of the original, and makes it common knowledge, presented to you at the very beginning.I do not want to recommend this game. If the original was still for sale, I would recommend that instead. But this game still contains the Q.U.B.E. experience, and it comes bundled with the DLC, so that's nice. Just try to block out the narration.			"

												If you're at all a fan of the first Q.U.B.E game, you will probably find the narration and story telling to be a great addition to the experience. Like others have said, this probably could have been added as (free) dlc, but I actually ended up getting this game for free since I owned the first one. When I originally played the first one, I felt like something was missing from the game since there was a distictive lack of context. The addition of story telling to this version definitely made it better and definintely added closure to the whole experience. If you don't have it yet and are interested, try to nab it on sale or even at full price. I haven't even touched the included DLC yet!			"

												I'm sorry to say I don't recommend this game. It's too conflicting to be a solid project. The puzzles and the story aren't connected at all. The story is interesting, but not fleshed out enough, and no answers are given. I'm usually ok with non-endings in anime, but in this situation it didn't work. It's the laughable the game has achievements for 50 and 500 times game plays. The story is so unbelievably shallow there's nothing to miss. only 5% of the puzzles were any fun, gravity magnet and roomshifting were great, but the rest of them just aren't compelling enough to repeat.I got this game from♥♥♥♥♥just after the free keys were released- if you want this game, don't pay more than $2.00 for it.Even on sale, I don't recommend. This isn't a spoiler: I'd rather have seen a game about the male you converse with.			"

												If you love portal, then you'll probably considerabally at least enjoy Q.U.B.E! The first time I saw this was actually on a video called ""First 5 minutes of portal 3"" it was literally just this game, and a lot of people seemed to believe that video at the time... Anyway, the game is great! The puzzles are really challenging but can sometimes be a little too hard. However simple the graphics are really good and it looks really sharp and crisp later on in the game, overall its a great game for the same reason as portal - to play when your alone and bored. Anyway, pick up this game! Its definitly worth a try! Especially during steam sales!			"

This would be a fairly fresh first-person puzzle game, if it weren't so darn close to the iconic Portal series. It just doesn't bring anything all that new to the scene. The manipulation of blocks with your hands is fun for a bit, but doesn't have me itching to play more. While Portal was gravity-based logic puzzles, this is more traditional move-this-block-there puzzles.The dialogue is also horrible - it actually made me play with the sound off. It seems that this was built for a VR headset, which might be cool, but I don't have one at the moment.I also found it feeling 'cheap' (for lack of a better word) with the clash of the constant white background with the neon colored blocks. At the end of the day, it just reminds me of Portal, and why I shouldn't be achievement hunting or replaying those games.I got it in a bundle, so I can't complain too much, but I certainly wouldn't tell a friend to blow ten bucks on it.

												This is the weakest portal-like game I've played.It 's ugly, controls feel sluggish and the story is garbage. I have to give some credit for music though, which fits in well for a puzzle game. I could forgive the shortcomings if gameplay was any good. Which wasn't, but let me say why.The game's basic mechanics are simple and lackluster. They don't offer much creative space for interesting levels. You see the three interactions there are and you've seen it all.PlaytroughThe game seems to realize that because it follows with a long phase of physics-based puzzles. The solutions are obvious, you just need to time your button presses correctly to progress. Annoyingly, to press the buttons you have to turn away from the action as they are on walls behind you. Makes you appreciate how elegantly this was solved in Portal.After winning your battle with physics you proceed to the next area with lasers. These ""puzzles"" are extremely easy. You just choose which of the two way the laser should face, left or right. If the solution wasn't obvious enough it's very easy to brute-force your way through.This is followed by a story-intensive with more physics-based puzzles. After this you enter a giant room with another huge physics puzzle. I looked at it played with it a little, randomly found a solution, but then one of the cubes pushed the other away and I would have to reset. This is where I stopped playing. (stage 6 out of 9)ConclusionYou can disregard my opinion thinking that maybe the devs saved the best puzzles for the end However, I doubt that. I can tell you, I don't like this game. I don't recommend it to anyone. It's over-reliance on physics-based puzzles and lacking complexity make it an unrewarding and frustrating experience. You'd be better off playing Portal, Witness or AnteChamber if you haven't yet.			"

												Not a bad little game, still finished in under 3 hours with no help, fairly similar to Portal 1 but not quite on the same level. Not really sure why the Director's Cut needed to be an entirely separate game but unless you happen to have an Oculus Rift or you really want a little story/end game content (some kind of speedrun or time trial thing which I have not tried out) you can probably save a few bucks and go for the regular edition without really sacrificing anything worthwhile. Decent way to spend an afternoon but not a whole lot more.			"

												The gameplay is very good. The game is well-paced. It doesn't throw too much at you with each new mechanic as you progress. It gradually builds you up. The puzzles get progressively harder as you keep playing. Have to think with cubes.I heard the original Q.U.B.E. didn't have a story or the DLC. The director's cut has it. The story is interesting enough. It definitely made me want to keep going.It does the opposite of Portal and you don't die at the end as one of the voices claims.I recommend it, but during a sale or something because the main campaign isn't very long. If you are just that curious regardless of a sale, it might be worth the $10 default asking price.			"

												This game isn't bad. I'm not a big puzzle game fan, and never played the portal games. This game is literally only puzzles, theres really not even much in the way of platforming. You spend the entire game solving puzzles with cubes. You can manipulate different colored cubes in their specified ways. You spend the entire game in white cube levels made of a bunch of cubes (get it?). The game does a good job introducing new mechanics and ramping up difficulty. Later harder puzzles may require a walkthrough, but most won't. The story doesn't really make sense, the mystery is interesting, but for how dramatic it is, its pretty stupid how the world supposedly rests on you solving some cube puzzles for no reason, so it makes it all unbelievebale. The game is super short, around 2-3 hours. The problem is its quite repetitive. There are some cool visuals with the cubes in certain rooms spinning, but for the most part every area looks the exact same. You manipulate the 4-5 same color cube shapes every level. Theres not multiple solutions, just the one allowed by the game. It all just starts to feel monotenous. It would have been nice if more platforming were in the game, or if other puzzles didn't only just feature the same 4 colored cubes. The stuff with wires was pretty interesting, more fresh ideas like that would be appreciated.This game is close to a recommendation, but the lack of variety, boring level and world design, and ridiculous story, make it a puzzle game that just doesn't quite cut it. 6/10.

												When I think of every puzzle game I've played on Steam recently, I realize that this game, unlike them, can't boast anything unique or innovative. The main puzzle elements and gimmicks are not remotely new. The plot is a retread of ground over which we've already built a four-lane highway, you know exactly how it's going to play out literally the second you hear the second person talk.Atmosphere is desperately trying to rip off Portal 1 and 2, minus the dialog, and mostly without success. In a few places (ie the parts with blue blocks at the bottom of ramps) it's so blatant it's distracting. Pacing is also bad; there's many parts where you have to wait on slow elevators for no reason.The puzzles are good I geuss, or at least some of the ones near the end are good and the progression of how it introduces new stuff is handled well. But the game's also terribly short. Steam says I only played for 2 hours and I beat the story and 2 hidden bonus puzzles, and since there's no medals, collectibles or rankings in the main game (outside the DLC racing side-levels) it has 0 replayability. I've described games as ""short"" which were more than twice this long and had better reasons to revisit the levels to boot.Oh, and in the lasers+mirrors puzzles they literally didn't program in mirror behavior for anything but the correct solutions, which is baffling.Pretty much the only thing it has going for it is the graphics, which are great for an indie game. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this.			"

												To sum this game up, it's a less comedic Portal 2, if they went with that previously planned F-Stop mechanic instead of portals.  Go ahead and pick it up on sale, it has a nice minimalist art style and the mechanics are very solid.  It doesn't quite stump you like you'd expect from this kind of game, but it's still a nice First-Person Puzzler that takes a lot of notes from the Portal franchise.			"

												Pretty unspired and overrated. Puzzles are mostly straight forward, and you can just muddle your way through most of them. Rarely got that nice ""puzzlegasm"" you get on a good puzzle game when you are mid-puzzle and the penny drops and you realize your current approach is all wrong, and that there's a whole other aspect to the puzzle. A well designed puzzle has a journey - from confusion, experimenting, semi-understanding, more experiementing, full-understanding. There was hardly any of that. Often I felt disappointed to solve a puzzle - I was overcome with a sense of ""Oh, was that it?"".Buggy in parts, you and blocks can stick to walls at times.Never played the original. Story wasn't particularly engaging. Ending was horrible. Spoiler:  Either give me the choice to not enter the pod,  or just let me plunge to my death in the incinerator for a nice dark ending. My heart sank when the cheesy cut scene with your wife and the president began. "

												I stopped playing as soon as the game decided to throw one level after another, and both were basically the EXACT same puzzle, except making a rolling ball turn more colors than the previous level.If you can't make each puzzle unique, then you're not worth my time. I don't need remixed levels for the devs trying to fill some type of gameplay hours quota, or level quota. That's not fun.Many levels are not ""puzzles"" either, they are more skill based. Like rotate this part of the map, at the right time, to get the ball to move to the other side that it's currently rolling down, then make it change color, then make it roll into the proper colored area. The whole level is designed to be quick, use skill, and is VERY repetative, until you get it right.If that's what you're looking for, great. You might enjoy this game, but if you are looking strickly for a PUZZLE game, that is not based on time, and once the puzzle clicks in your head, you can easily solve it, then you won't like this game. It has lots of ""puzzles"", that even though you know how to solve it, it's still a skill-based challenge to actually complete the method in which the developers have setup to finish it.

												A great experience, though awfully short. The game presents pleasantly sterile puzzling environments, while still succesfully introducing a plot and some story development to the player. The dialogue is very well written, and the little nudges to cause the player to think about the scenario a little bit are welcome and often provide a great base for further thought, beyond the game's scope. Throughout the game, little bits of information are fed to the player at regular intervals, but they provide more questions instead of answering them and serve to build up to a powerful conclusion, without becoming boring on the way. The puzzle mechanics are nice and mostly function correctly, although they're not very complex and might quickly become boring to puzzling enthusiasts. In addition, the sphere-based puzzles leave quite a lot of consistency to be desired. Any additional difficulties or factors are properly introduced and the player is quickly made familiar with them, making for a smooth playthrough without entirely being stuck on a new mechanic. Q.U.B.E.'s soundtrack acts as the atmospheric centerpiece of the game and perfectly accentuates the dialogue and the plot's setting, taking the player into a harmonic, yet isolated world all by itself. Ranging from smooth ambient soundscapes to rough, but continuous drone-like backgrounds, this game's score not only fuels its amazing atmosphere, but also makes for a great puzzling experience, both inside of the game and outside of it. With the right tracks for the right mood, Q.U.B.E's soundtrack is great for studying, work, or even more puzzling. Overall, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone with even a slight interest in first-person puzzlers, or games that require thinking in general. My favorite parts of the game, in no particular order: The note from the protagonist to himself, in order to regain memory  The woman's story about her encounter with insanity during isolation  Puzzling in the dark  The constant feeling of being torn apart between both versions of the story Most, if not all of the soundtrack "

												Portal comparisons must be made: It is a series of puzzle based rooms that may or may not be test chambers all from the first person perspective as a mystery is slowly unravelled as you go. Portal portal PORTAL! Besides the obvious comparison this is not a bad little game.In Q.U.B.E. you have a pair of magical-science gloves that can manipulate a series of coloured cubes with various different properties e.g. red cubes just extend out as platforms, yellow cubes a series of three platforms, blue launching anything that touches it etc... While this may sound greatly varied they are, for better or worse, mostly just variants on platforms. As the game progresses more interesting items appear such as coloured balls that need depositing in pits, rotating rooms, rooms with lightswitches (more interesting then it sounds) and the ability to change cubes to whatever colour you choose.Despite all these fun sounding mechanics, the game is visually a very sterile white consistently. While Portal was mostly sterile, there were moments where you had variations in the chamber and moments where you could go behind the chambers, in Q.U.B.E. it remains almost exclusively cold white rooms. Late in the game things break up a little , but not to a great extent.The Director's Cut version adds both a narration via two characters talking to you via a radio, never fully being seen in game, and also changes some of the chambers layouts around. The naration helps to a degree as, with the first version, I found myself getting bored of the repetative rooms with no context. While it can be seen as a boon, it almost instantly breaks the late game twists by telling you right away what is going on, though it does provide a nice conflict for the player that is only answered at the end of the game.A recommendation for a rainy day as (I'M MENTIONING PORTAL AGAIN) with the first Portal game it is very short. Grab it when on offer or when it hits an indie bundle. "

												Feels like a low budget Portal. Which doesn't mean low quality. The graphics are very simple, but still nice to look at and the game runs perfectly smooth even on older systems with maxed settings and AA/AF. There is a story, but it's just some audio recordings playing in the background that don't really have much to do with the gameplay itself.The gameplay is varied, the puzzles are usually fun to solve and the mechanics are usually well thought out. Usually? Yes, because some puzzles are extremely frustrating and no fun at all. That's the biggest problem I have with the game, there are some puzzles in sector 6 that are super annoying to solve. I didn't finish the game because of these puzzles and if you look at the achievements I'm probably not the only one having this problem - only half of the people who made it through sector 5 also made it through 6.Seems like the game has 7 sectors, so it doesn't seem to be very long (I made it halfway through sector 6 within 2 hours). I can still recommend it if you can get it while it's on sale.			"

Well worth a play, and don't hesitate if you see this on sale!			"

												Qube is a surprising good game, it is very much a portal clone in that is a first person puzzler where you enter rooms and must use several typical mechanics to advance to the next room where a new puzzle awaits. Ofcourse Qube doesn’t use portals but qubes which can be manipulated depending on their colour. It’s either a jump qube, or one that can extend or form a staircase and so on.The similarities with portal don’t end there, you start the game not knowing what is going on or how you got there. It becomes more clear as you advance through the game. There is also a voice talking to you, and as you progress the rooms tend to fall apart/malfunction. I’m sure you get the picture on how much this game takes from Portal, however it doesn’t mean it is a bad game or a boring story. It’s all different enough to keep you interested, even the story keeps you wondering what is going on until the end. Though I must say the ending felt like a rushed job.I can’t say a bad thing about the graphics, they are just fine, but ofcourse nothing special either, just executed well within the set premise. The sound effects and music are minimal, but fitting and do their job well enough to emerge you into the qube-world.If you want a very decent Portal clone, this is the game to get.Plays without a hitch in Linux/SteamOS and it is a joy to play with the Steam controller. Streaming to the Steam link is equally trouble free.			"

												3/10The puzzles are pretty but not the most challenging or fun, but i legitimately think i spent 1/3 of my game time solving puzzles and the other 2/3 walking through hallways and sitting on elevators to get to said puzzles. There isn't a sprint button so you can't go fast even if you want to. During the downtime the game gives the usual ""you have amnesia"" storyline that I personally found extremely boring. In closing, this puzzle game is more story than puzzle and the story is unimaginative and dull.			"

												Picked this up in a humble bundle, haven't played it without the director's bit.It didn't take me nearly as long as my playtime to actually finish it. I made lunch with the game paused.This game, mechanically, is great. (with a caveat)This game, narratively, is horrid.Since I care about mechanics more, it gets a blue thumb.The puzzles make sense and are really well done. Every puzzle element does exactly what you'd think it does... Well, except for the lasers. The developers seem to not know how color works. Seriously. I don't even begin to know how that was supposed to make sense.That section is really short, though, and generally it's not even possible to get the laser to the target without it being the right color by the end, so whatever.Narratively... I just wanted everyone to shut up. There were long sections of hallways or elevators that only existed to let the voiceover voiceover. If the story had been ""You're in a box doing puzzles! Have fun!"" I would've been plenty happy. I did not need some lady yapping about my amnesiatic player character that I don't care about while I ride down a painfully slow elevator to let her do it.I can see where the comparisons to Portal come in. Puzzle-wise they have the same effect. The game is over 80% tutorial, and every new puzzle element is immediately understandable and interesting. Story-wise, though? Portal has an excuse plot with a backbone made of humor. It didn't matter if I cared about Chell. This one's trying to be deep, and it doesn't work because it's entirely dependent on making the player care about... whoever the hell the player character is. I forgot. 9/10 Puzzles (For a game that uses color so much, not knowing how they combine is inexcusable Yes, I know they're working with the subtractive color system. No, that isn't how lasers work.)0/10 StorySince my fix to the story would be taking it out... I don't really care that much about it. Have a blue thumb!			"

												Well here goes.First impression: Looks like a cool puzzle game.Second impression (after playing for a bit): It is a cool puzzle game. The movement is jerky, though. Maybe not jerky, but not smooth and precise. Third impression (after more gametime): This game needs improvements. A console. A duck option. A quick save and quick load options. The story so far has been close to zero (but acceptable for a puzzle game).A day passed by.Next day: Loaded up my game. Clicked resume and to my surpise I was thrown back to almost very beginning. That just ruined it for me. I was not going to go all through that again. Not now.Deleted the game. I give it a thumbs up, tho. It could be a fun one time experience.

The biggest difference (that I can tell) is THEY ADDED A VOICEOVER. And while I'm all for the creepy silence of regular QUBE this added a whole new feel to the game. QUBE: creepy block world in the middle of space? check. Cool spirit hand gloves that let you move things with your hands? check. glow in the dark mystery as to why you're in the middle of a block world? check. BUT NOW WITH ADDED CREEPY RADIO TRANSMISSIONS AS YOU GO ALONG?!

												Yeah, the game is short, but each new puzzle has a fresh mechanic never encountered before, and that's what really struck me. The story was decent, but as one of the reviews said, it should've had multiple endings. The puzzles are mind-boggling, BUT not difficult to the point of insanity. (my most difficult puzzle took me 30-45 mins to figure out, combined in multiple sessions of playing). The bugs though...you'll probably encounter your character being stuck and tapping indefinitely in one place, the blocks can sometimes bug out (one time it almost cost me the solution to the puzzle, I had to step on the block to prevent it from bugging out and disappearing into the floor).Overall, 9/10, would recommend.+unique mechanics and difficult puzzles+simplistic environment+great soundtrack+interesting story-bugs			"

The only real critique that I have is how after the main story ends you’re left with a speed running mode, which personally isn't my sorta thing. "

												I enjoyed this game and played it all the way through in two sittings. It very much has a Portal 1 feel to it in both storytelling and aesthetics. On aesthetics: cubes everywhere! Cube walls, cube lifts, cube lights, broken bits of cubes, all the cubes. At one point there is a pillar that is a cylinder, it gives you a new gameplay mechanic which is exciting, but I found myself suddenly confused by the cylindrical column trying to work out if there was more of a hidden meaning behind it as it wasn't a cube.I found the puzzles were at just the right difficulty, with some just being deeply infuriating rather than hard to solve. But these were few enough to be bearable and actually did increase the satisfaction of completion. The puzzles themselves introduced new elements and variations in each zone keeping things fresh. The puzzles were not done to death, and thinking back I find myself wishing that there were more of a certain type of puzzle rather than being annoyed because it's ""another one of these ones""I actually quite enjoyed the story; it was pretty un-intrusive and nicely tied the puzzles together. And I thought that the ambient music did a really good job of adding suspense and uncertainty. I really couldn't quite decide what the truth really was, which I suspect was the point, and I changed my mind more than one or two times  I would've liked to have had a choice of who to believe at the ending though. And the bit about you writing a letter to yourself was a little strange. There were some pretty long corridors and lift journeys carefully placed so that long monologue could be played whilst not doing puzzles, unfortunately I spent some of that time looking for hidden doors which did leave me to walk them in silence quite a lot. Technically, my aging computer handled the game quite well, although the mouse was a little jumpy on the menu & pause screens, and my computer certainly struggled in the final sequences. I also found that the transition from the play and the ""cutsceans"" was not particularly smooth, and was noticeable. At one point I was all ready to be super smug about finding a broken bit of texturing only to turn around and discover that this was in fact a secrete puzzle and it was supposed to be like that. I'm not sure if I liked that or not, but I happily got frustrated with all the puzzles, so all good.All in all great fun puzzle game. I will now be playing the speedruns to try and get all the medals.			"

Religious Propaganda with a Side of PuzzlesUltimately, the driving force in Q.U.B.E is its narrative, which tries to hold your attention between gaps where thinking is actually involved.GameplayFirst thing's first: The core game is short.  Like under 2 hours short.  No doubt there are some speed runs out there that drastically cut that time even further.  But my first foray through the game was done in under 120 minutes, and that included exploring the environment and planning out how to do the puzzles.The puzzles themselves are for the most part pretty easy to figure out.  There is a nice gimmick where you do one section in the dark, but those puzzles are actually rather rudimentary, the challenge being that you can't see until you light up each element.  Then there is the game's self described ""hardest puzzle"" which is really only difficult because it requires precise finagling to get the pieces in the exact right spot needed to complete the puzzle.  That, unfortunately, is a reoccurring theme with many of the puzzles, their solutions may be simple, but getting the timing just right can be a bother when there are moving elements that need to be relocated at precise moments.  While annoying, they aren't particularly difficult unless you have slow reflexes.StoryThere is an overarching theme in the narrative between the two supporting characters and the player about faith.  There is also the illusion of having a choice, which can bring about a disappointing conclusion for some players as there is only one ending to the game.  This ending further hammers on the point about having faith.  There is also something of a personal redemption story, though it is weak at best, with regards to the player doing something good after doing something bad, of which the bad is only talked about and never experienced first hand.  There are a few other religious overtones, mainly christian, but don't try to find anything too deep in the narrative, because it's frankly not there.PresentationQ.U.B.E runs on the Unreal Engine, and it's hard to mess that up.  There are very few load times, and they are generally hidden behind room transitions.  The graphics are nice, but with very few art assets, don't expect much in the way of a change in scenery.  The audio is fine, and while there is a soundtrack, it takes backseat and is really only noticeable during story beats or cutscenes.OverallPeople are going to play this for the puzzles, and sadly they're just not there. Nothing is going to make your head scratch, but at the same time there isn't much that is really unfair either.  One glaring issue, is that many of the later puzzles come with an ""undo"" button, which shows that not enough thought was put into preventing failure states for many of the challenges.If you're looking for something to challenge your creative thinking, you're going to have to look elsewhere.

												As far as Portal style games goes this one just doesn't really hold up, the puzzles are simple and boring and they do mix it up by adding a compltely no dynamic every once in awhile but not enough to give much variety. The story is extremely lackluster, Portal left you feeling like you had done something and beat someone, QUBE is just sort of a long question mark where you don't really care to know the answers.

												A short but fun indie game, quite similar to Portal but have far more difficult puzzles at times.If you're an achievement hunter (like me) BE WARNED, the achievements for the extra content, such as completing bonus levels with the minimum number of moves or beating the developers time on bonus levels are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, I have managed it and I celebrated so loud I woke up my whole village.There are also very grindy achievements like aquire 10,000 powerups, which I recommend working on last, and if you do please put on some music as it will be very repetitive and will turn you insane otherwise.I would recommend QUBE to any puzzle game fans, especially those who enjoyed the Portal series.

												The story is nonsensical and the there isn't enough variety in puzzles. It starts off promising but after a while the puzzles feel like a chore and are generally not rewarding upon completion. The last half of the game I was constantly checking the clock hoping I would reach the end soon. The visuals/setting can indeed be compared to that of Portal, however the puzzles and story are so unfulfilling that anyone who has played Portal would be left extremely disappointed if he were to expect something similar.

Religious Propaganda with a Side of PuzzlesUltimately, the driving force in Q.U.B.E is its narrative, which tries to hold your attention between gaps where thinking is actually involved.GameplayFirst thing's first: The core game is short.  Like under 2 hours short.  No doubt there are some speed runs out there that drastically cut that time even further.  But my first foray through the game was done in under 120 minutes, and that included exploring the environment and planning out how to do the puzzles.The puzzles themselves are for the most part pretty easy to figure out.  There is a nice gimmick where you do one section in the dark, but those puzzles are actually rather rudimentary, the challenge being that you can't see until you light up each element.  Then there is the game's self described ""hardest puzzle"" which is really only difficult because it requires precise finagling to get the pieces in the exact right spot needed to complete the puzzle.  That, unfortunately, is a reoccurring theme with many of the puzzles, their solutions may be simple, but getting the timing just right can be a bother when there are moving elements that need to be relocated at precise moments.  While annoying, they aren't particularly difficult unless you have slow reflexes.StoryThere is an overarching theme in the narrative between the two supporting characters and the player about faith.  There is also the illusion of having a choice, which can bring about a disappointing conclusion for some players as there is only one ending to the game.  This ending further hammers on the point about having faith.  There is also something of a personal redemption story, though it is weak at best, with regards to the player doing something good after doing something bad, of which the bad is only talked about and never experienced first hand.  There are a few other religious overtones, mainly christian, but don't try to find anything too deep in the narrative, because it's frankly not there.PresentationQ.U.B.E runs on the Unreal Engine, and it's hard to mess that up.  There are very few load times, and they are generally hidden behind room transitions.  The graphics are nice, but with very few art assets, don't expect much in the way of a change in scenery.  The audio is fine, and while there is a soundtrack, it takes backseat and is really only noticeable during story beats or cutscenes.OverallPeople are going to play this for the puzzles, and sadly they're just not there. Nothing is going to make your head scratch, but at the same time there isn't much that is really unfair either.  One glaring issue, is that many of the later puzzles come with an ""undo"" button, which shows that not enough thought was put into preventing failure states for many of the challenges.If you're looking for something to challenge your creative thinking, you're going to have to look elsewhere.http://store.steampowered.com/app/239430/ "

												Decent little game.  I enjoyed both the puzzles and the story.  The voice acting and visual style both impressed me.  Simple but polished.  Not quite on the level of Portal, but if you've played Portal and want more, this will likely suit your taste.The controls are a weak point.  I'm going to talk a little about that, and I don't want you to think this means I didn't like the game, because I did.In some parts, you have to aim very carefully (there's no auto-targetting help), fairly quickly, and the targetting reticle is often nearly invisible.  The shot cooldown is applied unnecessarily to all situations, including color-change targets which often need to be shot twice (shoot it once, click to shoot again, turn elsewhere, notice that your second shot didn't go through, turn back, find the first target...), so these parts of the game feel can very clunky and frustrating.  Jumping is never very good in a first-person game, and it's an annoyance here as well.  In particular, when you're standing on narrow platforms, and you have to walk toward where you're jumping, it does that FPS thing where walking into the wall at even a slight angle makes you slide along it.  Because of this, and because you can't see your feet, it's easy to accidentally walk off a platform, and also to miss your jump at a precipice.  At times you need to aim nearly straight up or straight down, and due to an overly simple polar coordinate control model the mouse control is very awkward at this; it makes sense, but doesn't feel natural or work well.The main story mode is not, by any means, an action game, so there's no real enjoyment in learning to skillfully and precisely control it.  It's a puzzle game, and fiddly controls just cause annoying blunders and waste your time.  The controls are better suited to the timed-run bonus levels, but in today's market full of cheap, good games, I don't think the bonus content is a good use of anyone's time.These things could be fixed with, I think, little effort, which makes them all the more grating in a project where so much was done with obvious attention to detail.

SummaryQ.U.B.E. is a fun puzzle game that aesthetically reminds me of Portal, but overall functions differently. I'd give it a 7/10, and would only recommend purchasing if it drops to 3 dollars or less. The game is ridiculously short, and it took me about 2 hours to beat (Left it running in the background for 1 hour while I did some stuff). It's a great game out of a bundle, and I'd comfortably purchase it at 2 dollars.Graphics-The sterile environments in Q.U.B.E. are immediately pleasing to the eye, and the first thing I honestly tried to do was shoot portals from my hands when I began the game. Every new puzzle element you unlock is very fun to look at, every chamber opens in a cool way that makes me feel like I'm in a gigantic Rubik's Cube. The lighting is done fantastically, and lights the mood pretty well from chamber to chamber.Sound-While the little beeps and boops aren't anything to write home about, they're spot on what they should be. The voice acting is actually done quite well, which impressed me. I'm not one for dramatic storylines in my puzzle games, but the actors were semi believable, especially towards the end. The only thing I'd wish they'd done differently is have a couple more sliders in the audio options. There's only a master volume slider for overall volume, which would be fine if they had normalized some of the dialog. It's not a huge problem, but you'll notice especially at the end of the game that the music is a little too loud and the dialog is a tad too soft. Overall nothing too worrisome, just my 2 cents.Story-Q.U.B.E. really tried its best to create a dramatic storyline where you are the hero, but all in all falls flat with the sheer absurdity of it. Don't get me wrong, the game's pretty fun, but at every moment that the story tries to reel you in, it immediately reminds you how ridiculous the whole ordeal is. Spoilers - You're in a gigantic puzzle cube hurling towards the Earth. By completing puzzles inside the cube, you break the cube and save the earth. The whole thing is ludicrous. Like the parts you break off wouldn't hurl like meteors into Earth's atmosphere. Like there would be a giant death cube in space with literally no origin story besides ""oh no, the giant death cube!"" The biggest issue I have with the game is the idea that they plant into your head that there are two endings. There are not two endings. You have 2 people in your ear at all times telling you that there are two options, and there just are not. There is a point at the very end of the game where you are to literally walk into something that completes the game, and there is someone telling you to do something else. When you try to listen to him, nothing happens. I even looked it up to see if I was being stupid, and I was not (this time). The whole thing is ridiculous. Spoilers- Especially the line, ""The president is on the line for you!"" I immediately thought ""no way, this is wrong. There's another option here that I'm missing.""Difficulty-I'm not a puzzle game connoisseur by any means. I immensely enjoyed both Portal games and the Talos Principle, but I do not actively seek puzzle games out. That being said, the puzzles in this game were pretty simple. Although a lot of the base concepts were pretty fun and unique, they were all pretty easy to breeze through. There were maybe two or three times where I had to sit and think hard about the solution, and the rest was pretty much ""ah, red here, blue here, green here"". I think that most of the difficulty actually came via the player's own mechanical capabilities rather than using your brain to get through the puzzles. Oftentimes, I immediately saw the solution, but had troubles trying to press the buttons fast enough to get it to work. It actually would not be that big of an issue if the buttons worked immediately when I pressed them. Sometimes the buttons would pop when I wanted them to, sometimes there was a tiny bit of lag that between my press and the actual event occuring, which is beyond infuriating. Either way, that artificial difficulty only delayed the game's completion by maybe 20-30 more minutes overall.I honestly feel that artificial difficulty is the way this game lasts as long as it does. It's not so much that the puzzles are super hard, it's just the tedium of trying to get everything to respond the way you want it to. Don't get me wrong, the game is NOT a laggy mess. It's done rather well, it just has a few minor issues that wear on you as you play. Beyond that, sometimes puzzles are just tedious to be tedious. Minor spoilers- For example, at the end of the game, you gain the ability to more or less ""make puzzles"". Now that in mind, the possibilities when solving a puzzle immediately become greater in number, or at least they SHOULD. But because the devs wanted you to solve the puzzles in a pretty specific way, it's hard to do what you want to do, even if it would normally work. Case in point, I wanted a ball to pop up into the air, hit the wall and bank shot off of it into the hole. But in this particular room, physics didn't work the way they should, and the ball refused to bank off the wall. All in all, I would recommend the game if you enjoy puzzles and have a couple hours to kill one day. Again, I can't recommend it at full price, but is a great value in a bundle.			"

												7/10 I would recommend it because the puzzles are really good. All of them actually made me stop and think about what I was doing, and not many games actually make one do that anymore. The story on the other hand is very straightforward, where they tried to throw in a twist, but it wasn't very well executed.  You have a woman that keeps on coming in and out of orbit that's apparently helping you (but actually isn't), then suddenly you have this guy telling you she's lying. All I wanna do is solve puzzles, and I have to put up with these two crazy loners arguing about nothing. No wonder they're in space alone. It's also a pretty game, in it's own cubey way, and I enjoyed the back ground music.			"

												It's a great puzzle game, in first person perspective. Think - Portal, but with out a portal gun. Think - 3D puzzles, but you're there, in the puzzle, and you have to try to work out how to get through each seperate puzzle room, to progress through a strange, clinical, constantly moving corridor (Think - the Staircases in Hogwarts) to get to the next puzzle chamber.You'll notice I use the word THINK quite a bit. That's because you have to use your thinky thing to progress through the game. There's a one way radio communication throughout the game, which outlines who you are(Because your memory is wiped) why you're there, and what you're doing. I'm offering NO spoilers, because I've only reached stage four, so I don't have all the answers for myself yet.The puzzles invold moving things, touching things, activating switches and using colour change devices to switch and blend colours. I hope you were paying attention in art classes.If you're into puzzles, this is a great game.Yes, I did get this game for free, but, because I enjoyed it so much, I bought it for a friend so that he may enjoy it as much as I did.

												Let's make this short:Pros:-Interesting mechanics and puzzle design- Story and voice acting is nice, though it's pretty obvious what is really going onCons:- Barely any graphic options- No seperate audio sliders- No Subtitles- Story is mostly told inbetween the puzzles. This wouldn't be an issue if the terrain was interesting to look at but most of the time you just stay put and wait in an elevator with nothing else going on or walk down a straight line in bland hallway. Telling the story while you are hammering your brain to solve a puzzle would've been more entertaining, this just causes a lot of boring downtime.- The puzzles tend to repeat itself quite heavily. Sure this is an aspect that can't be avoided but other games manage to make solving the same type of puzzles fun by changing the environment around, bringing a new visual or story aspect into it. QUBE sadly stays the same old boring white blocks most of the time.- There is some sort of artificial delay between beeing able to activate and deactivate blocks that drove me nuts. Quick and precise puzzle solving was made unnecessary slowSo would I recommend it?Pick it up in a sale, it's mostly entertaining and doesn't outstay it's welcome in the 2h it took me to beat itWould I play it again?I really wouldn't.

												Well, to be honest I liked the experience. Imagine portal-like puzzle game with a mistery feeling, a short story and very nice OST -that is the QUBE - reminded me somehow Moon 2112 with Sam Rockwell. Of cource it is indy but a good one and truly attractive.			"

												Personally I feel this is superior to the original on a few merits.1. The worst puzzle in the game is gone.2. The DLC is bundled with the main game, so it's a cheaper price for the same content.Otherwise, it realy is the same game. The main game I've discussed before but I'll talk about briefly; it's a competent enough Portal-clone with a variety of decent puzzle ideas but little in the way of originality, it uses standard puzzle logic and you'll have no problems figuring things out, it's on the easy side of things. Unlike Portal, Antichamber, etc. there's no original mechanics introduced, just... sliding blocks. Not that it's a bad thing! What it does, it does well, and some of the cube constructs look pretty neat.The narrative feels kind of forced into the game and some of it they actually had to add slow-moving elevators for, apparently, dragging out the puzzle-less sections even longer. Fortunately the narration also fills in what were previously dead sections and gives some context. There's an interesting theme of faith vs. doubt going on the whole way through but the issue is that, as Q.U.B.E. is a game with one ending, there's no real weight to it especially if you've played through the game before, because you know how it's going to end either way. I don't mind it and I don't have a preference between the lonely atmosphere of the original and the narrative of this version. It's fine.The DLC levels attempt to make the game more like a speedrunning game, while still retaining a lot of the elements from the main game. It becomes a puzzle to figure out how to get all the time-saving pickups and figuring out the fastest route through levels (or puzzling out the route that uses the least moves.) The levels all have some flavor to them and do really interesting things with the game's mechanics, I was pretty impressed by the level design.UNFORTUNATELY. The game's mechanic's also aren't very well suited to this kind of speedrunning thing. There is a pretty decent delay between any input you make, the base character speed is sluggish, and the cursor is tiny. One slight miss can completely destroy a speedrun attempt and it gets rather frustrating rather fast. Especially when it looks like you hit the powerup/block/switch you were aiming for (with the glow that appears showing right on an edge) but the game says you haven't. I think it would've been in their best interests to alter the mechanics slightly for the DLC, because the main game on its own is fine, and the DLC's content itself is fine, but the mechanical flaws of the main game don't suit the DLC levels very well.There's also the issue of having quite a number of grindy achievements that basically don't respect the player's time at all. Play 500 DLC levels? The shortest still takes some 40-50 seconds, so that would double my playtime just to do, practically. Walk 100000 meters? I only barely made 10% of that going for all the main achievements, I wouldn't dare imagine how long hitting 10000 would take; over 150 plays of the last level, I guess, which sounds like torture (and would also take some 2-2.5 minutes per run... also quite a lot of extra playtime. 10000 pickups? Again, I barely made 1000 going for all the main achievements. These kinds of achievements are pointless time-wasters not in the slightest worth grinding it out for, kind of irked that this will forever sit as unfinished simply because I refuse to waste that much time on this game.The problems are kinda nitpicks, yeah, but they matter to some people (like myself) and overall it's still a good game, though not a great one.

												Pretty good game, but fairly short. Most puzzles require thinking alone, but there are a couple of bits where you have to preplan and then use good timing to get it right.

												The game itself is a nice, but short, puzzler. The addition of the storyline (via voiceover only) for the Director's Cut is a nice option but in the end it doesn't really make any difference to the game itself.To those who like first person puzzlers, yes I recommend the game, but there's little point to get this if you already have the original and the Against the Qlock DLC, unless you want to know the story, like I did.Now as for the Developer, I have to say that I'm very disappointed.

												This was a very enjoyable puzzle game. The scenery may look a little bland, especially at first, but if you can get past that, you will find wonderful music, brilliant voice acting and headache-inducing puzzles. The game is rather short, but as they say, ""quality over quantity"".The story is very interesting too, and focuses on specific themes which give it a noticeably creepy and dark atmosphere. And while the story element of not remembering who you are etc is very overused these days, this is one of the better uses of it I have seen in a while.After you have completed the story there are time trials, which were very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed the Portal games, or any other good first person puzzle game.			"

												Loved the original Q. U. B. E., and when I found out there was a version with story, I said ""I don't want to play through it again, even if I never finished the original."" Eventually, I played  it a little. I've just gotten to the Sector 5 ball+power puzzles, and I'm having way more fun than the original. I'm not waiting for a little scrap of pointless dialog like in Portal, this game is perfectly paced. Dialog, quick puzzles, dialog. The story doesn't just drag by; there's plenty of it and the puzzles don't take so long I forget what was last said. In Portal 2, I once was apologized to for being called trash (Yes, I know it's not clear at first, but I didn't remember ANYTHING about trash) and had absolutely no idea when trash had come up at first.Only worry: There's only six Sector squares rather than nine now, like in the original. Guessing it's indicating that you're leaving the places you should be once you finish Sector Six, or something. Anyways, it's a great game and it being three sections shorter isn't a scam or anything; I still have the original Q. U. B. E. and got this and Against the Qlock for free, even though I thought at least one of them was going to be pay-for, and Q. U. B. E. Original may have been just a little TOO long for me, since I never finished it.			"

												Here's the thing. This is a physics puzzler with inconsistent physics. You need to know this right off the bat because some puzzles require physics-based thinking and the game doesn't behave the same way in each attempt. You can literally get stuck on some puzzles because you will be unable to make pieces move where you want them to move.BUT after finishing the game I can see the light in this game. Yes, it's trying to be Portal but out of all the Portal clones this one is pretty good, despite being only a few hours. The story pulls through and mechanics are easily memorable. Definitely worth getting on sale, but again, remember you may face frustration from the physics.			"

												An excellent little game which doesn't trouble the boredom threshold or the fury gland over its short but satisfying length. One imagines the developers being either offended or actively angered by Portal's subtext and constructing this in response. But it's okay, you don't have to hate Portal to play and enjoy this. Comes with a bunch of speedrun extras which I'm not interested in, but the main game is a couple of hours of fun.			"

												A puzzling adventure similar in premise to portal but with focus on cube manipulation rather than portals. The game uses several different cube types, all designated their own colour to quickly and efficiently let the player know how to interact with them. Red cubes can be extracted or retracted three times, allowing for you to build bridges or tower-like structures with them. The yellow cubes form a ladder when interacted with, the side you choose to left click will always be the longest with the other two nearby cubes forming steps. Blue cubes work as trampolines and can send both you and other cubes or objects flying. Purple cubes rotate the area they are attached to, this includes other cubes. Finally, green cubes form a boxlike object which you can push around or transport with the help of other cubes. Think of it as the companion cube from Portal but with less personality.There are also some puzzles which use balls that are sent rolling as they spawn, in these circumstances you are to transport the ball throughout a maze, often by making it go through different colour cubes to change its colour and thereby making it react properly with a certain coloured goal. Colour mixing and laser puzzles do also appear but in limited quantities.What sets this Director's Cut appart from the original Q.U.B.E is the narrative. The standard edition had no focused story at all, and was instead simply a collection of puzzles taking you through an unknown and strange place eventually bringing you to the game's climax. Here however, the developers hired a writer and some voice actors to formulate a narrative story piece fitting the game's gameplay and pacing, and hopefully bringing the player a deeper satisfaction as to why he/she would complete these puzzles in the first place.Does the narrative succeed with its goal? I believe this is highly subjective, and I've seen both much positive and negative feedback regarding the story. A lot of people are calling it bland, and I certainly can't say it matches the story of Portal 2 in terms of character development or pacing, but it is there and it somewhat does its job. The story, without spoiling too much, tries to give your character, well; character. You are told that what you are doing is for the purpose of saving the world, and that you may not remember anything because you have been out for far too long. Soon however another voice appears and tells you not to believe ""their"" lies. The player gets more and more information the longer the game goes, and the more puzzles you solve the more hectic the whole situation seems to become. Before you know it you got two sides calling each other liars, and you are to choose who to believe.The unfortunate thing is that, although I rather liked the story itself, and it did make the game more interesting for me personally, the ending was very poorly implemented for the story. I think that they should have either changed the ending and given you more options as to how to end the game, or rewritten the story's climax to better fit the game's ending. In the end it feels like no matter who you choose to believe, you are simply left with no choice but to follow the game's ""canon"" ending, which makes no sense at all if you believed the other side.If the game's climax had made more sense as regard to the story, or at least given you two choices as to how you wanted to end the game I would definitely recommend this. As it stands however; the payoff is really a letdown. And I therefore believe you are more likely to enjoy the standard edition, which has no story at all, and make up your own story instead if you wish, rather than playing along with their story and being forced down one path despite the game hinting towards two endings throughout the entire experience.I recommend you try out the original Q.U.B.E instead. It is an excellent puzzle game and the only real gripe I have with it is that the physics engine sometimes seems to malfunction slightly which can lead to frustration and having to redo puzzles. Overall, a great game which should satisfy your puzzle-itch for a few 2-3 hours.			"

												I don't typically do reviews. But for all things I felt I should for this game. If you do not want spoilers do not expand this review.8/10 Would get frustrated at the story again.First off I do like this game, and unlike several of the top helpful negative votes, I have not played the previous version with no story. However I do very much agree with their complaints vs. this rather plot-hole filled story line. One plot-hole of which bothered and irritated me so much I literally could not finish the game for a whole extra thirty minutes as I did everything in my futile power to try and stop the story from going the direction I was predicting. I will get to that and other cons later though, I will first explain why I still recommend it.Pro's:Q.U.B.E. is a really brilliantly put together 3D Platform Puzzle game. It manages to make really visually interesting environments with the majority of it being made out of same sized cubes. It's lighting effects and background music & sound effectively change how one feels about being in such a strange place throughout the game. Making the place feel oddly interesting to explore at first and then gradually becoming more and more unsettling and foreboding. The puzzles are rather somewhat simple to figure out throughout the game (for me personally at least) however they did become more challenging at a good pace and were all still very fun to solve. Some were more difficult to a degree due to some quick switching you needed to do in order to get things where you wanted them. This was rather hard to do sometimes since your abilities are kind of slow to act. Its a good thing though because that slow activation sequence makes you rely on puzzle solving more than quick reflexes.The controls are smooth and simple. It also doesn't explain any of them or how your powers work. I have this as a Pro because I find it rather annoying in games where they give you so much explanation on the controls it make you feel as if the game is mocking your intelligence. This also adds a small level of solving to the puzzles as well through trial and error.Cons:The main story game is a little short, however this isn't much of a Con considering that there is a bunch of added stuff to do and the story wasn't all that well put together. The story Is likely the biggest Con. I will go a bit in depth as to how it goes so don't read further if you don't want to know. It was an interesting Idea, but it came out rather painfully terrible.So the story is you have no memory of who you are or why your here and two people who contact you throughout the game periodically try to influence you to either continue or stop. This is all rather moot though because the one who wants you to continue makes no sense and sounds like a liar from the get go, and the others demand is that you don't listen to her and do nothing to save your life. I say its moot because this really all wouldn't affect you in this situation anyway. You would solve the puzzles anyway because doing nothing wouldn't get you anywhere so the one argument you would never listen to and the other one doesn't need to try and get you to continue.There is a point in their rather almost random poking around that they suddenly focus on faith and it suddenly becomes the whole thing the ""story"" is about afterwards. This all rather becomes annoying at the end because they make it off as a ""Who do you trust?"" only to make it so you can't choose. Not to mention the message this story conveys is that you should have complete blind faith in someone you don't really know. For reasons. It almost feels like you completely confirm that what you have is a gun in every way possible without actually firing it and then being told to shoot yourself in the face with it because that will save billions of lives including your own somehow. By the time you get to the end they create a logic conundrum. If you want to complete the mission, realistically in your mind, you would have to accept the person who has been trying to get you to complete it has been lying to you which, in turn, would make you not trust them enough to complete the mission. However as I stated you get no choice in the matter because there is only one route. Well there is only one route due to invisible walls and the developers lack of wanting you to fail the game. The last part is likely done because almost everyone who would play the game would fail it due to the fact you would likely not choose to complete the mission out of distrust. All in all the story is rather annoying, though interesting idea, that make the game frustrating at the end of the story.Apologies, that last part ended up a bit of a rant. but that is how terrible the story is. The game is still good, it just has a painfully bad story. So if you like 3D Platform Puzzles like Portal then you would definitively like this game's mechanics.			"

												Q.U.B.E. is a first-person puzzle game in which the player will mostly push or pull color-coded blocks from the walls, ceilings, and floors. New concepts are introduced often to keep the gameplay fresh. The early mechanics form a strong foundation for the remainder of the game, but Q.U.B.E. loses some momentum in the mid-game by continually introducing and dropping concepts which are either obvious time-sinks or perhaps rely too heavily on a finnicky physics engine. The developers finally hit their stride in the end-game, but then the whole package just hits a brick wall.The Director's Cut had one curious addition:  a story. The original Q.U.B.E. was pure gameplay. Here's a puzzle. Solve it (or don't). This version tries to play on themes of isolation, desperation, and paranoia by adding voiceovers (which are actually quite well-done); however, no gameplay alterations were made, aside from extending a few hallways. This seems like a mistake for a game which already had pacing issues.To make matters worse, the story never commits to its motifs. There was already a mark beside ""isolation""; it's a first-person puzzle game! ""Desperation"" comes in the form of ""The Earth's in danger."" and of couse, ""Oh no! Your wife is on Earth!"" Yawn. ""Paranoia"" was handled with a bit more grace, but you're expecting a payoff. You'll carry that expectation right up to the end. The story will suggest a fork in the road, but the game will present only one obvious path. You'll search high and low and wait while anticipating a time-based trigger, but you'll slowly realize that your options remain the same as ever. Play the game (or don't).Despite the bad pacing and one puzzle which was almost completely broken by the physics engine, I would recommend this game if you're a fan of Portal. The end-game puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but they do have a lot of moving pieces and therefore require a bit of thought. The developers knew their limitations; outside of the bundled ""Against the Qlock"" DLC, there's very little demand for twitch reflexes. The DLC seems to have promise, but I probably won't spend too much time with it. I don't enjoy time trials very much.			"

												Ok, going to start with the cons because they are somewhat glaring and hard to miss...Very short story: Not a whole lot to go with. There was an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, it's WAY too short. So much could have been done with the story that they built.Puzzles are good, but also short: Some of the ideas really built on themselves. Don't get me wrong. However, with the shorter story, it feels like many of these ideas are crammed together and used briefly. Lots of missed potential: Short story with the short puzzles makes the game feel rushed. I feel more colors and mechanics could have easily been used.Besides that, it's a nice story even if it is short. Gameplay is very solid, just needs expansion. Other than those gripes, the game looks and sounds amazing. Not one issue playing the game.			"

												The game has fairly nice graphics except I occassionally had a few graphical glitches on full settings. Interesting gameplay, it reminded me of Portal in a way, except it wasn't as fun or tough to complete the puzzles. The plot was quite interesting at one point but I feel that it was a poorly written towards the end of the game.For those that are comletionists such as myself, the achievements in this game are unbareable. One requires you walk 100,000 steps in total. Even if I had reached 10,000 by the end of the first playthrough, of 4 hours, that's 40 hours of walking and nothing else which is just pure grinding. This isn't the only achievement that is of a heavy grinding nature either. 5.5/10.			"

												Short (up to 4 hours) and entertaining first-person puzzler. The puzzles are not too difficult, but still satisfying. The minimalist style suits the game. Nice touches, like the rythmically oscillating walls, enhance the immersion.  The narrative, though well-intentioned, tends to undermine the sense of place (or placelessness) by inserting unnecessary detail. Since the player has no choice in the outcome, the story feels overly dramatic and awkwardly staged. Nevertheless these minor annoyances do not detract so much that they ruin the experience. Bundled for around 1$, the game is very worth it. At $15, your time is better spent elsewhere.			"

												Superb, normal human friendly little gem. Think and you will get through. Not much platforming involved, which is great. Because of that, the game is not long, not very varied, but it has its moments and presents them well.The narrative that's been placed on top of the original game (that I didn't play) feels very good and well executed (unbelievable voice acting, imho), except for the ending, which is, well, cheesy.... Also there's intrigue, and you can also use the game to test your intuitions and feelings towards the unknown. When guessed right, the feeling is great. I did, so I know :)Anyways, although the very ending is somewhat cheesy, at least you can reach it without using hints or performing (near) impossible timed sequences (as in some other similar games, that I'd rather not mention here ;)), so all is good.BTW, this review was on the story mode. Didn't bother with the other game modes there were.			"

The puzzles, while not overly difficult, were pretty interesting and the story that happens between puzzles works as incentive to make it through some of the more frustrating puzzles. There is also the option of doing time trial, if that's your kind of thing, but the game definitely has an end point and doesnt extend beyond that.

ThoughtsShort (3-4 hours) but enjoyable experience despite the very poor story line (or lack of story at all really).  The game revolves around a guy in a cube spaceship who must solve challenges using different coloured cubes to progress through the levels to try and escape the spaceship.  The story is extremely disappointing and really doesnt add anything to the game in my opinion.  I was left confused by it at the end and because its so random i felt no urge to even look up what it was about.  It had zero lasting effect on me in this sense.The puzzle elements of the game however are really well done and although not massively challenging they are also not frustrating either.  The game has some hidden puzzles which are a little harder but again nothing to hard.  The game revolves around using some special gloves that allow you to manipulate cubes to progress to the next area/level. Each cube is a different colour and they all act differently, you need to use a combination of the cubes to progress through the level with some timing needed also.The directors cut includes speed runs which i personally am not interested in but it might appeal to others.Overall i enjoyed the game from a puzzle aspect and if you are a fan of puzzle games i would recommend it especially when its on sale for less than £2.  However dont expect any gripping story line from this title.Steam Controller SupportThe game doesnt have any native controller support so the input for the steam controller needs to be configured using keyboard and mouse inputs.  I initially grabbed the top used config and adjusted the mouse input sensitivity to my liking.  The game works fine with this input method and using the triggers for left and right click to manipulate the cubes worked really well.Menu navigation was a little different but i blame the game rather than the controller for this as it was created for mouse navigation.Steam Link SupportNo major issues using this game with the steam link, 1080p @ 60fps without problems.  Menu text was a little small.			"

												This game is pretty straight-forward, which is a good thing.  The game was overall refreshing, and it played well (meaning, no performance issues or serious glitches).  Most of the puzzles were modestly challenging, though few were exceptionally difficult.  But unlike games such as Portal, the puzzles can only be so complicated before they're totally overwhelming.  But, the developers seemed to do a good job at avoiding any overwhelming puzzles (though, I hadn't found all of the hidden ones yet).I would like to point out that there were a couple puzzles that were a bit clumsy to solve, where I ""solved"" them by exploiting inconsistencies in the physics engine.  Though the level design may be clever, the physics engine can sometimes make the puzzles seem a lot less elegant.My biggest gripe with the game is the overall effort put into it, particularly toward the end.  The ending was very sudden.  It felt incomplete, rushed, and as though the developers lost interest.  I liked the psychological dichotomy in the story, but it felt like the entire concept of that was completely thrown away at the very end.  It would have been nice to have at least been given a choice to how the game ends.TL;DR:Decent game to get on sale and play during a weekend.  But the physics need refinement, it's visually boring, and the story is anticlimactic.			"

												NaissanceE meets Portal, but with an actual story. It's like a perfectly middle-of-the-road puzzle game - I kind of wish I could give it a neutral thumb recommendation. Some of the puzzles are relatively easy to brute force, the magnetism based ones are pretty awful just in terms of design, and towards the end (both literally and figuratively) it starts to fall apart a bit but it ends pretty soon after so it's not too bad.Want a short-ish puzzle game with a story that's on the relatively inexpensive side? grab it this game's for you (also, the challenge puzzles are waaaay harder than anything in the main game if youre a puzzle afficianado).Looking for an extensive puzzle game or story to get wrapped up in for 15+ hours? this game is not for you, its relatively short and while the story is pretty good it's not meant to be a 'story' based game.

												so i just finished the campaign/story/whatever you call it and i couldnt have been more satisfied. total time played to finish the story was 3h which included some afk time (about 15min). i am very good at puzzles so if this is your first time playing a puzzle game your time will increase. the game started off in a tiny windowed mode but i switched it to full screen 1080p immediately. from there i looked at the graphis options and proceded to max all fo them out. the game ran smooth and almost issue free with my laptop running a gtx570m. the 2 issues i had were screen tearing right in the very middle of the screen (only happened in later levels) and my fps dipped when there was fire and smoke on screen. once i turned my back to it my fps jumped back to 60 from the 25-30. if i were to turn off v-sync this might stop the screen tearing and improve my fps in the smoky environments but it was enabled by default and wanted to see how the game ran with it. the art style as described by my family is minimalistic futuristic, but i think it is more geometric. either way it is very unique. one gripe i will say is there was too much white but i can understand why there was so much. the puzzles to start off with were very simple and didnt get difficult for me until the 5th zone  there are 7 total  .  some of the puzzles expect you to use momentum which it made no reference to.  there are a bumch of different puzzle mechanics and i like some more than others but all were relatively simple to understand.the very linear story (yes there is a story) was fun to listen to,  but it needed some options instead of being linear follow the only path. give us the option to follow mr 919 or not. as of june 2016 the price is $9,99 which i consider a little steep based on how short the story is. if you can find it on sale or really like puzzle games then by all means pick it up. i'm am going to start on the dlc and community levels now and if those change my mind i will update my review.

												I think QUBE is a really nice puzzle game,though short.It's Portal-Like (without portals) but not a rip-off like other games. It's original and a great time-killer.-The graphics are great-Intriguing storyline-Enjoyable Gameplay-Puzzles are awesomely thought9/10 Would play again (maybe)			"

												Pros:Technically robust.Aesthetically pleasing visuals.Cons:Frustrating, slow and unsatisfying game mechanics and puzzles.Pacing problems.Ham-fisted story.Extremely annoying time buffers in the levels to accomodate audio narrative.My biggest personal gripe with the design of this game are all the forced waiting periods between puzzles, such as slow-opening doors, slow-moving elevators or poitlessly long corridors, which don't adapt to the player's pacing at all and will force you to wait idly in silence if you stopped to look or explore while the audio-only narrative played out.The audio narrative should've been playing during the puzzles, not in between!Or at least speed up the arbitrary waiting points if the audio already stopped playing!And to add insult to injury, the achievements indicate that there are hidden secrets in some stages, so exploration is both incentivized (with secrets) and punished (with pointless waiting if you lingered a bit between puzzles).I can tolerate a pointless story, but not when it gets in the way of the game proper.As for the core of game, I'd describe it as ""Portal-esque, but oddly unsatisfying.""Most of the game is spent trying to guide balls or cubes through obstacle courses by remotely triggering fixed gadgets in the level, which turns out to be a boring, repetitive and frustrating task.I imagine some people will love what this game has to give, but I was not one of them, and I generally can't recommend it.

												Loved this puzzle game. You are simply manipulating cubes by the way of special gloves to progress through the game. It gives you a sort of 'Portal Feel' as you are making your way through the cube.Portal is better and cost per hour is cheaper but don't let that keep you from this puzzle game. The puzzles are just easy/hard enough so that you don't get stumped and totally frustrated to the point of needing a walkthrough. There were only 2 drawbacks that I found. The 1st was a section of the cube that was in the dark, which I hated, and Thank God it didn't last too long. And the 2nd was that the game only lasted 4 or 5 hours.  I guess that is fair as far as price per hour goes but you just don't want it to end....it's that good.			"

												Only completed the first 5 sectors so far but the game is fantastic!The first 2 sectors introduce you to the mechanics and help you get to grips with the controls. After that the puzzle aspect just makes you want to keep playing. I have managed to complete 2 of the 3 side puzzles I have found (the third was pretty tricky, at least it was when i tried it late at night).I didn't buy this game but would recommend it to anyone and think it is worth FAR more than the price on the store page.Grab this game, it won't disappoint			"

												I haven't played the original QUBE. My opinions are based solely on the Director's cut edition!       QUBE is a fun and short puzzle game with, you guessed it, cubes. There is kind of a story added to the game, which is quite mediocre, but a cool addition to the puzzles nonetheless. There is little to no soundtrack in the game.

												I did actually like this game to begin with. My first play through was enjoyable. The puzzles were hard and fun to solve, the graphics are good and goes perfectly with the style the puzzles are presented to you, however, I have already played the likes of Portal and Portal 2 and compared with them I didn't find myself wanting to return to this world for a second play through. The story and narrative is very hollow to me. I found myself not caring about my characters situation and just looking forward to completing the next colourful puzzle in peace as there is no threat while completing them. If that is all you are looking for in a puzzle game then you may prefer this approach but I personally found this to be a one off play through.			"

												Hands down one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Absolutley on par with Portal and Portal 2.The mechanics for this game work extremely well and make the experience fluid and unhindered.Puzzles are a huge, huge part of this game and boy are the fanatastic. They progressively get more and more challenging and really make you think. There were times where I was stumped and wasn't sure about how I go about attacking the puzzle until I changed my perspective of it. Once I did that it made the puzzle interesting rewarding upon completion.Story also plays an important role in the game. It was delivered EXTREMELY well with superb performances by all of the voice acting, they really made me feel a sense of loniness, happiness, nervouses, and sometimes confusion. BUT everything worked the way it was suppossed to and the story made sense. At the end everything ties up in a satifying conclusion however it does leave some questions unanswered, but that's okay because it makes you step back and think about what its leaving you to think about.Overall I was extremely pleased with this game and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys puzzle, story, and suspensful games. Truly a masterpiece in my opinion.10/10			"

												First off: the puzzles in QUBE were cleverly designed, and the elements were very well introduced as you played. No tutorial necessary, just WASD + spacebar + left/right click. There was a single instance where I felt I solved a puzzle using a bug in the physics engine, but I'd struggled for about 15 minutes on that puzzle.The storyline in QUBE was fairly quick, but the dialog was incredibly immersive. I found myself confused and wondering about so many things. I agonized over the fairly trivial plot decisions I was given.			"

												Disclaimer: I'm writing this review as I am stuck on a particular puzzle a little over halfway into the game.QUBE as a puzzle game has very confused mechanics. It is both physics based and requires precise timing which will result in many frustrating situations of trying to get the ball/cube into the objective. As another reviewer said, even if you know the solution, luck plays too big a part in actually succeeding in the game.So far the story is forgettable and pretty much only to fill the time in between loading the levels.Graphics are alright but you'd be hard pressed to find a game that messes up cubes. Having both hands placed in front of your camera awkwardly can block your view of puzzles, especially as many of them are placed beneath your feet and in the ground.Good time waster but I wish I got a better game in my humble bundle.

												Awesome game! The game's mechanics are pretty simple and easy to understand, although there are more and more features added during the progression of the game.It is kind of a portal-like game, whereas the storyline is not that dense as in Portal BUT the level-design is much more diversified and creative in Q.U.B.E. (and good (-: ).Two things I dislike:- No option to change the volume of the music/sfx. It was too loud for me, so I turned down my master volume and had to turn it up again each time a dialog started )-:- Some levels are much too dark.Took me 2.7 hours to complete.I'd give Q.U.B.E. a score of 86/100.

												Overall I would say that the game is pretty decent, and worth your time, all 3-ish hours of it. The puzzles are decent, fun for the most part, never too hard to solve, but sometimes a little too easy. I like the way it looks and feels, it is all pretty nice. Though that is all nice enough, the game has a lot of major flaws in it. I can sum it all up with one word. Dissapointment. The game had a lot of missed potential, mostly within the story. The gameplay itself could have had a little more diversity and could have been a little more diffucult, but it really is the story that gets me. I was hoping for a little more psychological horror stuff because of the trailer, but that was really minimal. I really wish they better developed the story, and I wasn't a fan of the end, where you should get a choice, two options. There was a lot of potential in the story, but it just wasn't all there. So as I said, it is a decent game for your time, but plan to be a little dissaponted.			"

My only gripe is that while it starts off as a first person puzzle platformer, it morphs into pretty much just a straight up puzzle game. You are merely controlling a puzzle, the ability to walk around is incidental and meaningless. Nonetheless, it has a good difficulty scaling and gets quite hard towards the end.			"

												NaissanceE meets Portal, but with an actual story. It's like a perfectly middle-of-the-road puzzle game - I kind of wish I could give it a neutral thumb recommendation. Some of the puzzles are relatively easy to brute force, the magnetism based ones are pretty awful just in terms of design, and towards the end (both literally and figuratively) it starts to fall apart a bit but it ends pretty soon after so it's not too bad.Want a short-ish puzzle game with a story that's on the relatively inexpensive side? grab it this game's for you (also, the challenge puzzles are waaaay harder than anything in the main game if youre a puzzle afficianado).Looking for an extensive puzzle game or story to get wrapped up in for 15+ hours? this game is not for you, its relatively short and while the story is pretty good it's not meant to be a 'story' based game.

												I'm disappointed with this game. I never played the original, but I saw playthroughs of it. The director's cut edition merely adds a weird ""story"" and doesn't seem to have fixed the buggy physics or refactored the trial-and-error puzzles. There is not enough variety. There aren't even enough options in the menus for things like keybinds and graphical settings. This is effectively a version 1.1 labeled as a 2.0.I'd like to quote my friend:Originally posted by HugoBDesigner:As someone who's played both the original and the Director's Cut, and as a huge fan of puzzles in general, I have to agree: this game was disappointing. The concept is great, and some puzzles are awesome, but the execution felt very shallow, weak and poorly planned. The graphics are okay, I like simplistic games, but they went a bit too ""portal-y"" with the ""behind the scenes"" and ""destroyed environments"". The physics is buggy, hella buggy actually, and some puzzles are just, like you said, trial and error. I did get the ""hardest"" puzzle more easily by just aligning the pairs of blocks against the red cubes instead of using the magnets and timing. But overall, I'd say Q.U.B.E is a 6/10 game. Could have been great if it had been worked on better and if it was better planned, executed and tested. The story also felt shallow in my opinion, but I still had fun with this game AND with the lets play!﻿Since this game is ""above average"" I can recommend it, but just barely.			"

												Let's make this short:Pros:-Interesting mechanics and puzzle design- Story and voice acting is nice, though it's pretty obvious what is really going onCons:- Barely any graphic options- No seperate audio sliders- No Subtitles- Story is mostly told inbetween the puzzles. This wouldn't be an issue if the terrain was interesting to look at but most of the time you just stay put and wait in an elevator with nothing else going on or walk down a straight line in bland hallway. Telling the story while you are hammering your brain to solve a puzzle would've been more entertaining, this just causes a lot of boring downtime.- The puzzles tend to repeat itself quite heavily. Sure this is an aspect that can't be avoided but other games manage to make solving the same type of puzzles fun by changing the environment around, bringing a new visual or story aspect into it. QUBE sadly stays the same old boring white blocks most of the time.- There is some sort of artificial delay between beeing able to activate and deactivate blocks that drove me nuts. Quick and precise puzzle solving was made unnecessary slowSo would I recommend it?Pick it up in a sale, it's mostly entertaining and doesn't outstay it's welcome in the 2h it took me to beat itWould I play it again?I really wouldn't.

I've since completed Director's Cut in merely 2 hours. I was very frustrated by the end. If you really want this game, play the demo. It's as good as it gets.

												my friends described this as a portal clone but it is a verry different game, the only similaritys being the visual style and having to complete isolated puzzles. the puzzle mechanic in this game is verry unique, fun, and intuitivemy biggest complaints are: how short the game is, which i cant really fault the creator on. as many have already said, the lack of multiple endings dispite the game builing up to a choice in the end, a choice which you're presented with but cant make. and the achivements marking progression in the game.  after completing a section in the game you enter a room with 6 black sqares, each square lights up as you progress and you get an achivement every time this happens. but the achivement shows 9 squares, spoiling that the game continues past section 6. as small of a moment as it was it wouldve added a lot to my enjoyment if i didnt see it coming. but overall it was a really fun game and i liked it			"

												Hands down one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Absolutley on par with Portal and Portal 2.The mechanics for this game work extremely well and make the experience fluid and unhindered.Puzzles are a huge, huge part of this game and boy are the fanatastic. They progressively get more and more challenging and really make you think. There were times where I was stumped and wasn't sure about how I go about attacking the puzzle until I changed my perspective of it. Once I did that it made the puzzle interesting rewarding upon completion.Story also plays an important role in the game. It was delivered EXTREMELY well with superb performances by all of the voice acting, they really made me feel a sense of loniness, happiness, nervouses, and sometimes confusion. BUT everything worked the way it was suppossed to and the story made sense. At the end everything ties up in a satifying conclusion however it does leave some questions unanswered, but that's okay because it makes you step back and think about what its leaving you to think about.Overall I was extremely pleased with this game and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys puzzle, story, and suspensful games. Truly a masterpiece in my opinion.10/10			"

												I did actually like this game to begin with. My first play through was enjoyable. The puzzles were hard and fun to solve, the graphics are good and goes perfectly with the style the puzzles are presented to you, however, I have already played the likes of Portal and Portal 2 and compared with them I didn't find myself wanting to return to this world for a second play through. The story and narrative is very hollow to me. I found myself not caring about my characters situation and just looking forward to completing the next colourful puzzle in peace as there is no threat while completing them. If that is all you are looking for in a puzzle game then you may prefer this approach but I personally found this to be a one off play through.			"

												so i just finished the campaign/story/whatever you call it and i couldnt have been more satisfied. total time played to finish the story was 3h which included some afk time (about 15min). i am very good at puzzles so if this is your first time playing a puzzle game your time will increase. the game started off in a tiny windowed mode but i switched it to full screen 1080p immediately. from there i looked at the graphis options and proceded to max all fo them out. the game ran smooth and almost issue free with my laptop running a gtx570m. the 2 issues i had were screen tearing right in the very middle of the screen (only happened in later levels) and my fps dipped when there was fire and smoke on screen. once i turned my back to it my fps jumped back to 60 from the 25-30. if i were to turn off v-sync this might stop the screen tearing and improve my fps in the smoky environments but it was enabled by default and wanted to see how the game ran with it. the art style as described by my family is minimalistic futuristic, but i think it is more geometric. either way it is very unique. one gripe i will say is there was too much white but i can understand why there was so much. the puzzles to start off with were very simple and didnt get difficult for me until the 5th zone  there are 7 total  .  some of the puzzles expect you to use momentum which it made no reference to.  there are a bumch of different puzzle mechanics and i like some more than others but all were relatively simple to understand.the very linear story (yes there is a story) was fun to listen to,  but it needed some options instead of being linear follow the only path. give us the option to follow mr 919 or not. as of june 2016 the price is $9,99 which i consider a little steep based on how short the story is. if you can find it on sale or really like puzzle games then by all means pick it up. i'm am going to start on the dlc and community levels now and if those change my mind i will update my review.

												It's a great puzzle game, in first person perspective. Think - Portal, but with out a portal gun. Think - 3D puzzles, but you're there, in the puzzle, and you have to try to work out how to get through each seperate puzzle room, to progress through a strange, clinical, constantly moving corridor (Think - the Staircases in Hogwarts) to get to the next puzzle chamber.You'll notice I use the word THINK quite a bit. That's because you have to use your thinky thing to progress through the game. There's a one way radio communication throughout the game, which outlines who you are(Because your memory is wiped) why you're there, and what you're doing. I'm offering NO spoilers, because I've only reached stage four, so I don't have all the answers for myself yet.The puzzles invold moving things, touching things, activating switches and using colour change devices to switch and blend colours. I hope you were paying attention in art classes.If you're into puzzles, this is a great game.Yes, I did get this game for free, but, because I enjoyed it so much, I bought it for a friend so that he may enjoy it as much as I did.

												This game was on my wishlist for years, mostly because it disappeared from the store to replaced with the ""Director's Cut."" From what I've read, the original game didn't have any story, just a string of puzzles, so I'm glad I waited. The story isn't much, but it's compelling. The musical is atmospheric--you barely know it's there, and yet it's so soothing. The artwork is minimalistic, but it really works. You're basically surrounded by nothing but cubes (hence the name), but they play with the settings by starting off with a very stark, clean environment (think Portal), then having a section completely in the dark, and several that are falling apart (think Portal 2). Basically, if you like Portal, or other puzzle-platformers, you'll enjoy this. You can manipulate different colored cubes, each of which serves a different purpose (ex. blue bounces you, red is a block of adjustable length, etc.) My only complaint that it was too short. I easily finished in an afternoon. The puzzles themselves are challenging enough to not be immediately apparent, but not so infuriating that they seem insurmountable. I haven't investigated the ""Extras and DLC"" section of the game too carefully, but it seems to be just timed versions of the puzzles, unless there is more that unlocks later.  But overall, a great game!			"

												An immensely enjoyable puzzle game with excellent voice acting and an intriguing storyline. Upon first playing it, I expected to finish in one sitting. No such luck; there were a couple puzzles that stumped me so hard that I had to step away for a while to let my brain recuperate! The challenges get more difficult as you progress and each sector introduces new blocks to play with, which keeps things interesting.Reminiscent of Portal, but certainly not a copycat. In some aspects, I even enjoyed it more.			"

												Q.U.B.E. is a first-person puzzle platformer that's drawn a lot of sorta-kinda-warranted-I-guess comparisons to Portal. You're an unnamed protagonist who wakes up in a maze of blocky little passages (all alike) without any real explanation of how you got there or why. A voice in your headset tells you that you're doing something of incredible importance to the entire human race—literally incredible actually, as seemingly all you're doing is solving block-moving physics puzzles and it's hard to see any direct correlation between making the green ball go in the green hole and humanity as a whole not dying this week. And the character communicating with you seems a little...unreliable. And then you realize you may not be alone in there...Which makes for a really interesting, dark tone that maintained my interest throughout Q.U.B.E.'s 3-hour run time in a way that it might not have otherwise. Solutions are logical but not exactly obvious, so there's a sense of accomplishment as you solve each puzzle and move along to the next, progressively harder one—but there's also a fairly smooth narrative progression as well, at least until the conflicting radio messages reach a fever pitch of urgency just as the puzzles start to require serious thought to work out, which slows things down enough to undercut the immersion a touch.But the biggest immersion break comes from the realization that but there's never any opportunity to explore an alternate path or flip the script. You either keep solving puzzles, or you turn off the game. Very meta, but a satisfying conclusion it is not. This all culminates in a final choice which—though the scene in which it occurs is very emotionally charged—you ultimately aren't permitted to make in a way that feels meaningful. The story here really isn't the point so much as the atmosphere of tension created by having to rely on a pair of dueling unreliable narrators, and it doesn't exactly ruin the game that came before it, but a cheap ending is a cheap ending.Still, the puzzles are good and the game is visually very appealing, with a clean aesthetic and clear objectives that never leave you wondering where you're trying to get to. Late in the game there're some lovely mind-♥♥♥♥y moments to be had as the corridors start undulating and swirling around you like the whole place has come alive, which is pretty sweet. If you've already got Portal and Antichamber and want something else to scratch that itch, Q.U.B.E. is a worthy enough Steam Sale pickup.			"

												QUBE proves that even if you have no design ability, no artistic skill, no programming ability, and no creativity whatsoever, you can still make a video game.  The basic gameplay loop is that you enter a white room, look for the three or four colored blocks, click on them in the correct order, and then move on to the next room.  It's basically a paint by numbers puzzle game where someone forgot to paint the numbers.Aside from the utter lack of anything resembling artwork in the game, the puzzles themselves are pretty boring and pointless.  The block elements in the game don't really lend themselves to interesting or intuitive puzzles, and your interactions with the various blocks are limited to one of two actions.Also, in the director's cut, there's some sort of thin, pointless story thrown on top.  It's totally disconnected from the game however, so instead of being mildly annoying like most pointless stories in video games, in QUBE it's actively distracting since you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out what the story has to do with the boring white room you're currently in.

												A tribute to Portal, this is a fantastic puzzle game that leads you down a narrative path while you try to solve 3D spatial enigmas. There's a real sense of mastery to the game design as you gradually learn to manipulate cubes to help you progress through the game. The learning curve feels just right.Intriguing puzzles combined with a mysterious storyline (backed by excellent voice actors inc. Rupert Evans from The Man in the High Castle!) all keep you motivated to find out what happens next. The controls are simple and intuitive and if you get stuck, just spend a bit of time thinking - you're bound to figure it out eventually.This was well worth the price for the experience - I haven't been this satisfied solving puzzles in a long time. I'll likely revisit this game when I get a VR headset.My rating: 5/5			"

												Decent little game.  I enjoyed both the puzzles and the story.  The voice acting and visual style both impressed me.  Simple but polished.  Not quite on the level of Portal, but if you've played Portal and want more, this will likely suit your taste.The controls are a weak point.  I'm going to talk a little about that, and I don't want you to think this means I didn't like the game, because I did.In some parts, you have to aim very carefully (there's no auto-targetting help), fairly quickly, and the targetting reticle is often nearly invisible.  The shot cooldown is applied unnecessarily to all situations, including color-change targets which often need to be shot twice (shoot it once, click to shoot again, turn elsewhere, notice that your second shot didn't go through, turn back, find the first target...), so these parts of the game feel can very clunky and frustrating.  Jumping is never very good in a first-person game, and it's an annoyance here as well.  In particular, when you're standing on narrow platforms, and you have to walk toward where you're jumping, it does that FPS thing where walking into the wall at even a slight angle makes you slide along it.  Because of this, and because you can't see your feet, it's easy to accidentally walk off a platform, and also to miss your jump at a precipice.  At times you need to aim nearly straight up or straight down, and due to an overly simple polar coordinate control model the mouse control is very awkward at this; it makes sense, but doesn't feel natural or work well.The main story mode is not, by any means, an action game, so there's no real enjoyment in learning to skillfully and precisely control it.  It's a puzzle game, and fiddly controls just cause annoying blunders and waste your time.  The controls are better suited to the timed-run bonus levels, but in today's market full of cheap, good games, I don't think the bonus content is a good use of anyone's time.These things could be fixed with, I think, little effort, which makes them all the more grating in a project where so much was done with obvious attention to detail.

												Let's make this short:Pros:-Interesting mechanics and puzzle design- Story and voice acting is nice, though it's pretty obvious what is really going onCons:- Barely any graphic options- No seperate audio sliders- No Subtitles- Story is mostly told inbetween the puzzles. This wouldn't be an issue if the terrain was interesting to look at but most of the time you just stay put and wait in an elevator with nothing else going on or walk down a straight line in bland hallway. Telling the story while you are hammering your brain to solve a puzzle would've been more entertaining, this just causes a lot of boring downtime.- The puzzles tend to repeat itself quite heavily. Sure this is an aspect that can't be avoided but other games manage to make solving the same type of puzzles fun by changing the environment around, bringing a new visual or story aspect into it. QUBE sadly stays the same old boring white blocks most of the time.- There is some sort of artificial delay between beeing able to activate and deactivate blocks that drove me nuts. Quick and precise puzzle solving was made unnecessary slowSo would I recommend it?Pick it up in a sale, it's mostly entertaining and doesn't outstay it's welcome in the 2h it took me to beat itWould I play it again?I really wouldn't.

ThoughtsShort (3-4 hours) but enjoyable experience despite the very poor story line (or lack of story at all really).  The game revolves around a guy in a cube spaceship who must solve challenges using different coloured cubes to progress through the levels to try and escape the spaceship.  The story is extremely disappointing and really doesnt add anything to the game in my opinion.  I was left confused by it at the end and because its so random i felt no urge to even look up what it was about.  It had zero lasting effect on me in this sense.The puzzle elements of the game however are really well done and although not massively challenging they are also not frustrating either.  The game has some hidden puzzles which are a little harder but again nothing to hard.  The game revolves around using some special gloves that allow you to manipulate cubes to progress to the next area/level. Each cube is a different colour and they all act differently, you need to use a combination of the cubes to progress through the level with some timing needed also.The directors cut includes speed runs which i personally am not interested in but it might appeal to others.Overall i enjoyed the game from a puzzle aspect and if you are a fan of puzzle games i would recommend it especially when its on sale for less than £2.  However dont expect any gripping story line from this title.Steam Controller SupportThe game doesnt have any native controller support so the input for the steam controller needs to be configured using keyboard and mouse inputs.  I initially grabbed the top used config and adjusted the mouse input sensitivity to my liking.  The game works fine with this input method and using the triggers for left and right click to manipulate the cubes worked really well.Menu navigation was a little different but i blame the game rather than the controller for this as it was created for mouse navigation.Steam Link SupportNo major issues using this game with the steam link, 1080p @ 60fps without problems.  Menu text was a little small.			"

												This game is pretty straight-forward, which is a good thing.  The game was overall refreshing, and it played well (meaning, no performance issues or serious glitches).  Most of the puzzles were modestly challenging, though few were exceptionally difficult.  But unlike games such as Portal, the puzzles can only be so complicated before they're totally overwhelming.  But, the developers seemed to do a good job at avoiding any overwhelming puzzles (though, I hadn't found all of the hidden ones yet).I would like to point out that there were a couple puzzles that were a bit clumsy to solve, where I ""solved"" them by exploiting inconsistencies in the physics engine.  Though the level design may be clever, the physics engine can sometimes make the puzzles seem a lot less elegant.My biggest gripe with the game is the overall effort put into it, particularly toward the end.  The ending was very sudden.  It felt incomplete, rushed, and as though the developers lost interest.  I liked the psychological dichotomy in the story, but it felt like the entire concept of that was completely thrown away at the very end.  It would have been nice to have at least been given a choice to how the game ends.TL;DR:Decent game to get on sale and play during a weekend.  But the physics need refinement, it's visually boring, and the story is anticlimactic.			"

												Loved this puzzle game. You are simply manipulating cubes by the way of special gloves to progress through the game. It gives you a sort of 'Portal Feel' as you are making your way through the cube.Portal is better and cost per hour is cheaper but don't let that keep you from this puzzle game. The puzzles are just easy/hard enough so that you don't get stumped and totally frustrated to the point of needing a walkthrough. There were only 2 drawbacks that I found. The 1st was a section of the cube that was in the dark, which I hated, and Thank God it didn't last too long. And the 2nd was that the game only lasted 4 or 5 hours.  I guess that is fair as far as price per hour goes but you just don't want it to end....it's that good.			"

												Only completed the first 5 sectors so far but the game is fantastic!The first 2 sectors introduce you to the mechanics and help you get to grips with the controls. After that the puzzle aspect just makes you want to keep playing. I have managed to complete 2 of the 3 side puzzles I have found (the third was pretty tricky, at least it was when i tried it late at night).I didn't buy this game but would recommend it to anyone and think it is worth FAR more than the price on the store page.Grab this game, it won't disappoint			"

												Solid gameplay for a puzzler.Yes, there are many Portal comparisons - but this is a much simpler design. And the enjoyment is how simple the design actually is - with only 3-4 puzzle pieces, can you arrange them in the correct pattern for each puzzle.None of the puzzles required mensa level (or brute force) deductions.No artificial timer - you want to think it through while your cat wants tuna snacks?  sure... no pause button needed.Nice design work on the visuals given the intentionally limited pallette.The directors cut provides a fascinating meta-story (no spoilers) that had me very curious where it was going.  I did not play the original release version, but I went back and watched the youTube versions to compare.  I preferred the DC version.Overall - short play.  and I agree that there would be limited replay value unless you were looking for a speed run.			"

												Pros:Technically robust.Aesthetically pleasing visuals.Cons:Frustrating, slow and unsatisfying game mechanics and puzzles.Pacing problems.Ham-fisted story.Extremely annoying time buffers in the levels to accomodate audio narrative.My biggest personal gripe with the design of this game are all the forced waiting periods between puzzles, such as slow-opening doors, slow-moving elevators or poitlessly long corridors, which don't adapt to the player's pacing at all and will force you to wait idly in silence if you stopped to look or explore while the audio-only narrative played out.The audio narrative should've been playing during the puzzles, not in between!Or at least speed up the arbitrary waiting points if the audio already stopped playing!And to add insult to injury, the achievements indicate that there are hidden secrets in some stages, so exploration is both incentivized (with secrets) and punished (with pointless waiting if you lingered a bit between puzzles).I can tolerate a pointless story, but not when it gets in the way of the game proper.As for the core of game, I'd describe it as ""Portal-esque, but oddly unsatisfying.""Most of the game is spent trying to guide balls or cubes through obstacle courses by remotely triggering fixed gadgets in the level, which turns out to be a boring, repetitive and frustrating task.I imagine some people will love what this game has to give, but I was not one of them, and I generally can't recommend it.

												This game is an amazing Portal-like game. It is very simple and short, some puzzles are very hard to figure out what to do, and unfortunately some others are just clunky, but they still did not ruin the game overall.			"

												I think QUBE is a really nice puzzle game,though short.It's Portal-Like (without portals) but not a rip-off like other games. It's original and a great time-killer.-The graphics are great-Intriguing storyline-Enjoyable Gameplay-Puzzles are awesomely thought9/10 Would play again (maybe)			"

												so i just finished the campaign/story/whatever you call it and i couldnt have been more satisfied. total time played to finish the story was 3h which included some afk time (about 15min). i am very good at puzzles so if this is your first time playing a puzzle game your time will increase. the game started off in a tiny windowed mode but i switched it to full screen 1080p immediately. from there i looked at the graphis options and proceded to max all fo them out. the game ran smooth and almost issue free with my laptop running a gtx570m. the 2 issues i had were screen tearing right in the very middle of the screen (only happened in later levels) and my fps dipped when there was fire and smoke on screen. once i turned my back to it my fps jumped back to 60 from the 25-30. if i were to turn off v-sync this might stop the screen tearing and improve my fps in the smoky environments but it was enabled by default and wanted to see how the game ran with it. the art style as described by my family is minimalistic futuristic, but i think it is more geometric. either way it is very unique. one gripe i will say is there was too much white but i can understand why there was so much. the puzzles to start off with were very simple and didnt get difficult for me until the 5th zone  there are 7 total  .  some of the puzzles expect you to use momentum which it made no reference to.  there are a bumch of different puzzle mechanics and i like some more than others but all were relatively simple to understand.the very linear story (yes there is a story) was fun to listen to,  but it needed some options instead of being linear follow the only path. give us the option to follow mr 919 or not. as of june 2016 the price is $9,99 which i consider a little steep based on how short the story is. if you can find it on sale or really like puzzle games then by all means pick it up. i'm am going to start on the dlc and community levels now and if those change my mind i will update my review.

												Very good game. Calling it a Portal clone does not necessarily make it a bad thing. It has its own mechanic and it utilises it well. My only gripe is that while it starts off as a first person puzzle platformer, it morphs into pretty much just a straight up puzzle game. You are merely controlling a puzzle, the ability to walk around is incidental and meaningless. Nonetheless, it has a good difficulty scaling and gets quite hard towards the end.			"

												-Portalesque feel but not quite up to the same standards (but what puzzler really is...?)-Corny story.-A bit short main story (~2.5 h for me), however there are some extra content (time trial levels) that I have yet to explore...-Puzzles were perhaps a bit too easy (this is a fine balance though, since it is frustrating to get stuck too...)Perhaps not a masterpiece but still an OK puzzler to keep you entertained for a few hours. Get it when on sale! (But if you haven't yet played Portal/Portal 2, get those instead...)			"

												I like the simplicity of this game A LOT. It's balanced out enough to make you focus on the puzzles, but not too simplistic to the point where you get bored. The story is there, but honestly you probably won't notice it much nor care about what's going on in it. There are some really puzzling parts about it, but if you just look closely and observe everything in each room you should be fine.			"

												Really nice game that reminded me a lot of Portal, Talos Principle and Antichamber. Story is a bit on the short side, but the game is fun. The time trial ""DLC"" is not as good as the main game, but also worth a try as the main story doesn't really have any replayability.			"

												Okay, so I PLAYED AND FINISHED QUBE ""Classic"" . (I can't review it so I will review this one).I beat the game in 2h30, it's quite fast (too fast to be honest) and easy.If you like games like Portal or Antichamber, you should try it.It's mostly the same type of ""puzzle game"" but with Cubes.The missing ""thing"" in the classic version was a sort of a narrator (+ambiance music), they added it to the Director's Cut version.

												Qube is a short, but sweet 3D puzzle game (If you don't know the genre think of valve's portal) What seprates qube from the rest of genre is the focus on physics.Cons:-EasyThe puzzles are not very challenging, when I was stuck (If ever) It didn't last very long. This is mostly because they didn't take full advantage of the game mechanics. As some last less than 3 puzzles-The EndingIt isn't awful, It's just that, The ending, Singular, Mono, ONE! Through out the story you feel like you have a choice, but in the end it doesn't matter. Which also kills the moral of the story, sadly.-No subtitlesPros:-StoryIt was a great set up, till the end. The moral Faith is presented pretty well, You have doubt, You have confusion, Really wasn't a bad idea. If they had another ending where you didn't have faith, that'd be quite a shocker. to find out all of that was true with you being dead.-MusicAmazing soundtrack fits the tone and situation well. nothing memoriable in my book, but still it's has an exceptional ost -AtmostphereIt is both an awesome and cryptic place, you have no idea where you are, and where you are heading. This is the strongest comparison to portal.-VarietyLot of great mechanics. I can't see how you'd get bored. -TutorialIt feeds you info by level design. THERE IS NO HAND HOLDING IN THIS GAME! Makes it a lot easier to replay.Conclusion:Qube is okay. I don't regret buying, or playing it. I'm just sad there was all lot of wasted potiental.Edit: After reading some of the other reviews on steam. I think I need a disclaimer.DISCLAIMER: I have never played the original.			"

												Q.U.B.E: Directors Cut is a short and fun puzzle game (That wouldn`t exist without portal). You play as a man without his memory (Thanks Portal). Throughout the game you find out more about your charecter through some dialog over a radio (Thanks again Portal). The environment is minimalistic that goes from normal to destoryed, (Thanks Portal 2)The story is ok but not nearly as great as Portal 2`s story. The puzzle mechanic is original. You wear a glove and control qubes in the environment. There are five type of qubes. Red qubes, yellow cubes, green qubes, blue qubes and purple qubes. Each qubes works differently. Blue qubes qorks like a spring board while yellow qubes act as steps. There are a few twists and turnes in regards to the puzzle mechanins, but that is the general mechanins. The most disapointing thing about this game to me was the final level. It didn`t combine all the mechanincs learned like Portal, instead it just used a new set. It was still a fun game that only lasted about 3 hours. 7\10			"
