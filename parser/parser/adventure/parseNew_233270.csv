												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Here's a list of things you'll do in this game:Stab cyborgsUse a throwing star to stab cyborgs from a distanceStab more cyborgsSneak into a base and silently shoot cyborgs with arrows, when their friends walk over to the body to see what's up, sneak up behind them to stab themDisable a base's mega shields so that a gigantic damn dragon will charge in and stab cyborgs with its teethShoot an exploding barrel to distract cyborgs from the fact you're stabbing themSwim through waters that are filled with CYBER sharks and CYBER gators and enter a QTE that lets you stab themYour squad even has a stereotypical black computer hacker who speaks with a wacky urban dialect. But he dies soon into the game because of racism. And racism towards blacks is wrong.10/10, would stab cyborgs again			"

												Easily one of the best and most original FPS games i've ever played. Blood Dragon delivers everything a fan of testosterone-soaked 80s action flicks could possibly want. It's got the hot babe, the huge guns, and tons of explosions. (Did i mention everything is neon? Totally Radical bro.) If that's your thing like it is mine, drop the Politically Correct ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of today and go back to a time when blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up was all that mattered, this game is legit.PROS:+ It's a playable 80s action movie.+ Michael Biehn voices the main character+ ♥♥♥♥ING NEON+ Humor is FANTASTICCONS- UplayBOTTOM LINE:Just buy it already, unless you're a total dweeb.

												If you love the 80's action movies you will love this game, kinda retro but in a very cool approach. A lot of fun, very cool/smart graphics and pretty easy to get into the action (you will hate and love the initial tutorial, it is just great). And the story move in a old fashion way, almost like going back to the 8-bit gaming era... so much good memories!This game will appeal to adults who would like to see Tron merged with Duke Nukem merged with Far Cry 3. Everything else is like a trip through old VHS action movies that I loved as a kid. Worth it if you don't offend too easily.			"

												This game is pure awesomeness :)It's like one of those 80's Trash B-Movies..just better :)Totally over the top, cool one-liners, neon graphics, synthie soundtrack and blood dragons shooting lasers from their eyes...and it's mixing these ingredients very well!The humor is well done and it's never taking itself too serious.Though it's rather short, i had lots of fun with it and would recommend it to every FPS (Open World) fan who likes creative settings.It's pretty extraordinary in terms of setting and everything and i would guess a rather risky game to develop. Kudos to Ubisoft for doing this :)			"

												Far Cry 3 + a barrel of narcotics = Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon = LASERS + DRAGONS + EPIC WINThere's quite a few negative reviews out there so let me address a few issues raised...""uplay sucks"" - yes it does, just get over it and get on with the game. If you really can't get it working there's enough help on the internet that it shouldn't remain a problem for you.""requires too much stealth"" - how did you even come to that conclussion?? I spent the first hour of this game blowing stuff up and shooting people point blank in the face with a shotgun (the only reason I started using stealth was to get more exp). If you can't play like a man that's your fault not the game's.""penalises you for stealth"" - what, by giving you more exp? By stopping dragons from seeing you if you're crouched allowing you to evade them with ease?? Did you even play the game!?!?""exactly like farcry3 with less customisation"" - okay 1) blood dragon was just some fun thrown together by the developers so you could HAVE FUN. It's not a new game or even a full game so don't expect it to be. 2) the game takes care of your level-up perks so you can focus on killing things with lasers. Also while on the topic of customisation you can get a quadbarrelled shotgun that shoots incendiary rounds and a sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds.......enough said.			"

												Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon is an 80s sci-fi parody, with childish humor and old school gun play mechanics, similar to the likes of Duke Nukem or Serious Sam. The gameplay is virtually identical to Far Cry 3, all the same controls, weapons just have different skins. The stealth side of Blood Dragon is very key. You find your self having to stalk around dinosaurs in order to reach objectives, along with the regular stalking through bases to switch off alarm systems etc. I personally like to play Far Cry as stealthy as possible and then go gung-ho with weapons once I inevitably get caught. I really enjoyed using the bow and arrow in Blood Dragon, more so than in Far Cry 3, maybe it was because it has a cool bluey glow effect! Another nice addition, since you are a human cyborg, you no longer take fall damage. There is a hunting side to be found here too, b ut not as in depth as Far Cry 3, its merely there for an achievement purpose from what I could see. Graphics wise, we are looking at another re-skin of Far Cry 3, everything in Blood Dragon is darker and has the sci-fi look to it, with lots of glowing,  shinny, and metallic looking objects. The main story is full of cheesy one liners and plot twists, but still has a convincing and interesting story line to want to play it. If you were to purchase Blood Dragon just for the story alone, you will probably be disappointed. This is another open world, it does a couple of things differently to Far Cry 3 though. First of all, without wanting to spoil too much, there are tons of hidden Easter eggs found throughout the map that will give you a good chuckle. The map size it self is a little bit bigger than the first island you find yourself on in FC3, Sadly it lacks a little depth here, unlike in FC3, you  can't find many hidden secrets which reveal more about the story and characters, This is one of the few games that I have actually found my self playing through for a second time. My first playthrough done on normal mode, and second on harder mode. This added to the replay ability for me. You can also spend a lot of time working on (dirty) uPlay achievements, although some may not find this as attractive as Steam achievements, which is something Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon miss. You can if you work hard enough and plan things out, reach about 80% of completing the game fully on your first playthrough, alot will be time consuming though, be warned. My first play through was finished in six or seven hours or so, this was completing all of the side missions as well as a little achievement gathering. Sadly it seems a little short for what you are paying, but all of the other aspects of the game make up for it. Final thoughts on Blood Dragon, well, I would recommend people pick it up. The game brings back fun into a game without sacrificing core gameplay. I had fun playing from beginning to end. When you do complete Blood Dragon, it will leave you wanting more.

												I describe Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon as a cheesy take on famous sci-fi and action films of the 1980s. It purposely reminds you of famous films like Terminator, Die Hard, Commando, Predator, Robocop, and Rocky IV. Being cheesy doesn’t mean it’s not fun at all. It is actually quite a lot of fun to play in the permanently neon environments. The protagonist is Rex Colt, whose voiceover is played by actor Michael Biehn from the 1984 Terminator movie. Rex is a cyber-commando with a cybernetic left hand and a human right hand. He regularly comes up with one-liners after kills and after his data console tells him what his next objective is.The cut scenes play out in 8-bit and 16-bit form like a VHS tape whereas the gameplay is in modern 3D. The soundtrack is outstanding as it is from Power Glove and it genuinely sounds like ‘80s music. The gameplay will feel very familiar to Far Cry 3 players since the control scheme is the same and the ability to take over territory is the same. The outposts in Far Cry 3 are referred to as garrisons in Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Rex’s killer moves such as death from above and death from below feel very much the Jason Brody’s moves from Far Cry 3. However, there is no such thing as taking damage from any falls since Rex is a cybernetic guy. The main antagonist, Sloan, strongly resembles Bennett from the movie Commando starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The weapons you possess are the handgun, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, all with attachments that you can acquire as you progress. Later you will have access to the bow, a chaingun, and proximity mines. Those with experience with Far Cry 3 will feel at home playing Blood Dragon. The island has random battles between scientists who are part of your faction and members of the Omega Force.Blood Dragons are an integral part of the game and they appear all over the map. They’re quirky in that they fire lasers from their eyes. These dragons are powerful and take a lot of bullets to kill but you can lure them to cyber hearts that you can throw near them so that you can attack them while they’re eating cyber hearts. Cyber hearts are the hearts of the Omega Force soldiers that you can collect after killing them.There are still cool RPG elements similar to those in Far Cry 3. For every kill you earn cybernetic points that help you level up Rex. The RPG aspect of the game is simpler than it is in Far Cry 3, but it’s still fun to apply. Therefore, it would be wise to take on the side missions such as hostage rescues and hunting down special animals for leveling up and for earning attachments for the weapons.The environments do feel a bit monotonous since it always feels like night and the neon lights are the same. There doesn’t seem to be a day-night cycle at any time as you progress through the story. This game contains a lot of quirkiness paying homage to the 1980s. It’s not as fun as the classic Far Cry 3, but it’s still worth playing.			"

												Blood Dragon is a great experiment by Ubisoft, a nostalgia trip back to the 80's as a total conversion of Far Cry 3.  It feels like a blend of Tron, Terminator, and a typical 80's action movie wrapped into the Far Cry island.  At the same time, the game parodies modern games with simple repetitive missions and a long, mandatory tutorial that your character complains about while you do it.The game is a lot of fun, though I'm glad it's a small title.  The nostalgia trip only gets you so far and certain things like looting corpses gets tiring by repeating the same long animation every time.  The bad 80's action hero one-liners get quite tiring after a while too.It took me about 8 hours to complete everything available in the game, which I think is pretty reasonable for the price and a good length for this sort of game.  Any longer and I don't think I'd want to finish it, though at this length it is quite enjoyable.  If you think you'd enjoy the nostalgia trip or just want some more open world fps action, this is definitely a good title to pick up.			"

												(8.5/10)This is one of the rare times when you do get more than you pay for (especially if you snag it on sale).  It is essentially the entire game play system of Far Cry 3, plus neon, minus a hell of a lot of angst, plus laser gatling guns. In some ways you could consider it superior for the changes.Sure its quite a bit smaller, but its way cheaper, and honestly I had more fun with this than its bigger sibling.Go in, explode some things with neon lasers, and have fun, simple as that.

												Thanks, Ubisoft Montreal, for getting this right on the first try, because this is undoubtedly the only time it will be fresh and exciting. Still, the degree of creativity and the load of ideas on display really demonstrates which ways you can treat your source material inventively via spin-offs or DLCs. I really could get used to that.Fans of Far Cry 3 should not miss this fantastic experience, and anyone who grew up watching films like Terminator, Aliens and Commando owe it to themselves to play this, as it was certainly crafted by people who understand the culture.This game is pure irony: story, dialogue, music, graphics... everything recalls the craziest clichés of the 80s.Blood Dragon is a reminder that a story about one man killing thousands is just silly. That’s fine though, because games don’t always need to be serious. Games should just be fun, and that’s exactly what Blood Dragon is.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a true manifesto of vintage culture, of 16-bit gaming and trash cinema: a gem of rare beauty!			"

												☺ Great, varied gameplay.☺ Fully realised, Cheesy 80's Style.☺ Streamlined progression.☹ Puts you through some of the things it ridicules.☹ Still requires the use of Uplay, Ubisofts DRM Client.☹ Not enough enemies.Blood Dragon takes Far Cry 3 back to the future with its 80's inspired retro futuristic mayhem. You're Sergeant Rex Colt, a Cyber Commando who has a simple mission...save the whole damn world.The core Far Cry 3 gameplay is still here, but given new life as you sneak about enemy outposts stalking prey for a silent takedown, assassinating targets with a well placed arrow, sniping pilots out of helicopters or simply picking up the biggest gun you can find and going to town on enemy Cyborgs like some crazy 80's action flick - complete with ridiculous story line, cheesy dialogue, neon visuals, synth soundtrack and more explosions than you can shake something highly explosive at.There is certainly more fun to be had for those that enjoy a more sandbox like environment as you almost always have options available for how you approach a given situation (the exception being a few missions that require you to kill a target with a specific weapon to succeed), whether you want to take things slow and stealthy or go in guns blazing the world is set up to allow for different playstyles. The game doesn't take itself seriously, poking fun at things like tutorials and collection quests (although it still puts you through them, annoyingly), it even has a laugh with its loading screen tips. It's well aware its a game and can suit quick pick up and play action or longer play sessions as you clear out outposts, hunt wildlife or just cause on the fly chaos. One drawback is the number of enemies, in many cases there just seems to be too few that even the largest of outposts can be cleared in under a minute...but it is usually a fun minute!If Far Cry 3 was a decent bottle of wine, Blood Dragon would be a few pints and a lot of shots. It may be a reduced game at a reduced price, but its not reduced the fun to be had. It's a more distilled Far Cry 3 experience that will suit both FPS fans that have yet to play Far Cry 3 and those that have, but want more of the same with some 80's flair on top.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Ubisoft MontrealPublishers: UbisoftInitial release: May 2013Genre: FPS, Action, Humor#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationFar Cry 3 Blood Dragon is a stand alone expansion of Far Cry 3 set in a satirical and trope filled cyberpunk 80's.This game is a smaller much more condensed version of Far Cry 3. The main campaign is only about 4 hours but there are plenty of collectables to extend the playtime. As well as what has become something of an expectation, outpost takeovers. Upon liberating those outposts you'll unlock a side mission or two. Consisting of a hostage rescue or hunting specific animals with a specific weapon type affairs. Its pretty strait forward, its enjoyable. Its Far Cry. One complaint I have with the game is that it is way too red, I realize it was an aesthetic choice but its kind of over powering. It feels as good if not better than other Far Cry games, however the main character is kind of a show off and does a lot of flipping guns and spinny junk which looks really cool but when you're looting corpses or switching weapons in the heat of battle it can get a little annoying. It has some genuine laughs, Ubisoft poking itself for collectables “I hope I don't have to collect any feathers” The cut-scenes are also a throwback and done in a rather decent pixel art style.  One aspect I really enjoy due to the games length is everything regarding character progression is sped up. No hunting a number of animals for their skin to expand wallet size or weapon holsters. Most abilities are unlocked immediately but still leaves room for more progression. Fall damaged is removed which is nice, movement speed is also much faster to the point where I never even bothered getting into a vehicle. Its nice to see Ubisoft do weird things like this instead of delving into the money machine with their cookie cutter prowess (Not that that's inherently a bad thing) Its also nice to see Ubisoft turn criticism into something fun; giving us, the players, a nod that they have heard you.Follow my curation for more "

												Cheesy lines, power ballads, montages, neon purple, DINOSAURS- the 80s were good to us, and now they live again in the form of Farcry 3: Blood Dragon. Cannot recommend this game more highly, especially for the price that it’s typically sold at (generally about $5 on sale). It’s only short, but has all of the finely tuned mechanics of the excellent Farcry 3, laced with all the brilliance of the best parts of Predator, Rocky, Rambo and Top Gun. It’s just an extremely solid game that happens to be extremely funny- you’ll want to play it as much for the gun play, stealth mechanics, visuals and level design as you will for the HANDGLIDING (insert guitar wail here), neon bow-and-arrow, Ninja Turtles references and…HANDGLIDING!Solid 9/10. Doesn’t bring anything particularly new to the table, but delivers a quality experience without ever taking itself too seriously. Expect about 10 hours of gameplay if you really take your time and enjoy.			"

												Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is very simular to the original Far Cry 3 with differences such as the 80's retro theme, the gun upgrading system, story, and in game atmosphere. Instead of a serious tone of story and atmosphere players are greeted with a very different and humorous response that breaks the 4th wall. This is a more cheeky and silly game compared to the original Far Cry 3 but does well in providing a fun and funny experience both through gameplay and dialog. Right at the start the game pokes fun at you with the tutorials and continues to do so with the talking HUD having a tendency to annoy the main character. Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon introduces a new enemy called Blood Dragons (duh) that shoot lazer beams from their eyes and look overall bad♥♥♥♥♥ The guns in Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon are limited compared to Far Cry 3 but have more attachment options. These attachments are unlocked and obtained through side missions and collecting collectables through the game. Instead of a vibrant and natural landscape Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon offers a night club feel with neon lights and dark colors to give a more retro enviorment. Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon should be considered a DLC more than a game but is still a fun and funny experience.			"

												Far Cry 3: Blood DRAY-GOWN is a stand alone game that welcomes you to a futuristic warlord's island stronghold. Set in the year 2007, this is the future that 1980s action movies foretold. Blood Dragon is an open world, first person shooter that lets you tackle situations how you want. Do you sneak up behind someone for a silent stealth kill? Snipe? Go in guns blazing or set traps? Its up to you. The enemies try their best to flank you. The outside world and indoor compounds have open rooms where you and the enemies can jockey for cover. The world itself is dark, like permanent night. The compounds, soldiers and vehicles are all highlighted with neon lights. Even your knife.I would like to say right now, Blood Dragon needs UPlay and it comes with UPlay, but not the UPlay you need. The forum is full of complaints about UPlay. You need to uninstall the version that comes with the game, visit their website, install the current version. Register with UPlay. Then have it and Steam open, register Blood Dragon with UPlay BEFORE you can play it. Once its registered with UPlay, you can play it offline. It worked for me and took me an hour trying to figure it out. So if that's a deal breaker, now you know.On the island, there are a lot of things going on. Omega Force is your enemy and there are scientists that are your friends. You'll come across them fighting out in the open. Its good to see the factions interacting. There is also exotic wild life that doesn't care who you are. The aggressive ones will attack anything. Cyber sharks, crocodiles, some sort of mutant emu and of course the giant blood dragons. These blood dragons are massive and covered in neon phosphorescent light. When they're passive, its green, spooked, yellow and hostile, red. You can rip out a dead soldier's cyber heart and use it as bait to lure the blood dragons. Not just that, but the cyber hearts prevent them from shooting lasers. While its interesting to see, I think I can kill a lot quicker than the dragons.Controls are like other first person shooters. Walk, unlimited run, look, aim weapon, shoot, weapon wheel, melee / stealth kill, jump, quick weapon switch between two weapons. Throw something, throw dice to distract an enemy, hold for health, reload and your cyber eye. The cyber eye lets you zoom in and out along with mark targets. With targets marked, you see them even when they're hiding. Its helpful, but you can also tag them just by aiming at them. You can only hold four weapons at a time, with all the throwable types, making for eight weapons. There is a sniper rifle, machine gun, short range shot gun, Robocop style machine gun pistol, chain gun, bow for stealth kills and flame thrower. Enemies have ammo, but its more efficient to find a vending machine that sells it. The machines also have maps, health and body armor. There's even a quick way to fully replenish your ammo for a price. Money becomes over abundant, you'll have so much.There are a few types of enemies, standard soldiers that you'll hear talk with their robo-voices. Snipers, molotov throwers to light the world on fire. Flame throwing incinerators, heavy armored chain gunners, attack dogs and later on, ""running dead"" that attack anything around them. They only die from headshots. Enemies will run for alarms if you don't disable them and the area will flood with more soldiers. The enemy intelligence is good that I feel like that's all there needed to be. Soldiers can take hold of turrets. Molotovs can light themselves on fire. There is the occasional grenade too. I ended up just melee killing everyone. Flame throwing soldier? No problem, stabbed 4 times. It got to the point where they'd literally run away from me when I'd run to them to stab. You can always regenerate your health, so why not? You'll get notified how close you are to getting seen and if enemies are alert to your presence.The main missions are entertaining and offer enough first person diversity to keep it interesting. Hang gliding, driving a jeep out of an exploding building, turret sections, frying dragon eggs with a flame thrower, waiting for an elevator straight out of an Aliens movie. The main mission took me under 8 hours on medium, but I feel like I only scratched the surface. The main missions will have you 'liberating garrisons' and you can liberate more than the game demands. Once liberated, they become spawn points when you die. If you try to leave the mission area, it will warn you that you'll fail.There are side missions that reward you with weapon upgrades. After the first side mission, I stuck with the main missions. Side missions like rescue a hostage, where any wrong move, the half dozen commandos will kill the hostage. Plus there are others that have you hunting wild animals. See it doesn't sound difficult, until you factor in the randomness. While hunting something, suddenly a jeep drives by and starts shooting you, then scientist run up and capture the jeep, then the emu begins chasing you only to get attacked by a blood dragon. All while the field is on fire from a molotov cocktail.Michael Bein lends his voice to Sargent Rex ""Power"" Colt, a cyber commando and with a name like that, you can expect over the top 1980s action. So far over the top that for the first few hours I didn't see it as funny or entertaining. They're so over the top that it doesn't get to the so bad its good realm. I just keep thinking wow they're trying hard. I've heard far too many, ""Remember the time we (adverb) (country) from (country)?"" I feel bad for Michael Bien for having to put up with whoever wrote the script. Its not a parody of 80s action movies, its a mockery of video games. I'll be honest and say anyone could have done this gravel voice, but Michael Bein lends 80s star power.To start the game and to end each main mission, you'll see a retro style cut scene. Its got a great art style, but these feel a lot longer than they need to be, because of the voice acting. You can always skip them. While the style is great, its just cheaper than having in game cut scenes for a $15 game.Now for the bad stuff. As I mentioned before, UPlay was a pain, but more than that its the little things. The smallest step or height difference would block me 90% of the time unless I jumped. This even included the bottom of staircases. I fell through the world while inside a compound. Pilfering bodies has its own animation and pilfering 30 dead bodies just takes way too long from big room to big room. Loading a saved game doesn't put you at the last checkpoint, it puts you at the start of the mission. The hit detection for the blood dragons was pretty awful. They'd be far away and still hit me. Grass sometimes isn't attached to the hills. I felt like the game ran out of ideas for main story missions and just threw me into a horde mode.With all that said, the final mission was might be the highest point of any game that I've ever played. As unmoved by the comedy as I was the entire game, it just clicked for me. I enjoyed the hilarity of the final hour. The cut scene before the final mission, feeling powerful for the final mission, the surprise dragon ride at the end. Even though the game ended without a boss battle, I was still highly entertained.Its a solid sandbox first person shooter. I can forgive its flaws. Its a unique world, but I don't want to stay in. I prefer daytime and environments other than black and neon lights. They do a good job of recreating scenes from movies and that final hour was incredible.			"

												You know what's awesome? The 80s, specifically 80s action movies, with their simple no-nonsense plot lines about badass dudes saving the world from ultimate destruction, with synth heavy rock blaring in the background and explosions around every corner. Remember those? Blood Dragon definitely does, in fact it does such a good job of paying homage while simultaneously parodying them that it almost feels like it's a recently unearthed time capsule, built with technology far ahead of its time and hidden until the public was ready for it. That time is now; Blood Dragon is here and it's flipping sweet!As Sargent Rex ""Power"" Colt, former army vet killed and then brought back to life Robocop style as a superhuman cyborg, it's up to you to put a stop to the tyrannical plot of your former commander, who plans to harness the blood of the cyber dragon to bring about a new age for humanity no matter the costs. The plot is cheesy, over the top, full of outrageous one liners and more explosions than a Michael Bay film, and outrageously fun for all of it. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard playing a game as with Blood Dragon, which perfectly nails the balance between self aware cheese and playing up the ridiculousness of itself.And of course, Blood Dragon plays exactly how you'd expect, by which I mean to say it makes you feel like the incredible cyber soldier that you are, liberating the remote supernatural island bit by bit as you pop off robots, save the helpless nerds, and face off against cyber dragons (essentially giant dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes). For a budget game, Blood Dragon is surprisingly expansive, with the island being surprisingly large and chock full of side missions, collectibles, and cyber animals for you to hunt. It's not on the level of Far Cry 3 proper, but the size feels perfect for the sort of game it's trying to be, without any bloat and a fantastic ending which I won't spoil but is one of my favorites of any game in years.If I was going to nitpick, my biggest complaint would be that the constant darkness contrasting with the neon color palette can be rather hard on the eyes after awhile, making this a game best played in short bursts if you don't want to go into self induced blindness. Other minor issues arise with the somewhat weak gunplay and the difficulty of trying to maneuver any vehicle around the island (I eventually gave up driving and just sprinted to my destination) can be bothersome at times, but never made enough of an impact to lessen my enjoyment.Blood Dragon is a game designed to allow you to relive the glory days of silly action movies, updated with modern sensibilities to be nothing but unadulterated fun. It doesn't take itself the slightest bit seriously, and focuses all its energy into building itself up as a love letter to nonsensical action and soundtracks that you can't help but love (the music might be the best thing in the game, period). As long as you don't go into it expecting anything deeper than ""kill the bad guy"" and take it for what it is, Blood Dragon will shower you in it self indulging awesomeness and have you begging for more.

												The game is awesome it's like the movies American Ninja, Predator, Escape from New york, and The Octagon all in one. Now some people get mad at the fact that you have to play this game through Uplay rather than just only through steam. That's not really a big deal considering most Ubisoft games are through Uplay now days, Exspecially the good ones. Also ive heard complaints about the map looking the same everywhere you go, But keep in in mind that's just because that's the theme of the island it's all simular but still different. In my opinion geographly speaking. Now this game really isn't at all like Far cry 3 mainly because it's a Completely differnt game in it's self lol. So don't Expect Vas to be in it. Now if you liked the 80s decade or any of the far cry games then this is a must own. Many nostalgic references are made in this game making it even kooler.You are an american hero who's half man hallf machine killing dragons with lazers for cripe sake So purchase this game NOW PEOPLE 12/10			"

												I'm going to be the odd man out on this one. Blood Dragon has cool visuals, a very campy 80's feel, some decent bits of humor, and a kick-awesome soundtrack.Yet where Blood Dragon suffers is when it tries to be over-the-top ridiculous and use the Far Cry 3 game mechanics at the same time. You're given a rifle that can shoot lasers, turrets, a minigun, a laser you mount on your wrist, and you're supposed to feel like the ultimate badass that can kill everything.Yet the Far Cry mechanics call for stealth, not run-and-gun. So for example if you do a hostage mission, you have all these cool guns that you just want to go pew pew and boom boom with, but if you get spotted by the guards then you have seconds until the hostage is killed. What? These mechanics that fail to properly invent exciting combat are fully realized with the Blood Dragons. There is no real strategy to kill them, other to mercilessly run and shoot. Left 4 Dead makes this fun because the gunplay makes sense. Here it simply does not.Oh, and by the way, you use the same button to heal yourself and to extinguish fire on you. Due to the first person perspective, it's difficult to tell when you are on fire and when there's just fire around you. So you press Q before you are given the prompt to do so thinking you can put out the fire early. Instead, you just waste a syringe/time healing yourself and then you're still on fire.Overall, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and just want to have a more absurd version of that, this will suit you well. If you want to be the ultimate badass, play Serious Sam or Saints Row or anything else that is actually BUILT for that.			"

												Did you grow up in the 1980s? Did you enjoy terribly made 80's Sci-Fi B-Movies like Terminator? Do you enjoy 80s-Style Musical motiffs? If so, then this game is for you. I would say it is actually for anyone.Pros:+ Doesn't take itself seriously+ Cheesy Plot+ Still looks decent in 2016+ Musical score matches the theme+ A Few hours of fun+ Blood Dragons+ Some funny cultural referencesCons:- It's short- Limited replayability- Small World to exploreAll in all, I enjoyed the game for what it was. Judging by those merits, it's worth a play through, unless you don't enjoy FPS games at all or anything 80s. I would actually hope they could make a sequel to the game, but that probably wouldn't happen. Instead we get Trials of the Blood Dragon which actually looks quite fun!			"

 CYBER SEX So before I acquired this game, Ive heard people opinionate about how bad this game is, How it rips off Crysis etc etc etc etc.... All those f*cktards.....Seriously.....this game is like an 80's post appocalyptic movie set inside Jurassic park where the t rexes have a unique ability to shoot lasers from eyes (Maybe cause of the nuking of Canada...u know radioactive♥♥♥♥♥♥mutates creatures). Anyways, then we have the Terminator (except this time Micheal Beihn plays terminator and Arnold....hope he plays this game) and the baddie from Commando who apparently is the dragonborn of this world (he Drinks Dragon blood and is Uber powerful). Then like most games, we have the person we work for Dr Elizabeth Darling in this case whos a Canadian scientist working under Sloan and a huge videogame addict. So the stage is set......add some neons, lotsa cyber omega force, mutated animals...........and yes the Blood Dragons. The entire game looks like a movie James Cameroon would have taken back in te 80s. U can choose your playstyle too, play stealth like Rambo with jus a bow and arrow, or go Raging Rambo on enemies with the Gattling gun. You can go all John Woo on them with guns and swords, or Blow ♥♥♥♥ up like Micheal Bay. Nerds battling robots is the best thing to watch tho.....u can lend em a hand, or be evil and have fun watchiong them tear each other apart.....Guess what I do? I throw a cyberheart right in between them and wait for the BDs to kill them all ......Gawd Im saddisticMy rating :8 for the game1 for the finger 1 for Beihn and 1 for that quote >.>Rex Colt: Woah Doc, you play videogames? Dr. Darling: Yes, Rex. Videogames are a proven coping mechanism, like any hobby. They've been shown to improve hand-eye coordination, problem solving, social interaction, and self-confidence. And no studies have managed to to prove a correlation between videogames and violence. Frankly, anyone who thinks games are bad for you is a f*cking idiot. Rex Colt: Woah there Doc! Easy! Dr. Darling: No Rex. F*ck stands for: Failing to Understand our Capacity for Kindness. It's an acronym. Though I suppose this isn't a game anymore, is it? 11/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon 

			Views: 1,455		

			Our Analog Review of Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon by Senior Reviewer Trent. You can also join us on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AnalogReviewsOfficial or Raptr:...		

Exemplifying the garish excess of the times, the action films of the 1980's and early 90's have become nostalgic artifacts from the youth of many of today's gamers. Far Cry 3's stand alone add on Blood Dragon capitalizes on this as an entirely ridiculous, self aware gaming experience that bathes in a pool of 80's action cinema staples. It's not exactly a new idea but since we are laughing at Duke Nukem instead of with him these days, it's safe to say there is room on the market for a game like this. Montages, a synth soundtrack, one liners, vicious weapons and colossal lizards that shoot lasers out of their eyes are central elements of this love letter to all things awesomely bad about 80's action flicks. Blood Dragon takes the core elements of Far Cry 3 and grafts them into Blood Dragon's scan line littered world. It's landscape is dotted with outposts that look like GI Joe playsets which can be captured from enemy hands. These outposts have varying layouts and terrain that encourage you take take a new approach to each one. In these sequences the Blood Dragon's play their biggest role. These creatures have atrocious eye sight allowing you to sneak past them and can be lured with cyber hearts. Using the tools at your disposal, you can get the dragons to do your dirty work for you; though, if things go wrong they can become a much more formidable obstacle than the cyborgs that you are trying to clear out in the first place. Taking these outposts allows Rex to fast travel to that point and opens predator and hostage rescue missions. Predator missions task your cyborg hero with killing a unique creature or unit with a specific weapon while hostage rescues give you the job a saving a scientist from enemy hands. The wrinkle to these missions is that alerting the enemy to your presence will cause the guards to shot the hostage so some stealth is required to complete these tasks. Completing these mildly repetitive missions as well as collecting the various files, VHS tapes and televisions strewn around the island unlock weapon attachments. Being able to main enemies with a quad barrel shotgun with flaming rounds or a sniper rifle that uses exploding ammunition ensures that these side tasks are worth seeing through. The seven main missions can be completed in just a couple of hours so doing the side missions is highly encouraged.Blood Dragon suffers from an imperfect upgrade progression. Killing enemies grants you cyber points which acts as experience. With every level he gains, Rex becomes stronger, receiving more health and special abilities. I wholly expected Rex to become a nigh invincible hard♥♥♥♥♥but the point at which he becomes a demi-god comes much too quickly. With a few levels and weapon upgrades Blood Dragon not only becomes unchallenging but most of the finer points of completing the side missions are decimated with a sledgehammer. It becomes unnecessary to rescue hostages stealthily when you can mow through a half dozen guards faster than they can kill a single scientist. Capturing outposts also suffers once it becomes feasible to stand toe to toe with twenty enemies using your mini gun.With it's skies polluted by unicorn flatulence and flourishes of neon glow, Blood Dragon's aesthetic could be best described as a gay pride parade held in Gary, Indiana. The skies are hazy and red, the waters murky and black and colorful ruins dot the island. The terrain isn't as intricate as Far Cry 3 but there are enough landmarks and areas of interest to make it interesting to explore. Creatures with unusual color pallets and glowing eyes roam the island ready to pick Rex apart if provoked. Blood Dragon emphasizes artistic style rather than the technical prowess of the engine. The soundtrack, courtesy of Power Glove, is absolutely incredible and may be the single element that most sells Blood Dragon as a throwback to 80's action films.			"

												This game is hilarious.It's essentially Far Cry 3 reskinned. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3, you've gotta return for the laughs and the lasers. If you haven't played Far Cry 3, this is still definitely worth playing. It's full of '80s sci fi cliches and hilarious voice acting.A great, lighthearted, 5 hour experience.			"

												Take everything awesome from the 80's and combine it with Far Cry 3's open ended gameplay and environments and you've got Blood Dragon. This is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously but practically forces you to enjoy yourself. Worth playing for Michael Biehn's performance alone.Full video review:

			Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a stand-alone expansion of Far Cry 3, developed by Ubisoft Montreal. The game takes place on a retro-futuristic open world island crawling with evil, with players assuming...

												Just finished Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon and also watched the short-movie ending credits. Good Lord, Ubi has a felt million employees.Anyway, to the game. Glorious, ridiculous, to the point. Shocked such a dumb premise got greenlit by a big pub. Glad it did. The game is fun, very much so but I advise against clearing the strongholds. I did a couple after every main mission and it totally broke the pacing. It's boring, repetitive and not worth it. You get one to two side missions in every liberated garrison but they are copy-paste small mindless chores after the first few times. They unlock one weapon modification in the in-game store but honestly, they are not worth it. Most are just needless while others are way overpowered and take any challenge out of the already easy game. But most of all, they brake the otherwise perfect pacing of the game. Forget about garrisons and any other side occupation, just focus on the main missions which are great fun. Cutscenes and story were absurd, stupid fun and the soundtrack is just a gem. Went for all stereotypical action movie cliche and it just fits. Give this one a go, it's short and sweet.			"

												Lets you live out your 80s action movie and 90s saturday morning cartoon power fantasies. -For you Terminator fans: Be both a Terminator and Kyle Reese: SIMULTANEOUSLY.-For you Alien fans: Play as Cyber-Dwayne Hicks and burn a nest full of eggs with a flamethrower.-For you RoboCop fans: Use Murphy's signature handgun and a Sniper based directly off one of the props. Listen out for the ED-209 voice cameo.-For you Predator fans: Have a grip contest with an awesome African American supporting character and slaughter enemies from a helicopter using the onboard minigun while listening to Little Richard's ""Long Tall Sally"".There's literally something for every cheesy Sci-fi enthusiast here. Arguably the best game in the Far Cry series.			"

												+ Totally badass (Laser Dinosaurs!)+ Soundtrack+ Humor++ for making this standalone DLCA short but inexpensive game that shows us how developers can take their existing IP and transform it into something that plays the same, but feels so completely different in an awesome way.Definitely pick this one up.

												I've never seen DLCs like this before. It doesn't add anything new to your game like costumes, imbalanced weapons or maps, everything you typically want from downloadables......but this gives you something new: brand-new story, which is truly epic and 80's like (if you are from 80-s or at least 90-s, you can find a lot of easter eggs from that time!), the music which was perfomed by Power Glove and their retro kind of style fit the game, the voices and dialogues and so on. Just look at the art-cover!It's a real masterpiece just because there is nothing like this. At all. I enjoyed every bit of the game and if they come out with something like this, I'd definitely give it a try...because it would be a worhtwhile waste of time, wouldn't it be?P.S.

												First of all was not sure if i should get this but seen it on sale so i thought why the hell not and boy do i not regret it. A amazing send up of all those 80s action movies with big explosions, cheesy one liners and rocking music to blow the hell out of things. Story a little short but can expand on that with some side missions and exploring the whole island. Did enjoy this game and hope they bring back Rex 'power' Colt for a sequel, if you love Neon visuals, cheesy one liners and explosive gameplay then you gotta buy this. 10/10			"

												You blink at your tablet screen and yawn,stretching as the class ends and everyonepacks up for the day. You still need toworry about your shift at the bookstore,what groceries to get and catch up withyour girlfriend, Summer-Rain. On the train ride back from work, youwonder how it got this advanced in soshort a time. Gone were the days oflazily kicking back and eating cerealin front of the TV in the morning, thelatest Hollywood film that would makeeveryone leave in awe and this sense,this pervasive sense that the future wewould live in would be dimly lit withhealthy amounts of neon.So you've called Summer-Rain over butshe won't be here for another hour, oneof her class keeping her back. Shrugging,you open steam and go through your list,before stopping at a game which no oneis able to take seriously. Pressing play,nostalgia and parody are united, therecan be only one.FAR CRY 3: BLOOD DRAGON!Your good friend Spyder is dead, and you, having stepped into the shoes of oneSgt. Rex ""Power"" Colt, is all that standsbetween the homicidal madman with hisplan of world domination and the free world.Your ex-commanding officer who you lookup to as your father figure, Colonel Sloan,has gone AWOL and is feared to havebetrayed the red, white and blue you sogloriously uphold in high regard. It makes matters worse that Dr. ElizabethDarling (yes... that's her name) is kidnappedand forced to draw the blood of the game'sApex-wildlife, the Blood Dragons, to powerSloan's nukes and grant h e and his new Cyborg ilk the superhuman abilities toconquer the world!In Blood Dragon, the world of Far Cry 3 isturned on its head and you revisit every80s-90s era of video game settings, whereall animals are inexplicably cyborgs, and theenemy variety range from flamethrowers togrunts with rocking fashion sense, leatherbiker jackets coupled with daft-punk helmets,and neon, neon everywhere.The plot is downright laughable, lampooningmovies from ""Predator"", ""Alien"", the classic""Transformers Movie"" and even (spoilers)""Thriller"". The interface is reminiscent of thecodec from ""Metal Gear Solid"", and Rex Colt'sCyber-Commando program is less than a thinly veiled analogue to both ""Terminator"" and""Universal Soldier"".The soundtrack is to die for, transporting youback to the heyday of your childhood, eatingbread and ice cream with your grandparentson lazy weekdays waiting for your parents tocome home from work, grade school amid theglare of sci-fi laser fire and superhuman heroes,and finally to the closing of your adolescencewhere your life changed with your path crossingMs. Novocaine's. Life was good.All of this is too much for you to take in withinthe first three hours, and for a game scheduledto be DLC, it feels like an entirely separate onein its own right. You liberate garrisoned forts and save sci-fi nerds in lab coats, battling theoccassional Blood Dragon and cyborg animalwith an array of weapons with too much neonon them.""What are you playing?! Is that TRON?""A familiar voice says over your shoulder, andyour lovely vision of darkness, Summer-Rainis looking at you play Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.""It looks like an overbaked 80's action movie,complete with pixelated cutscenes."" She says,hands on her hips and a scrunched-up smileon her face. ""That's because it is!"" You reply,switching out your neon bow and arrow fora sniper rifle... with neon.""Seriously?"" Summer-Rain asks, striding overnext to your desk and you see she came backhome from her physics class, clad in a whiteblouse and pencil skirt, looking a lot like Dr.Elizabeth Darling from the game. ""Summer..."" You begin, in awe at how pretty she looks in a pencil skirt and her mid-length hair, gold bangs accenting her fringe today.""Have you cooked dinner yet...?"" She smiles,posing just like Dr. Darling from the game, whereupon you inwardly curse your sense of immersion. This isn't the first time that the immersion was this bad, ""I'm sorry Summer, I'm sorry-""Summer-Rain kisses you on the cheek andunpauses Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon with an evilsmirk and a wink. ""Go save the world, Starboy.I'll get your ingredients out downstairs first.""""10 minutes, 10 minutes...!"" You manage,while dodging bullets and firing wildly at a Blood Dragon. Summer-Rain shakes her head. ""I'll be halfway done with cooking our food then! I'm giving you 5 minutes, Starboy Coldheart! Not more...""You turn round at her pause to see her blouseobscure your vision, Summer-Rain havingthrown it at you and walked down topless.""...no less."" You remove her blouse, the scentof strawberries hanging about you, your mouthagape. It's not every day that Summer-Rain uses yourfull name. Not wanting to miss a cook-off witha view, Blood Dragon's theme plays throughoutyour journey below to Summer-Rain once again.FAR CRY 3.BLOOD DRAGON! "

												Rating: 8/10Overview: Open World First Person ShooterThe Good:+ Graphics that still hold up very well + An atmosphere and story featuring a retro 1980's sci fi theme. The game is completely self aware of this and uses every cliché and overtop gimmick it can think of and cram into one story. If you grew up in the 80's and you enjoyed cheesy b-level movies, this game nails that feeling. + A variety of guns with attachments that can be unlocked by completed some very easy side quests. + Solid shooting mechanics. + A soundtrack ripped straight from the original terminator and that’s awesome.  The Average:The game has scanlines to give it a more retro feeling, unfortunately this makes the game look worse with no option to turn it off. Luckily you can hex edit a file to remove them. Its not a very long game however the game doesn't over extend its stay either. As per every Ubisoft game, expect pointless collectables.Conclusion:A well written game feature an over the top story. If you grew up in the 80's then you would immediately understand this game, if you didn't then play this game and see what cheesy level sci fi is all about. "

												Well the game was great until a major update to Uplay jacked it all up and now the game just randomly crashes for no reason than to crash.  I have this version I bought that is unplayable and a torrented version, Now take a wild guess which one works perfectly without crashes.      I would have recommended this game in the past but as it is it randomly crashes during the worst of times and it destroys progress.    Fairwell my old time friend - your entertainment value was great while it lasted.      Maybe Ubisoft needs to Iconisize their ability to ruin good games and not understand what gamers want.   I still don't dare buy primal for the pc as that has many problems much like this.   The fact that two asset heavy overlayed framworks are running at the same time and one is superior to the other has to be blamed for the crashes as Uplay still has major memory leaks.   If you want to bog people down with Uplay Ubisoft - Take your♥♥♥♥♥♥off steam and sale it only On Uplay.    You dumbarses.			"

If all DLC could be like this, everyone would love DLC.Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is a standalone game that is extremely enjoyable and is a good throwback to the 80s. If you are familiar with how things work in Far Cry 3, this game should be no problem for you. The twist here is that there are now huge ""blood dragons"" on the planet. Remember in Far Cry 3, when you could use an animal to storm an enemy base. In BD, simply toss a cyberheart (The hearts of the enemies you killed) near a group of enemies and watch as they get wrecked. Story:The year is 2007 and the game takes place in a dystopian world. You, Sergeant ""Rex"", must investigate Colonel Sloan and see what he is up to. In short, kill bad guys, save people, be the hero. Guns, guns, and...awesome guns that...kill stuff:Gunplay is similar to Far Cry 3. You capture outposts (Garrisons) and you can hunt wild animals to unlock more goods. Good news is that you already have 4 weapon slots at the start and all the guns are already unlocked (well at least most of them). You startout with a pistol, a rifle, a sniper rifle, and an old styled shotgun (One word: reloadgasm). There are a lot of videogame references and inside jokes so be on the lookout for them.Sound...gasm:What happens when you have Power Glove making the soundtrack? Imagine taking Hotline Miami and mixing it with Superheroes (that's sort of like it). The soundtrack will give you the feeling that you just traveled back in time and the music goes perfectly with the events in the game. Rex (No, not the dinosaur):Rex is the guy who loves giving terrible puns and one liners so be ready for that :) In some cases, he even breaks the fourth wall. Should you buy this game?: For a quarter price of a usual ""AAA"" title, you can have a huge laugh and an explosive time in this dystopian world.			"

												What can I say about Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon, its horrible, cheesy, awful characters, cliches, and is worth every penny . Everything you could ask for in a tribute to a to the 80's including the VHS quality graphics. You play as “Sergeant Rex Colt” with a name like that you can't fail.  The intro video will have you laughing the initial tutorial will have you saying “What did I get myself into?”  Fantastic game makes you think of dusting off the Nintendo or even the Atari for some great retro gaming. :Rex:			"

												Simply put, its the best worst game you'll ever play. Take the awesome free roam gameplay of Far Cry 3 and replace its wonky, terrible story with a terrible but awesome 80's story and you get Blood Dragon. Guitar solo, flip off enemies, wield the power of the ancients and mix in some awkward scenes, and you have a romp through one of the best decades in American culture. Honestly, if FC3 just replaced their weird, supposedly deep introspect on gamer culture with Blood Dragon's over the top, neon lit rampage, I'd play more of it.			"

												A throwback to the 80s where cyborgs, aliens, lasers and mutated beings were the norm…or at least we thought there were…You are a Cyber Commando and your mission is: To Save the World. An over-the-top FPS shooter with great soundtracks and a cyberpunk setting. Quite the reminisce if you ask me. Graphics: 9/10Straight out from what the future would’ve looked like if you were imagining it from the 1980s. Neon lights, multicolour lasers and robotic arms are seen throughout the entire game. Some might even say they are too bright. Storyline: 7/10It’s a very simple – “get the girl and save the world because you’re the only one who can do it!”. I guess it’s the 1980s and this would be the norm, but it just seemed a bit too generic for me really; they should’ve tried something more unique as with sticking with the original theme. Nonetheless, the game will feed you a ton of 80s references and over the top comedy that will keep you entertained for the rest of the game. Sound: 10/10Do I even need to say anything here?? I mean it’s just pure awesomeness with everything about the soundtracks. Especially the voice acting and the minigun sound…they are so satisfying to hear. Gameplay: 8/10You either go in quiet and unnoticed or just go in full metal mode and barge in the room with your shotgun, it’s up to you. You’ll have fun either way. The weaponry, the enemies and the vehicles are well refined to have an enjoyable gameplay. The only downsides are the random frame drops when the game AutoSaves and it requires Uplay for you to be able to play. Price: 6/10Asking for £11.99 is a bit too much for the amount of time you can complete this game (around 6-8 hours), it’s not worth the ‘pound per hour’ if you’re wondering that. But it is certainly worth getting when it goes on a sale. Then I’d totally recommend it.  "

												I have completed 100% of the achievements and did everything in the game that there was to do (including collecting all items ever). I did enjoy 90% of the game although some parts left a more sour taste. The beginning is a long super-linear tutorial (1 hours+ in length) where you can not save your progress and the ending includes some really badly made arena fights, which are absolutely horribly designed and don't fit in at all (ending itself is also 1 hour+ long without a saving option). However, all other things were great! Very funny 90s B-movie-esque humor, great setting, funny retro-cutscenes, overall very solid gunplay (except arena), very good music, cheesy and funny voice-acting, enough stuff to do and things to explore. Although the game is quite short it is still a great value for the price!			"

												A very good, 80's stylized shooter with kickass soundtrack, atmosphere and gameplay. I love it, but its length is almost a sin. I managed to FULLY finish the game in merely 6 hours and that includes the side-quests, getting all the TVs, VCRs, notes and buying all the upgrades (all of this on the hardest difficulty). However, I can assure you that the expierence I received from this product was amazing and very ""full"" even though it was short. I can easily compare this to watching a good movie.It's not worth the full price in my opinion, but if you want it  don't hesitate and get it when it's on sale - you will not regret it.			"

												+ 80s impovisation+ High quality action- Compared to Far Cry 3 and other FPS relatevely shortOde to the golden 80s. Blood Dragon sums up everything which was glamour - bright lights,  synth pop, shoulder pads etc, and forms  a tremendous experience loaded with adrenaline and testosterone. This is crowned by voice talents such as Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens), Grey DeLisle and iconic Phil LaMarr.Having same mechanisms as its big brother original Far Cry 3 the gameplay is fun and controls work fine. Between main quests player is free to roam in a world and assault on hostile compounds. Enemies can be wiped out loud or silently. This stealthy way is much more difficult, but always possible.To play Blood Dragon you need to have or create an account in UPlay, which I'm going to criticize only by saying that it feels vain. More significant problem is the content in the game which took me 7 hours to complete and I beat almost anything the game had to offer! There is no separate Co-Op campaing.Thus, Blood Dragon is a great game all the way but could've been longer. So if you don't need it now pick it in sales and enjoy the fireworks!			"

As far as I can tell you cant launch the other version of the game even when you go to the .exe cause Uplay gets in your way. This game has been out for ages and a bug like this is still around?

												The year is 2007. It is the future. The world has been overrun by killer cyborgs, and only one cyber commando can stop them. This is Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, an amazing FPS that takes its weaponry and style from the films of the 80s and its missions and attitude from the FPSs of the 90s. It packs more memorable moments into its $15 price point than most FPSs nowadays can fit in at $60. The weapons, from Arnie's shotgun from T2, to Robocop's handgun, have a distinct kick that makes the combat addictingly fun. You could spend hours planning out stealth runs to take out dudes with shuriken and a neon katana, or you can charge in with your minigun and a sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds. I haven't even mentioned the dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes. When you were a kid, this is the type of video game you dreamed about playing, and it was worth the wait. There wasn't another game this entire year that ripped my attention away from Blood Dragon, and after three playthroughs it still feels amazing. You're doing yourself a disservice by not playing it right now, even if you've already completed it. My GOTY 2013. No contest.			"

												Udon'tPlay most of the time.Yet another game ruined by Ubisoft's failure of a platform.If Ubisoft wants to tie its games to a proprietary online distributor (and an extra level of DRM), they sould make their own. Oh, wait, they have - but very few people fall for it. So, they keep trying to piggy-back it onto STEAM games!I only managed to access the game for a few hours and the entire experience was ruined by the fickle and unstable UPlay servers that (whenever they are up) they do NOT work well with STEAM. Ubisoft managed to fool me a number of times on STEAM (in most of their STEAM games they even shy away from mentioning the Uplay requirement on the secondary DRM warning). This game made me to first check the Discussion forum before any potential purchase. Uplay: putting the U in F-U!			"

												A standalone mod, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a retro-futuristic FPS action-adventure game based on an island where you play as a cyborg. The game does an amazing job of putting over the 80's, retro, ""robots are going to take over the world"" theme. A fairly medium sized story mode will entertain you as you stop the bad guys, kill the evil robots and save the world. After you've done all that, there is a number of unlockables and side-missions to keep you busy after you've saved the day.One issue that people might find a bit annoying is that you need to download and install and then register your game with Uplay in order to play Blood Dragon. I didn't have any problems on my end, but it seems to be a different case with some other players. Overall, there shouldn't be much of a problem with Uplay and this game is worth it you enjoy these types of games.			"

Ever wanted to be the ultimate 1980's action hero??Well HERE IS YOUR CHANCE.Despite being out for well over a year, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon still proves that games with outlandish plots and pure unadulturated action can still make for one very fine masterpiece of gaming. For those who watched such movies like First Blood, Commando, Robocop (the original), this is one's dream come true. If you haven't, you will still get a kick out of Rex POWER Colt's no-frills personality and nigh-endless one-liners that flow out of him with every action and major scene.Coming from someone who has not played the original Far Cry 3 game, Blood Dragon certainly feels very fresh in my hands and runs smoothly on a middling PC. Neon-colors dot almost every inch of the violent island, definitely giving it that neo cyberpunk feeling. Almost all of the creatures that inhabit said island are given some kind of shiny robot-like texture, signifying just how MUCH of everything was hit with cybernetics. Oh, and already starting out with a plethoral of abilities will make it hard for me to try out the original Far Cry 3 with far weaker (and less cool) puny human.Campaign is somewhat short-ish, but for a cheap stand-alone title with loads of humor (and the fact that said Campaign can be extnded via going on a Garrison takeover spree), no doubt this game has (already) found plenty of fans clamouring for more.

												It's a love letter to 80's sci-fi action movies with the campy b-rated'ness cranked up to 11.Everyone's pretty much already said what there is to say about the game. So, here's some fun trivia about 80's action sci-fi from someone that grew up watching it in the 80's...* As the 80's rolled in, computer graphics stated taking off, most notably with CGA (which had a vivid, neon Magenta, Cyan, White and Black as it's prominent color scheme). Since computers were ""the future"", a lot of what folks saw in computer graphics (going from monocrhome green/amber screens to CGA) fueled some of the neon explosion of the 80's in regards to computer graphics art work about what the future might look like. Hence, the neon pinks (magenta) and neon blues (cyan) mixed with white and black. Other neon colors were popular in pop-culture, but since comptuers were being used more for marketing and graphics, the CGA color pallette really impacted a lot of 80's style (hence hot pink / magenta lettering and stuff).* Movies of old required a huge orchastra to create the sound track. When the synthesizer came around, you could instead hire one guy working with a keyboard and some sound editing software on a computer or in a small studio to do all the music. This was much cheaper for movie production studios to help them cut costs, and is why synth music became so iconinc to 80's movies. With the advent of more portable cameras and computers, you could have very low-cost movie produciton with just a few people handling the sound, music, camera work, etc... hence the explosion of B-rated movies in the 80's.* The 70's drug trips were mostly LSD and psychadelics which caused colorful trippy highs, which was reflected in a lot of the iconic art of the 70's. These gave way and mixed with the cocaine boom of the 80's, which amped everyone up with tons of energy and the ability to stay up all night (or even go for days/nights without sleep). Mix in the CGA computers for graphics that people used for movie sfx and ""future art"", and you end up with the iconic 80's dark, gritty, neon look.... a look that suggests ""it's the future (neon), but things are bleak (darkness from cocaine fueled nights)"".

												This game is what a game needs to be, fun above all else, say what you will about Ubisoft and I will agree, but this time they did quite well at remaking the 80-90s visuals.  While the ride is short, around 6 hours if you clear most of the outposts and side missions to level your character up, since it is a Farcry 3 game it’s very open and has a level of replayability.  The story is good enough with the cutscense using old school 16 bit still images which again add to the old school feeling of the game.  However what it doesn’t do is take itself serious, this is a comedy game make no mistakes and the comedy that is there is fairly solid though younger players who did not live though the 80s and 90s might not get many of the references or be able to fully appreciate what the game is showing you.  The game’s style is great though the scan lines might give people the wrong impression about the visuals of the game though they do seem to muddy up the image a bit.  However with everything being neon in tone it’s not hard to find objects, enemies and animals within the game.  Blood dragons are by far one of the coolest natural animals that you will see in many games and they fit very well within the universe, they are also a force to be reckoned with, before you gain the highest level that is.  The one major advantage of this game is that once you to get to the highest level and max out most/all of the sub missions you will feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ unlike in Farcry 3 which was at times rather bland once you gained your full powers.  The arsenals are awesome though some are more useful then others, some are more customizable then FC3 while others are less so however the important ones you do have the ability to make almost every weapon 10 times better.  If any of this sounds good to you then by all means buy it and enjoy, whether it be for the humor or the fun gameplay you will enjoy your time spent playing FC3: Blood Dragon.			"

												I guess this is a... Review to a Kill...That will be the one and only cheesy pun in this review of Ubisoft's Standalone Expansion 'Far Cry 3- Blood Dragon', as anymore will leave you feeling a little bloated when you get into the madness that is this game. You see, Blood Dragon is a spoof-game on so many levels: It spoofs the 80s VHS Action Movie Genre and perhaps most impressive it spoof's Ubisoft's gameplay style to perfection!I have a question to ask: Have you seen and enjoyed the following movies?AliensRamboTerminatorTransformers?Do you enjoy movies starring the follow actors?Jean Claude Van DammeMichael BiehnArnieDo you tell all your friends that all the best music was made in the 80s? Do you still dream of a world where synths and neon lights in a not-so-distant dystopia society rule over the masses? Well I might just have the game for you..!It's a FPS based around the Far Cry 3 engine, so if you've played Far Cry 3 than you should know what to expect. If you haven't then be prepared to be dropped on an 'open world' Island that you're free to explore at your will. There are various collectibles, unlockables, etc (such are Ubisoft Games), as well as your standard enemie types. It's a fun game that really embraces the subject material it's lampooning from the very first moment the game boots up. The actual gameplay itself is tired and nothing new, yet it's the character and the world around you that keeps you playing. The one liners drew me back to a day when Duke Nukem was considered a master piece, and thankfully this game has as many one liners as it does bullets and mindless violence! In fact, it's perhaps all the supporting material that keeps Blood Dragon feeling like a breath of fresh air in a very worn out genre void of much originality. The strange neon visuals look stunning at times as you storm into Garrisons to kill the Biker Helmet wearing nameless bad guys to a very satisfying Synth based soundtrack. The little details make the big experience worthwhile, so if you're not too fond of those details you'll perhaps not enjoy the game as much as I did. If, however, you find yourself going back to the stack of movies you have starring Action Heros from the 80s than this game might just help reignite your interest in FPS. + 80's Action Hero Genre+ One Liners+ Spoofs+ Doesn't Out Stay It's Welcome - I have no idea if they'll make a follow up to this genre! - Worn out gameplayOverall a satisfying short experience for 80s Action/Sci-Fi Movie Buffs, but it might not be for everyone's tastes.

												I hope you are aware that this game needs Uplay and a uplay account. And uplay taps a service into your system, so it might be a nice backdoor. Oh, and uplay already got hacked and user data was stolen. so think about it. a cracked version of this game might be a safer choice.			"

												Have you ever wanted to experience the retro-futuristic world as envisioned in the 1970s in Kung Fury?You should check out the Kung Fury game. It's on Steam somewhere.But if you want more, Blood Dragon should sate your thirst for Action, Drama and America. It's a game that delivers a solid gut-punch to the undemocratic intestines of poor game design, distilling the best aspects of freedom-loving, world-saving badassery into one several-hours-long adventure on a remote island that needs to be quarantined. With lead and lasers.Not for: kids, Canadians, wimps.Only for: True Patriots.			"

Delightfully 80s retraux.- Soundtrack by Power Glove is incredibly solid.- Standalone expansion, so it doesn't require the base game.- Loves to go on sale, which makes up for the length.Cons:- Very short. Expect six hours for 100% completion.- Will ruin the original Far Cry 3 for you, since the main character in this game is significantly overpowered in comparison.			"

												Clearly, one of the best games I had my hands on to have fun and to get to do whatever I want. It cheerfully combines all the different things I love in videogames: unstoppable shooting, open-to-explore world, random events, non-linear gameplay, customizable guns, character progression, stealth, rogue assault,  old-schooled music, humour, and - most of all - awesome cybernetic ""VHS"" (80-90s) setting.I'm pretty solid on this one: it's a must-have game for everybody who has seen and loved 80s-90s action movies and played those good old-fashioned 8- and 16- bit videogames.

												FC3 Blood Dragon is one big parody of movies and television shows from the 80's and early 90's. While playing, you'll see this through the game's characters, dialogue, weapons, music, and overall style. The most obvious nods are to the terminator films, but there are also nods to many other movies and TV shows. Some are obvious, while others are more subtle. The main character “Rex” is voiced by Michael Biehn, who was a protagonist in the first terminator movie and was commonly seen in 80's action films. Rex pretty much has the personality of Duke Nukem and as you would expect, you will often hear Rex drop silly and politically incorrect one-liners as he goes about his business. The story is like a cheesy 80's action movie, which is great because that is exactly what it aims to be.As for the gameplay, FC3 Blood Dragon is an intentionally over-the-top, sandbox FPS. You'll fight armies of cyborg soldiers and encounter some fierce wildlife, including mutant dinosaurs that can shoot laser beams from their eyes! Rex being a high tech cyborg himself can sprint at high speeds without getting tired, stay underwater without losing his breath, and land on his feet unscathed from a 1000 meter drop. Rex can also execute other cyborgs with a single stab from his knife. There is a good arsenal of weapons you can use and certain weapons can be upgraded, too. Some upgrades are pretty gnarly, like the sniper rifle firing explosive bullets and the shotgun being equipped with four barrels that can be fired simultaneously.Being a sandbox game, FC3 Blood Dragon provides you with both main missions and side missions. The main missions are more linear, while the side missions are more open ended. It took me about 10 hours to beat the game 100%, on my first playthrough. Being a game that was worth $15 upon its release, that's a good amount of play time. I just wish this game had more story missions because I actually enjoyed the story more than I expected.Although FC3 Blood Dragon is an enjoyable game, I still have a few complaints. There is no coop support, which is unfortunate because it would have been fun to play through the game with a friend. Rex can only carry four guns at a time, which is sufficient, but having unlimited carrying space would have been more convenient and more fitting for this type of FPS. The game has a fuzzy screen overlay that cannot be turned off, unless you modify a couple of files manually. My biggest complaint though, is you need to run uplay and have a uplay account to play this game. There's really no need to play this game through two gaming networks at once. I bought this game on steam, so I should only have to play it on steam.  Complaints aside, I loved almost every minute of FC3 Blood Dragon. This is coming from someone who has never played any other far cry games for more than ten minutes. I would recommend this game to any FPS fans who want to take a trip to the future of the 80's!I hope at some point down the road, we will be blessed with a game called “Far Cry: Blood Dragon 2”			"

												This game was really short, but it's such a fantastic thing, I don't even care...+ The good bits of Farcry 3: The island is still cool, the shooting is solid, hunt animals, stab people, swim with sharks, looks great, all that stuff...+ It's all neon now: Hunts giant neon lizard-dragons, fight robot-ish dudes that bleed bright blue, sharks are now made of metal. It's amazing. + You're a cyborg: No fall-damage, jump higher, run so fast you don't need cars.+ The humour: Saying anything about it would be spoiling some of the best jokes in recent videogame history.~ It's both too short and short enough, somehow.I can't find any real negatives about this game, it's simply the best that could come out of something like Farcry 3. It's amazing. Buy it if you like dumb references, memes, retro jokes and neon. Just buy it.Simolius - November 2016.			"

The soundtrack is made by powerglove audio, and they managed to create the most 80ish sound ever. Even though it is not the longest game, it's awesomeness totally makes up for it.

You are going to have a ton of fun with this one!Gameplay : Like stated in previous reviews , I truly enjoy the Far Cry gameplay formula and with this one it was no exception.I think it could be a little bit more challenging but it is comprehensible since the game is meant to be a parody.Story : Not really much here.

Sniper rifle, thats another story. Take down enemy from behind and then press F. xD- OVERALL:I liked it, shame that it's so short thus not worth full price. Get it when it's on sale.			"

												I am so happy I finally got around to playing this game, I've never played a Farcry game, but after this, I might pick up another. Driving around, shooting commies, saying one liners, and hunting and killing beasts! If any of that sounds cool to you, pick this game up, give it a play through, and have an amazing experience!This is 1 part though, it felt a little short, and it made me want more, so much more!

												There isn't a more 1980s first person shooter, I don't think. It's a nice throwback to the future (??) that is, the 1980s vision of the future. Take the dark future from Terminator, make it a little more generic and a lot more neon and add some zany stuff for flavor and you've got Blood Dragon, a TC for Farcry 3. Michael Biehn even voices the protagonist.It's a short game but I thought it was better and more interesting than vanilla FC3. Funny how that works.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥balls. You need to buy this, right now. Seriously one of the best games I've ever played. This is the most hysterical, ridiculous, outrageous, badass, exhilerating thing ever. It is SO much fun! I was laughing to the point of tears a few times. This is amazing! Oh, and I don't even have FarCry 3.The description of the game tells you everything you need to know. If you aren't sold based on that and the fact you play a cyborg commando named Rex Power Colt, let me just tell you, he has the best one-liners I've ever heard in my life. His blood is red, white...and blue. Let your enemies call the medics...so you can kill them, too. Oh, and don't forget to flip everyone off when you're not in melee range.I just can't even get over this game.I wish I was a Mark IV Cyber-Commando in real life... *camera zooms in* Maybe I already am...*80's electronic drumroll*			"

												A real DLC.Graphics : Instead of the warmy beaches presented by FC3 , you get the same island with a 80's theme that fits out just magnificently. The graphics are pretty good and are still not COMPLETELY outdated despite the game's age.Soundtrack : Awesome! The references in the dialogues... You are going to have a ton of fun with this one!Gameplay : Like stated in previous reviews , I truly enjoy the Far Cry gameplay formula and with this one it was no exception.I think it could be a little bit more challenging but it is comprehensible since the game is meant to be a parody.Story : Not really much here. The generic "" Let's save the world and the girl "" cliché that with the comic side of the game makes the story feel somehow new and different.8/10			"

												An 80's throwback and obvious passion project, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is a solid, open world-ish, mini-dose of Far Cry 3 doused in neon lights and electro synth beats.  This stand alone expansion is short (10 hours for my play through), but densely packed.  The gameplay consists of capturing enemy installations on an island map, completing side missions to upgrade your weapons, and ripping out the mecha hearts of your cyborg enemies for experience and cash.  Abilities are unlocked by just leveling instead of the more complex Far Cry skill tree system, but it feels more like a streamlining instead of an afterthought, allowing you to focus on the gameplay.  Guns blazing, satisfying stealth, or throwing aforementioned mecha hearts into an enemy complex to attract the nearly invincible, eye lazering blood dragons, you get to decide how to approach each situation.  Finally, the ultra-campy humor, retro NES-style cinema scenes, and Terminator inspired sound track round out this time capsule of a gem, topping it off with Michael Biehn (aka Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, aka the original Kyle Reese) grumbling out the best action star since golden age of Arnie, Stallone, and Van Damme.Buy if you love everything 80's, definite buy on sale to enjoy playing a game the developer had just as much fun making.

												When the developers started making Far Cry a much too bright game, I stopped playing it. I want dark, fantasy, atmosphere. Just as Bioshock spoiled itself by going the light and airy route, so did Far Cry.But Far Cry Blood Dragon is much, much better. Watching the vid for it, and the retro Fash-Wave style art etc, was enough for me to buy it straight away in the recent sale.It's slightly unoptimised, but with a mid tier PC, you should get an average 40 fps on High or maybe even Very High. Either way, it looks smart. And the gameplay is very nice.			"

												I havent played any of the main far cry games but if its anything like this, i will.  You've got FPS, stealth, upgrades, missions like many other games. What stands out is the visual style, awesome dragons and the fact that your a ****** cyborg that can run and swim like crazy fast.Whats even better is the framerate. For me the game hardly ever dropped below 100FPS with the settings not adjusted (GTC 750Ti) This made the gameplay soo fluid unlike most recent AAA FPS.The story is hilarious and doesnt take itself too seriously (niether does the game), which isnt a bad thing. Its a semi-open world with a moderate ammount of content. I almost 10 hours in and i can tell the game is going to finish soon.However, for the price, it is of good quality. Defo get it if is is on sale.			"

												If you've never played a Far Cry game, Blood Dragon is a fabulous place to start. Far Cry as its core is an Open World 1st Person Shooter. You start in one corner of the map, and have to proceed to different areas to either advance the story, or unlock side missions that allow your character to become stronger. It's a formula that while initial successful has started to grow stale. Blood Dragon is short as far as Far Cry games go, but this is not a knock on its quality. It's the perfect length for someone wondering what it's all about, and the price can't be beat. If you like the GAMEPLAY, then this should be seen as a spring board to other Far Cry Games.What makes Blood Dragon unique is it's utterly bizarre and totally self aware. It mocks everything but most notably cheesy 80s action movies, SNES era cut scenes, and, yes, even Far Cry itself. There are bad one liners, action hero tropes, and memes galore throughout the game. If you've ever seen the Indie movie ""Kung Fury"" this is thematically identical, only in video game format.So in summary: Never played Far Cry before and want to try? This is a good start. Love 80s action movies? Welcome aboard.			"

FarCry 3 - Blood Dragon 100% RECOMMENDED This game is not the DLC of Original FarCry 3 but its a stand-alone single-player Campaign filled with 1980s dialogues and referenced most of the movies. Its not connected to original but its a whole different plot but its mechanics are almost the same as original FarCry 3. Its Truly a Great game. I personally Enjoyed every bit of the gameplay. I am great fan of 80s movies, Hence I really Liked the game. Its very much humorous. Its a short game and its worth your time. And The Loading Screens they have Hilarious tips.And your Character Randomly says Lines, my personal favorite is:I don't have time to tell you my name, I only have time to kill youYou will enjoy every second of it.

I love the whole retro feeling this game gives me and I would love if they could make Blood Dragon 2 with a longer storyline with the same type of old school 80's theme and cheesy humor then I will be on it.

The story is enjoyable, some dialogues are mentionable. You are fighting against colored Dragons and feed them with cybergenetic hearts that you've pulled out of cyber soldiers.After you've completed the game, there is nothing more to do.

												Dino-Bot Baby!!!FC3 Blood Dragon is a blast in all its retro 80's glory, lots of easter eggs to amuse you, and the combat is considerably more braindead than FC3, but in a good way. My only complaints would be it is a bit short (only took me 10 hours to complete, and that is with a lot of exploring, completing the main story line and all side quests, and liberating all enemy garrisons). Also uPlay, once again must state is invasive and unnecessary. However it is an enjoyable ride while it lasts, and should appeal to anyone who likes sci-fi themed shooters. A nice compliment to FC3, and good to see something a bit different from the main game. "

												Blood Dragon is a more modern take on the games and movies of the 80's (and early 90's I guess). It's got lots of neon, dragons, a cheesy story, old school music and a lot, A LOT, of explosions. All combined into a neat little Far Cry package. Meaning it's an open world environment, and it has sidemissions and upgrades, too.If you're from the 80's theres's a high probability you'll instantly fall in love with this game. I did. It looks great in motion, the voice acting is great (although the story is purposely ridiculous) and it has tons of action in it, thanks to some awesome weapons in it. The world feels a bit empty, however. Where Far Cry 3 was filled with wildlife, I rarely saw wild animals in Blood Dragon. But it's possible that was because of the lighing and the fact that I didn't really explore like I normally do. Nothing big, it just caught my attention.Blood Dragon is, unfortunately, also a bit on the short side. Completing the game, doing only the main missions, took me about 3,5-4 hours to do. Enough for a downloadable game and more importantly, to keep things interesting. If you add the hunting missions and other sidemissions you can probably double that number. Upgrading your character also happens automatically (there are no skill trees) so replaying the game isn't all that interesting because you'll gain the same skills and perks every time, no matter what. Not that it mattered, because I had a blast playing Blood Dragon, and that's all that counts. Recommended ![Rating: 77/100]			"

Posted: November 24, 2014
												I ended up recommending this game but it was probably one of the hardest decisions I've made recently here in Steam. This is a game that is not fun to play outside of few interesting moments and kind of funny scenes. But please don't misunderstand me. I absolutely love the theme and the idea behind the Blood Dragon.This is a very stylish game with some really funny stuff in it. Especially for those of you who understand the references to the 80's action films and animated cartoon series. You can get a lot of out of this by just wanting to know what's the next thing the developers put into the game. But I guarantee that it's going to require hard work. It's also the only real motivation to make progress in this game.You see, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is not fun to play. The gameplay revolves around mostly just running from point A to point B. And it's boring as hell. You run around, do simple kills, and then run around again. Killing the stuff is so easy that even on the hardest difficulty level I never really died unless I became so bored that I lost focus and then died because I didn't bother to even try.The main objective in Blood Dragon is to collect stuff, so you can buy more stuff, that allows you to kill more things more efficiently. To be able to get more stuff you need to perform series of tasks, but you just cannot do them without liberating a garrison and unlocking those tasks, these tasks involve usually killing certain things in a certain way, and oh boy, it's annoying as hell. When you're travelling you need to collect random stuff along the way.This is a game where the main story can be completed within a four hours or less. Collecting the stuff takes probably another four to five hours. After the main story is complete the end game is easy and boring marathon. Especially if you're planning on getting all the achievements like I did.There are few rare moments when you're playing in a closed hallways and arenas which are used to advance the story. The story is mostly just as meaningless and cliché as most 80's action film plots are but in a wrong way. Result is a boring and meaningless mess of things. The script writers had the right idea but they were the wrong people to do it.I found it funny that although you cannot reach the kind of speed you can reach in Daikatana or Doom, players can still run faster than the vehicles in this game. Blood Dragon in overall has probably fastest gameplay I've seen in a recently released game. However the gun mechanics don't work like they'd work in an old school shooter. That♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most as the game is mostly optimised for gamepads.I could write more about the gameplay but I doubt anyone would read all that. Let me just sum it all up. This game is boring. Just as boring as the Far Cry 2 and Far Cry 3 are.Most things in Dragon Blood are suitably 80s. I don't need to pick them up and pull apart one by one.Visually the game functions mostly OK. Sometimes there are really weird slowdowns but usually just restarting the game it starts to work again. The neon lights and the colour palette in the Blood Dragon can cause huge eye strain and I'd recommend taking 15 minute breaks after every one hour spent playing the game. My eyes were bleeding dragon blood after playing this for a while. Blood Dragon also crashes every now and then without any apparent reason but at least it makes automatic saves after any and every meaningful event so you don't lose progress.The only thing I can honestly say was really awesome in Blood Dragon was its sound design and especially its soundtrack. It's full of really good FX and music with hints to various films and TV series but it still manages to sound fairly original and suitably 80's. It's just the perfect thing in this game. And I dare to suggest that you rather go to Amazon.com and order the soundtrack instead of buying this game. The voice acting is suitably bad in a good way that fits the game's mood.The controls work fairly well in the game but it's just weird how many actions there are which require you to hold a key pressed. Why not just pressing once to do the action? It would have made this game a lot more pleasant to play if instead of stopping, holding E, and then moving again players were able to just tap once when they're nearby something they can loot. I do however understand the need to keep Q pressed down to heal. The healing mechanic worked fairly well but I would have expected to have a separate key for the health packs that instantly give maximum health. I also just loved the fact that there's a dedicated ""F*ck you"" button in the game bidden to F.Blood Dragon uses Ubisoft's Uplay which means that you don't get to play the game before you've installed and upgraded that thing and oh boy, it can take time. I probably spent 5 to 6 hours in just trying to get the Uplay to work. It constantly kept disconnecting while it was downloading updates. It was awful. And when I finally had it updated and installed... I swear that every single time I started the game Uplay was updating something. It completely stripped me of any will I still had in me to buy other games made by Ubisoft that use Uplay. As a funny side note the Uplay apparently disables screen capture and pressing PrtSrc does nothing.That pretty much sums up the game. It's a game about funny 80's stuff without being actually a fun enjoyable game. There are much better games out there but at least to my knowledge this is the only one where you can play as a kind of funny walking parody of a Terminator T-800 that uses Robocop's pistol, has the Rambo's attitude, Cobra's moves, and overall is a generic 80's cartoon action hero with Viatnam War II stories to give the character little backstory, and you fight (and later in the game ride) a f*cking dinosaurs that shoots lasers from its eyes just like in the Dino-Riders.And yes, it even has a sex scene like the one you can see in 80s and perhaps in some early 90s films. The 80's theme goes up to the point that it even is little bit racist in a funny and politically incorrect way which earns it a lot of points. Oh yeah, this game also has Michael Biehn as the voice of the main character. I'll give more points to for that cleverness. I'd say it's worth checking it out if you can get it cheap.			"

												Ubisoft Montreal has offered a huge delirious game, full of references and old obsolete codes that will charm those the 80 are still dreaming. Provided you adhere to humor the 28th degree, one is sure to laugh about the vision of the future so new wave. Watch out for some short-lived and especially the possibility of not necessarily cling to the delirious nerdy. However, if you are a fan of the era productions, you should find much science fiction in the game. Buy on sale.PS : A good mix between Daft Punk and Tron in outfits and helmets. ;)			"

												I pretty much love this game.  The ridiculous 1980's neon future art and theming is definitely a part of that, but there's more to it then just that.  Blood Dragon takes the good parts of Far Cry 3 and leaves out a lot of the bloat, including the slow, laborious upgrade system.   Blood Dragon does take away some of the ""open world"" feel to the game (which is intact, but much less pronounced or ""free"" as in FC3), but I believe it to be a worth sacrifice for a tighter experience.  Where I feel that FC3 was probably 75% filler and only 25% ""killer"", Blood Dragon is probably the opposite, if not 100% killer. That is, of course, as long as you like the sometimes-sneaky sometimes-loud first-person shooting that Far Cry 3, BD, and now FC4 all offer.There is a caveat to all of this, however, and one that is a deal-breaker for some.  That caveat is Uplay.  Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM/PC gaming platform that doesn't work half the time and is often a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Honestly it didn't really interrupt my experience with Blood Dragon at all, despite being a minor annoyance to starting the game up.  If you've had bad experiences with, or refuse to use, Uplay, then obviously you're just going to have to miss out on Blood Dragon.If you're like me and can look past Uplay, Blood Dragon offers a great FPS experience.  Don't expect a breathtaking story, but the gameplay has honestly kept me entertaining through two complete playthroughs, including restarting and completing all the fortresses at least once.			"

												Far Cry 3 was one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. Now when I saw Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon up in the store, I knew it was something. At first, I thought it was a DLC or an expansion of the Far Cry 3. Turns out it was a spinoff. The idea of using the depiction of the future by the people in the 80's is the part I like the most in the game. Bright lights, cybernetic dudes, 80's sci fi naming sense (ex: Rex Power Colt), funky background music, obviously obvious screen hints,  huge amount of puns, receive a ton of damage from lasers and fire and heal yourself by just exercising your right hand, gattling gun, dinosaurs, dinosaurs that shoots fire from their eyes, dinosaurs that has a gattling gun on its back and shoots fire from their eyes, a scientist chic, a villain, a comrade. Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon almost has everything you need in an 80's sci-fi themed game. Gameplay itself is basically the same with the Far Cry 3. Get weapons, earn money, equip weapons, spend money, capture bases, blow up innocent people, kill mutated and genetically engineered animals, burn a bunch of stuff, buy attachments, equip attachments, realize this attachment is better than this attachment so you equip the better one. Basically same. The bow didn't have a single attachment though but I'm good with it since you get to have a sniper rifle that makes a freaking loud and huge explosion at long range. Graphics were still the same. The map is smaller compared to the Far Cry 3 but with the frequency of cyber-nerds and omega force dudes clashing, you get to have fun when you decide to walk around. Completing the game 100% is also easy since the VHS tapes, the TV sets and the Carlyle's Notes were all displayed in the map. All you have to do is pick them up. The side-missions are still enjoyable as ever. Whether it's to hunt or to save a hostage, I am satisfied each time. I recommend this game so much. I know it doesn't have a lot of content and you can practically finish this game in 7 hours, but in those hours, you will enjoy every moment of it.			"

												This game is just brilliant. It is definitely in my top games of all time. It has a perfect blend of action, references to 80's movies, humor, and kick♥♥♥♥♥gunplay. I cannot wait for the sequel they are making. For the very cheap cost of fifteen dollars you will get around 10 hours of gameplay but it is so well made and so cramped with one liners, hilarious storytelling, collectables, great characters, and awesome one of a kind moments that you will want to play it over and over.I beat this game a little over its half point on my first playthrough and I ran into some issues with Ubisoft's Uplay giving my Uplay account an awful generated name (it was something like ""User123ABC""...etc). And so after I got my account renamed and wiped, my progress was gone. If this happened on any other game I would have quit right there. But I had no hesitation to restart the hilarious and fun adventure in Blood Dragon's post apocalyptic, neon light lit world. And incase you are wondering... yes the Blood Dragons are badass and encapsulates every little boys dream of seeing a neon lit, laser spitting, cyber dinosaur. So buy it at fifteen dollars or wait for a sale, grab your buddies, kick back on the couch, and have a great time because regardless of the price you buy it at, this game will be well worth your time.10/10			"

												Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is the standalone expanion for Far Cry 3, which was originally about survival and a bunch of pirates that have been ordered to hunt you down and kill you. Blood Dragon is completely different in the sense that the survival element has been completely removed from this standalone expansion.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is basically a gigantic spoof of 80's movies and filled with 80's references in a comedic sense and cyber-punk manner. I didn't grow up in the 80's so I don't really get the jokes, but to anyone who has. This is the game for you! Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is in my top 3 best games list of 2013, it's cool, it's funny and down-right stupid. Unlike Far Cry 3, which was based on the harshness of the jungle, the enviroment and the enemies, this game is NOT a frightful survival game, which I meantioned at the start. THE STORY: You play as Rex ""Power"" Colt, a cyborg military man who is rebuilt to be better, stronger and faster. You start out in a machine gun turret inside a helicopter (Yeah, best beginning ever) and descend to take a tutorial (which shows a comedic part of the game) When Rex Colt takes the tutorial, he is frustrated and angry and wants to shoot things, while the tutorial lady is speaking. (Quite a funny scene) It is chock-full of bright lights, with a cyberpunk feel to it making it graphically impressive.THE PORT: Excellent port, has and FOV slider, full world detail changes and nice options to do with textures. Why did I list the FOV slider as a key feature? Becuase this one can go anywhere from 55-110, varies quite well when you really have a look at it.RELEVANCE: This standalone expansion is quite similar to the base game, only cybered-up and takes off more 80's movies.PROS+Nice options menu and graphics customisation+Funny plot and comedic ""hints""+Isn't another ♥♥♥♥ing MMS (Modern Military Shooter)+Nice change from a jungle-theme to a cyber-punk theme+You run faster than you driveCONS-Short story-Low replayability-Everything is red-Smaller map-Useless side quests-Small amount of weapons (Some credit to the creators anyway, most of the weapons are spoofed)-Requires a Uplay account.9/10, would definitely recommend picking it up on a sale.

For those that can handle ,and accept, and embrace the extreme ( and I mean extreme) cheesiness that is this standalone expansion, then by all means  I do recommend this expansion.

For those that can handle ,and accept, and embrace the extreme ( and I mean extreme) cheesiness that is this standalone expansion, then by all means  I do recommend this expansion. Be aware that is does have mature themes, which in a way does complete the farfetched imagenings of a young boy's mind.			"

												Amazing expansion.  Completely overhauls the game world with a new skin and characters but manages to keep the same excellent feel of Far Cry 3.  The game world is a bit dark and there are some weird architecture glitches (couldn't cross a door threshold sometimes); but above all else this game is fun as hell, and the shameless 80s characters are hilarious.  Did I mention no fall damage?			"

												A Must-Play for anyone who likes terrible 80's movies. The game has lot of bad punchlines and cliches, making it ridiculously funny. It also has a GREAT soundtrack! Of course, the graphics are beautiful, and the cyber visuals makes everything cool.Ubisoft really hit the spot for a modern 80's vibe game, and the only issue I had is that I finished the game 100% in only 6 hours. Still, it's totally worth the experience! "

												Ok first things first: I hate Uplay. I had to delete the entire game and reinstall it because of it. Uplay was broken, so I  couldn't launch the game.As for the actual game, its an amazingly fun title with tons of references for people to find. It has the most enternatining tutorial ever, and dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes and yell ""GENOCIDE IS FUN"". Extremely fun to play, but a bit on the short side, but well I paid like $3 while it was on sale so it was worth it.			"

												This game is a fantastic throwback to the neon 80's.The gameplay is largely the same as Far Cry 3: you freeroam around an island, capture outposts from enemies, complete side missions to upgrade your weapons and abilities, and work on the story missions along the way. The game's strength comes from it's style; in an effort to capture the magic of 80's cartoons and action movies, the enemies are generic and faceless, the heroes are cool and clever, and everything is covered in neon. The dialogue is great, and will often make you laugh. Michael Beihn (the 80's most underrated action hero) is a treat.Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon takes the strong framework from Far Cry 3 and adds a strong stylistic vision that elevates it to greatness.

												I'd like to start by saying that this game is a lot of fun, and I had a blast playing it. That said, I would get it on sale because the game is not that long. It took me 6 hours and 31 minutes to beat (I spent a lot of time afk which is why it seems like I spent more time in the game.) I collected everything, freed every objective, unlocked every weapon customization, and finished the story. I would definitely recommend buying this title.Pros:- Great soundtrack (Power Glove!)- Hilarious one-liners- Cheesy, but funny cut-scenes- Engaging combat- Lots of weapons- Customization- Fun collectables with their own little stories- Open world- Lots of easter eggsCons:- A little bit expensive for the amount of time it takes to complete- Difficult to interact with stuff sometimes- Holding down a button to interact is annoying- Short main campaign- The environment doesn't have a lot of variety- UplayI give this game an 8/10. Despite being super short I enjoyed the ride, which is something that I can't say for a lot of games. This game didn't get hung up on graphics and instead made fun of itself constantly which is something that I appreciate.			"

												Has the feel of the original Far Cry Instincts Predator, combined with the Far Cry 3 system. Great game, though the constant red glare becomes a tad repetitive at times. Very smooth storyline with a soundtrack right out of every 80's movie you might thihk of all rolled into 1. Not a vast amount of weaponary available, but what you do have initially, when upgraded become largely overpowered. The sniper rifle in particular was my favourite.

Stoey is fairly short and there's not a lot to do in the world, but it's definately a fun romp while it lasts. Consider picking it up in a sale. Downside: You have to install Uplay.			"

												Very fun game.What's good - the fantastically corny and over-the-top story.  The voice acting and dialogue.  Cyborgs whose heads explode with blue goo.  Dragons that shoot laser beams out of their eyes.  The soundtrack.  The overall feel of the game - very reminiscent of 80s/90s action movies.What's not good - the save system is annoying.  There are missions and open-world gameplay, and you can't do a hard save in the middle of a mission.  There are checkpoints within the missions, but if you quit the game and come back, you have to restart that mission.  It's fine in the open-world sections.  Also had trouble sometimes with not being able to walk up 2-inch steps, which is annoying while stealthing.  Oh and Uplay can be annoying when it needs to update.Speaking of stealthing, it's totally optional.  You can sneak about getting stealth kills, or just charge in with your guns blazing.  Both are valid and fun!The awesomeness of the game totally outweighs the niggling annoyances.  Everyone needs to play this.			"

Posted: February 26, 2016
												I decided to replay this game and make a review out of it. You know, for science and stuff. As usual, I will talk about the bad stuff first:First and foremost; Uplay. I shouldn't have to say anything else about that, but some people might not know much about it, so let's go into it. Uplay is a Steam-wannabe created by Ubisoft. It's laggy. It's crap. And if it wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft forces everyone to use it on their games. The thing is, you start the game and while other Steam games would likely start right away, with Ubisoft games you have to wait until this thing starts as well, and then the game starts. With singleplayer games ain't that bad, but if you have it on a new one, DEAR BUDDHA HAVE MERCY ON YOUR PATIENCE, as it will constantly ask for updates and crap like that. Uplay is even worse than Origin, and that's a big f#cking statement. And somehow, it still exists. Thankfully there are ways to disable it, and I seriously recommend you do it.The other problem the game has is this lenght. For 15€ you would expect at least 6-8 hours of content, however on my new playthrough I barely got 4 out of it, clearing everything at 100%. The main story itself barely has arround 5 missions, the rest are side-quests to unlock upgrades to your weapons; stuff you will surely want to get your cyber-arms on. What's sad about this is that this game is quite original and fun, and I feel like Ubisoft got lazy when they could've turned this little standalone mod into a game of it's own. It also doesn't help that, while the island is decently sized, the character runs and swims so fast that even vehicles are pointless when traveling, and you even have Fast-travel.That being said, is it good? Yeah. It's good. Have you seen any generic action movie from the 70's to the 90's? This game is pretty much a parody of all of them combined, throwing some game references along the way. The plot is so cheesy and idiotic that feels completely right.The gameplay is, obviously, quite similar to Far Cry 3. The only important stuff that has changed are things like upgrading your weapons to insane levels, and the main character throwing one liners non-stop.There's not much variety on enemies, and the NPC's indeed seem to be f#cking r#tarded, but they offer a decent challenge (until you upgrade your weapons, a fully upgraded shotgun pretty much kills anything on your screen in one or two shots).The soundtrack is what stands out the most in the game, always delivering this special 80's style. The item descriptions and graphics also show what dumb humans from the past though earth would look in the future, which was actually quite hilarious.There are also collectibles on the game, which you will need to get some of the collectibles, however you can buy maps that will show to you their exact location. With the speed you have, you can get them all in an hour.Granted, it's a fun experience. But a short one. And after clearing it 100%, I can't bring myself to recommend it at full price AT ALL. You should totally experience this, however wait for a sale. 7,50€ is good, but 5€ or bellow is perfect for this game. I just hope a sequel actually comes out someday, and it's longer and more 80's.TL;DR: The game's cool, but not worth the 15€ pricetag. Wait at least for a 50% sale.			"

												Although the campaign is short but hey what more can you expect from a standalone dlc, but even though its a dlc, it packs quality more than it actually should, and you will love the crazy and a funny revenge story of a Cyber commando in a war torn country.The game was setup in such a way that it is like we are playing the game at night. But they did this intentionally to portray the numorous bright neon lights in the game which makes it look super-cool and feels like total badass sci-fi shooter. And of course, the blood dragons are a real treat in the game, can divert them to some outpost to do your dirty job,etc.Well, personally I loved it very much as I did with far cry 3, but this is something more different than the other games we play, featuring a humorous and a crazy campaign with memorable one-liners and the awesome soundtracks which feels like ""The 80's vibe"". Simply, its a must play for gamers who loved far cry 3 and who want more action from Dunia 2.The Best Standalone DLC of the Year9.5/10 "

Joe etc etc.Now to propery descibe how Blood Dragon mixes these genres up is a little complicated, so bear with me.Billy and Jamall take a martini glass and ejaculate into it, Both gentlemens DNA is now swimming together and combining into a mega sperm cocktail.Then Amanda inpregnates herself with said goo, and 9 months later she gives birth to Farcry Blood Dragon.All 3 entities described in perfect harmony to give the player a fun, action packed, humorous and excellent game to play.My only complaint is that it is too damn short.

												The sh*t that you have to go through to play this game is a great metaphore for the industry as a whole (heh). After seven steam mandatory installations, you are draged into the spawning abyss of mediocrity that is UPlay.But they don't bother at least installing the latest version from the bat; oh no. They do it the old way; badly, very badly. After installing uplay you have to run another TWO patches, then log on to uplay, then add the product key like you're some fu*king criminal and are not to be trusted under any circumstances even though you launched the game with STEAM. Then, what do you do? After this entire process is complete?Close UPlay and restart the game because it got so friggin convoluted it even forgot why I bothered to start it and didn't even bother to remember starting the game.To summarize:- 7 mandatory steam installs- 2 uplay patches- uplay login- uplay key authentication- restart the game (or start it through their platform if you're familiar with satan's OS)The game? It's alright, if you like stealth elements in between your shooting. I don't. And as it stands I can't recommend this. I feel cheated, as I could've sworn this game didn't require UPlay at launch. It feels like a scam made up by some sick, twisted, french; probably because it is.			"

												I was excited to play this, yet I couldn't get past the UPlay launcher garbage. It installs itself onto your computer and forces you to register on it to play this game. It was painfully slow, and when I finally got around to creating an account, Ubisoft's painfully slow server's weren't available.			"

												This game will not even start up, even after following all advice that Ubisoft support gave me. This is a known issue that they have no solution for, as they claim it is a Windows issue.Buyer beware, you might get complete garbage instead of a game.			"

												To be honest, I haven't played this version of Blood Dragon beyond testing it on my system.  I played it in it's entirety on PS3 and it was a very enjoyable game.  There are Blood Dragons and♥♥♥♥♥♥  The tutorial is great.  It's just a fun game overall.  I did not realise that beyond simply needing a UPlay account it also has a DRM client that needs to be running alongside Steam in order to play the game.  This is the first Ubisoft product I've purchased on PC since Chaos Theory, whose copy protection came with real-world problems, necessitating the reinstallation of my operating system in order to access virtual and actual disks and drives the software knocked out and/or blocked access to.  That was over a decade ago.  UPlay didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the functionality of my PC in any way I know of.  I just don't want their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bundled software on my PC ever again.  In short, I wish the requirements were more to the point.  UPlay is a program that must be installed and running on your PC as a requirement to play the game.  To call that an account is somewhat misleading.			"

I get this is simular to far cry 3 but unlike fc3 there is not really any benefit to getting the garrison becasue the games not long enough that you are going to need to revisit that area again, so fast travel isnt really nescesary.

												Blood Dragon is an anthem to the old days where expansions were worth buying and added tons of extras to the base game. BD does a nice job setting the player in the 80s with beautiful neon colors and delightful 8 bit cutscenes. It has been a long time since I don't actually laugh with a game's joke and this game got some good chuckles out of me.As far the gameplay goes, this is Far Cry 3 with cooler, but fewer guns. Escaping and fighting Blood Dragons is really fun.The last level was remarkable to say the least. That was a really good joke and reference.Blood Dragon is DLC done right.			"

												As many have said before me, it's a great retro shooter that plays very similarly to Far Cry 3. That being said however, the vast majority of the negative reviews are all concerning Uplay, Ubisoft's attempt on Steam, basically EA's Origin for Ubisoft. Personally however, I didn't find Uplay all that bad. Sure making an account or having Uplay launch whenever you want to play can be annoying, but in my honest opinion, Ubisoft has definitely improved Uplay since I first purchased this game two years ago. Uplay just launches and then sets you straight into the game with it's in game overlay available via Shift F2 (in addition to Steam's). Sure your achievements are saved to Uplay along with the cloud storage, but Uplay also comes with some ""free"" addons purchaseable with credits earned by completing in game tasks.Overall, I would say Uplay is a lot less intrusive than in the past, and would recommend this purchase (assuming you are into this type of game-see other reviews on actual gameplay) despite Uplay (which I personally  don't hate).

												For starters, 3rd party launchers like UPlay that need to always be online can suck my d!ck.Now, as for the game, It's worth the 80's nostalge trip, with the self-aware videogame/movie tropes. And it rides that horse all the way into the sunset. There are four or five main missions that are each ~20 to 30 minutes of game time. The rest is two types of side quests; Rescue a scientist or hunt an animal type, Liberating outposts, And collecting TV's, Tapes, and Files, which DOES unlock weapon stuff so it's worthwhile. The island is fairly small, and you can fast travel. I liked it enough to see it through to 100% completion in less than 8 hours. But after all the novelty had worn off, this game left me wanting to go back and play Far Cry 3 again instead of ever planning on playing this again. As of this writing, the pricetag is $15, but I would definitely wait until it's on sale.			"

												It is amazing that a game like Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon can exist. It is a pitch perfect homage to cheesy, low-budget sci-fi. It's bathed in darkness and neon lights. It is ridiculous and takes itself only half seriously. If Far Cry 3 was the summer blockbuster, Blood Dragon is the weird straight-to-VHS sequel that has no connection to the source material. But in this case, it's fantastic and maybe even more fun than the source.			"

The variety of guns is a little poxy but the in game guns are one of a kind. Have fun.			"

												Farcry 3 was awesome.The 80's were awesome.Not all combinations of things are obviosly.This game though nails that love child, and although under 10 hours, far less than Farcry 3 its a solid game of its own. It takes all that was great about farcry 3, and adds alot of humor and ridiculousness, and 80s homage and arguably even more guns that are enjoyable to use.  And of course the music--sweet.  I can't even remember if Farcry 3 had music, but its a cornerstone of this game.  Game is worth damn near full price, though I imagine its probably not too hard these days to pick it up for much less.  I'm not sure if i'd recommend playing this before farcry 3 if only since that one is so massive in trying to take it on that you might find 3 boring after this.  Though if one were to play either, I'd say go with this, if large sandboxes are less your bag as this can be done in its entiretly in under 10 hours, even for a completionist ♥♥♥♥er like myself.			"

COMPLETED 100%This expansion to FC3 initially feels like a simple reskin of the base game but turns out far more than that. The game instead plays in the near opposite spectrum where the main missions throws the action straight in your face with little seriousness taken. For the most part the game is fun, loud, humourous and very much entertaining.  Outside of missions you're free to roam an shruken down vers of FC3's island with the same kind of side missions, collectibles and the basic structure that revolves around capturing outposts, a.k.a. garrisons. It's nothing much as special but then again, still provides the same pleasure as before. This also results in more content being offered, definitely making this DLC worth just about enough for its rather high price.			"

												Remember the 80's, what a time that was. Personally I wasn't born, so I wouldn't know, yet playing Blood Dragon was like reliving the era that I never knew. While this game is still Far Cry 3 at it's core which isn't a problem as Far Cry 3 was by far one of the best games of 2012, this expansion takes a journey into territory not taken by any DLC or even game before it. In short, it tries to recreate the 1980's nostalgia from dialogue, setting and even its great music composed by Power Glove, which really sets the mood. The story picks up in 2007 where you play as Rex, a American cybernetic super-soldier. He and another American cyber-soldier named Spider travel to an unnamed island to investigate Colonel Sloan, an elite agent who has gone rogue. Sound cliched? It is. It practically rips off every movie from the 1980's such as the Terminator and even makes clever references to other minor 80's shows such as great easter egg paradying the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (personal favourite), but I won't spoil it here. While the game does not have a complete new setting from Far Cry 3, a red haze covers the screen to give a retro feel and many new locations, enemies have been added to the mix. The new weapons are also a highlight including a razor disk that demolishes and disentigrates every enemy in your path, it's one of the weirdest yet most fun weapons in years. The story can be finished in 3-5 hours which may seem short, theres plenty to do afterwards such as saving scientists and collecting classic 80's items such as Television sets and VHS tapes. Those were the days. So with all these things to do Blood Dragon never gets stail, and for DLC you can't get 'better bang for your buck' so to speak. Best bit is that you don't need the original Far Cry 3 to play it, so anyone can buy this game straight up and play through it's hilarious yet cheesy dialogue and action sequences so bizzarre I can't even begin to describe them here. With Blood Dragon the 1980's are back in fashion, so put on some Michael Jackson full blast and bring back that Flock of Seagulls haircut, sh**s about to go down.  "

												One of the most enjoyable games I've played for quite a while. The gameplay is straight up Far Cry 3: liberating bases, driving around in a jeep and killing local wildlife and wandering enemies. However, what this game brings to the table is some of the best tongue-in-cheek straight 80s story stereotypes and writing that I have ever seen complete with pun-tastic one-liners. I can’t remember a game that has had me smiling or laughing as much as this game as I’ve played through it. Every collectible is worthy of at least a grin, if not a good laugh and every cut scene is a joy of purposefully over the top acting and 80s ridiculousness. If that didn’t sell you: it has freaking laser dinosaurs.			"

												I remember the '80s. I remember the weird, disjointed remains of the CCCP as a collapsing threat, and the last vestiges of the terror of nuclear war. I remember thinking that corporations were going to soon be able to own people, and I remember those last, fleeting touches of a dead future.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is more than just a parody. More than simply a mockery of an age, a tribute to ten mad years when we were trying to leave the past behind with lasers and robots. It is possibly the most cathartic experience I have ever had playing a video game. It's simple, yes. It's linear, yes. It has all the flaws and laudable elements of the initial release of Far Cry 3.When most games want to build up to a climactic fight, they present you with a challenge. I see now that this is the wrong attitude. There should be no challenge. No huge game-topping boss battle where you struggle hard to apply everything you've learned and done throughout the game.You should be an invincible sociopath with unlimited ammo. You should mow down waves of those who stand before you, cackling madly at their ineffectuality. You should play the end of most games like you play all of this one.I was at the right age in the '80s to imagine myself as someone not unlike Sergeant Rex Power Colt. I found that the experience did not disappoint.			"

												Favorite Quotes from Ubisoft Montreal's Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon: 1) Dr.: ""This is going to get bloody and messy fast.""    Rex: ""Those happen to be my two most favorite things.""2) Hint: ""Taking too much damage?  Stop getting shot, okay?  I swear, it's like talking to a monkey.""  In terms of content, much of what makes the '80s great and plenty of what makes that time cringeworthy, too.  The devs really had fun with this one.  It's literally packed with humor and references, everything from the story, characters and dialogue to the one-liners, hints, animations, extras, even the (not really a) tutorial.  Not a game that wants to be taken seriously!  From a gameplay perspective, Blood Dragon is fairly straightforward Far Cry material.  The weapons are all fun to use and offer options for sneaky combat or total chaos.  Area design is pretty recycled and AI is nothing to write home about but the combat is fun regardless.  Bases can be captured from the enemy and claimed for friendly factions, creating new fast travel points and opening up missions to rescue scientists, hunt wildlife, and more.  Certain achievements will unlock new mods for your weapons in the stores.  A few collectibles in case you're really into hunting around for hidden goodies.  There's really not much to be said in light of the fact that FPS players, especially fans of the Far Cry series will feel right at home with the controls and mechanics.  The art style and graphic effects are pleasing.  The visuals and audio suit each other perfectly.  I didn't mess around too much with the fancy takedowns or other moves but they are cool to see.  Finished the game on hard difficulty without doing much exploring of the place, instead moving quickly through the campaign.  Perfect recommendation for an infusion of '80s goodness and a brief bit of mindless first-person shooter action.			"

This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon then skip to Results and read from there.Ubisoft packs a punch with the epic 80s action movie video game. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon pushes the bounds of traditional fps with epic dialogue, brilliant combat, hilarious cinematics, and an over the top story. Story:You play as Rex, a Mark IV cyborg that is sent on a mission to clear out some hostiles. Upon arriving you discover the mission is a lot more complex than you originally assumed. Your partner Spider is killed right at the start and it’s up to you to get revenge and ultimately save the world. Dr. Darling is your female guide offering you more than just her brains. Sloan an evil super-villain has concocted a serum from the Blood Dragons that turns people into zombies. He’s going to unleash this concoction upon the world if you do not stop him. Campaign:Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon starts off with you flying into an blaze of glory only to end the same way. The campaign is ridiculously short, unless you go out an complete all other objectives. It took me 5 hours to complete the entire game (get every TV/Video, complete all missions, capture all the bases, kill all 12 animals, and upgrade every weapon). If you just ran the campaign I could imagine you completing it in under an hour and a half easy. There are about five actual missions, the one you play with Spider, the one where you blow up the dam, the one where you kill the scientist, the one where you complete the temples challenge, and the final one where you kill Sloan. The actual game takes place on an open-world map making you run between missions, but this is not a problem as you are a Mark IV and can sprint faster than the cars can drive, fall off cliffs without taking damage, and teleport to any of the captured garrisons. Gameplay:The combat makes you a complete and total hero, even on the hardest difficulty you will still be able to run into a room full of people and slaughter them like a wolf amongst lambs. You have a healthbar, but you are able to heal yourself without medpacks. For combat, missions, and secrets you get CP which levels Rex. Each level offers Rex a new ability (usually increased health and self-repair), but every now and then you get a special something else thrown in. If you complete missions and find secrets you can upgrade your guns in special ways making yourself even more heroic than before. There are eight weapons (A.J.M. 9, Fzertron, Kobracon, Galleria 1991, Bow, Terror 4000, Flamer, and KillStar) and two explosives (Grenades, and C400). The first four weapons have upgrades, the last four do not. You will find yourself using different weapons over others, but based on the nature of the game you will probably want to go for the loudest guns you can find. Hints:>Some people are having problem with saving the game. If you are trying to play the game please note you will not be able to click the save button until you have fully completed the first and second mission. The game will save itself once you complete the first mission, and it will allow you to save once you complete the second mission. >Some of the animals you must kill will not be revealed till after you complete some of the garrison missions (if you do not complete the missions you will only find nine of them).>The Kobracon explosive round upgrade is probably the best weapon upgrade you will be able to get. It allows you to kill Blood Dragons like they are nothing, so I would recommend getting it.Results:Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is an epic first person shooter that brings the 80s action hero genre to life. It feels like you are playing Arnold Schwarzenegger from Commando as you blast through hundreds of cyborg soldiers, wild animals, dragons, and zombies. The game is coupled with a hilarious soundtrack, amazing cut-scenes, epic dialogue, and downright awesome explosions. You will not find yourself bored while playing this game, so make sure you’re ready to become an epic action hero. Because Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is such a short game I would be wary paying full price if you are not 100% sure you want this title. This game is a great game if you can get it on sale.Pros:+Character levels which make you considerably stronger.+Weapon customization which allows you to fully kit out guns making them even more destructive.+Fast travel which allows you to move quickly across the map.+Items you can buy from the store that reveal all the secrets on the map, saving you from having to actually look.+Epic combat system with awesome melee as well as ranged.+Lots of different enemies that keep you interested.+Dragons obviously…+Great graphics, scenery, and map design.+Open-world Environment (I personally do not like open-world FPS, but for those who do this is a pro).+Great dialogue, music, and cutscenes+You do not need Far Cry 3 in order to play this game.Cons:-You have very little control over saving until after the first two missions, which is incredibly annoying.-Finding some of the animals is near impossible (also the stingray is classified as a civilian?)-You will spend more time traveling between objectives than you will actually playing the game.

												A hilarious spin-off game based on everything 80's. With all the same style of gameplay and UI of Far Cry 3 reskinned into a neon wireframe enviroment filled with explosions, 80's sci-fi, and dragons, because you know why not. The game itself has a very comical playthough and will definetly fill up a decent ammount of time for your money. 9/10.			"

												This game..You guys, this game! This is the game! You all wanted a cinematic experience with your codblops heavy armor spacemarines and muh freedoms and sandboxing in your elder fable scrolls but you were looking in the wrong direction all the time. You wanted cinematic experience? Good, here is an 80s C-Movie with B-Movie oneliners.You wanted freedom and sandboxing? Fine, you get the chaingun from the start and you can use dinosaurs to do your dirty work.But you also wanted romance too, right? Here, have an animated sex scene, the thing every game with sex ever doesn't use.Short as the game is, it is one hell of a ride. It allows you to do stuff most games only show you in cutscenes. The interior of the bad guy bases are straight out of *insert any 80s / 90s sci-fi cartoon* and so are the baddies themselves.Whats that? The music isn't cinematic and dramatic enough? Well then, they put the music from Rocky IV in the game, an actual movie for those of you who never looked away from their codzombiekillstreak, so shut your mouth.Only 2 minus points are having to install Uplay...but hey, at least it is not windows live..oh, and to be honest, the open-world gameplay is a tiny bit unfitting, but still, can't complain. Its a wonder that a game like this is released in the sea of brown cover shooters.			"

												If you took Far Cry 3's gameplay and slathered everything with bright neon colors and flashy lights, replaced the soundtrack with one of the most♥♥♥♥♥kicking beats ever heard in a video game, and made the uninteresting main protagonist into a one-liner spitting over powered Mark IV cyber commando voiced by a legend from the 80s, you get BLOOD DRAGON.One of the funniest games I've ever played. Rife with amazing details like your character flipping the lever action shotgun around like Arnold Schwarzenegger did back in Terminator 2. It's as if Ubisoft found a kid who grew up watching action movies from the 80's and 90's, and somehow gave him a blank check to make the game he always wanted. Game ends a little sooner than expected but definitely worth the money and doesn't wear out its welcome. 10/10			"

												Favorite Quotes from Ubisoft Montreal's Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon: 1) Dr.: ""This is going to get bloody and messy fast.""    Rex: ""Those happen to be my two most favorite things.""2) Hint: ""Taking too much damage?  Stop getting shot, okay?  I swear, it's like talking to a monkey.""  In terms of content, much of what makes the '80s great and plenty of what makes that time cringeworthy, too.  The devs really had fun with this one.  It's literally packed with humor and references, everything from the story, characters and dialogue to the one-liners, hints, animations, extras, even the (not really a) tutorial.  Not a game that wants to be taken seriously!  From a gameplay perspective, Blood Dragon is fairly straightforward Far Cry material.  The weapons are all fun to use and offer options for sneaky combat or total chaos.  Area design is pretty recycled and AI is nothing to write home about but the combat is fun regardless.  Bases can be captured from the enemy and claimed for friendly factions, creating new fast travel points and opening up missions to rescue scientists, hunt wildlife, and more.  Certain achievements will unlock new mods for your weapons in the stores.  A few collectibles in case you're really into hunting around for hidden goodies.  There's really not much to be said in light of the fact that FPS players, especially fans of the Far Cry series will feel right at home with the controls and mechanics.  The art style and graphic effects are pleasing.  The visuals and audio suit each other perfectly.  I didn't mess around too much with the fancy takedowns or other moves but they are cool to see.  Finished the game on hard difficulty without doing much exploring of the place, instead moving quickly through the campaign.  Perfect recommendation for an infusion of '80s goodness and a brief bit of mindless first-person shooter action.			"

After which i used a zip line to enter the compound and silenlty eliminate the remaining enemy presence with a crystal bow that shoots exploding arrows.  When everyone one was dead I reactivated the force field to the compound, killing the dragons within with defense laser beams, and claiming it as my own with a search light beamed to space.

												This game may well be great. I wouldn't know, because I'm unlikely to play much of it, since doing so requires using Ubisoft's awful, awful ""service"" Uplay.

My computer has no trouble handling modern games, so I thought it unnecessary, but that's the only place you'll see any warning about Uplay.Well, fool me once, shame on you. I won't be purchasing another game with Ubisoft's name on it until they pull a GFWL on Uplay. The sooner the better.			"

There are plenty of other problems, known since the release last year and nobody cares about fixing. I simply disapprove and disadvise.			"

												So, in case you didn't notice, UPlay is required to play this. After spending an hour-and-a-half trying to reset my password (last time I used it was for Assassin's Creed 2 on Xbox 360) and dealing with UPlay's fail-captchas, I finally decided to just make a new account. While I totally disagree against the requirement of the additional DRM/content client that is UPlay, I also have to take into account that I spent a lot of money (relatively speaking) to buy all the Farcry games. Once I had a new account, I was finally able to play the game.Being someone that has seen a large number of 80's action movies, I caught on to many of the references and even recognized Michael Biehn immediately on the front cover. The game is fun and humorous from the Get-Go. The game play is boring however. I expected more explosions and campy dialog during fights, but even during the first scene of carnage, not a line of dialog was spoken--just some classic rock music and the white noise from a helicopter machine gun. At one point, I caught myself leaning on my hand and yawning while using my other hand to aim and shoot. The audio wasn't very loud like I wanted either, even with my volume turned all the way up--but I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume that's just my problem.In the end, I can't recommend this game. It's fun for a short while but gets old really fast. If you didn't have to deal with UPlay just to play the game, maybe it would be worth it, but as it stands, it's just not.			"

												0/10. I remember hearing about this game awhile ago, and with the steam sale, how could i say no for 4 bucks?Installed it, came back a few hours later play. Then it begins, It begins its prelaunch installations. But then i notice a Uplay icon appear on my desktop. ""Oh no..."" I thought to myself, not uplay, especially with their notorious history of horrendous anti piracy, and the latest incident with watch dogs. After it finishes it pops up a uplay screen, and invites me with a ""Sign in to uplay"" . I respond with a no, and try re-launching far cry to see if i can get around it. ""No, No... I stay..."" says uplay, and welcomes me once again with ""Sign in"". I sigh and begin trying to recall my password for uplay, with no luck i hit the password recovery.It tells me to put in my email, and gives me a capatcha. I look at the capatcha instructions ""Please type the two words:"" and gives me two boxes. OK. I look up at the capatcha picture, and written is a mostly blank background, with ""9215"" written.  JUST. 9215. WAT. I try 9215 in the first box. ""Both fields are mandatory"". I try refreshing thinking something is wrong. it gives me. ""171"". 1.7.1. After refreshing a few times and trying various combinations i finally got 222 to work by putting 22 in the first box and 2 in the second. And this is all so i can use the online features probably right, i could of skipped this and just played the single player right? WRONG. ITS A SINGLE PLAYER ONLY GAME THERE IS NO ONLINE WHAT EVEN.0. OUT. OF 10. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN. WOULD EVEN MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT AND RE BUY ALL MY OTHER GAMES SO I DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY.Update: I have attempted to run the game.

												Got about 75% into this game when it came time for me to upgrade my steam hard drive to hold more space.  When I migrated my steam folder over to the new hard drive, this game's save file (along with every other UBISOFT game I own) dissapeared.  I tried everything in my knowledge to revover the save files.  I looked on Google and found tons of other players in the same situation as me, some of them found and posted solutions, none of which worked for me.  I tried contacting UBISOFT about it but only recieved a prewritten, stencel email that addressed my problem by offering a link to their FAQ page.  In order for me to speak with someone directly, I would have to go through more steps, which I will spare you from hearing about here.  Just to be clear, I never recovered my save files for UBISOFT games which have forced me to never want to play another UBISOFT game as long as I live. This game is a lot of fun -- I love the post aapocolyptic 1980s vision of the near future of 2007.  I just wish I could save my file without fear of losing it.			"

												There should be a warning in the description that this game requires Uplay. If you are on the line about whether to buy this or not, know you will have to deal with some consequences.I don't think the game understands how to correctly minimize. Pressing the Windows key doesn't work. Pressing Win + D doesn't take you to the desktop. Pressing Shift+Ctrl+Esc doesn't bring up the task manager. When you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, the game will automatically run in windowed mode with no option to minimize. If you want to make the game fullscreen again, you will have to go to menu -> options -> video -> fullscreen and change it.The game tries really hard to play satire on the genre its depicting, but it kind of comes off as an excuse for lazy game design decisions.I have also found the first game that can't get to 30 fps on my computer using minimum settings. I know I don't have a workhorse laptop, but a one-year-old laptop with an 8870M should be able to play this game at some sort of level.			"

												This one is a definite must-own and must-play.  It's fun and satisfying to treat the game like a big toybox playground of action figures from the 80s with you running around like a maniac at cyborg-enhanced speed blasting crowds of bad guys and finishing them off with shurikens and swords.The humor, music, and visuals are also all great.  The neon-on-black aesthetic makes the whole game feel like you're running around inside a giant arcade from the 80s.The only real downside is the major gameplay drag that was present in farycry 3 - the game, even on 'hard' mode, is still too easy.  The enemy AI is pretty dim and the enemies are far too easy to kill in general - even the blood dragons are chumps when you figure out their weakness.There was also an opportunity with this game to make more threatening enemies - for example, stalker cyborgs that might be a combination of Terminator, bits of the predator, and the stalkers from the Running-Man movie.  Basically, things that could be a tough match for Rex Power Colt to deal with.This game is also a budget spinoff made in-house, and it shows - they re-use assets for most of the game, and the game lacks a lot of features that would be great to have in a fully priced release - like epic boss battles and more variety.As it is though, this is one of those 'must-play' games.  You will feel like your dreams from childhood of being a cybernetic soldier of the future who gets to cuss all he wants and be the coolest kid on the playground are being realized.Oh and this game features one of the funniest sex scenes in anything.I look forward to seeing this game get its own true release in sequel/remake/spinoff form - everything from boss battles to coop play to more area, enemy, and mission variety needs to happen.  Rex Power Colt shall rise again.PS - When you play this game, unless you're rescuing a hostage or don't want to deal with a blood dragon at the moment, don't worry in the least about exercising caution.  Even on hard mode, you can pretty much run around like a maniac meleeing and stopping to blast a few enemies, so long as you run around behind cover a lot and use commo sense about not over-extending.  You're a superpowered cyborg after all, so you can do a lot more running and jumping than a human being  - might as well dash around like the Terminator stabbing people in the face.			"

There are plenty of other problems, known since the release last year and nobody cares about fixing. I simply disapprove and disadvise.			"

												So, in case you didn't notice, UPlay is required to play this. After spending an hour-and-a-half trying to reset my password (last time I used it was for Assassin's Creed 2 on Xbox 360) and dealing with UPlay's fail-captchas, I finally decided to just make a new account. While I totally disagree against the requirement of the additional DRM/content client that is UPlay, I also have to take into account that I spent a lot of money (relatively speaking) to buy all the Farcry games. Once I had a new account, I was finally able to play the game.Being someone that has seen a large number of 80's action movies, I caught on to many of the references and even recognized Michael Biehn immediately on the front cover. The game is fun and humorous from the Get-Go. The game play is boring however. I expected more explosions and campy dialog during fights, but even during the first scene of carnage, not a line of dialog was spoken--just some classic rock music and the white noise from a helicopter machine gun. At one point, I caught myself leaning on my hand and yawning while using my other hand to aim and shoot. The audio wasn't very loud like I wanted either, even with my volume turned all the way up--but I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume that's just my problem.In the end, I can't recommend this game. It's fun for a short while but gets old really fast. If you didn't have to deal with UPlay just to play the game, maybe it would be worth it, but as it stands, it's just not.			"

												0/10. I remember hearing about this game awhile ago, and with the steam sale, how could i say no for 4 bucks?Installed it, came back a few hours later play. Then it begins, It begins its prelaunch installations. But then i notice a Uplay icon appear on my desktop. ""Oh no..."" I thought to myself, not uplay, especially with their notorious history of horrendous anti piracy, and the latest incident with watch dogs. After it finishes it pops up a uplay screen, and invites me with a ""Sign in to uplay"" . I respond with a no, and try re-launching far cry to see if i can get around it. ""No, No... I stay..."" says uplay, and welcomes me once again with ""Sign in"". I sigh and begin trying to recall my password for uplay, with no luck i hit the password recovery.It tells me to put in my email, and gives me a capatcha. I look at the capatcha instructions ""Please type the two words:"" and gives me two boxes. OK. I look up at the capatcha picture, and written is a mostly blank background, with ""9215"" written.  JUST. 9215. WAT. I try 9215 in the first box. ""Both fields are mandatory"". I try refreshing thinking something is wrong. it gives me. ""171"". 1.7.1. After refreshing a few times and trying various combinations i finally got 222 to work by putting 22 in the first box and 2 in the second. And this is all so i can use the online features probably right, i could of skipped this and just played the single player right? WRONG. ITS A SINGLE PLAYER ONLY GAME THERE IS NO ONLINE WHAT EVEN.0. OUT. OF 10. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN. WOULD EVEN MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT AND RE BUY ALL MY OTHER GAMES SO I DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY.Update: I have attempted to run the game. There are no resolution options, and there is a black bar on the left side of my screen. I attempted to alt tab, and it went into windowed mode, and i have no idea how to full screen it again. -1/10.			"

												Got about 75% into this game when it came time for me to upgrade my steam hard drive to hold more space.  When I migrated my steam folder over to the new hard drive, this game's save file (along with every other UBISOFT game I own) dissapeared.  I tried everything in my knowledge to revover the save files.  I looked on Google and found tons of other players in the same situation as me, some of them found and posted solutions, none of which worked for me.  I tried contacting UBISOFT about it but only recieved a prewritten, stencel email that addressed my problem by offering a link to their FAQ page.  In order for me to speak with someone directly, I would have to go through more steps, which I will spare you from hearing about here.  Just to be clear, I never recovered my save files for UBISOFT games which have forced me to never want to play another UBISOFT game as long as I live. This game is a lot of fun -- I love the post aapocolyptic 1980s vision of the near future of 2007.  I just wish I could save my file without fear of losing it.			"

Played 10 mins - now uninstalling.   Entertainment value seriously outweighed by the problems.   I'm dissapointed in steam for allowing this crappy 'portal in a portal' hack.

												This is a corny 80's-style retro-future comedic FPS -- a non-serious look at a fictional neon-filled post-apocalyptic 2007.  If you've watched Commando, Predator, Robocop, TMNT, and the like -- you'll probably catch quite a few homages to those.  If you want serious business or anything not covered in massive helpings of cheese, look elsewhere.  If you want a corny power-trip with a goofball plot and a protagonist frequently cracking one-liners after killing enemies, this will entertain.It's very much in the style of the player as cinematic-level action hero -- you start pretty strong and pretty well armed, and it escalates from there.  There's a bow for silent ranged kills, takedown melee kills that can chain to multiple targets, a sniper rifle that you can upgrade to fire rounds that cause large explosions (think back to the original Robocop), an assault rifle that can be upgraded to fire laser blasts...It's pretty accessible.  I'm by no means an FPS fanatic, and on the default medium difficulty most things struck me as generally on the easy side -- it becomes not ""can I take out this garrison"", but ""would I prefer to do it quietly, or do I feel like guns blazing, or maybe it's time to lure in a Blood Dragon -- basically, a giant neon-lit T-rex that can fire laser blasts from its eyes -- for some chaos"".  There's one main-story mission that has a pretty severe difficulty spike in it, but difficulty can be adjusted on-the-fly.  This is definitely meant more to amuse and entertain rather than challenge and stump you.It's not a terribly long game.  Got all collectibles (some weapon attachments are unlocked with by accumulating them, so they matter somewhat), finished all side missions (which are almost either 'rescue a hostage' or 'kill a rare instance of one enemy type' at a specific location;), finished all story missions in under 17 hours, and many players will do this significantly faster.   There isn't randomly-generated content other than spawning of friendly/enemy NPCs (with no interaction beyond non-interactive greetings or killing, respectively) and it's not that long until you've been everywhere important, acquired all the weapons, hit the level cap, and killed at least one of every enemy type. As with most ~recent Ubisoft games, buying it on Steam will not exempt you from needing Uplay.  I experienced no trouble with this.  The game does have some crash bugs, though -- in particular, the game sometimes crashed if I inadvertently attempted to buy a health pack (""nano-meds"") from the store when I already had a limit.  Watch out for that if you're on a mission; once you start one, you can't leave the area without failing it and losing progress, and you only get checkpoints -- you can't actually save until you finish or fail it.    Individual missions usually aren't terribly long, but keep this in mind if you only have short intervals in which to play.Other notes -- Soundtrack suits the game very VERY well.   It's by Power Glove -- @ https://soundcloud.com/powerglove Also,  this is a standalone expansion.  I've never played any other Far Cry game, anyway, and gather that the rest of the series tends to actually be much more serious in tone.  Was originally $15 and Ubisoft is not averse to sales.   If you don't want two DRM systems for the same game, you could buy it directly via Uplay.			"

												A great retro-game.  Its a wonderful atmosphere, with great music, and funny over-the-top puns, and referrences.The optimization is actually pretty good. The gameplay is fun. The mood of the game is fantastic. The graphics are good, the sound fx are good, the music really accents the world. The game is a bit short, but its a stand alone expansion pack, and I got it for just a few bucks during a sale. I sure got my money's worth, and then some. I have atleast 7-9 hours clocked in on the game. Exploring, (got all collectibles) and sneaking around stealth like.The stealth mechanics seem semi-amatuer, but were still fun to sneak around with anyway.The story is pretty campy, but that was obviously the direction the devs were going in for the game anyway.Some of the weapons were pretty awesome, love the pistol (although not nearly as useless on the hard game setting which is what I played on.) I liked the lazer chain guns, the bow, and the sniper rifle. I didn't really care for the shotgun (which I usually love) or the assualt rifle. I think they could have done better with those, but I did like the weapon upgrade system.I give the game about an 8.1 all in all!I highly recommend it for any fan of the 80's (sci-fi or otherwise), especially those who happen to be FPS fans. I actually look forward to a sequel, or prequel, or frankly any game that is set in a semi-similar setting.Definitely catch this if you are even remotely interested! "

												If Far Cry 3 was an ode to bad trips, its spinoff, Blood Dragon, is an homage to '80s B-category sci-fi action flicks. Short, but sweet, and lacking nothing, from cheesy dialogue to horrendous one-liners to all-out badassitude and lack of subtlety. Recommended, especially if you grew up with the sort of movies this is paying tribute to.			"

												Far Cry 3 Blood DragonExplosive visuals. Neon colours everywhere. ""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?""Featuring an OST entirely composed by the australian music duo Power Glove, the sound is infused with electronic nostalgia that brings to mind many popular 80s film moments. It is one of the most memorable OST and I guarantee it will stay with you for days to come.The gameplay is almost identical to that of Far Cry 3, but with a few tweaks and simplifications. Being a game influenced by films such as Robocop, Terminator, Rocky, Tron, Commando etc, the main hero is a cybernetic super-soldier that obliterates everything in his way with the use of his ""little friend"". Also, there is a dedicated key for giving your enemies the middle finger.Keeping in mind that the game is supposed to be an hommage to the 80s films, the story, while being a massive cliche, has several exciting moments and is downright amusing. However, it's only there as an excuse for the gameplay.Extremely fun to play and doesn't drag on with only 5-7 hours of gameplay.			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about this game.The game is freaking awesome. Uplay is not even a problem to me. The way I got my game to work was to download and install uplay on their official website first. Then just download the game via steam and it should work fine (well at least it did for me). What happened when I first got the game was that it didn't work when I just installed the game on steam. When opening the game, steam automatically installed uplay and it just wouldn't let me log in with my uplay account for some strange reason. I then uninstalled the uplay that was automatically download through steam, and installed uplay again from the offical website. After that, it was all a matter of verifying the files of the game through steam which was pretty much all the files.			"

												This is one of the best standalone DLC's i have ever played. A whole different game from FC3 , It Oozes 80's.Terminator,Rambo,Predator,Robocop References can be seen everywhere. The dlc is full of colours , neon lights , lasers and theres a badass 80's synthwave soundtrack that will complete the atmosphere . Its also quite lengthy for a dlc and sidemissions are compelling as they reward you with attachments for your arsenal which includes Katana's , Ninja Stars , Lever Action Shotguns and a Minigun of course . I do however see complaints about it not working on Windows 10 , i use 7 so i dont know if thats true . I highly recommend you buy this gem .			"

 Retro futuristic style Non stop action! This game is great!  If you like 80s movies , dragons , comedy , action or just to shoot things up you should try this game! Uplay does not ruin the good experiance from the game, even though some people hate Uplay . While playing the game it does not come in the middle to ruin the game. Some achievements and rewards can be unlocked though Uplay which is a good thing.✓ Interesting story. ✓ Good graphics.✓ Great shooting and combat. ✓ Good voice act. Have some good funny lines.✓ Fun game play. (Stabbing mainly)✓ After main story a few side objectives to do. Rescue hostage, hunt for animals and take over enemy base.✓  Taking over enemy base ( side objective) is well done , if you like stealth you can sneak into the base and off their shield down so the blood dragons will come and finish the job for you OR you can go and single handedly kill everyone and take over! ✖ Short story , but this is not much of a drawback because there are some side objectives you can do after the story.

												This is now one of my faavorite games. I loved it. This game plays just like the orginal Far Cry 3, but is a completely new game. You play as Rex Colt, a cyborg, as you embark on your quest to rid the world of Omega force. Just like Far Cry 3, there are story missions and side quests. As you clear out garrison filled with troops, you unlock new side missions, which reward you with new gear and attatchments. There isn't a whole lot of pressure put on you to upgrade your weapons, but it helps to do so. It just a way to waste time in the game.  The real reason to play this game lies within the story. Its full of humour and references, but manages to stay original. The world is brand new, with ""future"" lighting and a slew of new creatures (Inlcuding the ""Blood Dragon"", which is extremely difficult to kill). You get a few futuristic versions of guns from the previous game, and a couple completely new ones. As you happily battle your way through hoards of enemies, you level up your character and guns; making you stronger and stronger. You keep donig this until you reach the end, which feels like it came too soon. The main game takes about 5 hours to complete, but you can still have plenty of fun performing the side missions.  "

												It's been 25 years since John Madden crashed through the front cover of your video game like a moppy-haired Kool Aid Man. That's 25 years of digital touchdown celebrations and the Cleveland Browns making it to the pretend Superbowl, just like in their dreams that never come true. For an anniversary so important it warrants messing up a long-established naming scheme, you’d think EA Sports would do more to celebrate it than just put in some retrospective trivia in the loading screens. Unfortunately Madden NFL 25 is more of a run-of-the mill upgrade than a big anniversary edition, but it is still a great version. Madden NFL 25 makes a lot of small improvements that build on last year’s big Madden NFL 13 revamp to create one of the finest football gaming experiences available.The differences aren’t huge, and hard to spot at a glance, because most are under the hood. Over a few games, though, it becomes apparent that Madden 25 doesn’t screw up as much. The Infinity Engine 2 physics got a lot of tweaking, and players look more realistic than ever in action. Each tackle feels and looks different, with players tumbling to the ground in myriad ways, but this year they do it without the crazy splaying legs and linebackers comically tripping over a downed receiver after a play. The cartoonish goofiness that took us out of the experience is gone, and Madden feels one step closer to replicating the look and feel of a real NFL broadcast.The other noticeable enhancement to moment-to-moment play is a much better set of tools for the running game. Maneuvers like spins, dives, stiff arms, and hurdles have all been improved and expanded, making great running backs and tight ends more awesome to play with. If you’re playing with a superstar athlete like Adrian Peterson, you can use a new Precision Modifier to really amp up the moves – if a player's stat in, say, Hurdles, is high enough, he can leap greater bounds, jumping over diving defenders. It's tough to pull off, and can only be done with the superstar athletes, but it's so satisfying when it happens.All of the modes from last year's game return, with some new tweaks that add another fun layer on top. Like in Madden NFL 13, each of 31 online players can decide if they want to play as a coach or as a single player (created, real, or legendary) in Connected Franchise. But now Franchise lets you play in Owner Mode, putting you in control of an entire team's staff, finances, and stadium. For the most part this is just a lot of metagame menus on top of Coach Mode, and deciding the price of hot dogs and jerseys isn’t the kind of thing that’s going to be long-term fun for most. But there is some cool stuff in here, most notably the ability to move teams to new cities. I was pleasantly surprised that when I decided to move my St. Louis Rams I was encouraged to pick Los Angeles, and when I did the mode's faux-Twitter stream mentioned the return of LA's prodigal sons. Owner Mode is a novelty to some extent, but it's a well done novelty, and adds a new way to play the already expansive Connected Franchise.With its incremental but noticeable improvements, Madden NFL 25 is the best football game experience I've had to date. It shines on a technical level, but the real issue with the series is that other sports games have improved so much faster that Madden 25 looks and feels dated by comparison – fake Twitter streams and pre-game montages are already old news. It would be better if EA Sports did more that was new and interesting rather than bringing back features discarded in previous versions. But the real meat-and-potatoes gameplay is better than ever, and when it comes down to it, we’re here to play some damn football. Madden 25 brings it with bone-crunching intensity.			"

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Genuinely funny, from the comic style animations between levels to the constant gags during gameplay.- Blood dragons, they are cool not to mention at one point you ride one.- Its different, the game makes great use of Far Cry 3 but it a completely different experience.- The end mission is just brilliant. The one before it isnt bad either, missions have variety. Onslaught ones are best.CONS:- Uplay, I personally have nothing but issues using Uplays DRM. With blood dragon it failed to save my progress within missions on a couple of occasions.- Fire, most enemeies use fire and god its annoying.- The game got a little tedious once the novelty wore off but ends really strong so stick with it.VERDICT? A unique experience and is definately worth a bash for its gung ho gameplay and genuine humour.			"

												Hilarious but painfully short.I really dig the neon, the one liners, mowing down enemies, it's Far Cry 3 but in the year 2007 (as imagined by people in the 80s).You get a huge selection of guns but no incentive to use them since your minigun eats through everything at the speed of instant. Tons of generic, unnecessary sidequests that exist to buff your terrible unused weapons, yawn. At least I can ignore them unlike in Driver SF. Suffers from a lack of enemy variety and the t-rexes are prone to being stuck in an infinitely looping animation.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I loved FC3 (for the gameplay and open world not the poor story)  and this twisted tongue in cheek spoof of the 80's seemed to be right up my alley. While some of the cheesy dialog, and general over the top humor did make me laugh, I couldn't get into the game. The problem was that while the graphics are well done, the 80's glam of neon blurred eveything into a haze that hid what it from view. Truth is my eyes hurt trying to play. Too much glowing neon. Nothing compelling in story and gameplay. Lots of similarities to FC3 with little twists of it's own...but nothing that made me want to keep going in the game.			"

												The good: -Vivid, fun visuals done in the style of over-the-top 1980's sci-fi action films, right down to on-screen effects intended to mimic VHS-era special effects, provide a total nostalgia trip-AWESOME soundtrack-Good pacing, excellent use of FC3 base engine makes the game itself very fun to play-Story elements are quite funny, as long as the buyer understands this game is not to be taken seriously-Good balance of challenge-Michael Beihn voice acting takes a goofy, silly, potentially even stupid idea and turns it on its head with a layer of legitimacy that makes the whole experience even more delightful.The bad:-Relatively short, but it's very cheap at least. The ugly:-Layered DRM with Uplay has made it so that I cannot play this or any other Ubisoft title for more than a year. Repeated attempts to resolve this issue have gotten nowhere. I am currently on my fifth support ticket.			"

												Hilarious but painfully short.I really dig the neon, the one liners, mowing down enemies, it's Far Cry 3 but in the year 2007 (as imagined by people in the 80s).You get a huge selection of guns but no incentive to use them since your minigun eats through everything at the speed of instant. Tons of generic, unnecessary sidequests that exist to buff your terrible unused weapons, yawn. At least I can ignore them unlike in Driver SF. Suffers from a lack of enemy variety and the t-rexes are prone to being stuck in an infinitely looping animation.			"

GONNA REVIEW THIS GAME...MARK IV STYLE MUTHAF*CKER !I really recommend this game to everyone who loves FPS or the 80s theme, you can have alot fun !PROS :The music is amazing ! GOD i can't stop listening to it.Graphics looks great and very colorful with all the neons and lasers (check-out my screenshots)Awesome story, fit extremely well with the 80s era.Suitable side-missions.Excellent voice-acting.Easy gameplay, even in hardest difficulty.Different weapons with customizations.Decent map with different vehicles.You can play stealth or John Rambo style.Tons of easter eggs and references.CONS :Uplay...i'll get to that later.Short, very short like 9 hrs to complete everything, you can even do a speedrun in about 1.5-2 hrs.Some visuals glitch here and there, nothing to worry about.No final boss fight, i thought there's one :(▂▃▅▇█ final judgement : 90/100 █▇▅▃▂Note :This is my FIRST game with Uplay and tbh i like it, with all those rewards and yes, i had 2 problems : the 1st, when launching the game for the first time it crashed every 10-15 mins, i redownload it again and the problem was gone. The 2nd is i lost the connection with UbiSoft servers, i dunno why. Uplay may suck but not like Origin (oh god that the worst platform, keep crashing) who knows ? maybe my second game with Uplay will suck ¯\_(ツ)_/¯And c'mon guys it's easy to make an account and install Uplay (it won't affect anything), IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE !

												If you like FC, FC2 and FC3 (like me), dont spoil it for your self with FC3 Blod Dragon.The save/cloud is a disaster (UPlay is not good, but in conjunction with this game...).I ended the game accidentally, when I had finished less than 20 % of the gameplay, and it was not even difficult (!). Actually I dont know how far I was in the gameplay, as the progress did not show in UPlay (it got stuck at 11 %).Leads me to this: One more (higher) level is missing. ""Hard"" is not hard.The super-boss is killed in a videosequence, not by you. (!!!)Then whole gameplay is not only a light-version of previous games, but ""the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over and over..."".NOBODY was inspired when they made this - just: ""Make some more money !""Best advice: Ask your friends who has it, to hear what they think.

												Explosions and neon and dragons, oh my. This is one of the best games I have played so far. Though the story is a bit short (about 8 hours on easy), the gameplay is fun and engaging. You may not have a large variety of weapons, but there are lots of attachments for them that you get by completing side missions (explosive bullets for a sniper rifle, for example). All the attachments give you a good reason to play on after completing the story. The game gives you a choice of playing it stealthy or going in guns blazing for many of the missions. My only real pet peeve is the brightness. Because the island is always dark, the neon lights don't quite light up the levels enough, and when they do, they are so bright it is hard to see anythingOverall, 8/10 would strongly recommend, especially on sale			"

												Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon is everything I hoped it would be, and more. More of the great Far Cry 3 combat system and mechanics, better atmosphere, stirring music, ridiculous weapons, and memorable quotes. After watching a few trailers, I can't see how anyone would be on the fence about this purchase. $15 is an absolute steal, if you don't see it in a classic Steam sale anyway. The 80's aesthetic work flawlessly well, and anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s will find Blood Dragon chalked full of nostalgic references. This game gets a full recommendation from myself, and it belongs in your collection if you enjoyed the Far Cry franchise, 80s action movies, or just an excellent open world first-person experience.As an aside, I'm not a huge fan of Ubisoft's UPLAY, and I'm not sure if it prevents Steam from tracking play time (I did get 1 of my trading cards). By NO means does it render this adventure unplayable.			"

												Wow yes..This is game, everything about this game done right. I do think it can surpass FarCry 3 if they make it the ""main"" game. The humor, the settings, the gameplay, lightings, graphics, optimization, all top notch. if you experience any FPS drop, try ALT + TAB then click the game press ALT + ENTER to make it TRUE full screen.The only downside is the very short play time (7 hrs FULL COMPLETION RATE with all collectibles) and of course the DRM..

												Words cannot describe how much I love this game. Steam says I have only 13 hours. It's more like 20-25. I could not get enough of the action and crappy dialogue. I spent so much time getting every achievement in the game, and loving every minute of it. The visuals are amazing, the music is hype, the action is brutal at times. The list of things I love about this game just goes on and on and on. My only complaint is it feels too short almost. Granted, it is a short DLC campaign, but it deserves its own game. 95/100 would play forever.			"

												This game is fantastic. I bought in at the sale price thinking, hey, if it's too goofy for me no big deal. But I have to say it was the best $4 game I've ever bought, and would be a bargain at $20. Good situation, plot, graphics, sound, music, voiceovers, and gameplay. It was just goofy enough to be a winner. My two gripes are: I beat it too quickly, and I wasn't able to ride around on cannon-packing blood dragons after I beat the game, which would have added a lot of replayability.Anyway, pick this game up.

												A cathartic, if short, throwback to 80's movies and 90's games. Everything about this game screams nostalgia: a protganist name like Rex Power Colt, dialogue so (intentionally) cheesey that even Snake Pliskin would cringe, and stylistic still-image cutscenes not scene in a decade. All of this utilizing the immensely enjoyable framework of exploring an open world and choosing your playstyle seen in Far Cry 3. The story is straight out of the 80's, with an ending that is nigh perfect for a game such as this.The guns, when fully upgraded, are immensely satisfying to use; the shotgun and sniper become stupidly overpowered (even on Hard) but it does a lot of work to get there. The real challenge comes from using stealth to get in close to the enemy, marking them all in order to keep track, and then blitzing through them with your takedowns, being able to take out entire groups in the blink of an eye should you possess the skill. The blood dragons you will encounter cannot be so easily slain, and they take patience and methodical approach to kill just one even with a fully upgraded character (on Hard).Overall, it's a game worth dedicating the day or two it will take to compelte. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously without being as wacky as games such as Saints Row 4 (though it does come close at times). The only obvious downside is how shallow and short the experience feels, particularly in the postgame, as it does not offer much replay value unless you really enjoy it. However it's cheap so that can be forgiven. Worth the buy if you loved 80s action movies, and worth a look even if you dont.			"

												Now THIS is a ♥♥♥♥ing video game. Amidst the call of duty trash and dull, generic, simulation shooters, Far Cry Blood Dragon stands alone. This game doesn't take itself so damn seriously. What happened to games being about fun gameplay rather than trying to slap a compelling narrative to a sub-par piece of trash? This game is about one thing and thats gameplay. Blood Dragon consists of an explosive and colorful arsenal (yes you can hold more than two guns at a time) that is used to destroy an array of diverse enemies. Ever used a lazer blade to assasinate an unsuspecting enemy, only to throw a shuriken into his partners dumb face? Flat out, this game is above and beyond. The controls are tight. The dialogue is hilarious. The tutorial will have you in stitches. Why aren't more games made like this? I have no idea. My biggest qualm with this game is the u-play ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tagged along with my steam version. Seriously developers, one piece of DRM per game please. Overall, If you were grossly dissapointed in Duke Nukem Forever, look no further. This is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been.I reccomend this game to anyone that likes to have fun.			"

												I bought this during the steam sale with no previous knowledge of the original game, something to be noted.The game itself, in one word is ""fun"" or ""amusing"".It is a parody of the 80's sci-fi cyberpunk genre, probably a re-skin of the original game from what I've heard of the original's gameplay.The narrative can be either funny or it feels like it tries too hard to be, which can be a hit or miss.The game has a story mode with objectives in an open world filled with ""Garrisons"" which you ""liberate"" giving you exp and access to sidequests that grant you attachments and upgrades for your guns.Speaking of guns, they feel great and doing the side quests and collecting items earning the upgrades feel very rewarding, for example: Explosive rounds for your sniper, laser rounds for your rifles and so on.This is one of the few games in which you can buy a loot map to find the collector items which is rather important as they grant you access to the weapon mods.The soundtrack by power glove is the cyber platter that holds this chunk of juicy cyber hearts together, the awesome 80's sci-fi vibe is propagated throughout the game with their immersive synths and tunes.I highly recommend this game for the price I bought it for which was about 4 USD, The game can be charged at least 15 and it will still be worth it.11/10 would bang			"

												HAve you played far cry 3? Well this♥♥♥♥♥♥is as awesome, only you have most of the abilities from the start, the game is hillarious, and overall there is less brain but more action. The only bad thing is that the game is a little to dark, and enemies have blue blood...everyboy wants real looking blood lets get real! Oh, btw, if you haven't played far cry 3, than you probably should grab ur armpit hair, cut it off, light it up on fire, and then after you that hair cant burn...drawn yourself in the toilet.

												Now THIS is a ♥♥♥♥ing video game. Amidst the call of duty trash and dull, generic, simulation shooters, Far Cry Blood Dragon stands alone. This game doesn't take itself so damn seriously. What happened to games being about fun gameplay rather than trying to slap a compelling narrative to a sub-par piece of trash? This game is about one thing and thats gameplay. Blood Dragon consists of an explosive and colorful arsenal (yes you can hold more than two guns at a time) that is used to destroy an array of diverse enemies. Ever used a lazer blade to assasinate an unsuspecting enemy, only to throw a shuriken into his partners dumb face? Flat out, this game is above and beyond. The controls are tight. The dialogue is hilarious. The tutorial will have you in stitches. Why aren't more games made like this? I have no idea. My biggest qualm with this game is the u-play ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tagged along with my steam version. Seriously developers, one piece of DRM per game please. Overall, If you were grossly dissapointed in Duke Nukem Forever, look no further. This is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been.I reccomend this game to anyone that likes to have fun.			"

												I wasn't digging Blood Dragon at first; when it opens it's kind of trying too hard to be ridiculous. However, it grew on me (like a tumah!) and by the game's insane, over the top conclusion I was unironically fist pumping right along side it.  I also ended up appreciating the game's condensed length.  Most open world games drag on longer than the expiration date of their mechanics - but you can 100% Blood Dragon in under 8 hours and that's precisely the right amount of time to spend with the game.

												Every now and then I will find and play a game that will challenge any sensibility I have of ""a fun video game"". I don't mean I think ""That was unique. I'm glad I played it."" I mean, I find a game that is fun, immersive, and so far up my alley that I beat the game before I get enough. Blood Dragon is that game, and I want another one. Blood Dragon is a shortened version of Far Cry 3 but with a theme that is the totality of rad from every 80s action movie ever combined into one. The year is 2007, and you have survived an apocalyptic nuclear winter between the U.S. and the USSR that crescendoed in the 1980s. You play as a Michael Biehn cyborg (ironic seeing how he fought one in the Terminator) and are trying to stop a Cobra Commander type of villain from sending his army of cyborg soldiers out to enslave mankind and rule what's left of the world. The action is awesome, the controls are great, the fetch quests are addicting and everything I've ever wanted in a soundtrack or action movie is here. My only two complaints are that the game was too short and that there was no final battle with the final boss (just a cutscene). Overall, I was extremely satisfied and am considering checking out the other Far Cry games.			"

												Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon HAS DRAGONS!!! This game is indeed a very interesting one, most of what the game was trying to accomplish it succeeds at, but others it falls short of intriguing... Every cuss word concocted by man is in every SINGLE SENTENCE!!! Like its ok after a small portion of the game but when you're playing this game for a couple hours it can get out of hand... And the game has these refrences to popular everything from the 80's!!! THAT WAS SWIG-A-DEE-SWOOG-A-DEE!!! ( Sorry, my inner nerd is trying to break free. At least that's what my friends say? ) I was not born in the 80's, but I pretty much got all the references. Hey, call me old school if you will, I'm just that cool (Sorry again, i'm actually not that cool). But action is non-stop and fast-paced. And you can play ""Halo"" two different styles ( Really this game is exactly like Halo, except not in space, has dragons instead of Grunts, and it doesn't have flippin MASTER CHIEF!!! BIGGEST COMPLAINANT RIGHT THERE!!! ) Stealth, or Guns-a-Blazzin. No matter which style you play Blood Dragon it's going to be a blast. This game is definitely worth your time if you like the Si-FI, Action, 80's genre! 10/10 IGN!!!Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon Final Review: DID I MENTION THERE'S DRAGONS!!!			"

												This game is completely nuts.Imagine Robocop, Terminator, Michael Biehn, neon, dragons, and really the 80s in general all blended into a game, and this is basically what you get. The soundtrack is fantastic. It plays practically the same as FC3, except now you can sprint as fast as Doom guy and you never have to deal with FC3's poor implementation of fall damage ever again. The guns are basically straight rips from other movies, they give you the Auto 9 and Cobra Assault Cannon from Robocop and the 1887 from Terminator 2 complete with flip cocking animation between shots. You even get a dedicated flip the bird button that you can totally rapid fire. That should tell you everything you need to know about this game. Really, the fact that a major studio like Ubisoft greenlit this is nuts, especially in the current generation where no one wants to take risks. Stuff like this almost never gets made outside of like, RDR Undead Nightmare or Infamous Festival of Blood. So yeah, if you're a jaded dummy like me who unironically loves 80s action movies, then you should probably support this. If you just want to see more crazy stuff like this get made then you should definitely support this.			"

												It is a fairly short game.  The hours listed reflect the fact that UBI Soft launcher was loaded, not the time I was actually playing.  Anyway it is very similar to Far Cry 3 except you play as a cyber soldier in a techno-color world.  It has a sense of humor and doesn't take it self seriously.  I hope this license ends up getting a full fledged game rather than the MOD treatment of Far Cry 3 it seems to be.  It could make a much more interesting game then its parent game.  There are only 4 main story missions to follow and a bit over a dozen bases to take over.  Watch some videos and if you think it would appeal to you, then buy it.			"

												1) How much do you care about 80's pop culture?2) Do you like...fun stuff?These are the only 2 questions you need to ask yourself when buying this game, esp the first question, because half of this game's awesomeness comes from you appreciating all the little references, hints, details, and culture from 80s' music, movies and games. Pros:- It's got Far Cry 3's gameplay/gunplay mechanics- Weapons: You're going to become incredibly overpowered by the end- A good amount of collectibles like video tapes and CRT TV's- Open world- Animals, or cyber-animals to hunt and mess with- Great nostalgic cutscenes- Artstyle and visuals, it's very retro yet gorgeous.- Blood Dragons, fun to fight and add a layer of creepiness when being stealthy- Cheesy: The dialog, story, characters are cheesy as hell. The one game where I wouldn't want it any other way- Music, absolutely fan- FU*&#QHREHFUH#U%HQUFAUFN- tastic soundtrack (my fav aspect of the game)- Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese from The Terminator)Cons:- Short, It'll take you about 10-12 hours to beat everything (Sidequests, main quest)Future:I'll buy whatever sequel this expansion gets, and I highly recommend this to everyone bec even if you're not a big 80's fan, there's still a great game here.

Lots of brain-dead enemies to lead into traps, decent if predictable assortment of weapons, and  just enough collectables to encourage you to explore.Everything looks like a mix between Tron and Terminator.It won't take you long to beat Blood Dragon, even if you collect every collectable and ace every side-mission.  That might sound like a disadvantage, but in honesty you will probably grow sick of the dark, cliched neon-punctuated world at about the same time the game runs out of content...			"

Once I started to play this I was immediately satisfyed. Most say this is what Duke Nukem Forever should of been and I humbly agree. Putting Duke aside though this is clever and unique in its own way. In such a way that even someone who didnt grow up in the 80s can enjoy it. You know when they say if you can get Michael Beihn get Michael Beihn...well they got Michael Beihn!!! The game is tragicly fun and harder to put down then the original Far Cry 3 which is not good in the slightest. However during thoose hours you are addicted to this little homeage,refrence and nostalgic filled game you will not feel like your time or money was wasted.			"

												Far Cry 3 gets the ""non-serious and reference-filled"" treatment with this expansion. Even though it takes place on an open world like its base game, Blood Dragon has been simplified, streamlined, and cleaned up quite a bit. When you're not engaging in the batshit crazy story, you're capturing garrisons and collecting collectibles. Being able to sprint infinitely and quickly combined with no fall damage makes for a game that's less about the world around you and more about you: a cyborg out for blue neon blood.As mentioned, the story is crazy. Unfortunately, most of it hides behind cutscenes that, while nicely-drawn and humrous, are ridiculously long. Like, seven-second pauses in between each line. You won't miss any plot if you skip these, but you might miss little nuggets of good writing.Also of issue are the titular Blood Dragons. While cool-looking and initially fearsome, you'll get enough firepower during your travels to turn them into more of a nuisance than a terror-inspiring boss. The other enemies you'll come accross, cyber-soldiers and cyber-animals, don't put up much of a fight unless they're in big numbers. Despite this, combat is still pretty satisfying, and the game stays true to the goal of making you feel like a badass.If you don't like Uplay, then I've got bad news for you: you need to install Uplay and create an Ubisoft account to play this game (assuming you haven't done either of those already). Uplay isn't really a pain to get set-up, and there's no always-online requirement, but it does add another weird layer to playing this game and it's one more program I have to install on my computer when I'd prefer to keep it as lean and clean as possible.All in all, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a fun halfway between linear and open-world, with lots of ways to approach enemies and a fairly formidable enemy in the Blood Dragons. It's the perfect length for an expansion and the setting is well-crafted, albeit hampered by an absurdly slow narrative.			"

My only two complaints are environment interaction is wonky. I have to position the camera at specific angles in order for me to loot or activate things. Pulling out hearts just to get the money from corpses is not one of my favorite past times. Heh, Rex shares the same reaction with me. The last complaint is pretty major and it annoyed me throughout. When you hit ESC to enter the menu screen, a pop up window blocks you for 20-30 seconds with a message saying it's connecting to the FC3 servers. Should be fine if I'm offline, but I wasn't. I set the parasite Uplay to offline mode, Steam in offline mode and still get this message.Other than those complaints, if you want to have a good time and likes ripping hearts out then Far Cry 3 — Blood Dragon is a no-brainer. Nerd.			"

												7/10, good game. Would I buy FC3, hell NO! FC3 just won't work. But let's redesign it: add Tronish neon retro-skin with powerful soundtrack, keep concept of fun game design in your heart (without ripping it out) and prime it with popular culture references and spot-on one-liners without teenish undertone. Especially soundtrack keeps this game afloat.I would have liked a bit harder gameplay difficulty, but it was entertaining enough. There was some grinding to get 100% collectable items and required dragon kills, but if you're not completionist then game flow is smooth. Hard difficulty 100% completion was under 17 hours and that includes time with game paused and watching credits. This is one of those games you play only once through but that play-through is actually good one. There is no replayability value.You can buy Blood Dragon without FC3, this a good purchase (15€) if you're looking for fast-paced retro-theme hero adventure to keep you entertained over weekend.			"

It's only downfall is that it's short on story missions. I was laughing hysterically and scared ****less all within a matter of minutes in this game. Far Cry 3 was good. Blood Dragon was amazing.

 Blood Dragon FC3- Blood Dragon was one of the best stand alone dlc games I have played in a while. Though its graphics are a bit old; It was increadibly fun to run around, explode faces, and collect tapes, tvs, and notes. I got this game during a sale. I wouldn't purchase it at full price but was definately worth it on the sale price.Pros Open World Option to go explore and find collectables Over Powered Guns (because we all love quadruple barrel incendiary shotguns) Blood Dragons (Makes the best weapon) Enviroment is flamable (for you pyros out there :P) Everything is NeonCons Short (However it is a standalone DLC) Nothing left to do after you beat the game Even the hardest enemies are easy after a bit of gameplay "

												Far Cry 4 - Blood Dragon is a short and sweet game with all the excitement of a regular Far Cry game however it is quite a lot shorter than regular Far Cry games It took me 8 hours to fully complete it(and I was NOT speedrunning it). Also this game is more laid back and free-willing than regular games in this series and has much more freedom than usually in this series. Either way this game is a great one-day game and it is worth money.			"

												Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon HAS DRAGONS!!! This game is indeed a very interesting one, most of what the game was trying to accomplish it succeeds at, but others it falls short of intriguing... Every cuss word concocted by man is in every SINGLE SENTENCE!!! Like its ok after a small portion of the game but when you're playing this game for a couple hours it can get out of hand... And the game has these refrences to popular everything from the 80's!!! THAT WAS SWIG-A-DEE-SWOOG-A-DEE!!! ( Sorry, my inner nerd is trying to break free. At least that's what my friends say? ) I was not born in the 80's, but I pretty much got all the references. Hey, call me old school if you will, I'm just that cool (Sorry again, i'm actually not that cool). But action is non-stop and fast-paced. And you can play ""Halo"" two different styles ( Really this game is exactly like Halo, except not in space, has dragons instead of Grunts, and it doesn't have flippin MASTER CHIEF!!! BIGGEST COMPLAINANT RIGHT THERE!!! ) Stealth, or Guns-a-Blazzin. No matter which style you play Blood Dragon it's going to be a blast. This game is definitely worth your time if you like the Si-FI, Action, 80's genre! 10/10 IGN!!!Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon Final Review: DID I MENTION THERE'S DRAGONS!!!			"

												It may say I haven't got a lot time on the game, but it's because when I play, it takes me to uPlay, so the time doesn't get counted much. I have spent 14 hours on this game.Basic Information ~ FC3 - BD feels like FC3 with an 80s nightclub feel, I'm guessing, and it adds 8-bit cutscenes.Story ~ You are Rex, a Mark IV cyborg commando, who is so cheesy, I can smell it, but this is actually quite funny. The year is 2007, after a nuclear bomb destorys Canada. Your old Commando, Sloan, is out to destroy the world, so you must stop him. It's quite weird how the story sticks along with the cheesy one-liners.Gameplay ~ The game consists of FPS and stealth. You have multiple ways around a situation, where you can take the guards out in assualt form, you can stealth kill them, or just sneak past them. Once you have finished the game, you can mess about in the Open-World, taking over the Enemy Garrisons and making them your own. The world is quite big, but not as big as FC3, but this is okay for an £11.99 game, or in a deal, £4.99. Times ~ Story - 4 - 5 hours Side Missions (to get you bonus weapon add-ons) 2 hoursOpen-World - 2 hoursIs it replayable? YES! Total time - 8 - 9 hours Overall - Overall, FC3 - BD is a great game, but it has it's flaws. Pros--Great Gameplay-Good Story -Cheese-IECons- -No skill tree, it has skills each level up.-Rex's voice can get annoying. -Short Story Time, only 4 hours! Total Score:8/10			"

												Far Cry 3 gets the ""non-serious and reference-filled"" treatment with this expansion. Even though it takes place on an open world like its base game, Blood Dragon has been simplified, streamlined, and cleaned up quite a bit. When you're not engaging in the batshit crazy story, you're capturing garrisons and collecting collectibles. Being able to sprint infinitely and quickly combined with no fall damage makes for a game that's less about the world around you and more about you: a cyborg out for blue neon blood.As mentioned, the story is crazy. Unfortunately, most of it hides behind cutscenes that, while nicely-drawn and humrous, are ridiculously long. Like, seven-second pauses in between each line. You won't miss any plot if you skip these, but you might miss little nuggets of good writing.Also of issue are the titular Blood Dragons. While cool-looking and initially fearsome, you'll get enough firepower during your travels to turn them into more of a nuisance than a terror-inspiring boss. The other enemies you'll come accross, cyber-soldiers and cyber-animals, don't put up much of a fight unless they're in big numbers. Despite this, combat is still pretty satisfying, and the game stays true to the goal of making you feel like a badass.If you don't like Uplay, then I've got bad news for you: you need to install Uplay and create an Ubisoft account to play this game (assuming you haven't done either of those already). Uplay isn't really a pain to get set-up, and there's no always-online requirement, but it does add another weird layer to playing this game and it's one more program I have to install on my computer when I'd prefer to keep it as lean and clean as possible.All in all, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a fun halfway between linear and open-world, with lots of ways to approach enemies and a fairly formidable enemy in the Blood Dragons. It's the perfect length for an expansion and the setting is well-crafted, albeit hampered by an absurdly slow narrative.			"

I thought it was a good idea to buy this to 'test' the game even though they look a lot diferent. The gameplay is not MIND BLOWING at all. If you liked FC3, then here ! There's more. The good reason to buy this, is for the god damn style of this stand alone. Basically, take what the 'future' looked like in the 80's and you get it right. Neons, synthetizers, cyborgs, dragons shooting lasers out of their ♥♥♥♥ing eyes, etc. It has some good geeky puns and references you might like, and the soundtrack is just a masterpiece. Really. FC3's weapons are reskinned to make you look like a badass, you can breath indefinitely under water, run faster than Usain Bolt and you take no falling damage. hf.MARK IV STYLE MOTHA♥♥♥♥A			"

It's not very long (around 2 hours of gameplay) but surely worth the money and the best thing is that it's a game itself, no DLC, no FC3 required to play this. Funny wirtten tips, good atmosphere and great voice acting. The only drawback I see is that you have to hold the interaction button to interact with things, not just pressing it once. After some time it's frustrating. But other than that, I surely recommend this gem.			"

												This game is radical, totally tubular, and gnarly to the max.With so many retro games trying to capture the feel of the 80s, it's ironic that Blood Dragon, from big budget publisher Ubisoft, does it the best. Everything here is a checklist of the era that I grew up with, and in such a tongue-in-cheek delivery that had me laughing out loud way too many times. It was clear that everyone involved had a lot of fun making this game. Micheal Biehn, who was sadly phoning it in for a recent blockbuster game  (And who wouldn't if you knew the game I was talking about), is incredible here with his self-deprecating portrayal of the 80s action hero that he helped create.Gameplay wise, while I'm not a big fan of open world games, the playing field of Blood Dragon is almost perfect to me: Not too sprawling with a an intimidating amount of repetitive minigames, but not too small that that game ends too soon. Although there came a point when I felt like things were getting tedious, lo and behold I finished not only the game, but all side quests and collectibles! A big feat for someone who skips these things in open world. Far out, Far Cry 3. Far. Out.			"

												I cannot recommend this game more. Certainly for anyone who remembers it's source material, but for any early '90's kid' who grew up on their older brother's 80's cartoons, their parents 80's action VHS tapes, and was entranced by the cartoons of their own era that still had that offbeat style that haunts them to this day. For those of you who see modern cartoons that lack the macho hero, the two-dimensional love interest, and the evil cyborg who wants to control the world. The shows that take themselves too seriously and are slathered with so many unsubtle moral messages they make no sense. For those of you who have had their experience ruined by modern storytelling and adult cynicism.This game is your outlet.Everything you miss about those old cartoons and action heroes.Crammed with references to series I never thought I'd hear about again (And some I never have, I'm sure), characters ripped straight out of more of the same, and a soundtrack so full of 80's synth you'll have flashbacks.And of course, more one-liners than I've heard from Arnie, Stalone, and Van Damme.Combined.Blood Dragon's action and story moments are what you're here for. A barebones kill-the-bad-guy plot that's not about who you're after, but how you take him down, and how everything explodes nonsensically along the way.The gameplay is simple enough to understand, effectively identical to Far Cry. For those not familiar with it, don't panic. It's a brilliant system reknowned for attention to realistic detail that plays well into the action-movie aesthetic Blood Dragon draws from. Even some of the weapons here are movie references.Perhaps the strangest part of Blood Dragon is the moments between its story and combat that provide moments for reflection, particularly with the travel methods taken from the Far Cry series.It is in these moments that you are likely to notice Blood Dragon's flaws, of which there are very, very few.Perhaps the most voiced flaw of Blood Dragon is the requirement of a UPlay acount to play Blood Dragon, as it is a Ubisoft game. This can be a valid concern, as loss of any account details can mean a lack of access to the game and requirement of technical support. Every buyer should take care in setting up their UPlay account if they do not have one already. The experience of Blood Dragon is too good to ruin with haphazard account setup, and is most definitely worth it.The first of the game's ACTUAL arguable flaws is its length. Blood Dragon is definitely not a very long game, and after your first full playthrough, you're likely to notice that there is nothing else out there except a week long 80's movie marathon that can come close to the feeling of your first Blood Dragon playthrough. Which is it's second flaw, the difficulty in defining why Blood Dragon captures its nostalgic essence so well can make it difficult to find anything like Blood Dragon except... More Blood Dragon. Or trying to watch Jonny Quest and Terminator at the same time while posing Dino Riders figures.Besides the possibility of account issues, Blood Dragon's only downfall as a standalone game may be that there isn't more of it. Or that it's not a war simulator that's been rehashed twelve times for its multiplayer. Blood Dragon delivers where a lot of games fail, making your protagonist a certified hero you WANT to play as. Rex 'Powers' Colt has no flaws, except maybe that he's TOO badass. And he's voiced by Michael Bien, who might not be the BEST known action star, but he's the hero from Terminator. And he's in Aliens, so Rex Colt really IS an 80's action hero.Anyone who feels a pang of nostalgia the moment someone mentions aliens of any kind, has a fear of man-eating sharks with uninspired names, or says 'I'll be back.' without even the slightest hint of an Austrian accent will find a moment of solace in Blood Dragon.

Now I will say this however, it is not as big or long as Far Cry 3 because it's supposed to be a DLC WELL IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A DAMN OVERHAUL! All the animals are mutated neon monsters, Giant Dinosaurs lovinley named BLOOD DRAGONS (seriously they live up to their namesake) roam the island killing Daft Punk fans and scientists ( Rex calls them nerds) while playing through a story with so many references that I almost had a brain anurism.

												1) How much do you care about 80's pop culture?2) Do you like...fun stuff?These are the only 2 questions you need to ask yourself when buying this game, esp the first question, because half of this game's awesomeness comes from you appreciating all the little references, hints, details, and culture from 80s' music, movies and games. Pros:- It's got Far Cry 3's gameplay/gunplay mechanics- Weapons: You're going to become incredibly overpowered by the end- A good amount of collectibles like video tapes and CRT TV's- Open world- Animals, or cyber-animals to hunt and mess with- Great nostalgic cutscenes- Artstyle and visuals, it's very retro yet gorgeous.- Blood Dragons, fun to fight and add a layer of creepiness when being stealthy- Cheesy: The dialog, story, characters are cheesy as hell. The one game where I wouldn't want it any other way- Music, absolutely fan- FU*&#QHREHFUH#U%HQUFAUFN- tastic soundtrack (my fav aspect of the game)- Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese from The Terminator)Cons:- Short, It'll take you about 10-12 hours to beat everything (Sidequests, main quest)Future:I'll buy whatever sequel this expansion gets, and I highly recommend this to everyone bec even if you're not a big 80's fan, there's still a great game here.

												They took Far Cry 3 gameplay and smashed every 80's action movie flick repeatedly into it.  The music and sound effects are amazingly synthesized.  The cutscenes are similar to Ninja Gaiden for NES.  Gameplay is pretty much the same as Far Cry 3.  Your character has to go around and liberate bases, do sidequests for weapon attachments, and kill stuff to level up.  The main story doesn't take long to complete, but is more satisfying than Far Cry 3.  I'd recommend checking it out if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, because this game compliments it well.			"

												It is a fairly short game.  The hours listed reflect the fact that UBI Soft launcher was loaded, not the time I was actually playing.  Anyway it is very similar to Far Cry 3 except you play as a cyber soldier in a techno-color world.  It has a sense of humor and doesn't take it self seriously.  I hope this license ends up getting a full fledged game rather than the MOD treatment of Far Cry 3 it seems to be.  It could make a much more interesting game then its parent game.  There are only 4 main story missions to follow and a bit over a dozen bases to take over.  Watch some videos and if you think it would appeal to you, then buy it.			"

												First time I saw the trailer for Far Cry 3 - Blood dragon I was like ""WTF?!?!? )))))) :D:X:XDXCFDXGDSSGg"". After playing the game through quickly I was still pretty much the same. WTF just happened. It's a fun sight to see a big game developer sidetrack and go absolutely bonkers with its franchise and that is what FC3 - Blood dragon is, absolutely bonkerville. Delightfully crazy 80s influenced futuristic action packed fast paced first person shooting trip filled with lots of references to popular movies and a soundtrack well suited for the whole setting. Love it!Like with Far Cry 3, I had very little problems with Far Cry 3 - Blood dragon (works with same engine, duh). It's a lot shorter experience but the price simultaneously is much lower and you don't need to have the original Far Cry 3 to play Blood Dragon. If you hate the 80s, corny remarks, one liners and references and you don't like fast paced shooting or alternatively slowly hiding and stabbing people or shooting arrows to your foes heads then the game definitely isn't for you. Otherwise it's a relatively short but pretty freaking solid shooting experience for a relatively low price and I most definitely can whole-heartedly recommend it.			"

												I absolutely loved FC3, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love the 80s.  Infact, I'm going to go ahead and get my small complaints out of the way early so I can spend the rest of this review going balls deep:  It sucks that there are so few weapons.  You get new attachements, and they can really alter the way the weapon works, but there are only actually a handful of death implements.  This bothers me  because  A.) The sheer amount of guns there are in Fc3, and B.) Because of how ♥♥♥♥ing cool potential weapons could have been.  The guns that are in the game are simply common archetypes - there's a shotty, sniper, AR, etc.  That's not necessarily an issue, but given how creative the rest of the game is, I can't help but hold it to a high standard.Now on to the good stuff.I'm going to tell you the very moment I fell in love with this game.  I had just loaded it up, watched a truly sick cutscene and sprayed down a bunch of future cyberninjas with a helicopter mounted minigun.  The helicopter lands, and I receive a comm message informing me that the tutorial is starting. Without missing a beat, my character screams "" I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE TUTORIALS "".  Hilarious though it was, this moment is also very significant.  It's Blood Dragon's way of letting you know exactly what it is, and what to expect, right as the game starts.  It is a fun spinoff of a popular game franchise.  It is not DLC.  It is not an expansion pack.  It is a stand alone experience that doesn't take itself to seriously.  It is a love letter to the movies, stories and games that many of us grew up on. It is charming, it is gorgeous, and it is incredibly engaging.  You take control of a cybernetic super soldier tasked with unraveling the defection of your former superiour officer.  The story itself is pretty cookie cutter, but the way it is told is anything but.  Cutscenes are an anachronistic fusion between the 8-bit era and modern flair.  Though the story failed to captivate me, the dialogue was frequently a highlight.  Blood Dragon thrives on it's unique brand of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Storywise - zero carry over from anything Far Cry, but there are quite a few similarities in the gameplay.  There are animals to hunt, there are unlockables to find and missions often play out exactly like clearing a compound in Far Cry 3.  The bones of it are the same, but not quite as deep (understandable, given the games bargain price point).  Aiming is almost exactly the same as FC3 - there is still that kind of ""floaty"" element to it which usually necessitates aiming down the sights to hit a shot.   There are not as many weapons to unlock, but the level of upgrades available for your arsenal per weapon is much improved.  Your relationship with your weaponry is a lot more intimate, and doing missions to earn these upgrades will be where you'll spend a lot of your time.   As a gamer, the thing that I find most appealing is atmosphere.  This isn't something that can be quantified, nor is it the result of any one thing.  It is the pervasive feeling you have while playing the game.  Blood Dragon has a very unique and powerful atmosphere.  The neon juxtaposed by the darkness of the island itself is amazing.  Running in terror from the eponymous Blood Dragon's (or alternatively using them as attack dogs) is a thrill.  Using your cyber ninja stars/samurai sword for stealth kill combos just feels right.  Watching a cyber ninja's head explode in electric sparks after a perfect headshot is satisfaction squared.  All of these things contribute to atmosphere, but they are only parts of the whole.  The thing that I love most about Blood Dragon is that it exists.  That a triple-a game studio like Ubisoft let their employees run wild and create something that was fun to them is incredible to me.  It isn't a (true) sequel, it isn't made to nickel and dime you, it was a bunch of people creating something cool for the joy of it.  This more than anything speaks to the feel of the game.  The soul of fun and creativity is apparent in literally every part and every moment of FarCry3: Blood Dragon.  I cannot recommend it enough, and I hope that we see more of its kind.8.5/10			"

												A very fun firstperson-shooter with beautiful graphics in an 80's retro-style inspired world.This is one of the funniest games I've had the joy of playing - the writing is incredibly entertaining and hilarious. It mocks pretty much everything that revolves around cheesy movie elements (lines, story, characters etc.) and other 80's related business.The game doesn't overstay its welcome with about 4 hours of an enjoyable story. Of course, should you choose to do so, you do have the option of doing various side-missions (hunting, outposts..) and collecting collectables.Also, NO RADIO TOWERS. Hooray!The game is open world, however the map is smaller than that of Far Cry 3, and you are much less encouraged to actually explore it since it's packed with a short story that expects you to follow it during your time playing the game and doesn't tell you or show you much regarding other open world related activities.Of course exploring it can be (and is) fun nonetheless.Cons: Uplay / supporting Ubisoft.Other than that, it's an experience worth having. Especially considering you can have the game for less than $4 during sales.			"

												Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is a very good game and makes fun. It has a lot of jokes and you can play it several times and its not getting boring. But the only problem that i dont like is, there is no CO-OP! Ok you must install U-Play to install it. Good its ok for me.So for me the 15€ were more then worth it.

												This game is pure cheese.It's like a Jean-Claude Van Damme late 80s movie made into a game.Surprisingly, it's quite enjoyable as a game.  Lots of brain-dead enemies to lead into traps, decent if predictable assortment of weapons, and  just enough collectables to encourage you to explore.Everything looks like a mix between Tron and Terminator.It won't take you long to beat Blood Dragon, even if you collect every collectable and ace every side-mission.  That might sound like a disadvantage, but in honesty you will probably grow sick of the dark, cliched neon-punctuated world at about the same time the game runs out of content...			"

												It may say I haven't got a lot time on the game, but it's because when I play, it takes me to uPlay, so the time doesn't get counted much. I have spent 14 hours on this game.Basic Information ~ FC3 - BD feels like FC3 with an 80s nightclub feel, I'm guessing, and it adds 8-bit cutscenes.Story ~ You are Rex, a Mark IV cyborg commando, who is so cheesy, I can smell it, but this is actually quite funny. The year is 2007, after a nuclear bomb destorys Canada. Your old Commando, Sloan, is out to destroy the world, so you must stop him. It's quite weird how the story sticks along with the cheesy one-liners.Gameplay ~ The game consists of FPS and stealth. You have multiple ways around a situation, where you can take the guards out in assualt form, you can stealth kill them, or just sneak past them. Once you have finished the game, you can mess about in the Open-World, taking over the Enemy Garrisons and making them your own. The world is quite big, but not as big as FC3, but this is okay for an £11.99 game, or in a deal, £4.99. Times ~ Story - 4 - 5 hours Side Missions (to get you bonus weapon add-ons) 2 hoursOpen-World - 2 hoursIs it replayable? YES! Total time - 8 - 9 hours Overall - Overall, FC3 - BD is a great game, but it has it's flaws. Pros--Great Gameplay-Good Story -Cheese-IECons- -No skill tree, it has skills each level up.-Rex's voice can get annoying. -Short Story Time, only 4 hours! Total Score:8/10			"

												Pros:Excellent game. Although there are not very many weapons, the weapon upgrades and the length of the game make each weapon a unique experience. It seems like the game knows when you are getting bored of a weapon, and says ""wait, you collected enough TVs to get a new upgrade that changes the weapon!"" and then you have something new.The enemies are mostly balanced. None of them are too overpowered, doo too much damage, or are too easy to kill (except for the flamethrower dudes, they are really op in my opinion)The graphics are not amazing on low quality, they are like low quality skyrim. However, the neon colors splashed everywhere make it look highly visually appealing. The game is funny. There are plenty of little jokes thrown in that will make you chuckle, or at least smile.It is rated M partly for sequal content, but the only part of the game that really has that is a cutscene you can skip. There is some writing with some sexual content, but it too is avoidable and optional to read.In traditional Far Cry style, you can realistically heal without medkits. Welding and reconnect parts of your cyber arm, exercising a hurt hand, reconnect a disjointed wrist, it all makes sense and later in the game heals up to 4-5 bars of health without a medkit. Cons:Healing and fire don't work well together. If you are healing, then during it you get set on fire, the healing will be canceled and you have to pat the fire out. However, you cannot pat the fire out for several seconds after it cancels out the healing. When it finally is cancelled out, you have to wait another few seconds before you can heal. it is quite a hassle. The game has taken me about 10 hours to completely beat, as in every side quest, garrison, collectible set, main story, and weapon upgrade acheived/done, and I hit max level. Although the game is great, 10 hours of playing is not worth 15 dollars.Summary: The game is amazing, every open world gaming fan should have it. However, don't buy it at full price. If you can get it for more than 50% off, i got it 75% off, it is definitely worth the money.			"

												Double-dipped for this bad boy, and don't regret a thing. Takes the solid gameplay of FarCry 3 and upgrades it with Mark IV cyberbiotech. Unstoppable.---IMPORTANT EDIT RE: GAME FREEZING---Okay, I don't know if the latest patch -- or possibly latest Uplay update -- broke the game -- or if I'm having bad luck but the game is really messing up. Rex struggles to walk up stairs or over lips, but that's not the worst part: Fast traveling freezes my game. Now, you might say, ""Then don't fast travel."" That's all well and good but missions that end with a cutscene/travel option (such as the one involving Dr. Carlyle) lock up, forcing a replay. I've tried to play in both online and offline mode, and don't really know what else to do, seeing as so few people have reported this. I suspect it's because most folks have moved on to new titles, and don't replay Blood Dragon as much as I do. Well... replay it as much as I did. I'll keep trying and remove this edit should I solve the problem (and post my solution, in case others are in a similar situation).			"

												I bought this during the steam sale with no previous knowledge of the original game, something to be noted.The game itself, in one word is ""fun"" or ""amusing"".It is a parody of the 80's sci-fi cyberpunk genre, probably a re-skin of the original game from what I've heard of the original's gameplay.The narrative can be either funny or it feels like it tries too hard to be, which can be a hit or miss.The game has a story mode with objectives in an open world filled with ""Garrisons"" which you ""liberate"" giving you exp and access to sidequests that grant you attachments and upgrades for your guns.Speaking of guns, they feel great and doing the side quests and collecting items earning the upgrades feel very rewarding, for example: Explosive rounds for your sniper, laser rounds for your rifles and so on.This is one of the few games in which you can buy a loot map to find the collector items which is rather important as they grant you access to the weapon mods.The soundtrack by power glove is the cyber platter that holds this chunk of juicy cyber hearts together, the awesome 80's sci-fi vibe is propagated throughout the game with their immersive synths and tunes.I highly recommend this game for the price I bought it for which was about 4 USD, The game can be charged at least 15 and it will still be worth it.11/10 would bang			"

It's everything that Duke Nukem Forever could have been. Brilliant one liners, excellent weapons catchy soundtrack and all in the flavour of an 80s sci fi action movie. Over the top and filled with action. It also acts as a good introduction to Far Cry 3. The achievements are good and more importantly, achieveable with at least one of them being a Bill Hicks quote.

The story is brilliant and its setting.If you love 80's action films especially Robocop and Terminator you will get right into this from the start! Even though it's an entire spoof of the 80's action scene it doesn't disrespect it, however gives a great nod to it.Full of over the top action and one liners. playing from start to 100% is about 8-12 hours depending on how well you play/difficulty. I really recommend doing all the side missions as they are not a waste of time like other games but give you a chance to upgrade your weapons and really make them ""bad♥♥♥♥♥quot;.2016 update- I still think this is one of the best.

												Want to play Far Cry 3, but without: wanting to commit suicide every thirty seconds because you're playing some b*tch named Jason Brody; having to waste time crafting crap; getting bored trying to play the main storyline after spending so much time doing side missions?I thought so. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is what you should spend your dollars on, not Far Cry 3 (or 4). It's like Ubi Montreal did a double-take and asked, “should we make this into a game people who eat their steaks with a side of bacon and a double cheeseburger for dessert would actually play?”HELL YES!The 80’s references, the graphic styles of Tron or Blade Runner, the animation cutscenes reminiscent of video games before quick time, the one-liners, and the music combine to provide what video games used to provide: entertainment. You can play this for half an hour and put it down. It’s not some game where you have to spend real hours crafting a purse from pig skins you collected because nobody on the island has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ backpack. And for that half hour, you’ll enjoy it.The fact that parts of the game slag FarCry 3's gameplay and character makes it it even more enjoyable for me. The only thing that could top that would be a chance to kick Brody in the nuts and then feed him to a cyber shark. So, what are you waiting for, your mother to buy it for you?Get it now!			"

Though its graphics are a bit old; It was increadibly fun to run around, explode faces, and collect tapes, tvs, and notes. I got this game during a sale. I wouldn't purchase it at full price but was definately worth it on the sale price.Pros Open World Option to go explore and find collectables Over Powered Guns (because we all love quadruple barrel incendiary shotguns) Blood Dragons (Makes the best weapon) Enviroment is flamable (for you pyros out there :P) Everything is NeonCons Short (However it is a standalone DLC) Nothing left to do after you beat the game Even the hardest enemies are easy after a bit of gameplay "

												Every now and then I will find and play a game that will challenge any sensibility I have of ""a fun video game"". I don't mean I think ""That was unique. I'm glad I played it."" I mean, I find a game that is fun, immersive, and so far up my alley that I beat the game before I get enough. Blood Dragon is that game, and I want another one. Blood Dragon is a shortened version of Far Cry 3 but with a theme that is the totality of rad from every 80s action movie ever combined into one. The year is 2007, and you have survived an apocalyptic nuclear winter between the U.S. and the USSR that crescendoed in the 1980s. You play as a Michael Biehn cyborg (ironic seeing how he fought one in the Terminator) and are trying to stop a Cobra Commander type of villain from sending his army of cyborg soldiers out to enslave mankind and rule what's left of the world. The action is awesome, the controls are great, the fetch quests are addicting and everything I've ever wanted in a soundtrack or action movie is here. My only two complaints are that the game was too short and that there was no final battle with the final boss (just a cutscene). Overall, I was extremely satisfied and am considering checking out the other Far Cry games.			"

												Far Cry 4 - Blood Dragon is a short and sweet game with all the excitement of a regular Far Cry game however it is quite a lot shorter than regular Far Cry games It took me 8 hours to fully complete it(and I was NOT speedrunning it). Also this game is more laid back and free-willing than regular games in this series and has much more freedom than usually in this series. Either way this game is a great one-day game and it is worth money.			"

Downside: Collecting ironical trophies in an open world environment is still collecting trophies in an open world environment. It's gotten a bit old, and making the trophies VHS tapes is both funny and self-defeating.			"

												year 2007? MORE LIKE 2077! (my original review, leaving it her because why not.)(now onto the new/serious review!)Alright, apparently not a lot of people know about this game, but its actually pretty good. Its always nice to see a game with so much silly cliches and awkward dialogue, that doesn't take itself seriously. Unless you know how to take a joke and have a good laugh, you probably won't like this ame. Its full of randomness and pop culture references from things like terminator, robocop, and a bunch of other classic future titles. If you like that kind of stuff, be ready to have a great time! If you're looking for a more serious story driven gripping adventure, go buy normal far cry 3, this one is for the nerds that want a good laugh from time to time.			"

												Want to play Far Cry 3, but without: wanting to commit suicide every thirty seconds because you're playing some b*tch named Jason Brody; having to waste time crafting crap; getting bored trying to play the main storyline after spending so much time doing side missions?I thought so. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is what you should spend your dollars on, not Far Cry 3 (or 4). It's like Ubi Montreal did a double-take and asked, “should we make this into a game people who eat their steaks with a side of bacon and a double cheeseburger for dessert would actually play?”HELL YES!The 80’s references, the graphic styles of Tron or Blade Runner, the animation cutscenes reminiscent of video games before quick time, the one-liners, and the music combine to provide what video games used to provide: entertainment. You can play this for half an hour and put it down. It’s not some game where you have to spend real hours crafting a purse from pig skins you collected because nobody on the island has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ backpack. And for that half hour, you’ll enjoy it.The fact that parts of the game slag FarCry 3's gameplay and character makes it it even more enjoyable for me. The only thing that could top that would be a chance to kick Brody in the nuts and then feed him to a cyber shark. So, what are you waiting for, your mother to buy it for you?Get it now!			"

												With Far Cry 3 being my favorite game of 2012 and in my top 10 list of favorite games of all time I got pretty excited for this one. Once I started to play this I was immediately satisfyed. Most say this is what Duke Nukem Forever should of been and I humbly agree. Putting Duke aside though this is clever and unique in its own way. In such a way that even someone who didnt grow up in the 80s can enjoy it. You know when they say if you can get Michael Beihn get Michael Beihn...well they got Michael Beihn!!! The game is tragicly fun and harder to put down then the original Far Cry 3 which is not good in the slightest. However during thoose hours you are addicted to this little homeage,refrence and nostalgic filled game you will not feel like your time or money was wasted.			"

It is a bit dumbed down from the main game such as no towers to climb, hunting is shallow, and upgrading is automatic when leveling up. Overall, if you like Far Cry 3 and want more of it, then you should get Blood Dragon. If you have not played Far Cry 3 but love 80s action/sci-fi movies and NES action games you should give this game a try.			"

												First things first: uPlay is awful, but there are plenty of mods that disable it. I strongly advise using one.A desperate old-school aesthetic without actual old-school substance. The profuse stupidity and half-considered sci-fi tropes are there, the challenge and deliberate balance are not. The noisy, interlaced, ""shades-of-pink,"" VHS aesthetic is simply a distraction from how little is actually going on. The gunfights are all immensely easy, made worse by the fact that the enemies simply throw themselves at the player without ever posing any actual threat or attempting any defensive tactics. The level-up system is completely unnecessary due to the game's abject linearity and lack of variation and simply serves to slowly buff the player out of control. Aside from the upgrade system and the visuals, the game's mechanics are mostly identical to Far Cry 3's, except that Far Cry 3's enemy layouts actually created situations which required some consideration, especially when going for a stealthy approach. Here, the best strategy is almost always to stand is a narrow corridor -- and there are plenty -- and wait for all of a level's enemies to come rushing to their deaths. For a game that prides itself so much on ""old school action,"" Blood Dragon is surprisingly braindead, even by modern standards.This is an old-school game for people who have neither experience with old-school games nor the skills necessary for them. I'd like to see one of the people who praised this game -- just one! -- one-credit-clear Metal Slug.			"

												The first thing this game reminded me of was Duke Nukem Forever. Everything is 100% guaranteed ubisoft, you can count on them making a terrible game no matter how awesome the initial vision was. It forces you to install ubisoft's uPlay, having it on Steam is not enough. The world feels completely desolate and uninteractive. The controls feel clunky and there is no option for hold-crouch because its made for people with only one finger on their left hand. There is no usable minimap either, I have to go to the full map every 10 seconds if I want to navigate anywhere. I have no idea why anyone would consider this anything but total garbage. Michael Biehn was the only reason i played for even 2 hours before uninstalling. It's just no fun at all, somehow watching someone play this makes it seem fun but it's not.			"

												It is a fairly short game.  The hours listed reflect the fact that UBI Soft launcher was loaded, not the time I was actually playing.  Anyway it is very similar to Far Cry 3 except you play as a cyber soldier in a techno-color world.  It has a sense of humor and doesn't take it self seriously.  I hope this license ends up getting a full fledged game rather than the MOD treatment of Far Cry 3 it seems to be.  It could make a much more interesting game then its parent game.  There are only 4 main story missions to follow and a bit over a dozen bases to take over.  Watch some videos and if you think it would appeal to you, then buy it.			"

												1) How much do you care about 80's pop culture?2) Do you like...fun stuff?These are the only 2 questions you need to ask yourself when buying this game, esp the first question, because half of this game's awesomeness comes from you appreciating all the little references, hints, details, and culture from 80s' music, movies and games. Pros:- It's got Far Cry 3's gameplay/gunplay mechanics- Weapons: You're going to become incredibly overpowered by the end- A good amount of collectibles like video tapes and CRT TV's- Open world- Animals, or cyber-animals to hunt and mess with- Great nostalgic cutscenes- Artstyle and visuals, it's very retro yet gorgeous.- Blood Dragons, fun to fight and add a layer of creepiness when being stealthy- Cheesy: The dialog, story, characters are cheesy as hell. The one game where I wouldn't want it any other way- Music, absolutely fan- FU*&#QHREHFUH#U%HQUFAUFN- tastic soundtrack (my fav aspect of the game)- Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese from The Terminator)Cons:- Short, It'll take you about 10-12 hours to beat everything (Sidequests, main quest)Future:I'll buy whatever sequel this expansion gets, and I highly recommend this to everyone bec even if you're not a big 80's fan, there's still a great game here.

												This game is not serious at all. It tries to be stupid and does it good. Beautiful scenery along with kickass 80's references and music makes it just epic. Overall a very fun shoot 'em up rather than your regular fps. Think of it as Duke Nukem or Serious Sam. Albeit a little short but absolutely worth it.			"

												Pretty much just a smaller retroized version of farcry 3.  The writing is funny as hell.  And the voice acting is just great!  Game play is pretty much the same as Farcry3's campaign.  There is no co-op or pvp.  I enjoyed the few hours it took me to beat this game.  Only downside is how short it is.			"

												I don't know where to begin with this game.  It has an amazing soundtrack and characters, and is full of great old school action.  It has an identical engine to that of Far Cry 3, has redone graphics to give the appereance of a classic 1980's TV show.  I highly recommend this game to anyone with some nostalgia, or someone who just enjoys a great game.			"

The humor, the settings, the gameplay, lightings, graphics, optimization, all top notch. if you experience any FPS drop, try ALT + TAB then click the game press ALT + ENTER to make it TRUE full screen.The only downside is the very short play time (7 hrs FULL COMPLETION RATE with all collectibles) and of course the DRM..

Multiple gameplay niches like stealth or all out warfare. Far cry element yet the scientific side of it. Mutants running around everywhere, humorous dialog, addicting gameplay, amazing graphics. My only and only complaints are: shotgun kind of sucks, wish more weapons were added, a bit more enemies (besides animals) and the DMR for uPlay by ubisoft sucks.You should really look into trying this game out.

												Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is one of those rare cases were the spin-off game is actually better than the main game in my opinion. It takes much of what Far Cry 3 does, condenses it into a smaller environment, makes everything much faster and easier to get to, makes you crazy powerful from the start, injects a crapload of style and 80's/90's referential humour into it, and offers a shorter and much easier to get into experience while giving you just enough stuff to do outside of the main story to easily justify the standalone price. Everything from the visual style to the cheesy neon environment and cyber-esque enemy designs just makes the short time spent in this game a joy. Throw in an amazing 80's style new wave/techno soundtrack from the guys at ""Powerglove"" and you have one of the more unique looking and sounding games of the last few years.An easy recommendation.

												This game is fantastic. I bought in at the sale price thinking, hey, if it's too goofy for me no big deal. But I have to say it was the best $4 game I've ever bought, and would be a bargain at $20. Good situation, plot, graphics, sound, music, voiceovers, and gameplay. It was just goofy enough to be a winner. My two gripes are: I beat it too quickly, and I wasn't able to ride around on cannon-packing blood dragons after I beat the game, which would have added a lot of replayability.Anyway, pick this game up.

A four dollar sale price makes this a no-brainer, but even at full price it's a steal.			"

												Double-dipped for this bad boy, and don't regret a thing. Takes the solid gameplay of FarCry 3 and upgrades it with Mark IV cyberbiotech. Unstoppable.---IMPORTANT EDIT RE: GAME FREEZING---Okay, I don't know if the latest patch -- or possibly latest Uplay update -- broke the game -- or if I'm having bad luck but the game is really messing up. Rex struggles to walk up stairs or over lips, but that's not the worst part: Fast traveling freezes my game. Now, you might say, ""Then don't fast travel."" That's all well and good but missions that end with a cutscene/travel option (such as the one involving Dr. Carlyle) lock up, forcing a replay. I've tried to play in both online and offline mode, and don't really know what else to do, seeing as so few people have reported this. I suspect it's because most folks have moved on to new titles, and don't replay Blood Dragon as much as I do. Well... replay it as much as I did. I'll keep trying and remove this edit should I solve the problem (and post my solution, in case others are in a similar situation).			"

												The only Far Cry game worth playing after the first two-thirds of Far Cry 1.It does-away with Far Cry 3's awful, dull and unskippable story-telling, and a few of the skinnerbox-isms that drive its gameplay hours (eg, less time wasted with lengthy contextual first-person animations, towers, etc.). The main missions are also a lot better than in FC3, and the humor is also particularly self-aware and well done in a pleasingly-cheesy way.Blood Dragon will be over before it gets mind-numbingly repetitive like Far Cry 3 and its filler, so I consider it the definitive Far Cry (3) game to play. It's the only Far Cry game I've ever been able to play until completion, and consistently enjoy.			"

												First things first: uPlay is awful, but there are plenty of mods that disable it. I strongly advise using one.A desperate old-school aesthetic without actual old-school substance. The profuse stupidity and half-considered sci-fi tropes are there, the challenge and deliberate balance are not. The noisy, interlaced, ""shades-of-pink,"" VHS aesthetic is simply a distraction from how little is actually going on. The gunfights are all immensely easy, made worse by the fact that the enemies simply throw themselves at the player without ever posing any actual threat or attempting any defensive tactics. The level-up system is completely unnecessary due to the game's abject linearity and lack of variation and simply serves to slowly buff the player out of control. Aside from the upgrade system and the visuals, the game's mechanics are mostly identical to Far Cry 3's, except that Far Cry 3's enemy layouts actually created situations which required some consideration, especially when going for a stealthy approach. Here, the best strategy is almost always to stand is a narrow corridor -- and there are plenty -- and wait for all of a level's enemies to come rushing to their deaths. For a game that prides itself so much on ""old school action,"" Blood Dragon is surprisingly braindead, even by modern standards.This is an old-school game for people who have neither experience with old-school games nor the skills necessary for them. I'd like to see one of the people who praised this game -- just one! -- one-credit-clear Metal Slug.			"

												The first thing this game reminded me of was Duke Nukem Forever. Everything is 100% guaranteed ubisoft, you can count on them making a terrible game no matter how awesome the initial vision was. It forces you to install ubisoft's uPlay, having it on Steam is not enough. The world feels completely desolate and uninteractive. The controls feel clunky and there is no option for hold-crouch because its made for people with only one finger on their left hand. There is no usable minimap either, I have to go to the full map every 10 seconds if I want to navigate anywhere. I have no idea why anyone would consider this anything but total garbage. Michael Biehn was the only reason i played for even 2 hours before uninstalling. It's just no fun at all, somehow watching someone play this makes it seem fun but it's not.			"

												haha this has references to stuff from the 80s. That means the devs don't actually have to build a decent game behind it.Seriously though it's just Far Cry if all the lights were turned out, the guns were replaced with futuristic ones that are worse than the FC3 guns and the islander theme was replaced with unfunny references to teenage mutant ninja turtles and dinosaurs.I liked the minigun section at the beginning though.

												I found the Far Cry 3 format to be excellent, but i just didn't like the outposts, the guns, the level up system, or even the island itself. I found it to have almost 0 replay value and to be flat out boring. Don't get me wrong, i loved Far Cry 3, I've beaten that game multiple times, but I found Blood Dragon just to not have the same appeal to me.			"

												With Far Cry 3 being my favorite game of 2012 and in my top 10 list of favorite games of all time I got pretty excited for this one. Once I started to play this I was immediately satisfyed. Most say this is what Duke Nukem Forever should of been and I humbly agree. Putting Duke aside though this is clever and unique in its own way. In such a way that even someone who didnt grow up in the 80s can enjoy it. You know when they say if you can get Michael Beihn get Michael Beihn...well they got Michael Beihn!!! The game is tragicly fun and harder to put down then the original Far Cry 3 which is not good in the slightest. However during thoose hours you are addicted to this little homeage,refrence and nostalgic filled game you will not feel like your time or money was wasted.			"

												Double-dipped for this bad boy, and don't regret a thing. Takes the solid gameplay of FarCry 3 and upgrades it with Mark IV cyberbiotech. Unstoppable.---IMPORTANT EDIT RE: GAME FREEZING---Okay, I don't know if the latest patch -- or possibly latest Uplay update -- broke the game -- or if I'm having bad luck but the game is really messing up. Rex struggles to walk up stairs or over lips, but that's not the worst part: Fast traveling freezes my game. Now, you might say, ""Then don't fast travel."" That's all well and good but missions that end with a cutscene/travel option (such as the one involving Dr. Carlyle) lock up, forcing a replay. I've tried to play in both online and offline mode, and don't really know what else to do, seeing as so few people have reported this. I suspect it's because most folks have moved on to new titles, and don't replay Blood Dragon as much as I do. Well... replay it as much as I did. I'll keep trying and remove this edit should I solve the problem (and post my solution, in case others are in a similar situation).			"

												a histerical, but short, far cry based shooter built from the ground up for people who like 80's action and sci-fi movies.  the game opens with a cheesey joke, if you laugh, then good things are ahead.  if you don't laugh, then some of this game's jokes may fall pretty flat for you.  people who don't like 80's stuff likely wont get many of the jokes.  but on the bright side, the game is great and many jokes don't need any explaining at all.  everything is a bright neon color, everything is a cyber this, laser that.  even the animals are cyborgs!  there is a scene where you dive into a tank filled with cyber sharks, the comedy is a persistant part of the game universe.   every bullet is a laser, your enemies blood is glowing neon blue, you pulll out thier cyber hearts as bait for blood dragons.  what are blood dragons?  genetically engineered monstrosities.  why were they genetically engineered?  unimportant.  what is important is that colonel ike sloan has gone mad from drinking blood dragon blood (yes, I know) in an attempt to become an even more powerful cyber-human.   you, Rex Power Colt, the last of the MK IV Cybercommandos must stop him.if this sounds ridiculous, good, it is.

												Want to play Far Cry 3, but without: wanting to commit suicide every thirty seconds because you're playing some b*tch named Jason Brody; having to waste time crafting crap; getting bored trying to play the main storyline after spending so much time doing side missions?I thought so. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is what you should spend your dollars on, not Far Cry 3 (or 4). It's like Ubi Montreal did a double-take and asked, “should we make this into a game people who eat their steaks with a side of bacon and a double cheeseburger for dessert would actually play?”HELL YES!The 80’s references, the graphic styles of Tron or Blade Runner, the animation cutscenes reminiscent of video games before quick time, the one-liners, and the music combine to provide what video games used to provide: entertainment. You can play this for half an hour and put it down. It’s not some game where you have to spend real hours crafting a purse from pig skins you collected because nobody on the island has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ backpack. And for that half hour, you’ll enjoy it.The fact that parts of the game slag FarCry 3's gameplay and character makes it it even more enjoyable for me. The only thing that could top that would be a chance to kick Brody in the nuts and then feed him to a cyber shark. So, what are you waiting for, your mother to buy it for you?Get it now!			"

												There are a lot of games that do a lot of things to try and be great. This game has nothing to prove to anyone because it is the ultimate 1980's power fantasy distilled  into game form. Does it have minor flaws? Maybe. Does it matter? No. Because you can jump off a hanglider, break your fall on a cyborg as you stab him, ninja star his friend, and then rip out their hearts and feed it to a dragon. That combo doesn't even use any of your bullets. This game can't be bothered with stamina meters or fall damage, it's too busy bringing future justice to care about that stuff. What it doesn't feature is unlimited ammo, which would suck, since half the awesomeness of having cybog weapons is reloading them like a boss.			"

It's book ended by lots of explosions, as fit for an action movie with lots of cheezy one liners. It's the best bang for the buck to come along since the Humble Bundles, and is the kick in the balls that the non-indie game industry needs right now.			"

												Lots of stupid fun, with many approaches to different situations.  It's on the easy side though, so I'd suggest playing on hard.  Worth it at the asking price, can't go wrong if it's on sale.  Not a ""must play"" by any stretch of the imagination, but there are some great ridiculous moments.			"

Throw all those 80's post-apocalyptic sci-fi tropes into one game, sprinkle with some great run-and-gun, a dash of stealth, a pinch of over-the-top humour, bake with kick♥♥♥♥♥visual styles of a future gone-wrong (it is the year 2007 after all!) all for the low-low price of $15 MSRP and... well... why are you still reading this when you could be playing Blood Dragon???

												A goofy romp back in time to 1980's, Blood Dragon's Neon looks are something quite unlike anything else out there today. Full of snappy humour and classic action movie nods, all backed up by the same solid shooting mechanics behind Far Cry 3. Side missions get repetetive, and there isn't much to do after the balls-to-the-walls climax, but the journey there is well worth the price of admission.			"

												It's a goofy, over-the-top, special effects-filled, 80s sci-fi action movie in video game form. Far Cry 3 was very pretty and fairly fun, but for the most part was dry, bland, humourless, with a cliche story trying to pretend it was clever. Blood Dragon, on the other hand, is a fun, intentional play on cliches that never takes itself seriously.			"

												If you've played Far Cry 3, get this game. If you haven't, get it anyways. This is the game comes straight from the 70s, 80s, and 90s all rolled into one, to give us a neon-filled, nostalgia-fuelled cyber-shooter. You play as a cyber commando, fighting other cyber commandos, and there are DRAGONS WITH FRICKIN' LASERS IN THEIR EYES. Lots of fun references, including Robocop and Predator, hilarious dialogue and jokes, and probably some of the funniest writing outisde of the Borderlands series. However, combat can often get repetitive with the many garrisons that you have to raid. Also, you can't fly a helicopter, but you drive something much better that I cannot say without ruining some ascpect of the game. Probably the one and only real problem that I've had with this game was that it was launched through UPlay. It just gets in the way. Plus, the main campaign is fairly short, but hey, pick it up during a sale, and it's definitely worth it. 8.5/10 Would 100% complete this game.			"

It has an 80's style feel to it, kind of like the terminator, each cutscene is also pretty unique, instead of like 3-D, we get NES styled cutscenes which in my opion is pretty badass!			"

The only downside to this game was UPlay. The game was also very short but that's because it is a stand-alone DLC. I consider this game better than the actual Far Cry 3.

It was targeted at 80's kids, though, but I was born in 1998 so I can't exactly say I get all of it. Comedy is priceless. Shoot a guy with a bow and your guy says ""I gave him the shaft"".

												really good game, its appreciated when a game has an unique style, especially in a genre that has been getting really stale and predictible, game manages to to do so by being filled with references and easter eggs from the 80's and overall capturing that era's vibe with its retro presentation in the cutscenes, chessy dialogue and story, overall not taking itself serious and delivering great gameplay with some enemies and weapons that are just fun to use and kill  are its biggest achievements8.5 "

												Blood Dragon is a much better game than the Far Cry 3 prefix would have you believe. It plays better, runs better, looks better, and actually has writing. Clever writing. It has undeniable style and some of the more fun weapons and combat I've seen in an FPS recently. It's not perfect, but it's a solid length and pretty fun. I imagine it's even a bit more fun if you were an 80s kid, but I can't speak to that.Try Blood Dragon, even if you're like me and disliked Far Cry 3. They actually put effort into this one.			"

The only thing that could've made it better is if it was longer and maybe some kind of multiplayer.  Totally worth $15. In fact, if you don't buy this then there's something wrong with you.

												There are a lot of games that do a lot of things to try and be great. This game has nothing to prove to anyone because it is the ultimate 1980's power fantasy distilled  into game form. Does it have minor flaws? Maybe. Does it matter? No. Because you can jump off a hanglider, break your fall on a cyborg as you stab him, ninja star his friend, and then rip out their hearts and feed it to a dragon. That combo doesn't even use any of your bullets. This game can't be bothered with stamina meters or fall damage, it's too busy bringing future justice to care about that stuff. What it doesn't feature is unlimited ammo, which would suck, since half the awesomeness of having cybog weapons is reloading them like a boss.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. If you are thinking about maybe buying it, buy it. It reminds me of Saturday morning specials of G.I. Joe and Transformers. It's like if Aliens, Terminator, and some other movie with Jean Claude Van Damme, Michael Beihn, or Arnold in it mixed together and made a video game. Plus there are hundreds of eighties movie refernces throughout the game. All these good things there has to be some setbacks:        - it's kinda short, but who watches an eighties action movie for the story?So why are you still reading this and not throwing your 15 bucks at this game?

												Great game. Blood Dragon is an FPS with elements of an RPG, set on a dark and futuristic island. If you love chessy 80's action movies, then you should get this game. -The plot is very thin, but the cheesy one-liners make up for it.-You unlock gun mods from side quests and collectables, all the while gaining XP and levelling up which give extra heath, or little perks. -The art style is awesome, from the filters put on the gameplay, to the retro style cut-scenes.-The game rewards stealth, for the most part. If you like run and gun, it may not be your cup of tea.7/10 - A bit short, but worth every penny. Normally I am a completionist, but didn't feel compelled to collect everything in this one.			"

												This may be the greatest game never made in the 80s of all time.The not-so-subtle bend of 80s-90s action tropes, pseudo-retro style and synth music is beyond AWESOME!The game is a LOT of fun and has some hilarious moments as well as letting you pace yourself. So if you want to explore every little cave and room you can  or just power through the main story. The only downside is the game ends quite quickly and unfortunately has little replay value but after a hard day's work there is nothing like mowning down multiple cyberborg soldiers with a mini-gun while spouting 80's styled puns and then giving them the cyber finger.All we need now is a movie of this phenomenal game.

												Overall, I really enjoyed BD, more so than any other far cry game I have played. Naturally, since it is just a standalone DLC, it is fairly short, and only took me 8 hours to beat. My biggest complaint is the difficulty of this game, it's even easier than FC3. I didn't die a single time on the hardest difficulty, and the enemies really didn't pose a threat, at all.			"

												This game basically fixes most of what was wrong with Far Cry 3 (Unlikeable characters, bad """"""crafting"""""" system, unimpressive gunplay, boring and atmosphere-less world) , while giving it a badass 80's futuristic action movie style, complete with the visuals, the characters, the bad jokes and puns, the nonsensical weapons and gadgets (along with the descriptions and typos).The gameplay is far better than FC3. Now you have more speed, jump higher, have stronger weapons, there's no bloated content (crafting, climbing towers, obligatory hunting missions and the skill tree in wich you can unlock everything, basically rendering the ""tree"" part meaningless, now it's just a linear skill unlock system) and, altough the map is much simpler, it's also better, and capturing camps isn't the same♥♥♥♥♥♥easy and boring job it was in FC3, in wich the gameplay can be basically resumed to clearing icons on a map.Just skip Far Cry 2 and 3 and play this one.PS: Far Cry 4 and Primal are basically reskins of the third game, that is why I didn't mention them.

												Sargent Rex Colt is a man with a mission. Kill the bad guys and save the day. It’s as simple as that, just murder everyone who stands against you and liberate the island from evil. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 or 4 and love 80s nostalgia then you will love this game.Using a fully upgradable arsenal of crazy weapons cut down cyborgs and neon monsters a like all the while spouting amusing one liners and wreaking havoc where ever you can. The titular Blood Dragons ate my favourite part, use some meat and summon a huge beast with eye lasers to do the dirty work for you.This game is more entertaining than you can shake a stick at. It’s hard not to smile while cutting people down with a shiny neon katana. If you want more awesomeness then you will love Far Cry: Blood Dragon.Have Fun ːMMForFunː			"

If you said no to any of these questions you need to get the f*ck away from me. Because this game is all of that sh*t in a $15 package. AND I DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE F*CKING SOUND TRACK. O. M. G.

												Great game.  Short, but cheap.  You'll only get about 3 hours out of this game (more if you do collectibles) but it's a great 3 hours with an amazing ending.As far as gameplay, imagine that Far Cry 3 got a lot less buggy, a lot less tedious, the combat got a lot more stable, and was injected with a heaping, healthy dose of FUN.  Fall damage was removed, as was the need to breathe while underwater, and you can sprint at about 30 MPH.  Everything has been given a neon tint (to emulate an old 1980s sci-fi movie) but it's never really distracting.  Overall, the dialogue and combat feel very Duke Nukem-ey.On the negatives, the game is VERY short (3 hours on my playthrough), but it's an extremely enjoyable experience for those 3 hours.  By the end of it, you'll be feeling like a super-powered monster, able to kill almost anything in one or two hits.  I found this to be pretty boring, because then the combat just got tedious instead of challenging.  Still, I loved this game, and I can't wait for the sequel.			"

												Did you enjoy the gameplay of Far Cry 3? Now imagine it being souped up by 1000% and combined with classic 80s action/scifi cinema and a soundtrack that marries John Carpenter with Brad Fiedel. Easily 2013's GOTY.My full review:


YouTube™ Video: Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (2013) - PC - Review 

			Views: 402		

			If you're into 80s action/sci-fi cinema as well as tight FPS gameplay, then this game is for you. A satire as well as an homage, Blood Dragon is my #1 game of 2013.

												Let me begin by saying UPlay is not a good interface, and it feels bulky going through Steam through UPlay to play this game.  Additionally, if you run multiple hard drives, it MUST be on your MAIN drive.ENGINE QUIRKS ASIDE, this game is amazing in that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's fun, fast paced, and JUST enough content to finish without feeling like it's dragging on too long (Like FarCry 3 started to feel by the end).If you enjoyed the open world, FPS style of Farcry 3, you'll love this.  If you're a gamer, you'll LOVE the banter of the characters.  It's light hearted nature is absolutely refreshing in the genre.I would highly recommend this to likely anyone interested in FPSs, RPGs, and/or the 80s.			"

												Story-wise, it's very short, I finished the campaign in just over 4 hours, but with triple-AAA graphics and presentation there's a lot of value here for the price. The 80's nostalgia and references alone will warrant a purchase from many people, but with the collectibles, side missions, upgrades and a moderately sized open world to explore with garrisons to liberate (MURIKA!) you should get quite a bit of bang for your buck. The humor here is excellent, as is the voice work and graphic novel-esque cutscenes that accompany the very tongue-in-cheek story, that, while intentionally cheesy, is still enjoyable and memorable. I very much recommend Blood Dragon, and if you can catch it on a discount (I got it half off) you shouldn't hesitate to buy it. My only real complaint is the fact that we are forced to download and use Uplay, another service like Steam, in order to access the game.Pros+ Moderately sized open world to explore+ Collectibles and hidden secrets (you know, like back in the good old days)+ REFERENCES GALORE (like, seriously, I counted a dozen in my first hour and then lost count)+ Awesome soundtrack+ Hilarious!+ Lots of AAA fun at a humble price + Cybernetically enhanced dinosaurs that shoot lazers from their eyesCons- Very short- Forced to download and use Uplay to access "

They remove some of the limitations on your character from Far Cry 3 and let you kick even more♥♥♥♥♥  Most of my friends and myself think that we've had more fun with Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon than we did with vanilla Far Cry 3 (mods not withsanding). The blood dragons are a nice touch as you may need to level your character up a bit before taking them head on.  Even after leveling up they can provide a challenge. The game doesnt take itself tooooo seriously.  There's also quite a bit of humor and odd things which make the game enjoyable.			"

There's almost too many awesome, great lines for one game to have!Main bad guy:  You and I are the same, Rex -- we even got the same blue blood!You:  Wrong ...  My blood is red, white AND blue.Everything about the game is a little over-the-top, the dialog, the story, the art style, the dialog; and that makes it hilarious.  The game itself is decent, and the only thing that really kept me playing through to the end was the dialog, and as the game progresses the dialog just got better and better.You:  Doc, I got the Killstar!  It's Sloan's bed time and I plan to tuck him in ... under six feet of dirt.The Good:+ Excellent 80's vibe  (art style, graphics, dialog, 80's references, the VCR-like special effects)+ The dialog.  Surely the best thing about the game.+ Plenty to do.  A number of non-campaign bunkers you can go liberate if you want more, as well as a number of other hidden collectibles.You:  What's the needle, Doc?Doc:  Listen.  This will make you more like Sloan.  Powerful, but without the side-effects.You: No Doc, no way!  I swore an oath to a special lady.Doc:  Your wife?You:  No.  Lady Liberty.  She taught me that winners ... don't use drugs.The OK:~ Campaign Length.  The campaign was just long enough to end before it ""went on for too long"".  I completed it in 7hrs, but I had enough.  The dialog is hilarious, but that can only carry a game so far.Doc:  Rex, I saw what you did in my scope.  That was incredible!You:  No, Doc.  Paintings of crying clowns and dogs playing poker... those are incredible.  What I did... that's just the job.The Bad:- Nothing really memorable about this game.  Other than the dialog...Your partner:  Tell my wife... I died fighting for my country!You:  You can tell her that yourself!Overall:  A decent game with fantastic over-the-top dialog delivered perfectly that offers plenty to do, but doesn't over stay it's welcome.  ~7.8 out of 10Doc:  Be careful Rex, there's death in that place!You:  What kind of death?Doc:  ...The dangerous kind...

												After growing up with video games from the Atari, and over the top Action flicks from the 80s... I have to say this game has no shortage of bad puns, cheesy plotlines and senseless violence. AND ITS AWESOME for it. If you even remotely enjoyed Far Cry 3, pick this up and enjoy just having fun in the engine. Leveling is done for you, and the collecting is not a serious pain to unlock more badass gear. Oh and no dang wallet cap ;-)The only downside to it, is getting 100% completion is kind of short (compared to the main game). It could have done with some more intermediate main missions of senseless killing haha. But, for the price, its a great DLC.			"

												In this game you take control of a Snake Pliskin-type Action Hero settled in a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi vision from the 1980's. The whole setting feels like an amalgam of Terminator and Robocop and is highly overloaded with colorful lAz0rs and cybernetic mutants. Probably the best game Ubisoft produced in over 10 years.Great game with nice self-ironic humor, okay graphics, satisfying gunplay and a great soundtrack that sends you on a time travel. Sadly, the game lacks a multiplayer mode and interesting boss battles.The only thing that sucks mayor dong about Blood Dragon is the fact that this game must be run on the U-play platform. Why? Why even bother selling it on steam when you force me to play on yet another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaming distribution platform. I don't need this. I don't need no 5 diffrent services to play my ♥♥♥♥ing games on. Not to speak off that all records and achievements hit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. Stop it. Leave it to Gay Ben.Cheap in price and runs as a standalone without the far cry 3 main game. If you like to pick up a short, fast paced experience packed with fun and action, this is something you can fetch for your cart without a second thought.Pump 'em full of lad with an incinerated quad barrel shottie in the face.

												Farcry 3 is Great, Awesome, this is BETTER.It's a salute to action films of the 80s and even the tutorial will have you laughing.The only way I can see someone not liking this game is if they utterly HATE the 80s, or neon lights. ya, LOTS OF NEON in this game.This game deserves a full lgenth story, NO, a full length SERIES.my ONE complaint is when you think you get to fight a big monster, a few times throught the game, you don't.Biggest thing you fight are those blood dragons.Still, if you don't own this yet? freaking get it.oh, and the Gunslinger/Blood Dragon combo back? GREAT GAMES. Get that on a sale, always buy games on a sale.  money is good to save for MORE games.			"

												This games main story can be completed within 5 hours or less. The games story is weak but like all Far Cry games, the open world content is amazing. The voice actors are also great and the artwork style is just amazing.It's got lots of different collectibles, awesome weapons to unlock and cool boss battles, as well as some hidden secrets to discover. This is my personal favorite installment to the Far Cry series just because of it's bright, cheesy style and it's creepy vibe.I'd recommend this game to open-world shoot em up enthusiasts.			"

												Recall a time where the only things that matter'd are neon colors and a lust for blood. Enter Blood Dragon, a game running on the same engine as Far Cry 3. While Far Cry 3 was a nice game for about the first half, it just became too much of a ""watch me f*ck your girlfriend"" experience, whereas Blood Dragon is a never ending action packed killing rampage adventure.  Makes that OTHER Far Cry 3 look like garbage, get this one instead.			"

												Here is another great game from Ubisoft. It is not as big or as long as Far Cry 3, but size doesn’t really matter, right?While playing, you can feel that this game was made by gamers for gamers. I spent quite a bit of time searching and gathering the collectables to get all of the achievements and unlocks; and in a contrary to Far Cry 3, this wasn’t a tedious task; Each time you get a collectable, Rex throws in a cool joke or a reference. For instance:Sgt. Rex 'Power' Colt: [Finding another collectible] Great, found another one. What the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing?Sgt. Rex 'Power' Colt: [Finding another collectible] Whoever thought this would be fun, I'm gonna collect their head and have it mounted it on a wall.And so on…I say even if you are not a fan of the genre, give it a try, if anything else it is certainly entertaining.

												So, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a standalone expansion to Ubisoft's Far Cry 3 (obviously). This time players are not put into the modern day jungles, rather a post apocalyptic world, with you playing as Rex ""Power"" Colt, a cyborg with a robotic arm and a bad attitude.Gameplay is very similar to the base game, with the player able to free roam around the island, liberating outposts or, if you are like me, running away from the deadly wildlife. Blood Dragon introduces a new type of predator to the wild, that being the Blood Dragon. These hulking beasts are deadly in battle and have a hunger for fresh cyborg hearts (don't ask me why they have hearts, just play along!)These new beasts add a new mechanic to the game, with the player being able to throw cyborg hearts around, which attracts the Blood Dragons, which can be a huge help in liberating outposts. Just throw a tasty heart into the outpost, and watch the bad guys flee in terror from the onslaught of a hulking beast that will rip apart anything in its path. (did we mention it can fire lasers from its mouth?) Blood Dragon, for an expansion, is a decent size, with myself getting at least 10 or so hours into it. One thing i do wish is there to be more sidequests, rather than there just be the main story, as the island feels very empty once you liberate all outposts, with there not being much to do afterwards.This game is great, and you do not need Far Cry 3 to play it, meaning new players can pick up this game and play right away, without necessarily having to play the base game.This game is highly reccomended for fans of old, cheesy, 80's sci-fi media. There are tons of 80's cliches, ncluding a badass synthesiser soundtrack. 17/10- IGN			"

												Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a fun pastich of a game, where the developers intentially played with their 80s action-sci fi heroes in mind.Youre a cyborg soldier, with wise cracking one-liners that shoots thru a somewhat open world. If you´d played Far Cry 3, then you will automaticly reqognise its gameplay and mechanics.In Blood Dragon, its ""cheap"" feel is its best reward, as it crams in so many references of 80s movies it can.Its not long though, but thats okey, because of its low price and original visual style!

												This game does not feel like Far Cry 3, in terms of settings, story, atmosphere, and music; however, it does have that Far Cry 3 Gameplay that, in my opinion, is a top tier shooter, among the likes of STALKER.This game far surpasses Far Cry 3. The dialogue is incredible, and can stand up on its own. It does not feel like a DLC. It feels like an entire game, filled with the most excellent 80s core style I have seen in a game, even surpassing Hotline Miami.The writing in this game is easily some of the best I have ever seen in a video game. Did the same writers from Far Cry 3 work on this? I find it hard to believe.All in all, this is an AMAZING game. Even if you didn't enjoy Far Cry 3, you have to play this.5/5			"

												admittedly I write this without having played any other game in the far cry series, so maybe the experience would be different had I more familiarity with the mechanics and general gameplay of far cry.  that being said, this game totally sucked.  its biggest drawback was a technical failure or glitch (it seems hard for me to believe that the game had actually been designed this way) where the autosave didn't seem to function.  at all.  I played through three sections of the game, and every time I started the game back up, I had to restart with the same (AWFUL) tutorial section.  what made it worse was that the gameplay past the tutorial wasn't even much fun.  the game encourages you to use stealth, yet makes it very challenging to find a path you can take undetected (keep in mind that this is in the very first gameplay area).  once detected by one enemy, every other enemy in the area is alerted to your presence, forcing you into an open gunfight (despite having just trained you in the art of stealth).  if you, like me, decide to retry the area so as not to be detected, you have to start all over from the opening cutscene and terrible tutorial.  while the game would not let me manually save during the first area, I hoped that it had auto-saved for me after I reached the fourth section (a ""protect a guy while he does a thing"" section, which are never fun).  nope!  next time I started the game up, it was back to the opening cutscene and (did I mention AWFUL) tutorial.  there was some humor in the game that I enjoyed, and while I thought the graphical style missed the mark of what they seemed to be aiming for (in particular, there was an omnipresent neon haze that washed the life out of everything), overall I thought the setting of the game seemed appealing.  too bad the actual gameplay leaves nothing to be enjoyed.

												I hope that you came here from Far Cry 3, since I'll be comparing this game to FC3 quite a bit.Now, all that you really need to know about this game is that it definitely is worth the money, but I'll descend into some detail.The story is self aware, fairly fun and full of 80s references. The visuals are flashy, neon and 80s. The characters are stereotypical and 80s. Yeah, a lot of 80s stuff. But with the gameplay, you'll get about 3-4 hours worth of content, if you do the story mainly. Otherwise I'd say it's 6-7 hours, if you 100% it. The animations just make you feel badass, the same with your powers and skills.The wildlife, which was a strong part in FC3, is extremely weak here. No crafting system in the game at all. There are some upgrades though, which I approve of.Now, the movement system... You sprint about 2x faster than in FC3 and you take no fall damage. The game encourages you not to really even use a car, but just run like Forrest Gump across the map. Again, it just makes you feel awesome.And the last thing, soundtrack. It's great, nice synth. Overall8/10A truly exciting experience. (**5/10 is the average game**)			"

												Blood Dragon is a magnificent standalone expansion to Far Cry 3. It features a near polar opposite premise to the original. It is the 80's perception of the year 2007, ravaged by Vietnam 2. You emerge as a cyborg badass all American hero. Your objective? Kick cyborg♥♥♥♥♥ kill the badguy, and get the girl. Not necessarily in that order.My favorite aspects of this expansion pack are how similar to Far Cry 3 it is, and yet how different. The game's side content is very similar, coupled with the open world nature of the game. However, the aesthetic is completely different. Resembling a cross between G.I. Joe and Terminator, with dozens of allusions to almost every single 80's movie ever created.Add to that is a top notch soundtrack, with tunes reminiscient of Terminator and Daft Punk. You definately get what you pay for with your 15$.Some mild critiscms include the general lack of major gameplay innovation over Far Cry 3. It's very similar to that game, and if the aesthetic differences don't appeal to you, nothing else will. It's also not a full length game either, and it is very possible to 100% complete the game in a single sitting.Yet I have nothing but good memories of this game, and it's in general a sign of good things. Blood Dragon could easily be compared to Red Dead Redemption's Undead Nightmare, and eventually I hope more titles could be added to that list.			"

												admittedly I write this without having played any other game in the far cry series, so maybe the experience would be different had I more familiarity with the mechanics and general gameplay of far cry.  that being said, this game totally sucked.  its biggest drawback was a technical failure or glitch (it seems hard for me to believe that the game had actually been designed this way) where the autosave didn't seem to function.  at all.  I played through three sections of the game, and every time I started the game back up, I had to restart with the same (AWFUL) tutorial section.  what made it worse was that the gameplay past the tutorial wasn't even much fun.  the game encourages you to use stealth, yet makes it very challenging to find a path you can take undetected (keep in mind that this is in the very first gameplay area).  once detected by one enemy, every other enemy in the area is alerted to your presence, forcing you into an open gunfight (despite having just trained you in the art of stealth).  if you, like me, decide to retry the area so as not to be detected, you have to start all over from the opening cutscene and terrible tutorial.  while the game would not let me manually save during the first area, I hoped that it had auto-saved for me after I reached the fourth section (a ""protect a guy while he does a thing"" section, which are never fun).  nope!  next time I started the game up, it was back to the opening cutscene and (did I mention AWFUL) tutorial.  there was some humor in the game that I enjoyed, and while I thought the graphical style missed the mark of what they seemed to be aiming for (in particular, there was an omnipresent neon haze that washed the life out of everything), overall I thought the setting of the game seemed appealing.  too bad the actual gameplay leaves nothing to be enjoyed.

												I picked up Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for $8 during Steam's Summer Sale. Prior to this spontaneous purchase, I remembered Blood Dragon being an April Fool's joke - - - I didn't realize that it was actually published!The 1980's. The Golden Age of the science-fiction action film. Big hair and big biceps. Leather jackets and tight, acid-wash jeans. Aviator shades and motorcycle helmets with tinted visors - worn at night-time. Cigarettes under neon lights. Synth music. Sawed-off shotguns and laser rifles. Blood Dragon is a child of an '80's Child. Throughout this epic adventure you'll pick up on references to Robocop, Predator, Terminator, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and tons more. There is also some clever commentary on some of the trends in gaming (feather collecting, idiotic tutorials, etc.)To be perfectly fair - it isn't perfect, there are three issues that I find terribly detrimental: Firstly, Far Cry 3 requires U-Play, a deal breaker in of itself for many. Literally every single time I boot up Blood Dragon I must tell U-Play to ""try again"" in synching my progress. It works, after that - but many people claim they cannot run the game whatsoever. We shouldn't have to run DRM through our DRM, but that's how it is.My second issue with Blood Dragon is that it has the much maligned Far Cry 3 system of checkpoint saving. If you give the game some time you will learn how it works, albeit you'll probably find yourself repeating a mission or two before you finally learn to truly get a ""SAVING"" notice before quitting to desktop. It's not a game breaker, its just an inconvenience.My final issue with the game is that there are infrequent instances where the AI does something stupid - shooting at walls, walking into walls - or the game glitches to the point where a re-load is necessary.These issues are easily over-looked by me. Blood Dragon is a damned good FPS. You can read any number of reviews on Far Cry 3 for specifics on the engine and physics and whatnot. The storyline is much appreciated parody, it doesn't have the menopausal drama of the modern warfare shooter. The voiceacting, provided by Michael Biehn, is perfect. The soundtrack, provided by PowerGlove, is absolutely, absolutely incredible and worth listening to on its own.For what I paid, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon offers the absolute best value of nearly any game I have ever purchased.

												Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon is an open-world FPS made by Ubisoft Montreal in 2013.It's a standalone expansion to Far Cry 3, but it's very different from it. Blood Dragon, while using mostly the same gameplay and recycling a lot of assets (mostly terrain and animations) from FC3, it's a much less serious game. You play as Rex Power Colt, a cyborg commando infiltrating an island in 2007, which in this case is seen as a sci-fi post-apoc setting due to this game being heavily 80s inspired. Music is the usual retrowave fare, and if you've played Hotline Miami or watched Drive, you'll know what I'm talking about. The visuals are pretty much FC3 at night, but then with red filters and scanlines slapped on top of it, and lots of neon-lighting. I like it, but some people may consider it eye-straining or just bad overall. Keep in mind there's no way to disable things such as scanlines in-game, but you can edit game files.Blood Dragon jokes about a lot of things, and it seems to be slightly aware of its nature as yet another iteration of the Ubisoft Game(TM), that game with an open world full of collectibles and enemy outposts/towers. After a turret sequence that serves as an opening to the game, the protagonist enters a tutorial mode where the game does present the controls to you while Rex complains about wanting to shoot things. Since this isn't a full game in itself there was no time to make half the campaign a bloody tutorial in itself like in most Ubisoft open-world games, so the tutorial bit is mercifully short. Apart from this, there is the usual Ubi gameplay of collecting shiny things and conquering outposts.Exploration doesn't feel as fun here as in FC3 as the gameworld is mostly purple and red, and so I ended up doing the fairly short main missions (only 6 + prologue) and conquering less than half of the outposts. As I previously mentioned the gameplay is much like FC3, but with less upgrading: There are levels but each level has an automatic upgrade, making the only optional upgrades available weapon upgrades. For each weapon upgrade you have to complete a side mission (which revolves around saving scientists or hunting rare animals), and unfortunately I have to say the game has no upgrades for the bow, which is quite a shame. Overall, weapons do seem to lack a bit of punch except for the sniper rifle and the bow, and the fact that even though you do have a lot of mobility by sprinting, sliding and jumping, you can't actually fire while sprinting, making you mostly have to fire from cover and restricting overall combat mobility. Combat is fairly good but not great.The game's story doesn't bother taking itself seriously and ends up being a pretty cool 80s action movie-style thing, and the main mission starts with the usual Far Cry semi-open levels, and ends on a mostly linear power-fantasy. Overall, Blood Dragon is a pretty fun but ultimately short game.			"

												This game is a sort of dumbed-down, reskinned, rewritten, map-darkened, 'tongue-in-cheek', comic-book analog of Far Cry 3. A LOT of stuff was 'borrowed' from the base game (except for the Blood Dragon, of course. He's new, and probably the only really challenging opponent in the whole game, IMO...).  It's sporty play, but in a goofy kind of way.You basically play Rex, a cyborg being directed by a sexy blonde named Dr. Darling to go around and do the usual 'go here / blowup stuff' routine while dispatching enemy cyborgs in the process, and taking down fast-moving, laser/plasma-emitting dragons when they appear.   If you've played FC3, you will recognize the terrain, the vehicles (yes, there are even the occasioanal hang-gliders here, too !), weapon sounds and gameplay of the battles as eerily similar, but still different enough to make it interesting (for example, finally getting a hold of the AWESOME, hand-held Terror 4000 minigun during 'The Dam' mission.  That, along with the upgraded rifle, helps make quick work of the occasional 5000-points-per-kill Blood Dragon, so you can level up...)Later on, another even more awesome weapon is made available, but I'll let you find out for yourself what that one is...There's a good deal of profanity, including even a bit of R-rated adult content: A ""comic book"" love scene where Rex finally gets to ""nail"" Dr. Darling (yes, even titz and ♥♥♥♥ing, too !)Overall, it's a definite play. Check it out.			"

												Can't truly recommend the game, not because it is utter crap or unplayable, but because all of it's small mistakes pile up too high and DRM + necessity of U-Play don't make it better either. Still, here is a more detailed look at what I found quite not so good about the game (and a realy few things I did enjoy).The graphics are mediocre at best, the textures are void of any detail and the whole 90s futuristic look just feels forced.I played the game on medium and pretty much took my time, still only 10 hours of gameplay, also it was totally easy, there wasn't even a hint of a challenge.Story... well, i don't remember much of it even though i just completed it. Just some generic ""be a badass and save the day"" stuff. On the other hand a game like this hardly needs a good story.My biggest Problem was the end though. I have seldomly seen a so damn anti-climatic end. The last part of the game was the easiest out of the whole game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake it was a damning auto-scroller without any fear of death. There was no boss-fight, which i was looking forward too, only a cutscene and credits.All in all the game is good for some no-brain fps-fun, nothing else. If you can get it for something around 5$ it might be worth it, otherwise not.			"

												I can't believe I paid money for this crap.  No matter how far I play, when I restart I'm back at the beginning including the INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND STUPID tutorial that you have to play through EVERY FRICKING TIME.  Some sadist wrote thie piece of garbage.			"

												It attempts to parody annoying tutorials. This would have been funny, except in doing so they made an immensely annoying tutorial. I do have a sense of humour but I'm infuriated just reliving it on YouTube. There's a right and wrong way to approach parodies, and this way is neither innovative nor clever, it's just trolling. Blood Dragon promises a parody rich aesthetic while still providing fun, well designed kickassery, but at times it's more like that one awkward relative who takes jokes too far at birthdays. ""Well at least I wasn't ADOPTED HAHAHAHA!"" yeah.... party over, a**hole. 0/10.			"

Short versionThe game is funny, even witty at times, it looks good and the soundtrack is awesome, but the poorly implemented save system is a major deal breaker, you can lose a lot of game progress if the game crashes (which it did, twice) or if the power goes out etc. and replaying tedious tasks is not fun the third time around. All of this could be easily fixed if the game so would autosave at every checkpoint and not after completing the mission, but that's not going to happen.TLDR versionI really had high hopes for this one, the game is fun, it's full of 80s-90s pop culture references and throw away gags. The graphics look nice and polished (the Tron-like neon look might not be for everybody but it works for me). The audio is also great, synth music and goofy robot voices straight out of Robowar.The game mechanics are basically identical to Far Cry 3 (although the skill tree is fixed), but the game also borrows the save system from Far Cry 3 and here the fun stops abruptly because you can't save during missions. Should you decide to exit the game during a mission, you lose all saved progress and have to restart from after the last completed mission. That wouldn't be such a big thing if the missions were short, but the first two missions are both over an hour long (played using stealth). Why can't the mission checkpoints be used as saving points is beyond me.One more thing worth mentioning is that this game requires Uplay (Ubisoft's own flavour of DRM) which adds another level of frustration. I didn't have any major problems with it (some people can't even start their games), but I had to sit thorough updates almost every time it started and these are not you 2-3s updates. With limited play time available (as I imagine is the case with most gamers today) 5-15 mins of updates are something to take into consideration. I think you can start it in offline mode and skip the updates, but it's still a bad decision for Ubisoft to include their own DRM in a Steam game and I don't want to support it.			"

												In the very first mission you have to defend an NPC while he hacks a terminal. Then the game spawns a buttload of enemies who are all wearing bright bleepy lights. And the environment is covered in bright bleepy lights. And the NPC dies in seconds. And they make you watch a 3-minute unskippable cutscene every time you die. And if you get frustrated and put the game down to come back to it later, guess what? You get to do the whole thing again from literally the very beginning, annoying tutorials, unskippable cutscenes and everything, because there are no mid-mission checkpoints.Haha, no. Screw that. I don't care if you're holding the most amazing pie ever crafted by human hands if I have to wade through a pool of rusty nails to eat it.			"

												Bought the game during Steam Sale without knowing what I will get at all. All I knew was that it had flashy colors. I like flashy colors.Also enjoyed Far Cry 3 alot, so what could seriously go wrong? Answer? Nothing! The game is great. It mixes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 80s style with lots of sarcasm, tons of bad jokes, cheesy but pretty cool color scheme, a robot hand, DINOSAURS WITH LASERS!!! and Medics running around, shouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at their enemies, then getting shot (nerdy scientists voiced by the Medic voice actor). It's perfect!The gameplay offers not many new things compared to FC 3. They tightened it by removing getting all these different things for loot you had to sell (cards, dices, bling and other garbage), the crafting, and the messing with skill points. I appreciate that because I never enjoyed these aspects of FC 3.Also they break the 4th wall alot. So will the main character when doing game typical collecting tasks complain that it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, or ask what he is doing there at all.Can't say much about the story because honestly I don't care for it. Story in Far Cry 3 was nicely done and told in a quite interactive way, in Blood Dragon there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of cutscenes in 80s style. They are ok but I skip them because they bore me. The missions I played so far were also quite boring to me, the usual shooter stuff. Find this, find that, protect your friend while making your way into a building, cover his back while he his hacking into a system, blah blah blah. The game kinda celebrates this by giving you mission descriptions like: ""Kill the Sniper. Why? Because Snipers are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. ""Do you really care why you save the scientist? Just save him"".  Just saved a scientist, he pulled out his welder, pointed it at some wires and died. I got experience for that and surely won't blame the game for being pure cynicism.Haven't progressed very far but the world seems huge. Well, it's mostly a reskin of Far Cry 3, but ... DINOSAURS WITH LASERS!! Yeah, I know they are dragons.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. This is a prime example of how a DLC is done the right way. For the same price this game is asking you could get four multiplayer maps in Ghosts (which should come with the game free of charge, but whatever), and Blood Dragon doesn't require the main game, making it that much better. I cannot praise this game enough. The soundtrack is perfect, and I want it for my Steam music player. The visuals are incredible, matching the soundtrack in every way. The cut scenes are skippable (press Enter then Escape), but you shouldn't skip them because they're awesome. The amount of references to 80's movies and pop culture are incredible, adding to the aesthetics of the game. The final boss battle is also something everyone should experience at one point in their life. To be honest I haven't had a problem with Uplay yet, so I don't see what the big deal is. The most you'll have to deal with it is setting up an account, but that doesn't take too long. Long story short this game is awesome.			"

												First off, this game is attached to Ubisoft UPlay. If you do not like that fact that you have to have a separate account to maintain the list then you should avoid this game.  It is very difficult to move licenses of Ubisoft games to new profiles that you may have created with other games if you have ignored the registration process. It takes a while for Ubisoft Support to process claims for this....Onto the review:Blood Dragon is a standalone version of what Far Cry 3 is. It's more compact version of what Far Cry 3 is.  Even if you don't want to commit to playing Far Cry 3 with all the content that it has then you can get a relative feel of the experience through Blood Dragon.  Regardless of what you choose, you will enjoy these iterations of Far Cry.Blood Dragon is an over the top game that borrows on futuristic visionary concepts from the 80s: Neon lights, dramatic music and acting cliches.  Players will notice this through the weaponry, vistas, and character tropes. Gameplay wise, it's generic: find stuff, recover stuff, do missions and save the day.  Just remember to take it all in stride.			"

Clunky controls and movement, which is incredibly distracting.  And you run around collecting enemy cyber-hearts.  This is supposed to be a shooter, not a collection game!  How could the developer possibly think it is fun to stop for two seconds to collect a heart from every single kill?  It breaks up the gameplay in the worst possible way.  This is my beef with all Ubisoft games.  They don't bother to play their games to see if they're actually fun or not.  Ugh.			"

												A nice dose of brainless cyber splatter with humoristic cliches that never grow old. The game doesn't give too many hours of game play, but I prefer quality over quantity. If you're an 80's kid, you'll probably enjoy this game ...I did!			"

												In the very first mission you have to defend an NPC while he hacks a terminal. Then the game spawns a buttload of enemies who are all wearing bright bleepy lights. And the environment is covered in bright bleepy lights. And the NPC dies in seconds. And they make you watch a 3-minute unskippable cutscene every time you die. And if you get frustrated and put the game down to come back to it later, guess what? You get to do the whole thing again from literally the very beginning, annoying tutorials, unskippable cutscenes and everything, because there are no mid-mission checkpoints.Haha, no. Screw that. I don't care if you're holding the most amazing pie ever crafted by human hands if I have to wade through a pool of rusty nails to eat it.			"

												If Steam would have a points score system, i would give it 5 or 6 maybe. So i should give it a negative review. It's an ok game, but after playing this i know i don't want to play any of the other Far Cries (and i haven't). It is bland and repetitive. Story missions and the theme is ok, but nothing really engaging, spectacular, at times stupid even. I get that this was an intention to beat on trash movies cliches, but it was too much some times. Outside of the main story it is an open world which is pretty empty. Yeah with some fights between scientists and commandos going on here and there. It was fun to roam in a jeep, but not for long. Side quest are all similar (go and kill someone and maybe save some scientist jerk). I hated missions requiring you to do stealth in an open field surrounded by 20+ enemies. ""Cutscenes"" were often too long and, i don't know, i just didn't liked how they sounded and looked. I didn't get the leveling thing as you couldn't choose a skill, it was just a linear progression which happened automatically. I hated some animations like pilfering cyberhearts (which you needed sometimes to distract dragons) or shotgun reloading cycle which took to long to start shooting again.Then the general design. Saves somethimes weren't working. So i ended up only using checkpoints. And once i had to listen to some story dialog like 10 times while dying on some side quest and loading again. Stupid system of repeating everything when you load a save. After a recent uPlay update it started to mess with Blood Dragon launch and jumped in front of it making BD starting in a windowed state, so i had to restart it every time (that' because uPlay wasn't already running, yeah, i don't want some program to run all the time when i only need it for one game occasionally). That's another point why i won't play Far Cry or other Ubisoft game.All in all, it was fun to shoot enemies and ride the jeep at times, but it was also a bland, sometimes boring game with an overdone humour. Can't call it a good game.			"

												Reasons I hate this game:1. UplayUplay is really fuϲking annoying. I want to play this game through Steam, but Uplay demands I use it. Uplay won't let me play this game with just Steam, I HAVE to bring Uplay along, too. I object, and try to avoid using Uplay, but even Steam tries to get me to use Uplay.It's like trying to go to the movie theater with your girlfriend, but one of your unpopular friends demands you bring her, too. She won't let you see the movie with just your girlfriend, you HAVE to bring your loser friend along, too. You object, and try to avoid bringing your friend, but even your girlfriend Tries to get you to bring her.2. The game doesn't workThe ""Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon"" logo pops up, then another popup, which simply says ""Error""The only option was ""OK"" which closed the gameCouldn't find solution onlineSteam wouldn't give me a refund, when i tried, the page took over 5 minutes to load and just gave me a connection error3. eventually got new pc months afterwardsdownloaded blood dragon""Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon has stopped working""are you kidding meFuϲk you SteamFuϲk you UplayFuϲk the stupid little hearts that censor profanity in reviews for M-rated gamesI want my money and time back			"

												There is nothing about this game you shouldn't love. This game... this game is designed for you to play as you want to. Assuming that you played far cry 3, obviously, but that's why it's in the title.You want to just mow through the missions and kick♥♥♥♥♥ You can do that. You want to go around collecting random♥♥♥♥♥♥and conquering a bunch of random outposts just because the game has them? You can do that. This game.... This game lets you do both. You don't -need- to follow either path, because... this game.... it gives you freedom. The freedom you need.Anyway, if you choose to follow the missions only, you'll find an experience on non-stop hilarity and action. If you don't like the extreeeeme, you won't like this game, but if you think you can stomach it... this game is for you.			"

												I just finished this game and I have to say, great ending. Saying it for you would just ruin the surprise. This has been literally the funniest video game that I have ever played. Also the funnest. The things that just about every part of the game says is hilarious. Every description of a weapon to the bio of a character to the random stuff that Rex says. The corny badass phrases the are said in this game make me feel like I'm some funny, non Schwarzinegger, terminator with a good sense of humor. This 80's terminator universe is big enough to call this a small game instead of a DLC. Well worth the money to play this fantastic piece of entertainment. I had a lot of fun playing through this and I don't think there's many people out there wouldn't. If your reading this considering whether to get this game, just get it. It's so much fun. The art style is very pretty, and doesn't take as much computer power to put out great looking graphics.Probably my new favorite title to date.Pros: Hilarious80's throwbackGreat GraphicsGood storyCool Weapons(especially the arm lazer)Overall sarcasticnessCons:There are none. Period.I think the reason this came to be is because ubisoft handed out 6 packs in the office one day and everyone got good and buzzed before they did some brainstorming. I have to hand it to them. This is about as far from far cry 3 as they could have gotten and they did it spectatularly well.My favorite part of this game is sneaking into a garrison, turning off the shields, throwing a cyber heart in the middle and watching the blood dragon reak havok on the soldiers with lazer vision. There is actually a part in this game where you play ring around the rosy with a blood dragon mama that you just killed all the babies of until you can escape on the elavator. Scared the heck out of me when I saw it running my way.			"

												The perfect microcosm of an open-world title, wrapped up in what is one of the better 80s action movie parodies I've ever seen. Seriously, beat for beat it's amazing. I'm incredibly sad more studios don't use completed engines for short projects like this more often, it's leaving cash on the table. I don't even want to describe why it's so good, because between the game's brief length and the jam-packed amount of jokes in there, I feel like it should just be experienced instead of explained.Buy this, and then watch it whip itself out and take a leak all over the rest of the genre's conventions.

I slapped a done on it and sent it down the assembly line for cash-out.  Sevens.  Pay me.On a 100 scale I give this a potential of 80 for the obvious dev effort early in the schedule and the decade of better hackjob movie plots it ironically parodies. And just like Ubisoft, due to me pulling the plug on my give-a-♥♥♥♥ budget partway through, I give it an actual 6.

												Amazing and hilarious game. This game made me adubily laugh a great many times, and the shooting mechanics are very satisfying. Also, the length of the game is either too short or just right, as collecting all the collectibles and doing the side missions does not feel like a chore. Definitely a more hidden pearl among games!			"

												First off, this game is attached to Ubisoft UPlay. If you do not like that fact that you have to have a separate account to maintain the list then you should avoid this game.  It is very difficult to move licenses of Ubisoft games to new profiles that you may have created with other games if you have ignored the registration process. It takes a while for Ubisoft Support to process claims for this....Onto the review:Blood Dragon is a standalone version of what Far Cry 3 is. It's more compact version of what Far Cry 3 is.  Even if you don't want to commit to playing Far Cry 3 with all the content that it has then you can get a relative feel of the experience through Blood Dragon.  Regardless of what you choose, you will enjoy these iterations of Far Cry.Blood Dragon is an over the top game that borrows on futuristic visionary concepts from the 80s: Neon lights, dramatic music and acting cliches.  Players will notice this through the weaponry, vistas, and character tropes. Gameplay wise, it's generic: find stuff, recover stuff, do missions and save the day.  Just remember to take it all in stride.			"

												Truly a fun and hilarious sci-fi action game. The retro feel of the soundtrack, the design, everything makes you want to watch all those classics again, like Robocop and Terminator. Dialogue is catchy and fun. Gameplay is sleek and blasting off an enemy's head and watching blood spurt up like you're in a Tarantino film is always satisfying.			"

												This is going to be tough to recommend this game. I dont want to give it a ""thumbs down"" because the game is usually on sale or at least offered at a reduced price. So, my only recommendation is really based on purchasing the game for equal or less than what I paid for the game. That price was $11.99What can go wrong? Far Cry 3: great map, solid game play, good AI, great environment, the whole nine yards. So, if the developers mod the game, reskin it, give it post 80's futuristic feel, add neon dinosaurs, and you should have a winner. But sadly, its immediately apparent that everyone involved took everything too far and everything was overdone. Its almost as if they used a overkill policy just to make sure they didnt miss their mark. If the goal was to create a nostalgic retro futuristic shooter off the FC3 platform they not only hit that target but they actually nuked it.The redeeming qualities of this game are all of the same qualities in Far Cry 3. All of the gun play and melee are the same. The map is the same. The animals are basically the same (except a few large T-Rexes).Im not going to get into to explaining the story line or the main character too much. Its not important. You have one bionic arm and your guy flips people off, has reload animations that are 80's ridiculous, and the jokes and comments will make you smirk for the first 5 mins before becoming very annoying. Your standard bad guys have digital sounding voices that also get very annoying after a few minutes. But as in FC3, those bad guys also said much of the same things too and were almost as annoying. I think the beautiful environment in FC3 distracted me enough to not have to pay too much attention to what the bad guys were saying. But in FC3-Blood Dragon, the whole world is dark and the excessive neon doesnt distract. Matter of fact, your brain starts to block it out after a few minutes and then youre left in this permanently dark world.So, it sounds like I hate the game, right? Well, kinda-sorta. But not really. All of the preview videos are fair. They show you exactly what you are getting; bad jokes, dark environment with neon, robots, and neon 1/2 robot dinosaurs. I purchased the game after finishing FC3. I wanted to continue playing the game and I did not want to actually replay the same story. So I got exactly what the previews showed me. However...I only played the game for about 1.5-2 hours before getting bored with it. At that point, I bought Far Cry 2 and enjoyed that immensely. So, if youre like me and finished Far Cry 3 and are still craving a Far Cry adventure, get FC2 if you havent played it yet...its great. But if you want neon dinosaurs then Blood Dragon is for you. It is worth the 11.99 USD that I paid for it, I dont regret that. And I feel like I got my money's worth. So at that price or less and this is a safe buy. Even if you only get 2 hrs out of it like I did, its the same amount of $ to go see a 2 hr movie. Dollars to Donuts			"

												This is a real short experience. Open World (not as big as FC3) with 2 hours of story elements. But every second is an enjoyment. This game made me buy Far Cry 3. It has the length of an 80s movie. And in fact it is an 80s/90s movie. (Open World Content will be like 5-20+ hours of collectibles, secrets and free roaming, while you can reset Enemy Garrisons now to have a neverending FPS Experience.)This game feels like ""Escape from New York"" (Escape from LA). This game is for people, who love Kung Fury, Terminator, Robocop, Ninja Turtles, Escape from New York, the Metal Gear Solid-Games, every Trash-Cyborg-Movie and Synthesizer-Pop-Music.The Engine is smooth and optimized. (The Far Cry 3 Franchise uses a strong amount of ""Head-bobbing"". This leads to some People who cannot play and enjoy these games.)Gameplay and Story are fantastic. Though the only stealthy Weapons here are the Neon-Bow and the Pink Tanto combined with the Laser-Shuriken. Besides that Stealth is fantastic in this game. Rating: 12/10 minus Uplay and the usual Far Cry 3 Headbobbing = 09/10A solid Shooter with outstanding Atmosphere and an interesting visual Style - if you get all the 80s/90s references.			"

												Take the world of Far Cry 3, replace it by a 80s cheesy saturday morning cartoon post-apocalyptic universe that doesn't take itself seriously, that frequently breaks the fourth wall and mocks it, add an awesome 80s soundtrack by Power Glove, and a ton of other fun gimmicks... and you've got Blood Dragon.Only two complaints with this game: it's short (but well, it's a cheaply-priced spinoff made for the hell of it), and the cutscenes are mostly static images sliding around. But beyond that, the production value of this game is definitely AAA... and I would not mind seeing some sort of sequel to this game, because it's a bit of a transgression towards the traditional triple-A manshooter values that needs to happen more often.

												It was a sad summer day and i did not have Wifi (explains why i only have like 3 hours on the game), so i decided to see what i could play on my steam list. i just finished far cry 3 and its pretty darn awesome. so i started playing Blood dragon. it started out pretty cheesy and i thought this might be great. but then in to game and i did ecerything far cry 3 style. but then i decided if i can food around a little bit and i upgraded my weapons and everything. so now i will tell what i can do.Taking Bases over:you go in there blow up the generator with some C4000 then you get in there and throw around some hearts. then you taken your ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle and start blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up cause you know you have EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS, THEN YOU TAKE YOUR SHOTGUN AND SHOVE THEM UP YOU ENEMIES ASSES AND THEN FLIP THEM OF (which you can actually do in game) THEN YOU FLIP OF THE DRAGON WHO IS RIPPING PEOPLES HEADS OFF AND TAKE YOU LASER HAND CANON AND START SHOOTING AT HIM AND THEN BLOW HIM UP CAUSE YOU KNOW DRAGONS DON'T JUST DIE. THEY BLOW UP. oh yeah and did i mention that the dragon will shot you with explosive lasers THEN WHEN YOUR DONE YOU WILL HUNT TURTLES IN UNDERGROUND SEWERS WHICH WILL ROLE BURNING EXPLOSIVE BARRELS AT YOU AND ♥♥♥♥ YOU IN THE BUTT WITH FIRE. the rest:sitting somehwere next to a street lure some enemies there and some dragons. then you walk on the hill next to the street and watch the show cause the dragons will not die and the bad guys will just keep on seding their guys. and from time to time you shot EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS at them with your sniper rifleif that did not make you want to play the game... well you're stupitso yeah 4000/10			"

												Divertidissimo! A incrivel jogabilidade de Far Cry 3, porém com um toque de humor. O game é mais curto que o FC3. Usa o mesmo motor do Far Cry 3, porém com várias particularidades. As missões são divertidissimas de fazer.Seja transportado diretamente para a visão de futuro que existia no limiar entre os anos 80 e 90. Muitas referências POP e de games dos anos 90. Um herói brucutu e clichês ao melhor estilo desta época. Obrigatório pra quem curtiu FC3, tem bom humor e foi criança nos anos 80.Recomendo! ;)			"

												I can't recommend this game enough! First of all it has the FC3 Engine which is freaking amazing. Second for me is the soundtrack. For me this game has the soundtrack of the year. To recreate how music would sound in 2007 from a 80's point of view. Giorgio Moroder would be proud if he would listen to this.Third must be the great tribute this game gives to the 80's. If its fashion, film and technology. This game is how people in the 80's thought the future would look like.If you a fan of Tron, The Black Hole, Blade Runner, Terminator,Aliens, Robocop. At least once in the game you will get a little hint that will remind you of these films. Just by starting of with the upbeat Terminator Music or the synthesizer  music that reminds you of Miami Vice and Tron. It has it all the one liners of our great 80's action heroes. The Neon lights. Kraftwerk-esque Music etc.The action in this game is really great, you can run around a open world island and kill everything than comes to near. You can be stealthy or just do it commando style.Drive around or take a jet ski. The weapons in this game are amazing and can all be upgraded. Just buy this game and enjoy. I haven't played Far Cry 3 but I can only imagine how awesome it must be. I really enjoy sci fi, so that's why I love this game.10/10			"

												I had some pretty major problems with just running this game at first. It would freeze up at random times and just stop responding. That was fixed by changing from fullscreen to borderless. I have a Radeon R9 285 but I now understand that this issue is very common. If you have the same problem, don't run it in fullscreen. That option should just be removed for all of the problem it's caused. Anyway, once I finally got it running, it has turned out to be one of my favorite games ever. The '80's movie humor alone is worth the price. This game has caused me to literally howl with laughter at times. I wish Ubisoft would make a sequel to this game. It's much better than FC3.			"

												Like its target audience, this game seems to have no concept of a joke that isn't that funny to begin with persisting in not being funny after gratuitous repetition. For some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, this game insists that you hit Enter to get rid of the dialog boxes that grind the game to a screeching halt and appear roughly every 15 feet, which gets old pretty much instantly. After a forced tutorial making light of this fact which runs the joke into the ground and then continues running, these Wacky & Random pop-up dialogs are still appearing an hour into the game.

												I would give this game a proper review if only i could play the d*mn thing. Uplay is one of the worst things to happen to videogames, constant errors and bugs that prevent people from using games that they have already bought and have fully downloaded.I get errors concerning my internet, my internet is fine, why the heck do i need internet to play this by myself. Ubisoft is the new EA, support tickets got me nowhere and took forever to get a reply.All in all might be a good game, I'll just never knowF**k Uplay and all their ""tech support""			"

												♥♥♥♥ YEAH!80s action hero bonanza, and you're it! This game drove home that I really am a casual gamer anymore, but I keep coming back and playing (and dying) . . .(repeatedly) . . .It looks and feels perfectly like those 80s over-the-top actionfests, full of cheap scifi movie designs and cheesy♥♥♥♥♥dialogue, and the gameplay is good too- it's not hard to learn the controls, and doesn't hang you up in glitchy impossible maps, which I am so damn grateful for.If you like ANY of that, this game might very well be for you!

												Sarcastic HUD, AIs, and loading screens.Cheesy 80s American war hero story.Amazing 80s style music (think Hotline Miami)Over the top weapons (sniper rifle with exploding bullets, quad-barrel fire shotgun, laser assault rifle)Far Cry 3 Gameplay, but it's not too long so it doesn't outstay its welcomeDragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes.About the only things not to love are Uplay and the fact that there's no final boss.I recommend the Hard difficulty as the game is pretty easy by default.

												This game is the closest you'll get to the 80's in 2016 (Don't take my word for it, I wasn't there)While it has some slightly annoying tropes taken from the Far Cry 3 engine, such as having to loot each enemy individually, repeated animations for almost any action taken, and a generally short total play time of roughly 3-6 hours, it makes up for it in the content. Rex ""Power"" Colt's personality and quips just make the game amazing somehow. It finds humor in all the right places. The art style brings out the in 80's aesthetic, and is chock full of badass moments.TL:DR 6/5 I want a sequel			"

												Unlike the Stanley Parable, I'd actually buy this for $15. Furthermore, I do not use the following phrase often in my reviews: I love this game. It has:+ an awesome as hell 80's movie atmosphere+ a very nice soundtrack that reminds me of the original Terminator+ probably a lot of subtle references, some that I didn't catch+ over the top action elements and self-parodying humor+ cool as ♥♥♥♥ shooty and stealthy gameplay+/- cheesy as hell story, quotes, and cutscenes (which I loved)- the longest ♥♥♥♥ing credits ever, ♥♥♥♥ ubisoft- uplay (I don't think it's that bad though)If you liked a few things from the 80's you should get this.

												A fantastically stylised, retro game with good humour, fun characters and great weapon mechanics. I'd recommend buying this game (or getting it free online from uplay if you hurry) particularly if your fond of the dark, action film aesthetic from the 80s. Don't expect a terribly long campaign, however the map has enough side missions (all fairly same-ey) and collectives to keep you busy afterwards.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough! First of all it has the FC3 Engine which is freaking amazing. Second for me is the soundtrack. For me this game has the soundtrack of the year. To recreate how music would sound in 2007 from a 80's point of view. Giorgio Moroder would be proud if he would listen to this.Third must be the great tribute this game gives to the 80's. If its fashion, film and technology. This game is how people in the 80's thought the future would look like.If you a fan of Tron, The Black Hole, Blade Runner, Terminator,Aliens, Robocop. At least once in the game you will get a little hint that will remind you of these films. Just by starting of with the upbeat Terminator Music or the synthesizer  music that reminds you of Miami Vice and Tron. It has it all the one liners of our great 80's action heroes. The Neon lights. Kraftwerk-esque Music etc.The action in this game is really great, you can run around a open world island and kill everything than comes to near. You can be stealthy or just do it commando style.Drive around or take a jet ski. The weapons in this game are amazing and can all be upgraded. Just buy this game and enjoy. I haven't played Far Cry 3 but I can only imagine how awesome it must be. I really enjoy sci fi, so that's why I love this game.10/10			"

												There is nothing about this game you shouldn't love. This game... this game is designed for you to play as you want to. Assuming that you played far cry 3, obviously, but that's why it's in the title.You want to just mow through the missions and kick♥♥♥♥♥ You can do that. You want to go around collecting random♥♥♥♥♥♥and conquering a bunch of random outposts just because the game has them? You can do that. This game.... This game lets you do both. You don't -need- to follow either path, because... this game.... it gives you freedom. The freedom you need.Anyway, if you choose to follow the missions only, you'll find an experience on non-stop hilarity and action.

												THIS! I like this.This game is full of cheesy 80s humor, neon lights and clichés and I count that as a good thing. Rarely has an action fps game made me laugh so much. I mean come on it has wingless dragons with neon coloured stripes and they shoot lasers from their mouth. How often you've seen that? :DThere are few bugs there and there but none which would make it unplayable. The gameplay is solid with good control and the colour- and soundscape fits the atmosphere perfectly.I would give this one 9/10.One point being taken away because of major nuisance called Uplay. Still, I would Highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to have a laugh while shooting neon coloured enemies into face.			"

I was bored to death and hitting the esc key during the intro and ten minutes in to the game I was looking for the uninstall button.  Youtube has some videos that detail the first fifteen minutes of play. I would check those out first to make sure that this is the game for you.  I am afraid I can’t recommend it at all, but it may be your type of humour. God help you if it is!! Check it out on Youtube and decide for yourself.			"

												Overall Score: 5/10My advice: Only get it if you're really into 80's style movies and need something to crave a Far Cry itch until 4.Genre: Action Adventure FPS, sandbox RPG.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon puts me in a difficult position. I loved Far Cry 3, and thought the creative direction to incorporate cheesy 80's-style humor with retro gaming was a neat take. But like... when you're playing a game, and you find yourself having to purposefully push yourself to keep playing it? That's a bad sign.I'd give a plot synopsis, but really, there's not much more to it then ""you're a badass cyborg on an island killing pretty much everything while you save the world for the USA."" If the humor the game uses were enough to make up for the flat plot, this might be exclusable, but there were countless groaners that really fit the genre... too well. Guys, there's a reason we don't right corny as hell plots like this anymore.Alright, so the story is flat and schlocky, how about the gameplay? Well, it's basically just Far Cry 3, except... detached. You've got maybe 6 hours in the core game, 16ish overall if you get all the collectables. They didn't add much new until really the end of the game, and really, half of what was so fun about Far Cry 3 was you ascended your character from weak chump to badass over the course of the game, discovering new skills and abilities. Here, you just start out a badass becoming a bigger badass, fighting hordes and hordes of bland, faceless enemies... It just kind of became boring. Vast murder and tons of explosions became boring. That's half the selling point of your game!The only stuff I really took enjoyment in was the stealth and the mobility, which is surpisingly good. The environments may not be all that pretty, but at least moving about them is a fluid and kinda pleasant experience.All in all, unless you really want some kind of new Far Cry 3 experience? Just avoid this one. I'm surprised I stuck with it as long as I did.			"

												Blood Dragon is basically Far Cry 3 Lite: 80's Sci-fi Edition. Overwhelmingly tongue-in-cheek, and with a couple questionable design decisions here and there, but it's a very worthwhile entry in the field of open-world games that won't hit your wallet as hard as vanilla FC3.In particular I enjoy that you're given superhuman speed, unlimited sprint, and no fall damage right out of the gate. Traveling on foot is actually more efficient and reliable than ever bothering to jack a vehicle.			"

												This game has very, VERY, stupid ""saving"" feature. I played like 30+ min and there were many checkpoints that should save the game, right? NO! Apparently you need to finish the whole first level for the game to save your progress. I tried playing this game 3 times, every time from the beginning with those stupid unskippable shoot your weapon to kill enemies tutorials until I googled that the game dosen't save like normal games.. Now I have 69min playtime and zero progress.I cannot say much about the game, I just don't have the will to start the first level again for the fourth time with the tutorials and play it completely to find out if this game is good or not. If you are not sure you have enough time to always complete the whole level  don't buy this (I don't know if every level has the same ""feature"").We have come a long way when it comes to graphics from Doom and Wolfenstein3D, but taken many steps backwards when it comes to saving your game.

												Just when you think this game can't get any more awesome, it does. From a dedicated flip-off button, to an insanely overpowered laser, to mechanical sharks, to cheesy one-liners and plot points from just about every 80's action movie you can think of; Blood Dragon is a great change of pace from the generic monotony of modern shooters.That being said, this game is easy... like really easy.I played through Far Cry 3 on normal and ended up having to challenge myself by not using stealth or certain weapons because it was so easy. With that in mind I played Blood Dragon on hard. Playing through this on hard felt easier than vanilla Far Cry 3 on normal. I was run and gunning almost the entire way through the game with little use of stealth and little to no threat of danger. Just one of the many perks of being a badass cyber commando I guess.Then there's the unfortunate fact that the game completely misses an opportunity to have a cheesy and completely unnecessary sex scene when Rex has too much energy for his body to handle. Luckily the game rectifies this by having an even cheesier sex scene about 2 minutes later.All-in-all, I give this game a 5 out of 5; Dangerously Cheesy.			"

												This game was so overhyped and it came bundled with real Far Cry 3 (which is awesome btw) that after several ""You have to play this!"" from my friends I decided to give it a shot. TL;DR - The game isn't really good, but it has nothing to do with Uplay.Tell ya what, if you don't think you are going to love it after seeing the trailer - you won't. If that trailer was the thing for you - weeeeell, maybe you will kinda like the game. But still it is a watered-down, less-serious, brainless and rushed in version of FC3. It screames ""I want to be awesome!!!"" out of everywhere but the gameplay is basically your FC3 wrapped in some old time references. It looks like you should be running and gunning around Serious Sam-style but nope. Find some cover, spot your enemies, still the same. But level design does not really help with that. And the atmosphere. And the music. Everything wants the game to be tougher and cooler than it can actually be.After 30 minutes I wasn't really feeling like playing it anymore constantly thinking ""give me back my Far Cry"". Today I have tried it once again. And guess what - I've had to start it all over again. Why bother with all those ""checkpoint, game saved""? It worked fine in FC3 last time I checked. And I'm not going through half an hour of that ""tutorial"" again. I'm noping out of it. Once again, everything is not that bad, even fine. Except for the gameplay. It doesn't fit at all.Mind that I don't really write revirews but this game made me do it. I just hope I can help some fellow gamer to save a few bucks. If you are not really sure then don't buy it. Forget it.P.S. To all those negative pseudo-reviews based solely on the presence of Uplay - stop being such crybabies and learn to PC or buy youself a console, just stop bothering people. Never had any troubles with it, always launches without asking any questions and works silently until you exit the game. Then it takes you just one click to close it.			"

												Do you have a laptop? Then don't play this game, Ubisoft does not support your video card. It may work, but seriously, it's a gamble.Things like this should be in underlined bold italics, Steam doesn't mention anything in the requirements it is only mentioned on the Ubisoft page and in a not very visible page ---> https://support.ubi.com/en-gb/FAQ.aspx?platformid=9&brandid=108&productid=4567&faqid=kA030000000eVW8CAMBut otherwise the game is super cool, you just need to download Uplay first and then choose between launching the game from Steam in order for Steam to open Uplay and then launch the game ORLaunch it from Uplay in order for it to open Steam and then launch the freaking game.If you don't have a laptop and have a PC, the game is awesome. Pretty cool FPS or at least that is what people saay, I wouldn't know because I have a gaming laptop...			"

												The game itself is actually pretty good if you can get past the hideous colour scheme.  I'd forgive it the, hand-holding tutorials if they weren't popping up every couple of minutes.  I'd even forgive it the menus that feel as if they were designed in the 80's if they didn't feel as if they were designed BADLY in the 80's.  The one thing I can't forgive is that when you see ""Checkpoint"" is doesn't actually save your progress.  If you don't see ""Saving..."" you're progress hasn't been saved.  I've lost numerous hours because of this and I'm done with it.  You're too much work Blood Dragon, you're too much work.			"

												This is basically a stand-alone expansion of Far Cry 3. Without revealing too much, this game is a parody of 80's popular culture that plays almost exactly like Far Cry 3. It is gorgeous, it is funny, and, most importantly, it is fun. I would even go so far as to argue that it has slightly better replay value than the original Far Cry 3.With the positives out of the way, here are the reasons why I am giving it the thumbs-down rating:While I would argue that it has slightly better replay value than the original Far Cry 3, I would also argue that the lack of content kinda negates the increased replayability to some degree.While I could tolerate the potential negatives of Uplay from a technical standpoint, the potential negatives from a business standpoint are enough by themselves for me to give a game a thumbs-down rating. What I'm talking about, to be more specific, is a Uplay feature unofficially referred to as ""Steam Mode"". When your Uplay library consists only of games bought through Steam, the store becomes inaccessible through the Uplay application. On top of that, many of the free games and demos/trials in the ""Free Games"" section of Uplay are removed. You have to make a purchase through Uplay in order to have these features reenabled. Sounds like an awfully slimy business tactic to me.The game itself is good. Great, even. But the decision I have to make here is whether or not I would recommend people to spend their hard-earned cash on this product. Unfortunately, my answer is no.			"

												Farcry 3 alt. universe this is not. Sure, it comes with a full visual overhaul and a true 80s retro feel, but to call this a separate game would be too generous. The pacing is pretty bad, and they don't give you choice over how you level your player. The weapon selection is woefully limited and vehicles are pretty much pointless as your character runs at breakneck speed by default. The inclusion of the blood dragons was a nice touch, but I would have liked to see more of this, more character abilities, more challenge.The tongue-in-cheek humour is good (although it dries up a little outside of the first 30mins). There's some good retro gaming fan service and let's face it, shooting cyborgs in the face with a neon-coated bow from a faraway hill still ticks some boxes, but this game could've been much more. More outrageous, more idiotic, more creative...If after Farcry 3 is done you're left wanting, I'd pause for thought before diving into Blood Dragon as it might not fully scratch that itch.[5.5]			"

												Before going in to this I thought the 80s sci-fi/action setting would be a great idea. However, this quickly wears off and you're stuck with a really dark (the sky is always red) environment and cheesy 80s one-liners wich get old really fast. I'm sure a lot of people will like this standalone expansion, but I was bored real fast. It just made me want to go back to the original Far Cry 3, with it's lush environments and blue skies. If the screenshots and the idea of constant 80s references and jokes don't turn you off you might have a great time though, because behind that lick of paint is the same Far Cry 3 game I enjoyed so much.The 80s throwback is a nice concept though, and I commend Ubisoft for trying.

I can't recommend it for it's full price, because of the very short storyline, but this game is well worth it on sale, if you're a child of the '80s!			"

												I can't say much about Far Cry 3 - Blood dragon, because I haven't been able to play it since I bought it July 12, 2013.Both Steam Support and Ubisoft refuse to admit there is a problem (I know, I've tried!).Validation results in 50 corrupted files, that download, then fail again indefinitely. Steam says thats 'Normal'.There are several steam users who cannot start, let alone 'play' this game.This problem has nothing to do with uplay serial key problem. This is in addition to that problem.I do not reccomend this game, to anyone. It is a gamble it will work with your system (high end systems as well).UPDATE: 2016 02 26 -----------------------------------------------------Far cry 4 and blood dragon uses the 'parental controls' component of windows to stop kids from playing it. If Parental controls is removed from windows then blood dragon wont work.Using a program like NLITE to edit windows installation is how Parental Controls  gets removed.Reinstalling windows is the only way to get parental controls back into windows 7.----------------------------------------------------Check if you have parental controls installed (WIN7): ----------------------------------------------------Click ""Start"" and type in ""parental"" into ""search programs and files"" text boxIf ""Parental controls"": doesnt show up then you are MISSING parental controls.----------------------------------------------------			"

												This game feels like a slap to the face, I was so excited to play it and all I got was dissapointment.  My computer is decent by all means, and runs most every game at medum settings in 1920x1080 with what I feel is a decent frame rate.   This game will not run on the absolute lowest settings while getting a playable frame rate.  By playable Im not talking about 60 fps or anything, I mean the frames I get on lowest settings are around 15-20 if that, and thats on lower resolutions too.  This game was such a big dissapointment that this is the first game review I have ever made.  I actually exited the game and came here to vent about not being able to play it :(   Really dissapointed with the game. I will search for if something else is causing the problems on my computer (doubt it) and return to update the review if the game suddenly becomes playable. :(my first edit:  its been a long while since ive tried to play this game, like a year or so i think.  anyways the game was a massive pain to even get up and running, took a couple updates and uplay witch had trouble launching the game.  when i finnaly did get it working it crashed before the opening video had finished. ♥♥♥♥ this game.edit two: so i got the game running and hows it run! at ♥♥♥♥ing 15 fps while at ♥♥♥♥ing 720p! screw this game, screw ubisoft, im going to attempt to return the game.

												♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design doesn't not count as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design anymore if you include meta-commentary on the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of of said design elements (by making a series of VERY similar jokes) and their prevalence in other ♥♥♥♥♥ily designed games.The game suffers from the same problem as Snakes on a Plane and Grindhouse: if you are going to go for intentional silliness and retro parody, you need to go all the way, and here you don't see full commitment in every aspect of the game or its story. It's bog standard fake-open world stuff with repetitive combat clearly made for gamepad rather than mouse and keyboard, with a crazy 80's colour palette and frequent interruption to gameplay for some occasionally-not-crappy jokes, ham-fisted pop culture references and some mildly amusing cutscenes which are nowhere near as funny or clever as they could have been.Just watch the trailer. I wouldn't usually recommend that for a game but basically you get everything there is to get from the game in one hundredth of the time.			"

												I'd. personally, rather let a buffalo take a diarreah dump in my ear than buy another game which requires me to run ubisoft's stupid, redundant, cpu hogging uplay nonsense on top of steam.The game itself is just another modern shooter: boring weapons, a heavy focus on cinematic takedown garbage, everything looks like it's made of pieces of meat held together by metal and why does your character have to have that horribly ""bulky"" feeling like you're lugging around a real body, it's supposed to be ""realistic"" but everything is so slow and awkward as a result. I hate it. Go back to Unreal and Quake type controls, that's what everybody wants.			"

												It simply doesn't work on my Windows 8 64bit machine. Support took 2 weeks and a complete system log of my complete setup and installed software to come up with a huge wall of text with fixes, which didn't work.All this, after having been forced to register with UPlay feels like a complete rip-off.The only other game in my 180+ library to not work was Carrier Command, which was by a (I believe) small developer. I think Ubisoft, as one of the biggest publishers should be able to create a game that works.It may be a great game, but I'll never find out. Can I have my 10€ back now?			"

												This game had huge potential. It has an interesting setting and is making fun of the fps genre in general. It pokes fun at the generally shallow nature that most fps games suffer from - useless item hunting, horrible AI, shallow story, etc. Unfortunately this game suffers from all of this and fails to be funny or fun to play. It just gets really boring after about the first 20 minutes. I played through as far as I could until I hit a broken hunting quest where it wouldn't let me start the quest because the gun needed was already equipped. Then I just uninstalled out of boredom mainly.			"

												This is how you make a true refreshing DLC. Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon uses the exact same gameplay and engine as Far Cry. Blood Dragon is a hilarious parody of everything in the 80's. This game is so hard to describe in a short review so watch this to get an idea of what the game is:

 Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is more original and has much more and better content than most full prize video games. Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon's graphics are great and feel nothing like a Far Cry game. Besides gameplay, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is nothing like a Far Cry game. It has the funniest tutorial level ever... Because it mocks other tutorials. The main character Rex is hilarious, the gameplay is just as good as FC3's. the story is as good as any other dlc. Although it's cutscenes drag out too much and are very uninteresting. When the cutscees are on you can literally go, leave, make yourself lunch, take a shower, heck at least make a cold drink with ice. Because they take so long that i find myself ult tabbing whenever one is on and start watching other stuff until it's over. Their isn't enough autosaving points. As even when you hit checkpoints, if you quit you will have to restart the whole mission over and when you first start the game the first level is around an hour so don't start and quit. POSITIVES: great solid gameplay just like Far Cry 3's, unique graphics, hilarious comedy, lot's of content for a cheap priced DLC, better than lot's of full priced fps games around... also there are Dragon's with lazers...lot's of them. CONS: Cutscenes are too long and aren't skippable, Easy difficulty especially compared to FC3, VERDICT: A great DLC with lot's of content and a unique style. Easy to recommend			"

IMO this would have been much better without the throwback to horrible game UI from old school games. The joke gets old fast, like 1.3 seconds.

												The Short Version: widespread technical issues and incessant crashes render the game unplayable for many PC users.The Long Version: I jumped into the stormy, explosive waters of Far Cry right with its third installment, tasting the salt and bullet baffet for the first time with Far Cry 3.Blood Dragon's parent game was an interesting adventure and for the most part a fun ride, but both Far Cry 3 and this wacky incarnation of it seem to fail the most basic requirement of a PC game: ...You have to be able to play it.For that lofty goal to be achieved, it simply needs to be a thing that can run on the PC. Unfortunately, this is not the case for a great many PC users, myself included. When I first purchased Far Cry 3 (and later Blood Dragon), my computer met every single one of the minimum requirements to run it, but I haven't been able to get the game running. Technical support was of no help at all, and even after upgrading my computer (which I shouldn't have had to do, since I already met all the requirements), finally getting the game to work was an ordeal when I discovered that the game would crash on me almost every five minutes of play. Worse, it would often give me the Blue Screen of Death, forcing me to reboot. Even after trying everything I could from every advice, tip and tutorial I found online written for (and by) the many users who have gove through the exact same issues, the game would still crash. Since the game doesn't let you decide when you save your progress, most of my original run of Far Cry 3 was devoted to trying to get through the mandatory tutorial (that felt like it was 20-minutes long) in the beginning of the game, hoping it would not-crash long enough for me to get to a checkpoint and not have to start all over again when the game inevitably freezes my computer, forcing both a reboot on my part as well as a long wail of frustration, curled fingers reaching for the uncaring dark skies above.Blood Dragon, I was hoping, would be an improvement and the issues with its parent game (which were reported not only by yours truly, but a great many users who practically flooded not only the official game forums but a big chunk of other threads and discussion boards) - unfortunately, the game crashed right in the middle of the (again, mandatory) tutorial in the beginning, shortly after the opening scene and before I could get two minutes into the thing.I wish I had more to say about both games, but this abyssal experience has not allowed me much of an opportunity to actually play the game itself, and since it shouldn't be on me, the customer, to spend months of my life sifting through forums and struggling against the current, trying to get the game I paid money for to actually PLAY, I simply deleted both games from my computer and consoled myself only with the fact that I bought this one on sale. Still, it doesn't wash away the bad taste of the promise of a little video gamey fun being ruined by the video game not actually running.			"

While it is bursting with style and awesome fastpaced gameplay and Michael Biehn badassness, the content leaves a world to desire, as the main story lasts a mere 2-4 hours. Outside of the main story there is little to do besides obtaining collectables, liberating outposts, and doing repetitive side missions. Think Far Cry 3, except with way less variety, content, and tactical options.  "

												A good, fun game but unfortunately I cannot reccomend the steam version as ubisoft insists on daisy chaining thier vapid and greedy service to steam. God help you if you want to play this game but forgot your Uplay account like I have, so I now have a title in my library that I can no longer acess. Do not support a publisher who insists on having thier service nonsensically attatched to steam, allowing steam to take thier cut of the profit but insisting you play on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ adobe air DRM system. ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft.

												If you always wanted to be in a cartoon this is it.  If you grew up in the 80's like I did the makes you go wtf Disco died in the 70s, which is what it looks like a 70s disco inferno scene.  Some of the game is cool like the banter between two guys blowing up stuff.  Idk i can not recommend this game to anyone unless they are bored to tears as the cut scenes are annoying and cliche, the banter gets old quick, like Spider a black Lt, whomever wrote this charecter was either higher then a kite and watched starsky and hutch a little to much, or is truely a neo white superemist the only word not used is nigeria (you get the point)anyways do not be suprised when you just stop playing as the game sux.  oh and you do not mind the fact you can not complete a mission cause a bad guy is stuck behind a door for some reason, but can shoot you and spider up and you cant touch this (him).

												I'm sure this game is great, based on the streams I've seen, but the requirement to play via uplay makes it unplayable. I wish I knew what uplay was and it's prereq prior to spending money on this. I'm in principal against using a 3rd party system to play a game. Steam is non intrusive and easy to work with, but uplay is invasive and an unneccessary step on top of steam. Ubisoft clearly is run by cash grabbers anyways, why else do they keep churning out subpar AC games.			"

You can sum up the gameplay as a reskinned Far Cry 3 without the gathering and crafting elements, but I personally found Blood Dragon to be the better of the two experiences. Instead of motion captured acting cinematic cutscenes, you get pixely looking montages that are very entertaining to watch. The dialog of all the main characters are written by people who must have watched a lot of those 80s sci-fi b movies.

 TL;DR Unless you want a game just because is more or less a basic 1980s reference, move on, there are far better and longer games for under $10. It's standard and stale FPS gameplay with neon and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes. The Good. +The game play is smooth, and aside from cutscenes (which don't really obstruct gameplay) and loading you'll spend your time wandering the black-and-neon wastes.+The game engine itself feels fluent and all cutscenes are skippable.+The sniper rifle is useful, with or without any attachments.  Not OP at all. >+Blowing people up with the sniper is  satisfying  , for a short period anyway.+Power Core (Power on Uplay?) is actually pretty good.+Blood Dragon Main theme is OK.+You can still drive the large utility trucks atleast once in the game, it never forces you to, but you can do it.+If you look for it you can find a mantaray in the water, nothing too special but it was cool seing something other than a shark, eal or fish.  The Bad. -Game is supposed to have a stupid atmostphere, but it just ends up being bad.-It is WAY too short even on hard, even after collecting EVERYTHING. It's under 4 hours. I've beaten  it twice already and screwed around in the empty world.-The pistol, while probably supposed to be a reference to the Robocop pistol, is, unlike it's original, useless. Looks are decieving.-The shotgun doesn't work like you would expect when it's in quad. It takes 3-5 shells to kill a heavy on single, 4 on double, and a total of 8 on quad. How does that work? It's because it normally takes an average of 4, but the game most likely doesn't count all 4 shells hitting when your in quad. The fire attachment feels OK and it works, until you realize it isn't just fire. It explodes too, which is most likely going to shred you too when your using a shotgun at close range, it also explodes grass, which lights everything on fire. Which includes you, because there is grass everywhere. Plus fire is useless on Blood ""Dragons.""-I know the point of the game is to be all-on-you, but if your going to have friendly AI, don't make them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I watched a couple jeeps of scientists crash into the same Blood ""Dragon"" at the same spot.-Blood Dragons are clearly Dinosaurs.>-This isn't Star Trek, and that isn't a dog with a cone on it's head.>-How hard is it to tell a Dinosaur from a Dragon? It's not even a European Dragon/Wyvern.-The Terror 4000.-The bow is absolute crap, and I don't know why anyone though it was a good idea. ♥♥♥♥ing Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ that's why.-Remember death from above? How about finishing 1/2 the game never using ammo? Sound fun? It's not. It's OP and is even worse when you get auto pilfer. Someone tell me why I need a gun again.-The Pin Cussion (CRT) Shader gets really anoying after about an hour in game, If it needs to be there, it could have atleast had been better.-Minor, but there is no photo mode, there's some really cool stuff to see, If only there wasn't a GUI and the shaders from the GUI in the way.-Ending sequence is BS, and you can't die.-Minor: They missed the opertunity to reference Atari's Battlezone and put a castle in the background and send missiles at you when you try to go to it.-  The Kill Star is terrible VS the Terror or Sniper. -  You don't get to kill sloan. -  Ending BS cutscene is BS. -Flamer is still terrible.-Fazetron is Ok, I'm Ok with that, and I am not OK with that.>-Fazetron on lasers is actually pretty bad, and not worth the effort.

												If there's one thing this game is, it's thurough. Completely thurough with it's cheesy 80's theme, but often to a fault.For example, purposfully covering your view with scanlines and tint to bring back crappy 80's resolution doesn't mean said scanlines and tint won't make it hard to see what the christ is going on throughout the entire christing game!Far Cry 3's use of its engine was magnificant! But it wasn't designed as an over the top shooter. It was about planning, taking it slow, and methodically toppeling your foes' instalments. This game on the other hand is about action! Lots of action! Over the top action! But Far Cry 3's engine just doens't support it. Oh, Blood Dragon will tell you that stealth is still an option, but stealth requires precision and clarity, two things which this game's visuals (while awesome) utterly preclude.If you're more into 80's cheese than I am, you might be able to look past that. But all that deliberatily crappy grunge just gets in the way of the mechanics, the clarity and the conveyance.Yes, it's completely faithful to it's 80's theme, but I personally am reminded why it's a good job it's not the 80's anymore.Not to mention horrible horrible Uplay. No Ubisoft! I don't want to wait five minutes for an update EVERY SINGLE TIME I WANT TO PLAY!!			"

												A fun, doesn't-take-it-self-too-seriously standalone mod/expansion to FarCry 3. Takes all the greatest tropes from classic 80's action films as well as conventions from traditional FPS' (health packs, carry more than 3 weapons, etc.) and immerses you in a gritty, retro world with modern polish.Despite this, I experienced a game breaking bug that prevented the game from saving any of my progress. Tried a few different workarounds without success.The game is ~9 hours; maybe one day I'll revisit it and/or marathon though the game.			"

												I never did get a chance to play Far Cry 3, but Blood Dragon was on sale, I saw it was a standalone game, so I decided to get it.  The game is relatively boring to me.  I like shooters, but this one just felt too silly and dull (yet I like TF2).  It just didn't give me the same fun as playing through BF3, Crysis, or L4D2.  I don't recommend this game if you don't like cartoon like shooter and are more of a CoD, BF3, etc. player.  If you want to give it a go though, go right ahead, but maybe wait for a sale first.			"

THERE 5 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!!!!!! i would pay to get this game taken off steam or to make the cut scenes shorter. like 1:30 minutes shorter. i went through half of the game and i litteraly uninstalled it because i dont think beating metroid on the old NES title waiting for this game to finish one cutscene is worth it			"

												Selling five times what Ubi expected, Blood Dragon is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale lineup of new shooters. It has that feeling of those 00's era shooters like Unreal II where it has just the right mixture of story and gameplay without feeling like a movie or an arena shooter. It's a reminder that games should be entertaining. It's also how DLC should be done. It's a joke game appealing to a niche market and as such it's Bioshock Infinitely better than a AAA game trying to appeal to everyone.			"

												As much as this game could be fun, UPlay just messes it up. UPlay is a horrible overlay made by Ubisoft and I can't even log into it without it saying that the servers are down. I had to get a crack for this game to work without UPlay. Unlike other Ubisoft games on Steam that don't require UPlay like Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, this one does. Only buy this game if you're feeling lucky, or just want to go through a rage fit and find yourself some cracks online. The malware you will find on there will be much better than UPlay, so don't worry. Anyways, for the game itself, I would recommend it.			"

												What this game does best is cultivate an image for itself through the art and the soundtrack. It looks like it was made from care and a love for '80s macho ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and antique synthpop. The mechanics are all fine and the shooty action is pretty good, but about somewhere after hour two is when the game starts repeating itself, and the game gets worse in writing and missions as it goes on, opting for HA HA, 80s TROPES. (It ends with a turret section with a meme in it, which I consider to be a middle finger-worthy act.) The same one-liners, the same types of extracurricular mission, the same kind of thing I imagine is in Far Cry 3 but cut down a bit. This is triple-A gaming trying to play like an indie, but what happens is that due to the heightened and faster production cycle, the game comes off looking good but feeling anemic, padded, and slightly wilted. So it's all right, but I'd recommend the soundtrack over this.			"

												Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a perfect, bite-sized serving of of gaming goodness. It plays like a condensed version of a typical Far Cry game, but with a heaping helping of insane humor and crazy weaponry. The main campaign doesn't last long, only clocking in at about 5 hours, but the content it contains is perfectly tuned to be a fun and polished as possible. The humorous writing is spot-on and each level gives you something unique and fun to do. Outside of the main levels, Blood Dragon gives itself some replay value with side quests and collectables for you to tackle, which is satisfying and adds another 6-ish hours to the game. This game is a good value for its price point and is sure to please.			"

												This is what I thought games in the future would look like when I was a kid in the 80s. The great part about this game is that it's not a parody of the 80s - it is a game that seemingly was designed in 1986 and sat in a jar somewhere for 25+ years. From the music, to the dialog this very well could have been be released for the Commodore 64 (minus the awesome graphics). If you don't like this game you're probably a socalist pig and I hope you die.			"

												One of the best games I have ever Played.... This is second to that of Halo reach and FarCry Instincts Preditor. *WARNING* Uplay is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get it to work... If you manage it though, you'll see that this game is almost unmatched.Pros:*Great Graphics - 7/10*Funny and unique characters that make the game feel finished and detailed - 9/10*Runs very well on my computer(I have a little above adverage laptop) - 7.5/10*The soundtrack Amazing - 10/10*Great Animations, Really fluid - 8.5/10*A good, 20 hours of gameplay if you take your time, no rush 7/10*Humour - 9/11*Running speed - 10/10*Swimming speed - 10/10*Take no fall damage because your a cyborg - 10/10*Murder everything you see - 6,000,000/10   <---Jew joke *Blood dragons shoot red kamehameha waves at you when they get angry. - 8/10*Best weapon in my opinion is the shotgun and/or the knife. - 10/10Cons:     @~10 = really bad~@     @~1 = No Big Deal~@*Fps drops a tad bit around building - 4/10*Once you enter a missions sphere of influence, you are locked to that mission, leaving the mission area makes you fail the mission and have to restart. There is no way to leave a mission once you start.  - 8/10*The Animals are pretty useless and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. - 7/10*There is no way to attack sharks underwater until they attack you - 6/10*If you just rush through the missions and speed run the game, you WON'T have fun. You need to make sure to take garrisons - 6/10*Uplay might not work on some Computers, I know a bunch of people hate it. I got it to work 2 days after i bought it, so I guess it's okay but not great so i'll give it a... - 8/10*Not too short, but not nearly as long as a standalone should be. They should have added 7 more enemy garrisons because that would be 20 that you have to take over, just my opinion. - 2/10*No way to listen to the wicked soundtrack ingame, other than by waiting for it to play. - 3/10*The bow is sort of useless, and engaging the enemy from a distance is pointless since you can murder them with your smg up close or just use a gernade. - 4/10*Driving is useless because you can run just about as fast and be able to jump and strafe. - 2/10I am getting a cool canvas print out of Rex Power Colt....http://www.bonanza.com/listings/Far-Cry-3-Blood-Dragon-Rex-Power-Colt-Game-Art-30x20-Framed-Canvas-Print/266574234I really like this game..... :D			"

												Better than the original Farcry3(imo). If you like the 80's era style and music you will like this 'mod'. Visuals are excellent and for a couple of bucks(which is what i bought it for, all hail steam sales) this is a must buy!			"

The game is pretty funny & smooth the problem i had is the fact you need Uplay on your computer to play the game. You click Play Blood Dragon on Steam then steam opens Uplay then Uplay opens up The game... Why not just open the game with steam instead Ubisoft. All in all good game just a little sad I need another program just to play the game (Dirt 3 needs Games For Windows Live, Mass Efect 2 needs Origin & now Blood Dragon needs Uplay)			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is awesome. The music, the humor, the visuals, and of course more of Far Cry 3's fluid and immersive gameplay, are all perfect and fitting. The game is a humorous homage to 1980s sci-fi cyberpunk and action films and it's brutally funny. The story itself is very short (only a couple hours) and rarely do I find myself playing a game beyond its narrative elements, however the setting, weapons and continuous humor are just so incredibly unique that it's too much fun to even repetitively capture garrisons. 9/10			"

												Blood Dragon is actually a really fun game. Really easy but fun. Granted the price may be a bit steep since theres really not enough in the game to really captivate you for 15 hours. The graphics are pretty good, I cant really make a huge complaint on them concidering the game is done in a retro 80's art style. The one liners just keep coming as you play the game too so dont think he says the same thing all the time. If you liked the gameplay of Far Cry 3 then this is a cakewalk since, as stated on the store page, it is built off of Far Cry 3 but does not require the base game. The storyline is pretty much what you'd expect out of an 80's themed sci-fi shoot em up game. Worlds been through nuclear war, big red shield in the atmosphere protecting the people from harmful cosmic radiation. Corperations control the planet and fight for control yadayadayada. All in all I do recommend this game to people who find that it perks their interest but I also strongly encourage you to wait until it goes on sale because the price does not match the amount of content offered.

												VERY FUNNY!!! This game is one of those kinds of games that is just way fun even collecting the random crap is fun. The guns are awesome and the gameplay is just fun. This game doesn't just tell you that you're a cyber commando you feel like it too.Worth $15? Maybe depends on your taste.Worth $10 and under? YES!!!			"

												I'm hot for this game ! Don't let that ""partial controller support"" scare you off, as all of the mahem you need is at your thumbs ! (If only this had two player local action, co-op or competitive gun fight, I would marry it !!!)			"

												This is by far one of the funniest games I've ever played. Being a kid that grew up in the 21st century, I don't get much of the references. But I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off the whole way through. The cutscenes bring me back to when I played nothing but retro games for about a year or two. Believe me or not, the plot seems more grounded than Far Cry 3's.Buy the Call of Juarez Gunslinger + Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon pack for the best story telling experience you've had in video games.""He said 'Blow Me', so I did"" - Rex Power Colt after blowing up an enemy.

												Love love love this game. I love the 80's reference, the mood and action. All the guns are over powered (in a good way) and the one liners are great. +80's aestheticsone linersExplosionsSolid gameplay-The stealth didn't get the same shot in the arm that the guns didSometimes the neon makes it hard to seeBe aware you will need Uplay, so you'll have to log in and start it each time. For many this is a deal breaker, for me, I don't really care. It has an offline mode, so you don't need to worry about being online. Also, if you don't have Far Cry 3, the game will still work.			"

												I had a ton of fun playing this game. Far Cry 3 really nailed the open-world FPS thing for me, and Blood Dragon just builds on what I enjoyed about the original. Blood Dragon takes the core mechanics and simplifies them, so all you need to worry about is enjoying the♥♥♥♥♥kicking and hilarious cheesy 80's action movie dialogue. You feel incredibly powerful as you mow down slews of enemies, and fighting the blood dragons themselves is pretty awesome. If you enjoy FC3 and want to play it again in a ridiculous 80's style, then buy this immediately! Well worth it at $15.			"

												The gameplay is basically the same as FC3, but the setting is even prettier. It is more story-oriented, but maybe that's because I didn't bother too much with sidequests (liberated only 3 out of 12 camps), the whole thing took me about 10 hours. But you can still ""keep killing"" if you want after that. Very funny, and with lots of mayhem. I especially enjoyed fighting the ""running dead"" to get the star, and riding a very content blood dragon.Conclusion: Short but loads of fun!			"
