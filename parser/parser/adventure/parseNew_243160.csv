Introduction Mushroom 11 is a challenging puzzle/obstacle course game from Untame. In Mushroom 11 you ‘take control’ of an amorphous organism and guide it through increasingly difficult obstacle course style chapters. The apocalyptic world you find yourself in is full of strange mutated creatures which either act as collectibles or bosses. Presentation The game’s presentation is easily its strongest aspect. The organism itself looks great and fits well with the rest of the game. The backgrounds are incredibly well designed, each chapter having a different one, they really give the game the ‘destroyed world’ feel that the devs seem to be going for. There’s not really any UI during gameplay but it’s not necessary to have one so that’s fine. The menus are nice and simple but I did have one problem with the menus, no confirmation dialogue when quitting to menu. I misclicked during boss fights a couple of times which resets the bosses, a simple confirmation would have meant this didn’t happen. It’s not a major issue but I found it bothersome.Gameplay So you’ve got yourself a giant blob of an amorphous organism and an obstacle course, how exactly do you get through this obstacle course? Movement is pretty much just erasing parts of your organism so that it can grow back on a different part of your blob. It’s difficult to properly describe how this movement is achieved but the game’s simple tutorial explains it rather well. Movement is only possible while your organism is in contact with the ground though so when you’re in the air you just have to hope you make it across to whatever you’re trying to reach. As for the actual erasing you simply use the LMB or RMB. The LMB is a large eraser generally used for movement while the RMB is a small eraser that’s generally used to cut off certain parts of the organism or to make more precise changes to the organism’s shape. The simple control scheme for the game definitely works well.The puzzles/obstacles you encounter vary but for quite a few of the obstacles in each chapter they’re just more elaborate versions of what you see in the first couple of chapters which leads to little variety, apart from difficulty, over the course of the game. That said new obstacle types are introduced from time to time and some of them are a lot of fun, such as slides and cranes. From time to time you’ll find you’ve either managed to erase too much of your organism or you’ll find yourself up close and personal to a trap which kills the organism, such as a lava pit. In these situations you’ll find yourself at the last of the regular checkpoints that you passed.As well as these puzzles/obstacles you’ll face a boss fight at the end of each chapter. There’s good variety between the different bosses and they all provide a decent challenge, the later ones more so than the early ones as would be expected. The bosses also introduce interesting mechanics such as bombs which, if they go off close to you, will burn through your organism.Audio Not too much to say about this one, the sound track and sound effects are both good quality and fit well with the game. Miscellaneous As far as I can tell the game doesn’t really have a story, not necessarily a bad thing but something I wanted to mention.Sometimes it felt very much like trial and error when figuring out puzzles/obstacles due to how you have no control over how your organism actually grows, only what you erase. While this is very much part of the game, and it probably wouldn’t work without it, I wanted to mention it in case it’s something you really don’t like. Personally I don’t think the price tag fits what the game offers. Unless you go back and replay every mission to get all the collectibles there’s around four hours of content and due to the lack of variety it can feel like less than that. Somewhere around £6.99 would be more reasonable in my opinion.Verdict Worth Purchasing on Sale. Mushroom 11 is a challenging puzzle game with a great look, good world design and fun gameplay which is let down by its high price. If you’re a complete puzzle game nut you might get your money’s worth but if you like a puzzle game every once in a while I’d suggest waiting for a better sale.Review Copy Provided. No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			"

												The game gets points for trying out something new and it is indeed an interesting mechanic. Heck the first 45 min of the game are actually fun! meaning the 3 first chapters out of 7. Don't worry the later chapter take longer to wrap up and impossible to get achievements will keep you playing for long if that's your sort of thing. Now why don't I recommend this game? Well past those first enjoyable 45min, the game switches the feeling it is transmitting from novelty and fun, to sheer and utter frustration. The intrinsic mechanics of the gameplay, where deleting some of the mushroom makes the same amount grow more or less randomly on another part of the mushroom ""cloud"" gives you limited control on what you're doing.Most of the time I passed what I guess are supposed to be challenging obstacles I didn't feel the ""I finally got it feeling"", but instead I got a ""Finally, luck was on my side!"". Just to give a quick example: in the last chapter there is a section where you need to form your mushroom into a disk in order to make it roll down a hill with enough momentum to catch a sticky liane at the far side of a deadly gap. Now that liane is actually slightly swaying back and forth! Enough to make you miss it if it has moved a few milimiters further than what you need to catch it. If you managed to make the disk perfectly and got maximum momentum, you'd have to pray to get a good ""cycle"" on the liane. The above and other examples result in repeated deaths and massive frustration.So in the end, what could be argued to be a difficult game, just feels like a frustrating experience due to an interesting concept that fails during implementation. I finished the game and joined the club of 3.5% of owners who did so, and it only took me 4h. This tells you much about how little people bother to finish the game past those initial enjoyable 45min.I wanted to like the game, it started out well, but turned out bad later. I like an increase in difficulty, but the gameplay needs to be responsive for that. Mushroom 11's mechanic is all but refined and would have benefited much more from an overall accessible progression with the added twists it already implements in each chapter. Adding extra difficulty was unecessary in my opinion. Suffice to say that after finishing the game I came to hate it rather than even just like it.			"

Pros+ One main concept, which is done really well and explored fully - like what Braid does with time manipulation, Super Meat Boy with saws, and Portal with... portals.+ Beautiful environment - each level has a distinct, abandoned feel while still staying different from each other+ Music is meh, but fitting+ No hand-holding: the game doesn't give you any advice other than the controls, leaving you to figure things out.Cons- There are some tedious parts.- Short(ish) at first: there are only 7 ""chapters."" First five chapters are quick, but then the difficulty escalates a lot.- Controls take a bit of time to get used to. Flipside: Once you get used to them, it feels fluid. Just because they're different != badSummaryWonderful presentation, solid gameplay - It took ~6 hours to complete, and is very hard to 100% (no one has done it). It explores the ""erase to grow"" concept really well. Overall, a puzzle/action game worth the asking price.Note: I got a copy from the developer, and gave an honest review in return. In truth, this has been one of my most anticipated games. "

												Every once in a while a game feels entirely self contained and 'perfect'. The last one I can think of is Frozen Synapse and now there's this. It's been frustrating seeing it unreleased for so long, but now seeing the final product I understand the long delays. The visual polish is absolutely amazing. Slowly navigating through its post-apocalyptic wasteland reveals an infinite set of painted vistas. There's just enough visual storytelling to make you wonder of the purpose of the strange blob creature, but no more.The closes comparison for gameplay is World of Goo with it's analog manipulation of complex physics systems. But otherwise it's entirely original. Nothing out there is quite like it and anything similar that follows will be branded as derivative. It encompasses every inch of the good ideas in this design space and nothing more. No filler.Some of the later puzzles are a little difficult, but mostly they demand patience. Take a break and come back to it when you're ready to play with physics.			"

												This is possibly the most original platform game ever made.  To start with our character is blob of green cells, he must be some type of mold or mushroom.  I'm gonna call him a blob from this point on and I hope he doesn't take offence to this.  I grew quite attached to him during our journey and have great respect for his determination to achieve his admirable goal in the game.We control our blob by erasing parts of him, but don't fret he grows back to the same volume as before almost instantly.  We can get him to traverse some pretty funky obstacles in the game by using the two erasers supplied (LMB and RMB) one is a large eraser and the other one much smaller, better for slicing or fine adjustments.Some have complained that the game is too tough, but the levels are designed as such to place very regular checkpoints before and after each puzzle.  Maybe the frustrating parts can come from some of the obstacles having seperate sections.  Clearing the first couple of sections and then failing the third and having to restart does create some ""NOOOOoooooo!!!!"" moments for sure!The puzzles are really well designed, have a great variety and most importantly are fun.  So replaying them until I succeeded wasn't an issue.  The few that caused me real headaches I stopped playing and came back to later with a fresh mind and found I completed them fairly quickly after.The game looks nice, it has a grimy art style which works really well for our blobs environment.  The sound track is created by Future Sound of London and its ambient style suits the game perfectly.I felt a feeling of accomplishment completing the game but checking some of the achievements...  some of them require one-shotting levels....  wow!!  Good luck!!I highly recommend Mushroom 11.  It's a really original and well-designed platformer with well-placed checkpoints which counteract the sometimes seemingly impossible puzzles!			"

Destruction is the only way to growDeveloper: UntamePublisher: UntameRelease Date: National Mushroom Day (October 15th, 2015)The game’s going to give you a headache. Other than that it’s fun though I have to say a tad overpriced. So if you’re looking for a rather weird, some might even say bizarre, puzzle plattformer … It’s safe to say you’ve found it.StoryThe story unfolds itself as you progress through the levels. Since there’s no dialogue you’ll have to pretty much put the pieces together yourself.At the end you will found understand where exactly you emerged from.GameplayRight click and left click. Those are your very best friends in the game.Left click is called the Big Eraser and the right click is basically his lil’ brother the small eraser. Two brothers are aiding an amorphous organism to understand the true nature of devastation from which he emerged.Basically you guide, let’s call the organism Dave for the sake of the review, Dave through the levels by erasing him. Sounds a bit weird at first and might even look rather weird but hey that’s just how it works.Anyway. Whatever you erase will grow back. That’s the beauty of it and the tricky part. In order to move Dave around you have to erase certain parts to make him expand in a specific direction.During your journey alongside Dave you’ll have to help him overcome certain obstacles like moving plattforms, lava and even a purple-ish fluid that will destroy you if you don’t erase it.The best part about the game is by far that every level is unique and there’s a huge difficulty spike throughout the game which might be off putting for some people but I enjoyed that quite a bit.The game actively forcing you to think (so better use that thing between your shoulders!) to overcome certain obstacles or even boss fights. More about the bosses later on.For example one part of the game requires you to be picked up by a crane and the being flung over a pit of lava. So you have to have enough momentum to overcome the  pit and you have to expand Dave just in time to connect with the ground else you respawn at your last checkpoint.Exactly the game does, god bless, have a checkpoint system and to be fair it’s quite good. By that I mean the checkpoints aren’t that rare in the game which is quite the help since you find yourself more than ones literally erasing yourself.Technically you can’t entirely erase yourself since there’s always a tiny bit of organis that just refused to be erased … Dave’s pretty stubborn like that.You can sabotage yourself though if you erase too much of yourself. While that’s a reason to be annoyed or even frustrated I always found myself cringe at my own stupidity.So far I’ve managed to get to the boss of level four and let’s just say the game gets weirder and weirder. Which is a good thing by the way since it’s rather interesting.Other than that the game’s pretty straight forward. It present you enough puzzles that you probably just would like to pull your hair out … or rip your face in tiny pieces but it’s excellent at what it does.Let’s talk a bit about the bosses.The bosses are quite a nice addition to the game. Especially the way you approach them. In order to beat the first boss for example you have to destroy certain parts of him while he’s trying his best to annihilate you.The boss in level three was my favorite so far and also the easiest.I won’t get too much into the bosses because that’d be a huge spoiler but let’s just say that every boss is unique in design and the way you have to approach him.VisualMushroom 11 looks as weird as it sounds. Which is quite a good thing!The level design is interesting and unique and the whole scenery just gives you a pretty good glimpse at what’s coming next.The beauty is that your organism moves so fluid. It squeezes, squirms and just moves around in a fantastic manner and it just looks rather awesome to watch it shrink and grow again.Dave’s pretty dope!AudioThe music just fits. I especially like the sound your organism does while moving around, growing while you erase it.The whole music and sound effects in the game are rather subtle though but that might just be me since I haven’t found myself paying too much attention to the music.Whether that’s a good or a bad thing well I guess that you’ll have to find out for yourself but the overall soundtrack was quite nice.What else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Mushroom 11 in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.You just have to like the release date of the game. October 15th. That’s the national mushroom day folks. That’s not the only thing there is to like of course!Mushroom 11 is a visually striking and quite bizarre puzzle plattformer.The whole idea of the game’s rather unique and fun. Erasing yourself in order to grow back and get through the levels was quite something.The puzzles are not too hard but do require a fair bit of brain power.The only thing that bothers me is maybe the price … Personally I think that it’s just a tad pricey but that might just be me.Overall it’s a really solid game which I can only recommend to every puzzle fan out there.Or to everyone who just wants to play something rather weird and unique.

Mushroom 11 - ReviewStory:There is no exposition, but the setting and title give away this much: You play as a fungal biomass, with the goal to survive and evolve by devouring whatever you encounter.All actions take place in the ruins of humanity, where you crawl through what is left after the apocalypse that wiped out all life, with the exception of mutated plants and beings.Gameplay:Mushroom 11 is a puzzle platformer, you play (as I mentioned) as a fungal biomass, which you control by deleting it's cells. Whenever you do so, cells grow on the biomass you have left. The controls require quite a lot of getting used to, but with the necessary experience, the game both feels very smooth and rewarding.Now, whilst overcoming the challenge of mastering these unique controls, you have to overcome the obstacles and puzzles of the environment. One can get stuck at certain puzzles for a longer while, which often comes with frustration, but actually finishing it feels all that more rewarding.The levels themselves are designed quite nicely, with interesting backdrops and a variety of threats on your way, but the  game is not all that long, featuring only 7 chapters, where each ends with a bossfight (basically a puzzle), and only took me (with my not too outstanding skills) ~5 hours.A level editor/workshop support would certainly have been a valuable addition.Pros:+Unique concept+Diverse level design+Challenging PuzzlesCons:-Quite shortConclusion:With a fresh idea and a well implemented concept, Mushroom 11 shines as a puzzle platformer, with it's only downside being it's shortness.8/10 - A good game!If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												After finally beating the game after a few hours, I feel I need to write a review. I got this game as part of the freedom humble bundle. This game is like nothing I have ever played before. The first level is pretty easy, but as you progress, it gets extremely hard, to the point of almost giving up. For some obstacles you need the slime to be in a certain shape in order to get past them. However, the slime regenerates randomly, meaning you have to carefully thin out the slime and pray it grows in the directions you want. When you need the slime to split into pieces, the camera also seems to wonk out bases on how close to the end each chunk is. I eventually started callining the slime ""RNG slime"". I used the name to yell at it or praise it when things worked, the thing drove me crazy. The second hardest thing with the RNG is when you have to fly missiles in one of the chapters. However, the obstacle that took the longest was when I had to pick a lock with the slime in the last chapter. It was very rewarding to fianlly beat the game.Pros:Beautiful art and music, gives off a cool dystopian apocalypse feelTons of checkpointsInteresting mechanicsCute slime mold creatureFun boss levels (excluding the rocket one :P )Difficult but rewarding levelsCons:Not for the faint of heart or low of patienceDifficulty spikes randomly, several obstacles will be easy, with an obstacle that takes an hour in the middle of themSometime obstacles depend on how lucky you are with RNG growthDid I mention how difficult some parts are?Overall, I enjoyed the experience. If they ever do update the game, I think a boss rush level would be nice for those who beat all the chapters.Hopefully you will give it a try!:) "

												Games often explore the human psyche in post-apocalyptic worlds, but what about the life of an amorphous organism? Mushroom 11 shifts the focus to a giant green blob as it travels through dilapidated environments, and though the game appears simple on the surface, it reveals layers of complexity synonymous with fantastic puzzle platformers. The core principle of cell reformulation takes some getting used to, but once players overcome the initial learning curve, a compelling adventure awaits.When you open Mushroom 11 and see how polished and innovative it is, it may be hard to believe that it was produced by a team of only four people. However, that is exactly the case; the indie studio behind the game, Untame, is composed of two husband-and-wife duos with a passion for creativity in game design. They were the brains behind the award-winning iOS game Rope Rescue, and Mushroom 11 is their first project for PC.Mushroom 11 wastes no time—players jump right into chapter one with no mention of backstory or narrative. The game builds its personality through art design, which appears to hint at some kind of end-of-the-world scenario. Nevertheless, the core mechanic of the amorphous organism and its movement exists as the main draw of Mushroom 11. Players use the mouse to remove cells from the organism, which then appear on the other side of it. Doing so at a rapid pace results in a rush of momentum that allows the organism to move along the environment. The controls feel a bit awkward at first, and thus Mushroom 11 takes a little while to truly grab the player's attention. That patience is rewarded, though.The initial chapters appear straightforward, but that's not to say they're a walk in the park. The mechanic of removing cells so they appear on the other side provides all kinds of opportunities for mistakes and blunders. I had to cross my fair share of lava and poison pits, and let's just say I took a few too many tumbles along the way. I didn't always feel like it was my fault, but once I familiarized myself with the controls, those mistakes slowly started to disappear. Despite some frustrations along the way, it's a case of practice makes perfect.Eventually Mushroom 11 becomes even more complex, and the platforming aspect of the game transitions into a series of puzzle elements. At that point, it's about executing on an idea rather than executing in general. After a few chapters, I started wracking my brain to get past a bunch of obstacles, whether it involved hitting multiple switches at once to open a door or splitting the organism in two to bypass a seesaw contraption. The gradual introduction of more complex obstacles works in the game's favor, even though there are spots that felt a bit too challenging at times given the game's controls. However, the difficulty of this game is only occasionally frustrating. There are plenty of checkpoints, most of which occur immediately after puzzles, so solving them feels rewarding. Each chapter in Mushroom 11 culminates in a boss fight, and they provide a nice change of pace from the slow and methodical levels that lead up to them. Although bosses attack the organism, death is never really a threat. Instead, they often stand as a test of platforming skills, such as the first one in which players must circumvent a creature's wildly swinging legs to reach a series of weak points. Another one involves using the organism as a platform of sorts to launch bombs up to the boss' weak points. There are some clever ideas on display in each boss fight, and the inventiveness helps compensate for the lack of challenge on a few of them.The landscape is littered with deteriorating buildings and other decaying objects that you must maneuver over and around. There are several types of pools you can encounter as well. For example, lakes of lava will burn you up, so make sure all of your mushroom isn’t submerged at once or you’ll die. The purple goo is poison, infecting you gradually and eating away at your fungi; if you’re in contact with it for too long, you could disintegrate entirely. Water won’t hurt you, but it behaves like water does in real life, so it can be tricky solving puzzles while swimming.While you travel, you’ll find several little bugs to gobble up. These don’t noticeably increase the size of your mushroom, but there are achievements for successfully eating all of the bugs on each level. This additional challenge encourages extended exploration or replaying levels after bosses have been defeated.Mushroom 11 doesn’t have an explicit story, per se. There aren’t any cutscenes scattered throughout the chapters, and there isn’t any narration. The player is left to determine the story through scenery and subtext. The epilogue is lovely and minimalistic; though it continues the trend of no narration, it is still very expressive and leaves you filled with hope for the future.The game contains original compositions by The Future Sound of London. This rough, sometimes haunting, electronic music is the perfect match for the dystopian environment. Also included are a host of ambient sounds that intertwine wonderfully with the artwork to create a full backdrop.To conclude there is no denying that Mushroom 11 left me very impressed. Untame deserve a lot of praise for attempting such an original concept and pulling it off. It may not quite nab a place in the platformer hall of fame, but it should be enough to satisfy fans of the genre who are looking for something outside the box that is packed full of dark atmosphere and intricate puzzles.

   Mushroom 11 Review.   Developer:  Untame.Publisher:  Untame.Genre:  Indie, Action, Puzzle, Platformer.Price:  $14.99Played on: GTX 650, Core i3, 1920x1080 Res.For a game that has pretty much nothing to do with mushrooms or the number 11, Mushroom 11 is a pretty good game. It has obviously had it’s glory moments, “Rock Paper Shotgun” has picked it as their “Best Platformer” of 2015 and it also has gotten a lot of other awards. The game is a puzzle platformer with a very original concept, there are overall 7 chapters all set in different locations in a nuclear/ apocalypse type of world.In the game you control a weird green glowing radiant blob that rebuilds the parts that you destroy of it. Sounds weird? It is pretty weird. Like I said, this is a very original concept for a platformer. You control the blob by deleting parts of it at the back and then it rebuilds them at the front. So to move for example to the left you delete to right of the blob. By doing this you can gain momentum which allows you to do things like turn into a circle or turn into a stick because it fills the area that it’s in.It’s a hard concept to explain but the video at the bottom will show a demonstration. The blob can squeeze through tiny holes and can be broken into small pieces or large chunks. The way you move and break and do anything in the game is with the eraser tool. Holding left click makes the larger eraser and holding right click makes the smaller one. The bigger eraser is using mostly for moving yourself around terrain and the smaller eraser is used to make precision cuts in your blob for the more delicate puzzles. There are also blue glowing checkpoints that appear throughout the chapters. With these tools you can do a lot of pretty awesome things such as molding yourself around a small block for example or make a sort of hinge or you can turn yourself into a bridge or a ramp to get objects across gaps. In each chapter, there are 10 or so puzzles that you have to get through, each chapter making the levels harder and adding new mechanics to keep the game fresh. Most of the puzzles were fun to solve and felt satisfying to complete but some of the puzzles were not. During the later chapters in the game you find puzzles that are just down right more frustrating to solve than fun. Sometimes I would just leave the game and come back later because I was getting so frustrated by some of the puzzles.Along the way, in the chapters you see all kinds of plants and other glowing things that you can collect and they are known as “DNA” points, in a chapter there are 50 of these DNA points to collect and collecting all of them by the end of a chapter unlocks an achievement. There are no upgrades or anything of the sort that you get by collecting these DNA points, they’re just there for perfectionists and achievement hunters mostly. A few of the points are pretty easy to get and sometimes you even get a few after defeating a boss but they are usually in tough spots to find and are hard to collect so I didn’t really make an effort to collect all of them on any chapter. As you progress through each chapter, you get to fight a unique and pretty sweet looking boss at the end of each one of them. The bosses in this game might be my favorite part about it because they are all super colourful, special and just sorta fun to kill. They are also pretty terrifying, you come up to a boss and it’s standing or floating there shooting deadly lasers at you or spitting weird acid in your face  while you are just a green blob that has to use the environment to actually defeat them, so watch out. Visually, the game is exceptionally pretty, the dark, misty but colourful art-style makes the game visually pleasing. It sort of feels like if you took “LIMBO”, set it in a nuclear wasteland and added colour to it. Each level has it’s own unique visual theme (Scientific Laboratory, Jungle ext). Animation in the game is also superb especially on the bosses, all looking very clean and smooth. The music in the game is alright, it’s nothing too special and I mostly found myself putting on my own playlist of music when playing through the game. The boss fights again I think take the lead here even with the music since the boss music was the best music in the game in my opinion.The biggest problem I have with this game is that’s it’s extremely short.I finished the whole thing in around 6 hours if you take out all the extra things I did with the game. Is that such a bad thing? No not really, but when the game is asking for 15 dollars it is. The game is great but standing on its own in the store the price for it is just a bit too large I feel. I got the game in January’s “Humble Monthly” which was a great get because it came with other games for a price lower than 15 dollars. TL;DR Mushroom 11 is a great 2D puzzle platformer with an original concept and great art-style, it’s extremely frustrating at some points but also has it’s glory moments. The price they’re currently asking for the game is a bit too high which is one of the most negative things about this game at the moment.  8.5/10   For more reviews like this, check out my curation page  here!

												Mushroom 11 is an incredibly unique game, and I love it. it's unique style and gameplay make it stand out from any other game I've ever played. The fungal ooze you play as is awesome as is the mechanics of erasing to get the fungus thing to grow in other places in order to move is genius, and the first few levels are an absolute blast to play.Then, all the game's flaws are pushed to the forefront after the first level or two.See, while you can erase parts of the fungus to make it grow in other directions, you have absolutely no control over where else it grows. while this isn't a problem while moving forward, during delicate tasks like riding rockes or moving up cliffs or cielings is an absolute chore and extremely frustrating experience. Several times, the game asks you to cut your fungus in half in order for you to move on, and, since you have no control over what grows where, you'll find yourself moving smaller and smaller pieces while the half you're not touching grows bigger and bigger.Moving in water is finicky and sometimes the developers ask you to 'jump' out of the water, which I could never figure out how to do with any reliability, and it took me about 10 minutes just to get past the first air vent in the 7th chapter (the chapter I am still on as I write this)I spent about a minute fighting the boss of episode 6 only to spend about 20 minutes trying to get across the gap that he occupied.Honestly, this game is a frustrating mess and I wouldn't suggest anyone buys it unless it's five bucks on sale.

												This is an early review, I'll update as I play more.So far, I'm loving this game. In a marketplace full of rigid game genres, annualized franchises, and me-too clones, It's a very rare occurance when I can say that a game is 100% unique. If novelty is your thing, look no further than Mushroom 11.I truly have never played or even seen a game like this one before. Mushroom 11 is based on the surprisingly simple mechanic of forcing your ""mushroom"" (it looks more like a green mass) to grow by destroying parts of it. Basically, it grows opposite of where you prune so if you want it to grow left, you cut the right side of it and vice-versa. Using this mechanic, you must navigate the desolate wasteland of a post-appocalyptic Earth. If this is difficult to understand, you're probably better off watching a video of this game in motion.Where you are takeing your mushroom, I don't know. What the overall goal is, I don't know that either, but so far I have played the first chapter and I'm having a blast.Pros:+ Genuinely100% unique.+ Long, intersting level design+ Fantastic artwork+ Challenging, especially if you try for 100% and absorb everything+ The Mushroom is a treat to control+ I have no idea what to expect next+ Uniquely suited to the PC + Fun boss fightsCons:- Can't use a controller (probably for the better, I don't even know how this would work, but some may see this as a con)			"

Mushroom 11 is a charming indie puzzle platformer game with interesting erase-and-move progressing system.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:""Delete it and it will grow."" That's what the Store page says and it's pretty much the most accurate description of this game. You are an unusual green organic creature (""the blob"") that consists of certain number of cells or blocks. Every time you erase a part of the blob, exactly the same amount of the blob grows from the blob in its other side. This way, you are able to move. You are placed in a world of fun and hard puzzles and boss fights.Pros: The Idea | I wouldn't come up with that in a hundred years and I have to say that the idea is brilliant. We all know that the market is already flooded with tons and tons of different platformers, so a change is certainly welcome. Puzzle Complexity | The puzzles were a lot more complex than I was expecting them to be. By that I don't mean they were necessarily hard, but the way they were thought out is just brilliant. But they're sometimes also just plain hard. The Graphics | You probably noticed that if you checked out this game's Store Page, but I'm gonna mention it anyway: this game is beautiful. It's not in stunning Ultra-HD, but it's still really pleasant to look at. I especially like the green shiny look of the blob. The Soundtrack | This game also has a really good soundtrack! They figured that out and made an OST DLC available for purchase. However, it costs 10$, which is really not worth it. Gameplay Time | I confess: I haven't finished the game yet. It's so damn hard! But I played it for quite a few hours already and it's still fun. Therefore, I'm sure that you can get at least 10 hours of fun out of it. I also feel like there is some replay value as my save files got deleted and I still enjoyed replaying the first levels. OS- and Steam-related stuff | Erasing mushrooms is now easier than ever even on SteamOS and MacOS. Achievements and Trading Cards are of course included. However, there is a catch regarding save files. See cons.Cons: Game Saving Problems | So, this game's saves are apparently locked to your Steam Community name. Not to your account, not to your computer, but to your name. If you change your name, your saves are gone. In my opinion, this is a really strange way of saving a game's progress and they should switch to using Steam Cloud as soon as possible. Difficulty | This game is charming enough to keep me interested even after failing a number of times, but I'm pretty sure that some people won't last that long. As I mentioned already, this game is pretty damn hard. It starts of pretty easy, but then gets harder and harder. And harder. And it shouldn't, at least not as much as it does.The final verdict:This is a good-looking platformer that actually brings something new to the table. Erasing mushrooms and growing them back are never yet seen in the platformer world or in any, to be honest. That's why it's worth its price. If you look at the trailer and all the screenshots, you should be able to figure out pretty quickly if this is a game for you or not. I can't decide if this game is balanced in terms of difficulty or not. I had a great time playing, but games just shouldn't be as hard as this one is. Almost everyone I know that played this game didn't finish it, but they all really liked it. I would suggest lowering the difficulty somehow as this would bring the player through the whole game and make him feel a lot better. Other than that, I have no major complaints except that save file issue, which is really weird.You might or might not know what this game was highly anticipated before it came out and the players weren't let down when the game was released. The initial players with such hype are usually disappointed because games are never that awesome as they appear before the release, but Mushroom 11's fans were quite satisfied with the result. This means that you will probably be as well.Anyway, if you like puzzle games, put this on your wishlist or just buy it. It has lots of playtime and it's not that expensive. And it looks nice.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: 2D, Puzzle, Physics, Mouse-OnlyValue Proposition: Can be relaxing, may also have a number of areas that can lead to excess frustration due to finicky nature of the control scheme. BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): This game is relatively unique in its mechanics but is has similar art/aesthetics or feelings as Bulb Boy, Badland, Incredipede or Leo's Fortune. Concomitant Exposition and SummationI hope your Photoshop skills are expedient. Mushroom 11 is a physics based puzzle game expressed concisely. You don't have direct control of the.. well, I don't really know what you are in this game. You guide a mass of Non-Newtonian fluid-- That's not right. It's viscosity doesn't change nor does it alter further from the speed at which it you attempt to separate it -- it's shear rate. Let's call it “space goo”. You use left and right click as more of an eraser to remove parts of the space goo and wherever you are not erasing it recollects or perhaps more accurately, it reproduces itself. This is not entirely intuitive. It's deceptively easy to grasp but very difficult to gain any amount of adept skill in quick succession.  There are numerous obstacles to overcome. Gears, lava pits-- even simple platforms afford some challenge; Plumes of smoke rise from factory pits and your ability to shoot the goo further becomes dependent on your current weight or inertia to be more precise-- Less mass, easier to move but less potential energy and so forth. The left click is a large eraser while the right click is a much smaller one usually reserved for cutting the goo into pieces lest you need to depress a button or lever while the rest of the goo presses forward. The larger eraser also affords you some level of creating your own platforms pushing the goo onward. Being that the goo regenerates upon collision with a solid surface you can sort of push it around by erasing what's behind it. The art is really nice, it's got a sort of vaguely cartoonish--post apocalyptic aesthetic. The puzzles are not expressly frustrating but for what seems like a relatively casual experience, some of the puzzles and boss creatures/scenarios can be overly specific and rely too much on luck of getting a teeny tiny piece of goo into a certain region. For most people this won't be a huge issue but if you're the kind of person that doesn't enjoy attempting something over and over when you already understand what is needed to get done and simply not being able to accomplish it because the goo tends to reproduce itself randomly when erasing rather than say.. on the opposite side of where you erased-- it can be needlessly frustrating when you just want to move on. It just feels a little out of place for the type of game it is but it's really not a big deal. You may just have to play around a bit until it something clicks. THE GISTMushroom 11 is a nice, fun distraction in between bigger titles with some very nice art. I'd wait for a sale if you can as it doesn't offer much replay value aside from tracking the speed and collectibles of each level. Nor would I say the first time experience is anything groundbreaking.Follow my curation page for more. "

												Man, do I hate this game...Probably one of the most challenging games I've played. It starts very basic. You have a blob, and by erasing part of it it will grow on the other side, which allows you to move it and get stuff and reach the end of the level. You can never fully erase the blob, and it will always grow back to full size when you leave it alone.The first level is easy, just get to the end, beat the boss. The next two levels add some obstructions that can actually kill you, like lava and poison, but are still fairly simple and more than doable. Starting at the fourth level the difficulty really goes up. The last thee levels will make you scream at the screen and throw your mouse into the tv.I managed to stop myself from damaging my tv, luckily, else this game would have become a lot more expensive. Did a lot of screaming though.If you like spiking difficulty puzzle platformers, this game is a must have! But you will hate it nonetheless.Oh, and some of these achievements only add to the cursing. Not recommended for 100% hunters unless you don't value your life and love a challenge of the ages.			"

												I'll echo a lot of what people are saying in negative reviews and agree that while the game is definitely an interesting idea that clearly had a lot of thought put into it, it just isn't any fun to play. The first couple levels are promising and fairly easy, but past them the difficulty spikes quite a bit, with either timed platforming or puzzles where you have to get the Mushroom into just the right shape to progress, usually while hoping the game's physics cooperate. Sometimes it's both at once.I disagree that controlling the Mushroom is completely luck-based, but it doesn't feel precise enough for a lot of the stuff you have to make it do. I got up to the middle of Chapter 5 before my patience ran out, so I feel I gave it a fair shot. This was after a patch meant to minimize frustration, so I'm curious how difficult things were before. I don't have any suggestions myself about any further changes, and if the developers have it the way they like, that's fine. I'm just not sure it's a game most people would want to play, even ones interested in difficult games.			"

												Mushroom 11 is a puzzle platformer where you move your amorphous blob around the level by shaving or destroying parts of it forcing it to regrow in the direction you are trying to move. Thankfully it regrows almost as fast as you can destroy it , I assume it's powered by photosynthesis, nuclear fallout or just magic.The game contains seven large levels set in a post-apocalyptic world and in a twist you move right to left on screen which takes a little getting used to! Each levels contains multiple puzzles like climbing stairs, riding rotating metal bars, an Indiana Jones cart sequence to running ahead of rolling balls creating bridges with your blob so it can pass by. There is plenty of inventiveness here and many of the puzzles in the last two levels are quite demanding.The control system couldn't be simpler, left click to destroy a large part of the blob, right click a small part. Sadly here is the only weakness in the game, as the blob randomly respawns when you eat away at it some of the tougher puzzles are more trial and error and just plain frustration instead of fun.Beautifully presented, Mushroom 11 is a very good game only let down by a control system that can't quite keep up with it's demands at times.

The way you 'erase' the goo(?) to traverse the levels is unlike anything I've ever seen before.The levels are very interesting, despite the bleak-ish tone. Hard to really express why I love this game, but it's definitely one of the games I would recommend everyone to check out.			"

Skipping Mushroom 1-10; Mushroom 11 is a HitFULL DETAILED REVIEW[gonewiththewin.com]So many taglines floating out there regarding this unique and enjoyable title. Are they all correct? Pretty much. There is nothing out there like Mushroom 11. Its unique take on platforming is refreshing and fun. Did I mention the art and musical direction? Well it's fantastic. It sets up the atmosphere very well, it surrounds the unique platforming concepts admirably. Are there any flaws? Some, I think replayability can come into question, I honestly didn't feel compelled to play levels again. Some stretches of the game were ""the same"" in a way, just slightly altered. Overall though this is an extremely fun ride I would enthusiastically recommend to platform genre fans, casual fans, and definitely anyone looking for something ""different"" (but good) to try.			"

												I feel attention is due to this unique puzzle game I've come across. My verdict is: It is definitely worth checking outBut if you are looking for something more in depth then read away...    Ever since I saw the first teaser for this in 2013 I was ecstatic for something this strange and intriguing for a physics-puzzle title set in some strange overgrown apocalyptic world. The artist who did the music created an eerie atmosphere with each world, 7 in total that had there own characteristics and enemy types that add to a DNA based score system when you have the 'bacteria' you control consume it.    Within moments of it starting the game tells you everything that is needed, You don't control the green entity yourself you mearly control its growth with the two mouse buttons(I stritckly use a keyboard and mouse when playing so I don't know the specifics for controllers) by erasing parts letting it grow outwards whichever way works. The two buttons have a different size based on whether or not you want to finely erase with the right mouse button or take out a decent chunk with the left. Many mechanics are introduced throughout the levels with wildly varying types sometimes only shown once other times in many formats through the game.    each level is roughly the same in execution: Go through the level introduced to new mechanics that progressively become more complex the further in, come across some alter form of ultra bacteria killer, learn a thing or two about what went wrong with civilizatoin and where things began to sway from what we're used to, and fight a particular boss that may pertain to some relative history of that place.   Now for the gritty part, this game has an EXTREME escallation in it's difficulty probably somewhere between Chapter 5 and the start of six I ended up spending more and more time on single puzzles than I do the entire game. Certain physics are introduced that require precision and timing with erasing the bacteria and by the time I got to the final chapter I was taking long breaks because of how long I spent on it. This was mostly due to having a hard time figuring out the way it was supposed to be solved because occasionally I would spend more time solving it one way that ends up taking longer than the desired approach since the game doesn't exactly tell you HOW it gets done just that it can be done in any way desirable.    Now you don't need to play them all the way through as you can exit at any time and come back to the same puzzle though in doing so it will stop tracking the time at which you played.     Now all these issues could easily have been fixed by now since I played it before they added the cloud saving which is something I am grateful for since it is important to be able to save that progress to other systems or when something happens that erases your data. Another thing that might've been fixed since playing were some of the puzzles so any serious gripes I may have had with the difficulty spike may have been fixed although it is hard to say without going all the way through that stuff again.   I think I've said my piece on how I feel about this whole thing so what's the verdict on MY reccomendation and pricing? I will say YES, if a unique physics based puzzle platformer is what you are looking for then by all means try it out. I will say the price may be a bit much as I originally was able to beat the whole thing within 8 hours so you might want to wait for a slight sale before paying top dollar.			"

												I want to like this game.  It's an awesome concept and a lot of fun for the first few levels.  The problem is, I don't have much patience for games with hard ""gates"" that you can't pass without a good amount of luck/dexterity/precision.  A platformer that requires a clever bit of thought to figure out where and how the jump should happen is fine.  A platformer that has several possible ways to make that jump is even better.  Unfortunately, Mushroom 11 seems to have a few spots where it's just a question of getting the exact right setup, and making the exact right jump.  And that kills the fun entirely.I'll probably never finish this game and that's too bad, because it really does have some neat gameplay.  I just wish it were a little bit more forgiving.			"

												Mushroom 11 is a game about flow, and it's biggest flaw is when it looses it.  This is an extremely unique and smart game which is a joy to play until approximately 70-80% of the way through the puzzles take a sharp turn from ones demanding thought and innovation in order to succeed to utterly finicky nightmares where the solution is obvious but hitting microscopic timing windows while getting the janky physics to play along required me to repeat some sections close to 100 times.Still a reccomend, as it is still worth the asking price, but with some game design consultation and broader playtesting this could have been so much more.  As it is, only a very small fraction of players will have the skill and patience to finish the game - and that number will dwindle to zero for the less skilled casual audience.			"

												Mushroom11 is about half way from a rough diamond to a cut one. Some parts of it are done really, really well, while other not so much. Good things first:1.  Control scheme. Your play as a hive-mind fungi colony. And it has a pretty unique way of moving - you must grow to move. However, you cannot grow out of thin air; you are a living form, so you need fuel to do that. You must sacrifice parts of your colony, to make another part grow. Here comes the tricky part - you can't control the exact part of colony which will grow, you can only rely on it being on the opposite side of the destroyed part. You can also divide your colony, if you need to, but remember - the smaller part will die. Basically, to succeed you must think as hive-mind fungi colony. 2. Level design. The authors decided to go with visual narration for their story, so the levels and backgrounds will tell you what happened. Wander through traps and debris of the abandoned world and absorb the history of a now-dead civilization. There are also hazards waiting for you, but they are generic: toxic liquids, spikes, fire, etc. 3. Physics. It brings at least half of the fun. Let me give you an example. There is a puzzle in the game, where you attach your colony to a rotating gear, and then detach a tiny part of the fungi at a right moment, so it will reach a higher place, and then you do your best in destroying the main body (which is still on a rotating gear mind you), so the colony's small part can make it. It's pretty fun. 4. Challenge. To overcome every obstacle and reach the ending, you'll need an agile mind along with good reflexes to back it up. 5. Have you ever tried to defeat a level boss, playing as a fungi colony? 6. Music. Developers went with electronic ambient music. Not a bad choice at all. It sets the mood and highlights some tones of crumbling world. And last two things that are not that great:1. The game is pretty short, just seven levels. It's kinda classic, but inevitably leads to next point.2. The difficulty curve rises very, very quick. Nevertheless, it's very interesting to play.So be prepared! The world of Mushroom11 is forsaken by good and is full of evil.Have fun, though!P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steam CRIMINALLY Low Sales curator.			"

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new puzzle/platformer, Mushroom 11! (NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)Video Review:  Mushroom 11 Review	 The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Very unique. Truly amazing graphics. The gameplay and controls are much smoother than it appears at a glance. Addicting puzzles. Not the same style, but definitley on par with Portal as far as top-notch puzzle games go. 4/5 Worth the $15The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Mushroom 11 is very unique. Right from the beginning you know you've gotten into something strange...different.....fun. The gameplay and controls SEEM wonky until you actually try it out and get going, then it is actually VERY fluid. You essentially prune away at your amorphous blob to get it to move along the level. That's it. These levels, though....puzzles, obstacles and even bosses. That's right, there are some really fantastic boss battles in this little puzzle platformer about an amorphous blob. In fact, the boss battles are one of my favorite parts! I got that same feeling I got when I played Portal for the first time after accomplishing some of the puzzles, thinking to myself ""Hey, you're pretty damn clever, Gamer Guy (In a Suit)!"". The visuals are very beautiful, especially considering you are basically exploring a post-apocolyptic wasteland. The music is also well done, and (again) I am not big on most video game music. I cannot wait to dive in for more. This game is superb. A solid 4/5. Worth every penny.Happy Gaming!!!			"

												I'm not sure how to feel about this game... It has a great concept and is genrally enjoyable for the first few chapters (actually for all chapters, but the last)... But when you reach the seventh chapter, it is a masochist's heaven... I wanted to kill somebody (mostly the developer xD) for pretty much the whole playthrough of it...I have no problem with hard games, I usually like them... But, problem is that this chapter requieres precision, that this game by design cannot have... And it requires huge amounts of trying or getting lucky (or experiance with it), to do something... And when you do it, you usually don't feel so nice about it, like you really did something hard, but just a relief that it is over... It does not have ""Super Meat Boy"" sense of hard achievements...Aside from that, design of the final boss is unbelieveably bad. I won't spoiler it for those who didn't play. All other bosses are pretty awesome, though.So, anyway; I think that game is good, it has nice visuals, pretty good gameplay for the most part, nice sounds, and I liked it... Except for the chapter 7; That was really sadistic...7.5/10 Recommended (If it wasn't for the last chapter and boss, would easily be 8.5/10)			"

												Interesting concept, but I really can't recommend it. Good fun for a few minutes but once the harder puzzles start appearing the fact that you have no control over how the ""Mushroom"" re-forms itself causes big problems. From a couple levels in onwards, the game alternates between trying to do the same very quick reaction time-based puzzle the same way over and over again until you get lucky with where the new parts appear, and very slow intricate puzzles where you keep nudging the same few bits of screen space over and over until finally a new bit of the Mushroom spits itself out in the place you want. It's about as fun as it sounds.			"

												The mechanics of this platformer are novel and interesting, as you push along a blob of shroom with your mouse, erasing what isn't needed so more can grow. The setting is post-apocalyptic, the backgrounds immersive and the music too. Initially, this game is fun and engaging. However, you quickly see that any collectibles you get serve no purpose, there is no way to augment your mutation of a character in a progression system. Quite the disappointment, as that has a lot of potential, but that doesn't ruin the game. You know what actually ruins the game? ROCKETS. It is a step just too far in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty mechanics that require absurd amounts of luck just to pass through. It is incredibly frustrating, and frankly, just plain poor game design. I'm guessing the reason why this game has so many good reviews is because most people don't play through the game enough to actually witness how the gameplay changes into this sheer frustration.			"

												A novel game and concept that is ruined more by its execution than theory.  The game plays like it shows, erase your blob to make it grow in the opposite direction. It's a push mechanic only much more cumbersome. I think it's critically overrated simply because it is indeed a new, novel at times approach. But the niggling fact remains it's cumbersome to play, level design is often more boring than fun and tedious rather than challenging. I'd say it's worth the experience at maybe $5 or less, but any more than that and you're much better off playing some other indie title.			"

												If you like frustrating puzzle games with nuclear slime, soothing soundtracks and wonderful artwork this is definitely for you!After almost 100 hours of playing I have to say I love this thing. While the main storyline isn't overly difficult it sure as hell isn't easy. The real challenge however is all these achievements. If you're a sucker for achievements this wonderful thing will come down on you like a ton of bricks. The amount of frustration trying to find all those strands. The pain of doing run after run to try and get no-deaths. All in all it's wonderfully horrible.If you like frustrating puzzle games with nuclear slime, soothing soundtracks and wonderful artwork this is definitely for you!			"

The soundtrack by, ""The Future Sound of London"" is really frickin good and perfect for Mushroom 11!			"

												This game is weirdly addictive. The controls, I think, are what makes it both unique and interesting, and immensely frustrating--in the ""I know what to do, and I just need to, dammit. start over and try again"" sense. There are plenty of checkpoints spaced out fairly well, so it's somewhat forgiving. Are you familiar with those squishy tube stress releif toys? The ones that kind of flop out of your hands when you squeeze them, and are made of transparent plastic, and usually filled with colored liquid and sometimes small plastic toys. Imagine you have to push one of those across a rocky, post-apocalyptic landscape, over lava and acid pits, and defeat cyclopean terrors. Imagine that you can only really interact with by pushing it with a fist or a finger. Now you are starting to understand how Mushroom 11 works. But, like, more complicated than that.			"

												Mushroom 11 is a somewhat physics-based puzzle-type game. You're given control over a slime-mold like organism that is able to rapidly reform itself, either if damaged or if the player manually removes parts of the organism. This is the core mechanic of the game, and while it it easy to learn, it's hard to master. Sadly, it might be too hard for some people and I personally have found myself frustrated to the point of just giving up, as the way the blob reforms itself is fairly unpredictable, making mastery somewhat of an impossible feat - at least to me personally. At first, this problem is trivial, but as you move through the levels it gets increasingly hard to make the blob do what you want it to do. The puzzles in this game are easy to figure out, but the unwieldy controls of the 'mushroom' makes them very hard to execute, and not in a good or rewarding way. This is especially true from level 5 and up.I must begrudgingly (as I applaud the developers for their willingness to explore new game concepts,) say that it is not what I had expected from this game, and unless you are forgiving in regards to bad controlschemes and frustratingly punishing trial and error puzzles, this game might not be for you. In other words, the basic idea is good, but the execution is lacking. Therefore I do not recommend this game.			"

												""In a post-nuclear wasteland, you're controlling a radioactive mushroom that can regenerate itself from a single molecule. Therefore, you're able to shape your own form to progress forward and solve puzzles."" This is the premise of Mushroom 11, a puzzle platformer. Having such an original mechanic in a game, although it could be fun and interesting, would usually require some adaptation time from the player. But there is nothing out of the sort in Mushroom 11. It's instinctive, it makes sense, it feels great to play right from the get go. It's such a joy to twist your mushroom around that you barely even notice you're solving physics based puzzle.The game is generous with checkpoints, basically give you one after each obstacle, so you will never have to replay a serie of puzzles already solved. That makes for a pleasant pace, and you feel like you're constantly moving forward with a difficulty that ramps up progressively.However, i do think the game falters a bit on its 7th and last chapter as this level is way more difficult and longer than the rest, introducing new mechanics constantly with trial and error the only way to understand how theses new physical objects work. I think it would have been nicer to split the level in 2, and maybe introduce things with less deadly puzzles, as it took me about as much to complete this chapter as it took me to finish the 6 previous levels.Nevertheless, the short length and the low starting difficulty should make this game acccessible to a large public.If you wish for more gameplay and/or more challenge, the game keep tracks of your collectibles and will reward with achievements to complete a level while getting them all or without dying.

												Mushroom 11 is one of the best physics puzzle platformers I've played in years. They really do everything right - a perfect blend of a beautifully-crafted visuals, a soundtrack that meshes with the decaying atmosphere. The movement of your ""character"" takes some getting used-to, the puzzles will have you scratching your head at times, and the bosses are cleverly-designed. The overall aesthetic package alone makes this game worth a second, third, and fourth look.  "

												One of the most interesting things about the Indie scene in gaming is the unique gameplay that can be found from time to time. Mushroom 11 is a physics based puzzler, but one of the most innovative I have seen in a long time and calling it simply a physics based puzzler sells it short in the creativity on hand.From the control scheme to the bosses to the world that is hinted at, Mushroom 11 is interesting. The game is also really, really challenging near the end, but generous checkpoints stave off most of the pain that would otherwise be caused from having to comprehend a completely new way to play a game and puzzles that are non-intuitive at first because of the novelty of the systems.Highly recommended for the stout of heart who can deal with the difficulty. I have finished this game, but gave up on 100% half way through. "

												Very nice game, some levels used to be insanely frustrating and difficult, but when I got back in the game, I had a good time and was pleased to see many levels fixed.  Although it is a bit short, I think it is certainly worth the time to play.One of the things i like the most is the acheivement of figuring out how to do something. There is no text explaining what to do, or parts on bosses blinking to show you that they are important.  You figure all of this out your own because of the way the levels and bosses are designed to teach visually.  Finishing eacch level in my opinion was a very satisfying feat.Unfortunately a few puzzles kinda repeat themselves and others are more luck based that anything else, but I don't mind that all that much since the whole gameplay deviates from anything you've played before.

												I hate doing this. First 3 level I loved the game. Next 2 levels I was baffled at how rather good levels had terrible boss designs. And Then Level 6 anihilated ani resemlbense of fun and enjoyment that I had with this game. So I just quit at about the first third of level 7. I just can't do this anymore.This game has really good art design, fantastic soundtrack and great idea with the organism you indirectly control by removing parts of it, so it regains its mass in other parts. You can only control how bif the ""erasure"" is, so WHERE the mass appears is not controllable and with simulated physics, a lot of other mechanics are also out of your control and aren't set in stone. So, for the first few level developers fully acknowledge how much random chance dependent this game is and design levels and puzzles accordingly.And then they stop giving a damn. And level 6 is one huge ""woops, you got unlucky"" chain of events without real challenge or fun, just pure frustration and amazement that the developers thought that this is good design. It's not even the first game that falls into this trap - a fantastic game with liquid simulation also on sale here on Steam called Vessel also became rather annoying at times for the same reason of how absolutely unpredictable and random gameplay was. Except, that game never really hit rock bottom of bad design choices, just had missteps (and even fixed\rebalanced a lot of things with patches so the game is more fun). Mushroom 11 goes all the way with horrible.And it sucks. I loved this game when I started playing it. I was having a lot of fun. To see the game break itself so hard is unbelievable and inexcusable. If you want to check it out - you WILL enjoy the first few levels. They are genuinely fun. Just don't be surprised if you start hating this game the longer it goes.			"

												NOTE: This game was a large factor in me purchasing it with 5 other games in the BTA Humble Bundle for cheap.This game has a very annoying concept, but very good level design. Controlling the character with the mouse was unique. It had a learning curve to it. The game explain how to do it somewhat, but i feel some more instructions could help here. Its possible to move through most sections fast, but it isn't intuitive how to do it. This made the game annoying. However, the game made interesting use of its mechanics with interesting physics ""puzzles"". I especially liked the rocket riding challenges in Chapter 6. As someone who played a lot of Portal 2. If you like spending hours trying to make stacks of cubes or wall portal climb to try and break a chamber, this game feels like a good fit for you.One thing that often felt unfair about this game is that your body can often get split into pieces and the camera follows the wrong one. Then when you try to get back together by erasing the other side and the side you wanted to stay is already going off the screen which destroys it, so you die. Another problem with the camera was that it would sometimes shake erratically causing lots of lag, while your trying to make a precise move. This doesn't happen too often, but I would propose to fix it by giving an option in the options menu for the player to control the camera. This couldn't be used to look ahead because the player will still get killed if they move the camera away from the character. One great feature of this game is that all levels save individually, so if your trying to get 100% on one, and there's a tricky one you can't get, and you want to try a different level no deaths, then you don't have to lose progress on that level. This is something I didn't realise at first thats a really smart feature most games don't have.Don't expect to get all the acheivements from this one. The last chapter (level 7) is extremely hard to get no deaths. I don't think it's worth it. There is also a extremely well hidden ""Strand"" in each level. If you have lots of extra time and are looking for a challenging search this is a great part of the game, and adds replay value. If you don't have other games to get on to they're fun just to get. Check where they are on an online walkthrough video. Some acheivements are vague, and I can't find any information online about them.			"

												Finally unlocked all the achievements, so hey, why not write a review.This game is really well-made. Graphics, level design, everything is top-notch. Any bad thing I may have to say about the game is due to my disagreement with the devs' decisions, not due to the devs failing to execute their decisions well enough.The core mechanics is really innovative and different. For that alone the game deserves a recommendation.Simply completing the game is moderately hard. Unlocking all the achievements is really very very hard. Think Super Meat Boy level of hard. If you don't intend to attempt to unlock all of them, the game may appear too short for its price. This game is really targeted at the masochistic kind of people who will replay the same level again and again until they finally manage to do it perfectly.The biggest disappointment for me was that all the puzzles only test reflexes and manual dexterity. I wish the puzzles were more similar to Portal or Braid, clever riddles that you have to strain your brains to solve, and once you solve them you'd get a new broader understanding of the game's mechanics, and the puzzle will appear obvious in retrospect. Alas, the devs decided to go another route.Connected to the previous point, I wish the core mechanics would change in later levels. Something like reagents that temporarily change your cohesion or make you smaller/faster/sticker. There are new elements that appear in later levels, but they're all in levels themselves - new objects to interact with, new liquids and traps. The mushroom itself stays exactly the same during the course of the entire game. Which is a shame.			"

												Phew...how to classify this game? It's both a puzzler and a race game. It's a parkour for the thinking gamer. It's world of goo's building style with the movement of games like element4l, hydroventure (fluidity) or puddle. And the style is something between fallout and oddworld. All in all, the least you can say about mushroom 11 is that it's unique.What amazes me most about this game is how fast moving around becomes a second nature to me, as I don't think I've ever played a similar game. You have to trim out the parts of your blob you don't want so the remainder will grow in directions you DO want it to go to. So it's mouse driven, and most likely mouse only (perhaps with a touchscreen exception?). Everything in the game is fluid and strangely intuitive. But that doesn't mean it's easy. I've just passed level 5 and if other reviews are to be believed, things'll get harder quickly now. And yes, some 'open the door'-puzzles are already were quite hard (borderline frustrating). But the overall experience itself was almost worth the price of admission. So I'm confident enough to thumbs up this game no matter what future levels may bring. :-)			"

												This game describes itself as a puzzle platformer. However, the controls are rather weird and the regrowth of the ""mushroom"" is random. This leads to many instances where the player knows the solution to the problem but cannot simply get past it due to fighting the controls. This in turn leads to many instances of frustration and being stuck despite knowing what needs to be done.I cannot recommend this game, especially at full price. If you are able to pick up the game on a steep discount or as part of a bundle, then maybe consider it, but I do not recommend this game as-is.			"

												Mushroom 11 seems to think of itself as a platformer, but it's more of a slow puzzle game with a control problem.You control your ""blob"" by using your mouse to paint away segments to destroy.  The problem is that because you cannot control where the blob grows from, you're left tediously painting the same segments again and again in hopes that it eventually goes where you want it to.I only bothered playing up until Chapter 4.  Most of the puzzles were easy to solve but overly tedious to execute.			"

												Mushroom 11 has some interesting concepts and is generally fun for the first 45 minutes to an hour (up through chapter 3 I would say). From there on out it starts feeling far too luck based. As you progress in the game you don't gain any more control over the blob so the challenge in puzzles starts feeling more like getting lucky with how the blob grew at a specific point in time as opposed to simply being about your skill. Due to that fact and the general feeling of frustration I can't recommend this game. It doesn't feel satisfying to complete the puzzles, it simply feels like you happened to get lucky doing the exact same thing you did the last 10 times.			"

												Mushroom 11 is what you get if you mix up a platform game, a puzzle game and Photoshop's eraser tool. And it's great!The underlying movement mechanism - where you destroy some of your cells to force it to grow back in a different shape - is very simple, but the beautiful design, endlessly changing landscapes and inventive puzzles means that it never gets old. It's so beautifully slick, too. Your organism gloops, squeezes and squirms around with a fluidity that is by turns graceful and hilarious.Progression through the level is fairly A-B, with a few optional side-roads to find collectibles. You generally take on one puzzle (or speedy action sequence) at a time, with plenty of checkpoints between.There's only the occasional bit of needless frustration - you finish off an end of chapter boss, only to have to perform some slow, painstaking final climb up a difficult chain just to finish the level, for instance.My impressions so far of chapters 1 to 3 is that the game is quite gentle introducing itself to you - the puzzles don't get tricky for a while (variations on button pressing, simple see-saw physics puzzles etc), with the trickier bits coming more from when you need to somehow squeeze across a pool of lava without falling in. But I'm itching to get back to it - I can't wait to be challenged more.Great soundtrack, too. It's exactly what you'd want to hear while being a giant, slimy mushroom.Gameplay of chapters 1 and 2:

												Mushroom 11 is a beautiful, focused and elegantly designed physics puzzler with an extremely novel movement system. It has fresh ideas all the way to the end, is polished to a mirror shine, and never feels like it has extraneous bits that weren't needed. It's a tight experience that knows exactly what it is and executes with style and artistry. It's also got a gorgeous aesthetic. Seeing your blob slip through and around the beautiful apocalyptic level geometry is satisfying and cool to watch, especially when it absorbs other plants (or poison!) along the way and the foreign element spreads and diffuses into the larger structure. The boss fights at the end of each level are expertly designed and felt like novel, interesting uses of the mechanics.This recommendation comes with a severe caveat; while the physics puzzles you solves are often clever and interesting, they often demand speed and precision, especially in the later levels. The game's central mechanic is often openly hostile to these demands as it is random, touchy, and inexact. Since you only control where the mushroom is destroyed and not where it grows, puzzles that require you to spread your mushroom thin (or avoid spreading into dangerous areas) can be tedious and frustrating. It's easy to accidentally cut off too much of a mushroom, or accidentally destroy a piece you needed and flub an obnoxiously precise physics challenge. This all becomes especially apparent when you need to interact with physics objects in the game, or fling your mushroom into the air.None of this is too onerous in the first few levels of the game (and you might feel you've gotten your money's worth just from there), but by the end the difficulty curve starts to feel actively malevolent, especially when a particularily long and precise platforming segment decides to be stingy on checkpoints. This game is also not great if you have wrist problems, with lots of repetitive mouse interaction. The combination of frustrating difficulty and mounting wrist pain drove me from the game several times.If you want a beautiful and utterly unique puzzle game and don't mind that later levels of the game might be deeply frustrating, then I encourage giving Mushroom 11 a shot. As far as the core gameplay mechanic, there's nothing else out there like it, and the game is thoughtfully and elegantly designed throughout.			"

												Puzzle Platformer with an interesting mechanic. The puzzles tend to be tough but fair. However, the largest downside is that there should of been more check points, or atleast better placement of them. Too often a check point will have you go through something tedious to get back to a hard puzzle. So you spend 30 seconds just to get back to where you are having problems at.So yeah, check points need to be increased in number, or placed in more conveint places to avoid tedium.Edit: So the later levels gets a lot harder. The one with the rocket riding is particularly BSy. So.. Yeah. Keep that in mind.			"

Mushroom 11 plays like an abstracted futuristic version of World of Goo, except it has heavier emphasis on tedious painting with your mouse and less on actual architectural design like in World of Goo.

												While it probably won't be for everyone, Mushroom 11 is one of the most interesting/original puzzle platformers that I have played in a while. In Mushroom 11 you play as a creature that can almost instantly re-grow its' cells. This means that damaged or ""erased"" cells will re-grow to the creature. The main mechanic in the game involves erasing part of the creature which makes that part of the creature re-grow somewhere else which you use to move the creature and solve the game's puzzles. The game does a great job using this mechanic to create some interesting puzzles and boss fights. For the most part the mechanic works really well but the game does occasionally run into situations where the game keeps adding the new cells to an area of the creature where you didn't  want them to be moved to. This means that you sometimes have to waste time erasing the same part of the creature. While I haven't finished the game yet I am through four of the seven levels and I have played the game for a little over three hours. I am guessing that the game is around six hours long. If you think the game's concept sounds interesting I think you will enjoy Mushroom 11. If you are a little more unsure about the game, I think you should at least consider purchasing the game during a sale since it is a really unique experience that I think most people should enjoy.Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.

												A very novel sort of puzzle “platformer”, Mushroom 11 sees you in command of a ball of cells. You cannot move it around directly, but you do have the ability to erase cells, which causes the ball of cells to regrow said cells in some other location so long as the cells are touching a solid surface. By erasing cells, you can navigate the ball of cells through the levels, and even do such things as navigate through mine carts and steer rockets – all without any control over that the ability to delete cells where you want.The game’s challenges are all fundamentally built around this central mechanic - growing along walls, creeping through tunnels, and otherwise making your way through the world. It is a very creative mechanic, and the game shows that there are a wide variety of things you can do with it. The early stages of the game feel very good, and you get to explore what it feels like to move the cells around and flow through narrow spaces and run over ground, both even and uneven.Unfortunately, while the game shows that you CAN do a lot of things with it, by the end of chapter 6 you are left with the question of whether or not they SHOULD have done many of these things. As the game goes on, the puzzles grow ever more sophisticated, but chapters 4, 5, and 6 introduce a number of new stage mechanics which ultimately prove to be extremely frustrating due to your lack of control over the cells. The aforementioned mine carts are somewhat frustrating to deal with – if you touch the tracks the mine carts run on, all you cells die instantly, in sharp contrast with other challenges in the game, where only the cells in contact with the hazard die (or in some cases, where the hazard creeps through the cells and kills them). While this section is generally not too troublesome, there are a few places where you’re likely to touch the tracks while trying to set off the mine carts in the first place, which is very frustrating. Moreover, your inability to actually directly control your cells starts to rear its ugly head here, as you must fling yourself through the air to complete many of these obstacles – and flinging yourself through the air feels very finicky and hard to control, as very small differences in your starting trajectory make a huge difference.This only gets worse over the course of the game. Later puzzles much more frequently involve such “flinging” of your cells, which is often very frustrating for how erratic the outcome tends to be. You also end up with an entire set of puzzles – air currents which buoy your cells through the air – which is entirely based around being in the air and unable to control yourself in any meaningful way after you’ve launched. Such sections feel less like puzzles and more like trial-and-error gameplay as you try to get things just right so you get flung on the right trajectory. What you need to do in these areas is obvious, but actually doing it is very difficult and oftentimes frustrating.Chapter 6 introduces rockets which your cells can ride through the air, and which explode when they (or the cells) hit any wall. It is here that your lack of control is at its very worse – while the rockets can be controlled, they’re very difficult to steer, and just after you get the hang of steering them vertically, you start having to steer them horizontally, which is even more of a crapshoot. These sections are, again, not really puzzles at all, but rather, again, trial-and-error gameplay of the worst variety, and are extremely tedious. The fifth and sixth levels, due to their mechanics, took upwards of 90 minutes to complete apiece, and much of it was spent tediously trying to get just the right trajectory, rather than coming up with clever ways to exploit the game mechanics.The collectibles in the game, too, are kind of obnoxious. Many of them require very tedious processes to reach; rather than being about your ability to solve puzzles, instead they test your willingness to sit there and do something like build a very tall tower out of the cells, or your willingness to sit there and try to achieve the right trajectories while flinging cells. While some of these puzzles are quite clever, others are quite tiresome, and worst of all, if you beat a stage and have missed some of the collectibles, they all reset – you have to get all 50 collectibles in a stage in a single run, which is very annoying given that you have no idea where you missed the collectibles and the more tedious-to-reach collectibles must be grabbed in the same tedious manner as they were the first time.All that being said, there are definitely some bright spots to the game as well. The bosses get increasingly difficult as the game goes on, but are actually reasonably enjoyable to combat, and all of them are puzzles to solve which are mostly not too bad to fight against, especially as progress while fighting them is saved. Having to fight a boss while not being able to directly control yourself sounds obnoxious, but in reality, it is surprisingly fun and flowing around the boss and setting them up to damage themselves or to reach the points which deal them damage is mostly reasonably enjoyable, and the attendant puzzles are mostly not too annoying – even the boss you must fight with rockets isn’t that bad, though, again, the annoyance of the uneven trajectories rears its ugly head again.Visually, the game is very beautiful, with the cells, enemies, levels, and backgrounds all looking excellent. The devastated, post-apocalyptic world of Mushroom 11 is pretty to navigate through, though it is likely that your concern with the puzzles will cause you to tune out the environment to some extent.All in all, Mushroom 11 is interesting but deeply flawed. The fun of the early levels gives way to the frustration and trial-and-error gameplay of the later ones, and while the game is certainly a very interesting and novel concept, at times it gets so caught up with the fact that it can do something that it loses sight of whether or not it should be doing it.

												A unique and well designed platformer. It also seems to be using its own unique engine rather than the unity engine that is prone to producing stutter making this one of the few 2D games in my library without stutter. Unfourtunately, the game becomes too tedious and hard on chapter 5 and downright impossible on chapter 7. Strangely chapter 6 was easier than both. Its relatively easy to find solutions to puzzles, the real challenge is in actually executing them and unfourtunately that can be too difficult to accomplish. Since only a really hardcore player would be able to finish this game, I can't recommend it to the general gaming population. This is a good example of why it is important to have a group of testers play through a game and see if they enjoy it before actually releasing itt. It's so obvious that only the developers playtested the game.update: turns out the devs did use unity. In that case they deserve credit for making it work well.			"

												Mushroom 11 is a novel concept that was completely lost on its design. Basically, you have a... mushroom, I guess? When you erase parts of it, it regenerates the lost mass. In this way, you can erase it in one direction to make it move in the other,   erase parts of it to make it fit through holes, etc. There was some potential, but the actual mechanics and level design completely ruin it. When you erase a part of your mushroom, the mass is added back randomly throughout it. This means that if you want to mold it into a shape, say, a hook, you need to continually cut parts of mass off of it until it molds into your design. This leads to constant repitition, a very slow pace, and a generally monotonous, unfun game. The puzzles that accompany this mechanic aren't much better; none of them require any thought, and the challenge lies more in getting the game to do what you want than actually getting it done. It just isn't.			"

												Like Portal, Mushroom 11 has a completely new and fresh mechanic in platform puzzlers.  Unlike Portal, the game does not show a lot of playtesting and tuning.  In Portal, you always felt that the game was being fair.  If only I was a little bit smarter, I could figure out this puzzle.  In Mushroom 11, you will often be in a situation where the solution is clear, but you can't get your little cells into the exact place you need, while avoiding the hazards in the very strict time limit.I am a big fan of this genre.  Other games in this genre that I have liked are Swapper, Limbo and (to a lesser extent) Braid.  I found Mushroom 11 too frustrating to recommend.  It's too bad, because there is an awesome game here, waiting to be found.  Take out the frustrating bits and let the player skills grow organically like in Portal.  Distill the puzzles down to their fundamental elements.  You'd be left with a fun 5-8 hour puzzle experience, which is just fine for an indie puzzler like this.			"

												When I read the game description, my first thought was that it would probably be something like Giana Sisters, as in a medium-paced platformer with the occasional puzzle. As I read further and realized the emphasis would be more about puzzles, I supposed it might be a little more like Nihilumbra, meaning slow-paced + puzzles. After actually playing for a little more than an hour, I can say for sure that Mushroom 11 is much more a puzzle game than a platformer. Is that good or bad? I don't know, depends on which of those genres you like better. Personally, I'm usually not into complex puzzle games. I often find them tedious and generally uninteresting. This one, however, just like Nihilumbra, has a unique feel to it, that got me curious enough to keep going.When I first launched the game, I picked up my Xbox controller and was expecting to play with it. When the game wasn't responding to the controller, I checked the options menu, expecting to find there an option to activate it... except there was no such option. I imagined Grumpy Cat look at me and say ""No controller for you, dumbass! Deal with it!"". So I went on and started playing with the mouse. The control felt really awkward for me at first. It took me a while to figure it out, but I have been learning along the way. Also, the game is quite challenging. Most of the puzzles got me thinking for a while before I could find the solution. Same for the bosses, and I'm only at chapter 3 (out of 7). The game looks and sounds well, the level designs are really cool, and maybe most importantly, it runs smoothly and quickly. Nothing too fancy about it - no extra weight. Ugh... what now? Oh, right - the bottom line! Well, the bottom line is, that this game is mainly about patience, creativity and solving problems. You don't need fast reflexes or a good eye-hand coordination to play, but you do need to be patient and think. If you think that's for you - Mushroom 11 will definitely be a lot of fun for you. Otherwise, it might get tedious and frustrating very quickly.			"

												Great game.Very original, very challenging and creative.Many secrets to find in each level.Only ""con"" - There are several sections in the later levels that can be too hard to complete, even though you know exactly what to do, it's just hard to make it happen in-game.It's not really a con, but some people might find this really frustrating. (Including me ^^)Overall, very good game, ~5-7 hours to complete (even more if you're trying to get all the secrets), very challenging, and great graphics.If you're an indie/puzzle fan, you should play this game.

												Whenever someone talks about how modern gaming is dead and bland, show them Mushroom 11, along with your very best ASCII middle finger.This game is simply brilliant, with an easy-to-understand control scheme and some good old fashioned no-nonsense puzzling, in a game unlike any which has gone before.Mushroom 11 is irresistable and fascinating.  You have to Mushroom 11.  You have to.			"

												At a first glance this game seems like a very good one. It has a novel twist on the platformer genre, adding physics puzzles to a biological blob. Initially, the levels are fun and the puzzles are challenging, but by the time you reach the final levels you realise things stop being fun, and just become frustrating.The game excells in the art department however, from the nice detailed backgrounds, to the feel of the diverse biology, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and the ambient background music. The control scheme of using a mouse to click and grow a tol that burns away the blob work well initally, but when you need more precise control later on it becomes difficult to use. Mostly because you have either a very small brush, or a big one that changes in size. This, plus the mechanic seems more geared towards a touch device where you can touch directly on what you want to change, rather than dragging a cursor around.The puzzles themselves are initially simple, and soon become challenging, but solvable. But eventually they require very precise movements to complete, which in my mind are simply too difficult for the control scheme provided.			"

A breath of fresh air on the 2d puzzle platformer games.Innovative in its mechanics, Mushroom 11 gives a very pleasant experience wich grows from chapter to chapter.Becoming more challenging and offering new and more varied tools to work with as it molds through the wasteland gaps and objects, you don't do the same thing often.There are only a few chapters but the difficulty escalates quickly between them, making the game fairly lengthy. Plus if you would like to 100% it, there is a fair amount or replay value, and it's very tough to do!Overall, a very good game with new ideas and very well put together. Worth for those who like puzzles and for any interested in the unique beauty of it.			"

												A unique game experience but infuriatingly tough. I should have realized that when gravity is the dominant challenging factor that it was going to hurt. Once the organism starts rolling, there's precious little to be done about it; Even while regenerating it doesn't lose any momentum. I'm not sure about the physics of that. I just wish that the puzzles could exist more like a lab experiment, something you can think about and less of tests of agility and timing. Time is spent carefully paring the organism to make it reach a ledge. But I kept forgetting to let go of the button and I'd accidentally bisect the thing and lose my work. I think that the game design has a fundamental flaw: As you kill cells the organism regrows in random directions, away from your cursor. And there are spills of separated cells that you need to clean-up or else they could become something greater. Because it is random, you can't control what you're getting. So it becomes a cycle of kill, groom, klll, groom, kill, groom, etc. And your effectiveness at being able to do this and keep the thing reasonably under control will determine whether you succeed or fail.

Small things like the ashes off the lavav and the background scenary really show it's beauty.It reminds me of World of Goo for some strange reason and I would rate this game 9/10 the reason it's not 10/10 is because it ends but I am hoping for more levels. Hope this helps! My video shows more! I will be playing it more and showing more levels soon.This game is definitely worth buying!Callula			"

												One of my favorite puzzle games. I'm a casual gamer, but I also like a challenge, and Mushroom 11 seems to find a good balance. It's frustrating at times, but also fairly simple, and quite unique in how you control yourself or rather the, um, blob. I've seen complaints that the chapters are long, but there are only seven and numerous checkpoints (between just about every puzzle) so you aren't constantly restarting. The last two chapters are by far the most difficult, and not as suited for casual play. There is a fair amount of replayability, as you aren't merely solving the puzzles and also because there are optional things to collect and achivements to complete. Though it can be interesting to develop theories as to what the blob is and what you are trying to accomplish, there is definately no story attached to the game. The atmosphere and soundtrack add a lot the the experience, but the control mechanic is what makes this game stand out. Overall, very enjoyable and worth a bit of your time and money.			"

												The way you play is by pushing/erasing part of a amorpohous blob which grows from it's largest section when you push it. One reviewer called this frustrating but I found it simple enough. I'd say the game is really mellowed out.A pretty ingenious puzzle game based on physical puzzles, not too difficult. Interesting boss battles. Plenty of save points so on the rare occsion when you do die, you don't have to go back far. The boss battles are not deadly (so far) so not too much grind, more a case of work out how to kill it and then it doesn't take long.Beutifully drawn levels and backgroudns and the music is also gorgeous.Story: None so far after a few hours of play (I tend to be a slow coach at games)Worth $5 I'd say. (rec'd via humble bundle)Or another way of putting it:You play as a b*****d evil cancerous blob that intends to eat and kill everything in it's path!!!!!! Lol.			"

Once you get the hang of shifting your mass around puzzles largely revolve around not having enough of said mass to solve the puzzle without cramping your wrist trying to get two nodes to bloom where you need them. There are also boss fights which are horrid.			"

												A really good hybrid between 2D platforming and puzzle game, with unique and interesting mechanics and creative obstacles. Sometimes you feel like breaking the game and abusing mechanics only to learn that it's the only way to get to hidden goodies. Game really does rewards creative thinking, love it.May be a bit tedeous at the end though, some puzzles require a lot of patience.			"

												Very good concept, nice ambient and good story telling through the background: the game has a lot of novelty, and tries to do platforming differently, but the problem is that its controls are hard to grasp, and counter intuitive in a lot of places. That would be alright for me if the game was just a relaxing and slow paced exploration platformer, but it's try and die puzzle platformer.It is very frustrating very often, and not because you dont get what to do, or lack some skills, but simply because the physics is an out of the box 2D physcs that is not entirely reliable (some puzzle will have you try over and over again a move until you succeed without understanding why simply because the physic engine allowed you to)other times, it required a pin point precision coupled with some good reflexes, but sadly the controls can't allow you to properly do what you perfectly understands the game wants you to do: It's quite sad because it looks like great potential, I wish it would just be relaxing			"

												The way you play is by pushing/erasing part of a amorpohous blob which grows from it's largest section when you push it. One reviewer called this frustrating but I found it simple enough. I'd say the game is really mellowed out.A pretty ingenious puzzle game based on physical puzzles, not too difficult. Interesting boss battles. Plenty of save points so on the rare occsion when you do die, you don't have to go back far. The boss battles are not deadly (so far) so not too much grind, more a case of work out how to kill it and then it doesn't take long.Beutifully drawn levels and backgroudns and the music is also gorgeous.Story: None so far after a few hours of play (I tend to be a slow coach at games)Worth $5 I'd say. (rec'd via humble bundle)Or another way of putting it:You play as a b*****d evil cancerous blob that intends to eat and kill everything in it's path!!!!!! Lol.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a press copy of this game by the developers. If you feel that makes my opinions invalid that is your right. Though, for what it’s worth, this has never affected, and will never affect, the content of my reviews. Presentation I like the way the game looks, but I’d say it really depends on your tastes. The aesthetic fits the world that is presented to us; one that is, seemingly, post apocalyptic. There’s a lot browns and greys, and maybe it’s just me, but even the bright colours, like the goo itself and lava, feel kind of toned down, again, fitting with the theme. I feel that there wasn’t a whole lot of contrast between the colours, which isn’t my favourite look, but again, fits what the developers were going for. I think the highlight of the presentation is the way the goo grows, and the sound effects that come with it. It’s really well designed, and feels satisfying when you get the goo to go the way you want. Mechanics Speaking of the way the goo works, it’s really difficult to explain. Even if it looks like it at first glance, you don’t actually play as the goo. You play as a sort of god-like guide for the goo, who’s only power is to erase the goo. That sounds really weird, and it kind of is, but basically you have to imagine it as though there is a certain amount of goo that has to be on the screen at all times. If you erase a section of the goo, it will grow back the same amount you erased only from different parts of the goo. This allows you to shape the goo in whatever way you please; you even have a much smaller “brush” that can make relatively fine modifications to the goo. The game continually presents new challenges to the player, and many times, like portal, it’s about thinking outside the box or approaching the situation differently. Story The thing that was disappointing for me i terms of the story, is that it isn’t well contextualized, and that’s why I compare it to the first portal. Though, even then the first portal had more of a heart to it than this game. Because, really, it feels like a tech demo, and that the whole game is just a stage to show of this one mechanic and not really much more than that. Another game that comes to mind is the first Assassin’s Creed. It pretty much totally lacks a story, and while it does have the post-apocalyptic world, it felt like you could have re-skinned it with anything. Would this game be different if the goo was instead cotton candy in a cotton candy factory? Not really. Not in any big way.So this is what I mean. Portal 1 didn’t have the character and charm required to really be a masterpiece although it was still a great game. Portal 2 built upon the foundations that Portal 1 laid, and made a truly ground-breaking game that got, and deserved, universal acclaim. This game feels like an even more bare-bones version of Portal 1 -- so it shows so much promise, and was fun to play and is an all round really good game, but it was also an empty vessel. It doesn’t really have a soul to it. Verdict So as I mentioned before the game has 7 chapters and each will last, give or take 20 - 30 minutes. I think my longest was about 45 minutes, and my shortest was 13 minutes. So you’ll get about 3-4 hours out of this game, and maybe more if you go after the collectables which I didn’t do. $15 is reasonable for that amount of gameplay, and it’s pretty worthwhile gameplay too. It’s certainly fun, and becomes very challenging in the last few chapters so be aware of that. I’m recommending it, but if you’re only “kind of” interested in this game then wait for a sale. $5-10 for this game would be a steal.If you’d prefer a video review have a look here:

												I love this game. I thought I might get tired of the whole 'take any shape' mechanic, but I haven't yet because it's put to use in so many ways. The bosses are aggressive puzzles you have to figure out and the art design for the creatures and world is excellent. The story is told through what you see rather than dialogue, so you'll have to use your brain for that, too. It's really neat to go back over the chapters and notice new visual clues about what happened...Just one warning: the difficulty spikes are sharp in this game, especially in the last chapter. If you're prepared to put the time in, though, Mushroom 11 is a unique experience.

												I´m kinda conflicted with Mushroom 11. On one hand looking back the experience was reasonable enough, but on the other this game manages to capture a lot of what is wrong with indie puzzle platformers. I think the polish and details elevate the experience somewhat, so keep that in mind as I list off the flaws.Firstly the gameplay pretty unique, and it´s unique because it´s bad and other devs haven´t gone with it for a good reason. Every moment feels like you are just abusing the mechanics as everything is heavily physics/RNG based and moving through the game is a constant struggle for that next save point. Moving around is enjoyable enough as long as it remains novel.Difficulty-wise first 2/3s of the game flows past nicely, but at a point the level of challenge and the physics-based gameplay come to a head and just unleash a torrent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ obstacle after ♥♥♥♥♥♥ obstacle at the player.The length of the game is good but it does say something about the game when after about 2.5 hours one is done with it. Short game is short and for a very good reason.Audiovisual design is what benefits most of the polish and tons of custom visuals, but the only actually good looking screen in the game is the main menu. The rest has a lot of effort put into it but it doesn´t translate into anything that I would consider beautiful or memorable. It is one great main menu though.On the whole Mushroom 11 is a very forgettable experience that couldn´t really be fixed without replacing it entirely. Slightly smoother difficulty would make it painless but that wouldn´t actually make it good, and the mechanics are IMO flawed from the start. The visuals are good but would require so much more than tweaking to make actually interesting. Experiencing this game mechanic for the first time was fun enough on the whole but past novelty there isn´t much here.			"

												Mushroom 11 is a unique puzzle-platformer. The objective is to traverse a post-apocalyptic world with your green blob. The gameplay is extremely simple but works well. You delete cells in your blob with an eraser and immidiately new cells will grown in another place on the blob. You move around this way and can split up the blob and make it grow in different directions and sizes. My First Impressions:

			Genna plays Mushroom 11. A game where you traverse the land and solve puzzles by growing onto things. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

The main mechanics are you've got a giant blob. With the Left Mouse Button, you erase it on one end, and it'll appear on the other. Using this, you can move across levels, or squeeze through multiple cracks. It's so satsifying to solve puzzles that might require you to build yourself into a tall tower, and then slowly fall over, or consume an enemy from ontop so it doesn't poison you. Pressing the Right MB will give you a smaller erasor for more precision.The art style looks beautiful. From the background desolate city, to the foreground lifeforms. My main worry about the game was that it could have easily used its main mechanic as a gimmick, however it manages to present some really fun and clever puzzles. If you've ever played Gish, a lot of the level design reminds me of that.Overall, a really fantastic experience. I love it!			"

												I enjoyed pushing green mold around. 10/11 would do again.-1 point due to a tad overbearing frustrations in level 7, especially on that wheel thing.Overall I found the game enjoyable start to finish, a tad short, though that's not a bad thing at all. The whole mood and visual storytelling is very, very enjoyable and I would have loved to explore more and solve more puzzles. Playing with the funugs never got borring, nor does it ever feel like my skill is too far behind the current challenges. As for the DNA collectibles, I just ignored them mostly after a point as they didn't contribute to anything more than a self high five for performing amazing feats of mold-shaping-goodness.			"

												Do you own a pen+tablet? Because if you do you need this game.However, it’s still ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic with a mouse. I am pretty sure though I can’t convey how awesome it is to perform fungal acrobatics and fight plant monsters with art tools.Essentially… you are…the hand of a fungal god? Who knows. But its your job to trim this bush of matter and use physics to defeat 7 levels of puzzles and coordination tests. There’s the spores of a plot (hyuk hyuk) sprinkled throughout the background art - it’s clearly post-apocalyptic, but I’ll let you make the rest of your conclusions on your own. This game wants you to work it out, damn you!In addition, literally everything is astoundingly beautiful and I am looking up the artist of the background music in another tab atm.  If that’s not enough to convince you, there are definitely some weird squidgy moist uncomfortable feels when you’re jamming your pulpy sponge through the tubes.			"

												A really good puzzle-adventure game with a very interesting mechanics, but it's so frustrating especially in some harder parts in the game. It isn't caused by the lack of skills but because of this Blob-thing you operate. Sometimes I felt like it was living by itself doing something completly different than I wanted. To be honest, it's a big flaw for those of you who are easily frustrated and imaptient. I finished it after 8 hours with a good dose of satisfaction, but I don't want to go back to it again. All in all, I'm recommending it - difficulty of puzzles is decent, concept of the mechanics is greeat, frustrating experience is my only objection.			"

												tl;dr - I stole a unicycle from a giant shrimp, rode on a rocket, and got jiggy with a mushroom. 9/10 would ooze again.Overall, this is a fantastic puzzle-platformer! In all, You play as an oozy mushroom (the 11th of its kind? One of 11 siblings? No idea what the 11 of the game means) in a post-apocalyptic world where humans are clearly gone and only the fungi and lichen remain. The mechanic is easy to learn but has infinite complexity: You have an ""eraser"" that erases part of your mushroom, and it regrows in the opposite direction. So you don't so much as move as delete part of yourself in one location and transfer it to another. You can also split yourself into multiple pieces for various uses, and regrow from any of them until the very moment they are completely erased. Good way to give yourself a lifeline in case you mess up! It only took me about 4 hours, but it seemed like the perfect length. Music is great, very atmospheric. Art is also great! Several different areas, all with a different ""feel"", like an abandoned hospital, spooky jungle, the obligatory lava level. Puzzles are challenging but never impossible. A lot of them take patience to ooze yourself into just the right shape to reach a high platform, and others require you to rush through so that you have the momentum you need to proceed. I think my only complaint is that the bosses have very little indication of how you can beat them, so it just takes a lot of trial and error, but that's just me being picky. If you're looking for an ultra-challenging puzzler, this may not be for you, but its frustration level is low enough for us regular puzzlers.			"

One of the best platformers I've played for some time. I don't wish to spoil too much about this game as I feel it lends itself well to exploring it yourself. Do yourself a favour and get this!			"

												Not another bland FPS clone, both the gameplay and the music are a nod back to the late 90s which is no unpleasant thing.Controls are just mouse movement and left or right click but the intricacy of the physics will take time to learn. This leads to occasional, ""Ohhhh right!"" moments as you realise something you thought impossible is both possible and vital to the puzzle.Indie games FTW.			"

												This game is so frustrating!  Very interesting mechanics that sometimes fight with you but in the end, they make you really think out the platforming puzzles.  The artwork is stellar.  The story is told from scenery and backgrounds but still feels really interesting.  Pros: -challenging-Gorgeous Art-New mechanics/Ideas (Original)- Good platforming and puzzles-Each boss is creepy, weird, beautiful, and memorable.-Each level feels unique and thematicCons: -If you hate games like super meat boy where you wanna scream and break stuff this is not your game.

												Do you own a pen+tablet? Because if you do you need this game.However, it’s still ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic with a mouse. I am pretty sure though I can’t convey how awesome it is to perform fungal acrobatics and fight plant monsters with art tools.Essentially… you are…the hand of a fungal god? Who knows. But its your job to trim this bush of matter and use physics to defeat 7 levels of puzzles and coordination tests. There’s the spores of a plot (hyuk hyuk) sprinkled throughout the background art - it’s clearly post-apocalyptic, but I’ll let you make the rest of your conclusions on your own. This game wants you to work it out, damn you!In addition, literally everything is astoundingly beautiful and I am looking up the artist of the background music in another tab atm.  If that’s not enough to convince you, there are definitely some weird squidgy moist uncomfortable feels when you’re jamming your pulpy sponge through the tubes.			"

												depending on how one is going to play this will make it quite different in experience, personaly i try to do everything in a game before moving on and the first couple of levels were challenging but managable, it was only around the midway point the ""flaws"" as i saw them starting to make themself painfully obvius, the controll scheme with 2 buttons, one for large removal and one for precise wasen't as dependable as i would have liked, as you remove one part another grows with the same size as is removed and you move there fore in that direction but it's not always in the oposite place it grows, and as such any precise movements is pretty much up to luck rather than skill, it can be to a point mannaged but i found it frustrating,even when the solution to a problem is easy to figure out, actually doing it is harder than one might expect and becomes frustrating fast, trying to go for 100% in this is not enjoyable as it is hard mostly from lack off any real controll.but if one plays it for the journey itself it's a lot more enjoyable, the music and scenery i found to my liking and it is varied enough that one can recognise where they are in the level the next time it's played.so overall it would be 7/10 with finer controlls it would have done better, but is still worth it for what it is.

												This game lives and dies by the uniqueness of its main mechanic. The movement of the character is unlike any other game I personally have ever played, and it is worked into the game very well. The level design includes places where you need to go quickly, and places where you need to take your time and work out how to reach a ledge or solve a puzzle. The randomness of the movement can be frustrating at times, but it adds a decent challenge to the game and is a part of figuring out the game. It's not a game that you can rush through and brute force to the end, at least not in your first playthrough.Overall I'd say you should play this game if you're someone who likes unique and interesting mechanics, but if you're someone who wants a lot of depth in your game, this might not be for you.

												It's always risky to try some radically new base mechanic in a platformer game, so I tend to hail anyone who attempts to do so. Enter Mushroom 11, where you can't control your character directly - all you can do is erase a part of it. What you delete will regrow in a few seconds, randomly across the bulk of the fungus. Result: if you persistently delete the right side, the entire bulk will move to the left. And basically that's all.For such an odd mechanic to work, the puzzle design needs to be ultra careful, and this is one area where the game shines - most of the tasks ahead of our hero are well thought-out, rarely very difficult, and the checkpoints are thankfully frequent.The other aspect worth mentioning is the incredible background art and atmosphere.Mushroom 11 is not without faults, either. One is a direct consequence of the base mechanic - whenever you need to do something with accuracy, you need a lot of luck or a lot of patience. The latter can run out easily when you're shaping your fungus into something elaborate for the umpteenth time, and still end up eg. falling down.The other is more strange - at some points, the game seems to interfere with the physics, forcing a certain solution path. I met this only 2-3 times - one example is the cart ride in level 5 where I found it impossible to keep the fungus in the cart at a certain jump.Based on the above, there's a little secret to enjoying Musroom 11 - take breaks, even frequent breaks, depending on your skill. There are not many very difficult puzzles in the game (levels 5-7 are more difficult than 1-4, but not dramatically so), but the randomness tends to wear you down after a while, and you'll feel the game is unfair while it's only doing its thing relentlessly. Quit and come back tomorrow, it will feel fresh again.Untame has done a great job with Mushroom 11 - made a very brave move with the base mechanics, and designed an interesting and visually superb world around it. Definitely recommended. "

												This is a challenging platform/timing game with mouse and alternative keyboard controls for the mouse buttons that I found more comfortable since you hold down the buttons a lot. The puzzles are logical if difficult. If you are observant you will see what you have to do, even if it seems unlikely to be able to do it. Experimentation is better than walkthroughs for this game, The epilogue is a neat final puzzle that could be read different ways. Sometimes momentum works in your favor - though I wouldn't call it luck - the flow of physics in the game is sometimes unexpected, forcing you to alter your strategy.The game is neither easy, nor arbitrary. The difficulty often is related to the fact that earlier puzzles have many different ways to solve them. As you progress, it is clear that the designers have 2 or maybe even one solution in mind, and you have to try to figure out what that is.Dexterity and precision with the mouse is required.			"

												I chose to recommend this game, however, I hesitated very much whether to do it or the opposite. My impressions:Plus unique, novel game mechanic great theme (post-apo, radioactive mushroom) nice visuals good audio great-looking bosses new game mechanics introduced throughout the game the first 5 levels are fun Minus only 7 levels, 4.5 hours of gameplay (consider the game time/cost ratio) the last two levels are frustrating, requiring precision control where you have none by definition, or luck, or many retry attempts the last boss being dull and easy. Probably the only boss in any game that I could ""fight"" while reading emails on my cell phone at the same time unused potential, there could have been more game mechanics, more enemy variety, more puzzles, more interesting stuff to do. Instead the game is cut short (seems very prematurely concluded) and towards the end a very hard platforming is required instead of providing more of the interesting stuff. "

												A great little game.Mushroom 11 is a great platformer for people of any age, it does not require cat like reflexes or super difficult button sequencing, nor any quicktime events. You might think it's must not be much of a platformer without haing to mash the jump button but the game works great using its unique mechanic of morping you green goop with just the mouse.For me the game was very easy, with most if the obsticles taking one or two tries to complete. It balances difficulty with checkpoints between difficult obsticle and allows for you to contine the boss fights even when you die. I found this game to be enjoyable and great for relaxing after work or some mindless fun on a lazy sunday afternoon.For those who find the game too easy there are acheivments that will make the levels much more difficult to complete and might be quite stressful. With beautiful graphics and flawless gameplay as well as the G rated content (no naughty stuff) I would this game for kids and adults alike.			"

												9/10Patience is the name of this game and when the art and music are as beautiful as they are in Mushroom 11, patience definitely pays off.Mushroom 11 is the most inventive puzzle platformer I've ever played. You have to evolve and adapt by 'erasing' or destroying parts of your own organism, which then grow back - but not in an order you'd expect. This allegory carries through to the game's post-nuclear plot. An organism that evolved to survive nuclear fallout would definitely have to be a highly adaptable and quickly-regenerating one. Beyond that though, my own interpretation of this game is that it also has personal and political implications. When facing a tough challenge (and believe me, the challenges in this game are tough), be flexible and adaptable enough to erase your own outmoded ideologies. You will regenerate and in the process adapt around even the most daunting challenges.This game is a work of art.			"

												+ Destroying/regrowing is an ingenious mechanic, and the game explores all the different puzzle possibilities really well+ Great rhythm. In some puzzles you through an area like a crazed psychopath hacking away at yourself with a chainsaw, and other times you are slicing tiny bits off with the precision of a surgeon. Both were satisfying.+ Difficult puzzles towards the end, sometimes this was frustrating, and sometimes I had to rethink my entire approach to the game, and gravity, and life, in order to solve them. One of these puzzles I swear made me a better person.- I'm a fan of post-apocalypic art styles, but this one was a bit... unpolished and overdone.- Some aspects of the game design are also not quite polished, eg. in one of the later puzzles (surgical, not chainsaw), the camera kept moving inappropriately, causing me to cut myself in half and have to start again.

												tl;dr - I stole a unicycle from a giant shrimp, rode on a rocket, and got jiggy with a mushroom. 9/10 would ooze again.Overall, this is a fantastic puzzle-platformer! In all, You play as an oozy mushroom (the 11th of its kind? One of 11 siblings? No idea what the 11 of the game means) in a post-apocalyptic world where humans are clearly gone and only the fungi and lichen remain. The mechanic is easy to learn but has infinite complexity: You have an ""eraser"" that erases part of your mushroom, and it regrows in the opposite direction. So you don't so much as move as delete part of yourself in one location and transfer it to another. You can also split yourself into multiple pieces for various uses, and regrow from any of them until the very moment they are completely erased. Good way to give yourself a lifeline in case you mess up! It only took me about 4 hours, but it seemed like the perfect length. Music is great, very atmospheric. Art is also great! Several different areas, all with a different ""feel"", like an abandoned hospital, spooky jungle, the obligatory lava level. Puzzles are challenging but never impossible. A lot of them take patience to ooze yourself into just the right shape to reach a high platform, and others require you to rush through so that you have the momentum you need to proceed. I think my only complaint is that the bosses have very little indication of how you can beat them, so it just takes a lot of trial and error, but that's just me being picky. If you're looking for an ultra-challenging puzzler, this may not be for you, but its frustration level is low enough for us regular puzzlers.			"

I would however, suggest you get it on sale since I don't feel it is a $15 game			"

												This is a challenging platform/timing game with mouse and alternative keyboard controls for the mouse buttons that I found more comfortable since you hold down the buttons a lot. The puzzles are logical if difficult. If you are observant you will see what you have to do, even if it seems unlikely to be able to do it. Experimentation is better than walkthroughs for this game, The epilogue is a neat final puzzle that could be read different ways. Sometimes momentum works in your favor - though I wouldn't call it luck - the flow of physics in the game is sometimes unexpected, forcing you to alter your strategy.The game is neither easy, nor arbitrary. The difficulty often is related to the fact that earlier puzzles have many different ways to solve them. As you progress, it is clear that the designers have 2 or maybe even one solution in mind, and you have to try to figure out what that is.Dexterity and precision with the mouse is required.			"

												A great little game.Mushroom 11 is a great platformer for people of any age, it does not require cat like reflexes or super difficult button sequencing, nor any quicktime events. You might think it's must not be much of a platformer without haing to mash the jump button but the game works great using its unique mechanic of morping you green goop with just the mouse.For me the game was very easy, with most if the obsticles taking one or two tries to complete. It balances difficulty with checkpoints between difficult obsticle and allows for you to contine the boss fights even when you die. I found this game to be enjoyable and great for relaxing after work or some mindless fun on a lazy sunday afternoon.For those who find the game too easy there are acheivments that will make the levels much more difficult to complete and might be quite stressful. With beautiful graphics and flawless gameplay as well as the G rated content (no naughty stuff) I would this game for kids and adults alike.			"

												I chose to recommend this game, however, I hesitated very much whether to do it or the opposite. My impressions:Plus unique, novel game mechanic great theme (post-apo, radioactive mushroom) nice visuals good audio great-looking bosses new game mechanics introduced throughout the game the first 5 levels are fun Minus only 7 levels, 4.5 hours of gameplay (consider the game time/cost ratio) the last two levels are frustrating, requiring precision control where you have none by definition, or luck, or many retry attempts the last boss being dull and easy. Probably the only boss in any game that I could ""fight"" while reading emails on my cell phone at the same time unused potential, there could have been more game mechanics, more enemy variety, more puzzles, more interesting stuff to do. Instead the game is cut short (seems very prematurely concluded) and towards the end a very hard platforming is required instead of providing more of the interesting stuff. "

												A fantastic ""platformer"" with a very novel control scheme and amorphous character. Many interesting puzzles, bosses, and methods of solving both. Chapters start getting longer and harder (did feel a tad like banging my head against a wall a time or two) near the end after basic mobility is mastered in the early stages. A bit of replayability for those interesting in gotta catch 'em all completionism, or perfect no death or speed runs.			"

												9/10Patience is the name of this game and when the art and music are as beautiful as they are in Mushroom 11, patience definitely pays off.Mushroom 11 is the most inventive puzzle platformer I've ever played. You have to evolve and adapt by 'erasing' or destroying parts of your own organism, which then grow back - but not in an order you'd expect. This allegory carries through to the game's post-nuclear plot. An organism that evolved to survive nuclear fallout would definitely have to be a highly adaptable and quickly-regenerating one. Beyond that though, my own interpretation of this game is that it also has personal and political implications. When facing a tough challenge (and believe me, the challenges in this game are tough), be flexible and adaptable enough to erase your own outmoded ideologies. You will regenerate and in the process adapt around even the most daunting challenges.This game is a work of art.			"

												Not another bland FPS clone, both the gameplay and the music are a nod back to the late 90s which is no unpleasant thing.Controls are just mouse movement and left or right click but the intricacy of the physics will take time to learn. This leads to occasional, ""Ohhhh right!"" moments as you realise something you thought impossible is both possible and vital to the puzzle.Indie games FTW.			"

												Do you own a pen+tablet? Because if you do you need this game.However, it’s still ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic with a mouse. I am pretty sure though I can’t convey how awesome it is to perform fungal acrobatics and fight plant monsters with art tools.Essentially… you are…the hand of a fungal god? Who knows. But its your job to trim this bush of matter and use physics to defeat 7 levels of puzzles and coordination tests. There’s the spores of a plot (hyuk hyuk) sprinkled throughout the background art - it’s clearly post-apocalyptic, but I’ll let you make the rest of your conclusions on your own. This game wants you to work it out, damn you!In addition, literally everything is astoundingly beautiful and I am looking up the artist of the background music in another tab atm.  If that’s not enough to convince you, there are definitely some weird squidgy moist uncomfortable feels when you’re jamming your pulpy sponge through the tubes.			"

												This is a somewhat hesitant recommendation. A handful of the later puzzles require extremely precise, methodical work, which is great until you realize the factors that combine into my 1 major issue with the game:1. The delete cursor exerts slight force on the blob.2. The random regrowth of the blob adds slight mass to a random edge of the blob and can unpredictably alter its balance.3. The camera moves based on the position of the blob (and other factors sometimes) even during these puzzles, and cannot be locked.Situations arise where these factors combine to ruin minutes of work on a puzzle and force you to reset. The worst part is that resetting these puzzles requires you to painstakingly remold the blob to the perfect, specific configuration by deleting randomly regrowing spots until they happen into the spaces you actually need them. When you need to utilize almost every single piece of the blob in precisely the right configuration, this can be pretty damn annoying to reset, work on for minutes, and then have ruined by the camera AGAIN.Now that the bad is out of the way, Mushroom 11 is otherwise a standout puzzle game. It has an innovative, cool mechanic as its foundation. The physics are tight. Guiding the blob quickly comes to feel very fluid, natural, and intuitive as you build a skill unique to this game. Best of all, with few exceptions the level design teaches you how to use this core mechanic in new ways; it rarely adds a new ""gimmick of the level"" to shake up the gameplay as mediocre puzzle games do - the progression feels quite organic.If a Camera Lock toggle was added to this game, its only significant weakness would be much improved. As is, Mushroom 11 becomes pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times. An otherwise singularly smooth, innovative puzzle game is worth that (significant) frustration.			"

												This game is freaking brilliant and not quite like anything I've ever played before.

												I really enjoyed this one. It's a very good puzzle game with innovating and clever mechanics that allow for plenty of variety in the puzzle solving. Sometimes it's more about thinking, sometimes it's also about acting quickly, and this include the bosses at the end of each chapter. The art of the game is beautiful, and so is the enviromental music.It's not a very short game, it's not too long either, although keep in mind you will have to spend time thinking on the more difficult puzzles. Besides, not being too long is good for the game, as it allows it keeping it fresh with the obstacles.Overall, it was a great experience.			"

												This is one of the most unique puzzle/""platformer"" games you'll ever see. The unique control concept is intuitive and drives all the puzzles. It also has a great progression of difficulty in both the puzzles and the need for speed and precision, and hits all the right notes for this type of game.Being a puzzle game at heart it's on the short side, but between the secret collectibles, no death runs, and just generally seeing how much you've improved, it has better replayability than the average puzzle game. And in any case you're getting a unique experience you won't find anywhere else.One caveat: You will need a lot of patience to enjoy this game. Approached from the wrong mindset, the game is quite slow. You can spend a long time shaving off little bits to force yourself in the desired direction, and it doesn't really force you to learn how to go fast until halfway through the game. Also, each level is extremely long (the last 3 levels each took me just over an hour to beat), so by the end of each one I found myself praying for the boss to show up so I could do something else.

What I liked:  Physics based puzzles Bosses are a nice challenge and are well done Unique way to moveWhat You Need to Know:  This game has you control an amoeba type thing that you move by erasing, at first it seems random but you can get the hang of it The are 7 chapters that all end with a boss that uses something that was added in that level like, controlling a rocket, turning into ramps, or climbing on the boss itself. Also the last level spikes so hard in terms of difficulty compared to the rest of the game. I do have to say that I did not know there were bosses in this game. They are all very well designed and require you to solve the way to kill them in the form of a puzzle and are the best part of the game. There are no upgrades to your amoeba; they do have collectables that 90% are given just from progressing, the rest you have to use your skill to get. These add nothing to the game, they don’t level you up or anything like that. My Score: BPaid: Included in $6 Humble BundleCompleted in: 3 hoursGames similar I recommend:  Puddle Zup!

It has some very good graphics, enhanced by awesome shaders, and it has also a very relaxing music. But the best part is the game mechanics that make you say ""wow!"". Everything is very well designed, the camera has a custom behaviour that adjusts dynamically based on the place you are on the level at a moment of time.Trust me that I wasn't expecting at all such a surprise coming from a game that, I have to admit, I wasn't aware of until recently.

												Unique physics gameplay, beautiful hand-drawn like graphics. Can be slightly frustrating at times, but nothing major. Recommended.EDIT:I managed to get to the final boss, but could not beat it. Way too difficult for my patience.Now that I've seen most of the content I also think that the game is a bit overrated. It's good, but not that great. My biggest complaint is the ""puzzle"" aspect of the game. In general I like when puzzles in games take a bit effort to figure out, and once you do get it, they offer reasonable challenge to solve them. There are few worst case scenarios: a) puzzles that are very easy to figure out and incredibly tedious to solve, b) puzzles that are tedious to figure out and also tedious to solve and c) puzzles that you manage to solve without figuring them out (by luck, by persistence etc).Unfortunately a lot of the puzzles in this game fall in the category A, and some in B. Many times I figured out the ""puzzle"" immediately but solving it was so frustrating and lot of retries were needed.The controls are bit arbitrary and bit frustrating by design as you can only cull the mushroom and not say where it should grow. But this is ok, it's the thing in the game. The game also has quite good camera work in principle, but unfortunately together with the controls this creates a huge source of frustration.Even if you keep your mouse still, the moving camera affects the area where the mouse is culling the mushroom, and there's also a feedback loop where changing mushroom shape affects the movement of the camera. This was not bad as it propably sounds, but at times it was infuriating. Sometimes I was wanting for the mouse to move in WORLDSPACE, not in screenspace. That might have solved some of the issues...Anyway, I do recommend this game. It's one of its kind, and really interesting take on the physics puzzle platformers. Despite all the frustration.			"
