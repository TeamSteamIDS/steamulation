Geek Citadel - Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Review 
A Video of

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is an adventure game classic. It was full of adult humor and powered by a dark mystery surrounding voodoo. HD Remakes are now the nature of the game, and Gabriel Knight is next to get its upgrade. It does away with the 2D visuals of the first game and takes its steps into a fully realized 3D world.For those who don’t know about the story of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it follows a charismatic novelist who gets involved in a murder case. He’s been having terrible dreams that depict him dying a specific death, and soon he’ll discover that they lead to even more problems. Gabriel will travel across the city investigating the ""Voodoo Murders"" for his book. He will find love and intrigue as he tries to discover the secret behind the murders in New Orleans.The Anniversary Edition makes some major changes from the original. The visual bump from 2D to 3D is the obvious change, with many of the key areas and characters re-imagined for higher resolutions. Even the comic book scenes have been changed to include better art and speech baloons. It definitely looks much better than the classic version, but it loses all of the nostalgia factor for those that have already played it. Despite a few odd animations when moving around the title is a beautiful recreation of the classic.Interacting with objects and moving around the city is easier than ever. Simply double tapping an area will teleport Gabriel to a certain point in the room. A new icon now allows players to quickly leave an area and head to the world map at any time. No more waiting through long animations to wait for in a game with tons of backtracking.That's a staple of classic adventure games but this HD remake makes some changes to how the story unravels. Certain aspects of the story and puzzles are shifted around among the various days. For example, in the original game Gabriel would visit his grandmother on the first day. In the new version he doesn't visit her until the week is nearly over. It's subtle little changes like this that adds a welcome freshness to a familiar story.Fans of the classic will notice that the voices have changed for many of their favorite characters. Anyone that has played the original would be familiar with the popping and static in the original game. Sadly, Tim Curry, Mark Hamil, and many others were not able to re-record their voices. Instead, they have been replaced by a whole new cast who try to replicate the voices as much as they can. They do a fairly great job at sounding like the original characters, and some voices actually sound better than the original. The only change I miss is Leah Remini's fiesty run as Grace Nakamura.The upgraded animations are the best improvements to the title. You can actually tell what everyone is actually doing on-screen. It comes at a small sacrifice however, as there are zones where the world feels less alive because of ambience removal. The crime scene was hectic when Gabriel reaches the location in the first game, but it seems much calmer in the upgraded version. Also, the police station doesn’t have that lively hustle and bustle about it anymore.It’s good that the upgraded puzzle design outweighs a few removed animations. No more randomly clicking on pixels to find a snake scale in the sand. U.I. upgrades and of course cleaner graphics improve the experience from the original. The puzzles in Gabriel Knight have always been well thought-out (besides that awful clock puzzle.) Now Gabriel has a journal to keep up with current events for the day, and if all else fails a new hint system is in place to help players push through the story.My only real complaints come from the puzzles that allow players to clear manual input. Some of them have incredibly long strings, but the player will only be able to clear all the text instead of deleting a single character. Another problem I have is the strange speech baloons during the comic book cutscenes. Maybe it is the extensions that block the visuals on screen, but I just think it looks out of place and unnecessary.Do any of these changes make the Anniversary Edition better than the original? That’s going to be subjective to anyone that’s played the first game. There are always going to be games that we mesh more with and don’t want touched (Chrono Trigger, I’m looking at you) but for people who don’t mind seeing games upgraded, you can’t go wrong with this remake. It's a fantastic recreation of a classic title, and it even features some behind the scenes content from the original game for the nostalgic. Geek Citadel gives Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition 4 stars out of 5. A lot has changed to bring this classic to the HD world, but it's still very much a classic.			"

Gabriel Knight is one of those classic adventure games that has it all. At its core, a rich, engaging story involving voodoo, occult & sacrifice in New Orleans. Uncovering old family secrets & discovering your destiny. A cast of interesting, reoccuring characters full of personality. Mystery, murder, horror, star-crossed lovers & challenging puzzles. And off course, that black trenchcoat & that awkward southern accent! It's all been faithfully reproduced.The 20th Anniversary edition, could be likened to a ""Director's Cut"". The full story is still there, nothing missed, but some things are remixed appearing at different days or points in the story. There is also a few new things added. This all up, adds some freshness for those familiar with the original '93 release. It plays well and the changes made seem logical, balancing out the gameplay & story arcs.Cutscenes deserve a special commendation. They're done in a comic style (frame-by-frame), beautifully done, almost popping out the screen at times. These added a lot of emotional impact to the story.Although Gabriel Knight is a fairly logical (by point-n-click adventure game standards), its still an old school design, so there is some strange logic at times, ultimately adding to the difficulty & forcing you to think creatively. There are clues throughout the dialog though (& your Journal), so its important to always pay attention, even if it seems to be irrelevant at the time. It's a deep, detailed story to explore. Finding the clues, and figuring it all out is well-paced & generally an enjoyable experience. Makes you want to explore everything just to make sure you don't miss anything!There is great (fully voiced) dialog along with some funny adult humor & sexual tension between Gabe & Grace/Malia to spice up some of the conversations too. Although the voice acting is top notch, Gabriel's voice did grind at me (along with Gabriel's unlikable persona) for the first 2-3 days (in-game episodes). I got used to the voice eventually, and persona-wise this does change over the course of the 10 day episodes the game is split into. I though the creole narrator was particulary good, although if you don't like it you can turn her off.When you add the combination of the excellent remastered soundtrack (changes per location), along with the gorgeous highly detailed painted artwork, to the top voice acting, it creates an immersive experience with a unique ambience to every scene. I found myself just sitting back sometimes, taking it all in before progressing in the story. Most of the scripted animations were well done, although I found the animations for Gabriel a bit stiff at times when moving around a scene. It wasn't terrible, but it was noticable. You can also see clipping issues from time to time or the odd glitch.Interface was clear & functional and there is a limited hint system. It was nice to be able to double click to 'teleport' to a point. Click the exit to the scene just gently fades out was a smooth touch too. There is also a lot of content to sink you teeth into, for me it too around 25hrs to figure everything out to complete the 10 days & all achievements (although I am sure you can do it much faster!). Feels like a lot of care was taken to get this right. This is a quality, story-rich supernatural point-n-click adventure, honoring the spirit of the original. It reintroduces Gabriel Knight to a whole new generation of gamers, while bringing back fond memories for many older gamers.I really enjoyed the entire experience. Highly recommended!(PS - Hope this leads to the sequels getting the same 'Anniversary' treatment sometime in the future!)If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												I have never bought a game from Steam as instantly as I bought this, and at full price to boot. This is how fantastic GK (and the whole series, really) is.Periodically I would look up old point-and-clicks I used to play, or search desperately through new releases in this genre, and with every point-and-click adventure I'd find and play to limited satisfaction, I'd mutter to myself, ""why can't I find something like Gabriel Knight?""Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is my favorite game. Like, I'm saying of *all time* here. I attribute this to Jane Jensen and her team's wonderful storywriting skills: You will not find a point-and-click game anywhere else with more story and lore than this one. It is literally *the* game to beat in terms of this genre.This anniversary edition does wonderful justice to the original; revised just enough to keep up with a more modern market, while still keeping the same fantastic atmosphere of the original. I could not recommend a game more.Thank you for re-releasing my favorite game, I am so overcome with excitement I've lost my eloquence! <3 JUST BUY IT ALREADY			"

												Point n' click adventure games are making a return into the gaming industry! I loved the 1993 version and I love this version too. Jane Jensen wants to do more Gabriel Knight games and she has my support on it. The graphics are beautiful, even though you can spot the occassional clipping or the weird way people walk. The dialogue is as humorous as it was originally. They couldn't get the original voice actors, but they did a good job nonetheless. I am really digging the new interface and how much easier it is to do what needs to be done. The music in this game was done by Robert Holmes. If you don't know who he is, you have no taste in music. The music sets the stage for this gloomy game. But for what it's worth, this is a great game.			"

												The original Gabriel Knight was something of an unintentional rite of passage during my childhood. I found the game as a kid and I tried to play, the problem is that as a 10-11 year old kid I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. But I kept going on and on and because the game had a grip on me, the story is something that stayed with me for years to come.This remake came out yesterday and I've beat it already. I wanted to pace myself to enjoy it over some time but that was impossible, I just couldn't stop. Playing this game made me feel like I was brought back to my childhood, when I first played the original Gabriel Knight, with the difference that this time I had some sort of idea what I was doing. The additional material was really interesting too, because it included snippets from the making of this game and the making of the original one-Even if you didn't play the original game back in the day, the game stands fine on its own, so you can play it without fear.For a more exhaustive feel of the game you can read this review I wrote: http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/gabriel-knight-sins-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition-review/ "

												9/10+ the graphics are indeed remastered while staying faithful to the original- character models could be much better and detailed, especially gabriel+ fantastic soundtrack (enhanced version of the original), the original in-game music is great , brings back nostalgia, voice acting is generally very good- still had to reduce the volume of the music in-game, because it gets distracting being so loud - also prefer the original gabriel's voice and luckily there is an option to mute the disturbing narrator's voice+ don't have to say much about the story, it's great - gabriel tries to figure out the mystery of the voodoo murders in orleans, great dialogues, great characters, great setting and atmosphere+ in every scene you can see the concept art and several comparisons to the original sketches, very interesting stuff for the fans of the series+ puzzles are plenty with variable difficulty, mostly logical, classic gameplay mechanics (point and click adventure game in 3rd person), but with the great scope of the story it is sometimes difficult to proceed since you have to remember and combine many things - luckily the notebook is a great and very helpfull addition and there is also an in-game hint system (that i do not intend to use)+ the graphics being much clearer now than the original helps a lot in the pixel hunting, things to interact with are much easier to identify+/- space button reveals all hot spots in the scene+ great score system (that really rewards your progress)- technically the biggest concern are the animations - very stiff and slow, especially there is a delay when starting moving gabriel around -  also skipping dialogues sometimes is done in fast forward skipping the next sentences as well, this  can really use a patchin general , having played and loved the original i am happy with this release, it is definitely a remastered edition of the original, i am just not sure if it will appeal to new players (especially with games like vanishing of ethan carter being fresh and probably a step forward for the adventure genre) but the fans of the series will surely love it			"

												Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary EditionOMG! Was that really 20 years ago? Seems like yesterday when it came out. Back in the days when I was starting out playing PC and videogames. I had so many fond memories that I actually  shied away for long weeks before playing the revamped version on Steam , not wanting to spoil my memories of the game by a bad new version. But here's my two cents. Graphics  8 of 10The graphics made a huge step forward from 1993, of course. I liked the improvement, from dust particles that can be seen when the sun shines through a window, to the sometime kind of 3D backgrounds and characters. Advertised it is as being HD, but well it's not all HD, the story is done e.g. told in comic style. Because truth be told, back in the 90ies the graphics were so ugly, that sometimes you were just clicking around with your mouse, just hoping you hit something that could be useful. Big Thumbs up for the improvement! Gameplay/Story  8.5 of 10Even after all this time, the story still feels fresh .Gabriel Knight's humor and dialogues are still fun and feel fresh. The game is an Absolut classic. Voodoo Gods, the New Orleans Flair and the story of the Schattenjägers. The riddles are tricky and sometimes a little farfetched, but the producers added a new hint system in your diary, which should help beginners of the genre. And even though I been playing the game before, it still took me around 14 hours.  Music & Voice     8.5 of 10The 90ies music was replaced by a new mix by the original composer. Very fitting. Nothing against old-school, but 90ies PC music was not that good. I was surprised how fitting the voice actors were. Especially the voice of Gabriel Knight. Final Verdict  Definitely a must buy for nostalgic gamers (like me) , adventure gamers in general and probably the best game for starters of the genre.			"

												The full (German) review can be found here: http://www.jack-reviews.com/2014/10/gabriel-knight-sins-of-fathers-anniversary-edition-review.htmlAs someone who never played much of the original (and only played the third game till a technical bug prevented any progress) I thoroughly enjoyed the 20th Anniversary Edition. Gabriel might be too much of a playboy at first, but he got better towards the end. And the other characters are insteresting enough and offer voice acting that I can't complain about. I really didn't like the narrator, though. Her voice can be turned off, however.The story is also interesting from beginning to end, although I found Gabriels relationship to Malia highly unrealistic.And for an adventure game, it offers a whole lot of puzzles, all of  which are logical enough to be solved without having to endlessly wreck your brain. I hated the pantomine, however. And deciphering some of the codes towards the end took me a while.But if you're ever stuck, the game offers a hint-system with multiple levels. It doesn't offer solutions on a silver platter, but gets you far enough to proceed. Except for day 4, where I found myself wandering around aimlessly as I had no idea how to solve a specific puzzle until I decided to look at a certain book again.These comfort-features do have a downside, though. Their implementation is lacking.Show all hotspots - plasters terms all over the screen instead of showing subtle hintsSkip through dialogue - speeds up the game, which is very noticeable at times. Also can lead to skipping multiple lines of textRun to a specific spot - run? Gabriel doesn't run. He teleports!Continue - does not continue from your last save but from an autosave at the last map you visitedIt does have a few good features, however. If you click on an exit, the screen fades out almost instantly. And you can get to the worldmap from almost any screen. Important dialogue is also marked. And the journal contains extra-features for every map, like interviews, artworks etc...I'm sure I could mention more, but I've already written a whole review in German :DIf you've never played Gabriel Knight, I don't see a reason not to buy this version. Is the original superior? Maybe, but I liked what I got.			"

												it's a very faithful remake of the original gabriel knight game. all the original content is there and there are some new bits and pieces added. the story - set in new orleans circles around theme of voodoo - is still as engaging as it ever was. and this should do as an overall summary - it is still the sins of the fathers that we know and love, only it looks better and works better with modern systems.it's very nice in the art department, both being faithful to the original and enhancing on the original with added details - a lot of which seem to be from original designs but not implemented in original (mostly for technical reasons like art and display resolution).soundtrack matches closely to what's been done to the art. it is the same yet improved. and it is really good.voice acting quality tends to vary. occasionally it is really good, occasionally it is not good and most of the time it lingers somewhere around good. at times actors seem to be trying too hard to emulate the mannerisms of the dialogs in original game. not a bad thing in itself but a bit too obvious. acknowledging that it is very very difficult to top the voice acting of main characters from the original gabriel knight I cannot really blame the remake to fall a little short in this area. what we have in the game is still a respectable result.technically, it's not bad. unfortunately, it does have the downsides.large resolutions are supported and it works at 1080p (and higher) without problems. not related to resolutions but aspect ratio - some images look out of place with widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio - both studio's and game's logos in the beginning looked just a little bit off.animation is stiff and feels unpolished. wooden gabriel walking around is not too bad but in the first day introduction seeing grace walking into the stairs and then slowly rising above it (while she was the only moving thing on the screen, grabbing attention) left a strong impression of game needing just a bit more polish.tutorials are quick and simple but great and do give a small overview both to new and old players of how the ui works.adding labels to the actionable items on screen when pressing onscreen button or space is a great idea and a good way to remove pixelhunting (especially as this never was the point of gabriel knight games).unfortunately, there are issues with the ui as well. at times, after action or listening to a description, the game waits for a few seconds before allowing the next action. when skipping an action (not too uncommon with some items giving multiple descriptions on repeated views/actions) it gets more common. this also seems to depend on the area/screen, in the very beginning of the game, inside of the cabinet was a bad offender. an additional related problem - having clicked on a hotspot, the only way to continue is to select an action, there does not seem to be a way to cancel.clicking to skip/fast forward lines is unreliable, often skipping multiple lines of dialogue. it seems that due to the way skipping is implemented cursor basically jumps around on the screen (to the skip button and back to where it was before, sometimes missing the target on the latter) and quick clicking is thus discouraged.as a bonus, especially for fans of the original, there is extra material for each scene - concept art, artwork, comparisons of the remake and the original, interviews etc.for an adventure fan, this is a definite recommendation. for everyone else - give it a shot and you might be pleasantly surprised.

												I enjoyed this game a lot, though not as much as I did the original. That may have been because it was new and unexpected 20 years ago and now I knew what was going on and what was going to happen. My review will be sort of colored by that.I think the atmosphere felt more sinister, tense, and mysterious in the original. This one doesn't carry the same weight it did. The graphics are terrific, but I think the very fact that they are so visible tends to make them less ominous. Some of the new puzzles are annoying, though they are not totally out of place. I still hate mazes in Adventure games, but this one can be forgiven because ALL adventure games had mazes back in the day (or it seemed so).The voice acting is very good and I enjoyed most of it. I can easily recommend this one very highly to people who have already played it and to those who haven't. I had a ball.			"

												Was not disappointed in this revamp of the best adventure game ever made. Made things better without making anything worse. Anyone complaining about movement delays and stiffness, must not play many point and click games, because they generally all run like this. This wasn't a big deal or very noticable. I though the loss of the original voice track would be bad but again wasn't even all that noticable and all the new voice actors did very well. Saw someone complain that the New Gabriel was just trying to sound like Tim Curry, but for one would you want the new Gabe to sound like the old Gabe, and two it's a Gabriel Knight voice not a Tim Curry voice. Tim Curry who is british was doing a Gabirel Knight voice for the original, same as the new actor.			"

												This is compltely dumbed down from the original! If a location isnt strictly neccessary to go to to solve a puzzle to progress to the next day it it locked to you, so you cant go to the drug store, the voodoo museum or gabriel's grandmas house on day 1 like you could originally. why?? having only a few small locations to explore at once just ruins the depth and immersion. The tape recorder has been replaced with a hint ridden journal even with hints off, and it even highlights dialogue choices to tell you want to say to proceed! The only thing thats better in this version is the music.  Still play the original agan which can still be had legally from www.gog.com "

												When I was growing up, I kept playing SOL-games. My father loved them so he kept purchasing new titles as they came out. I thoroughly loved all of Larry, Police Quest, Kings Quest, Quest for Glory and Conquests. When Gabriel Knight hit the shelves, I was hooked. Never have I been so immersed in a story, or so hooked on an adventure-game. I hold the original as one of the top games I have ever played, regardless of genre. Naturally I was psyched when I learned about the anniversary-remake, but had mixed feelings. The last thing I wanted to do was to taint my precious memories. I feel they did everything right. The kept to the original as much as possible, whith a few twists and added puzzles here and there, but nothing that ruined the pace of the game. This was a worthy remake. Graphics and music included. The Gabriel Knight theme still, to this day, give me chills and goosebumps. This game is recommended both for returning oldies like myself and new ones that are used to much more updated graphics than the one from the 90's.			"

												Ahhh.....Gabriel Knight. One of my favorite games of the 90s and definitely one of Sierra's best games. Gabriel Knight is a novelist and owner of St. George's Rare Books in New Orleans. He's in the middle of writing a new book about the recent string of Voodoo related murders. The writer, Jane Jensen of Sierra fame, did a particularly good job of representing the city of New Orleans and it's vibrant history, and the story itself still holds up well after 20+ years.It was a little disappointing that they couldn't get Tim Curry to reprise his role as the voice of Gabriel, but I'm sure he was a little too expensive for Pinkerton Road to even consider, let alone the likes of Mark Hamill and Michael Dorn. The actor they got to voice Gabriel in the remake did a commendable job and kept the original style of southern charmer and womanizer, and a few chuckles can be found by using the hand and eye icons on most of the female characters in the game. While the 3D rendering of the remake brings new life to the game(and it is beautiful), it's a little disappointing to an old school gamer like myself. See, back in the day, adventure games were much more complex and unforgiving. The high resolution textures take the challenge away of having to find a tiny object in the sea of 256 color pixelation of the original. The puzzles are challenging and require that you pay attention to the information you're gathering from extensive conversations with the various characters in the game. You can't just fumble through this one. if you try, you'll likely be backktracking often or finding yourself using a walkthrough (anyone else remember old Sierra hint books?) to use a walkthrough in later parts of the game. Fortunately for me, I played through this game several times and actually remembered much of what was required to have the game move forward. If you want to see where the great adventure games of today got their inspiration from, buy this game and support Jane Jensen's new operation. Then maybe one day the Sierra of old shall return. Nah...scratch that. Just stay small and independent and avoid those buyouts so you can continue to breath new life into the genre.Now Steam just needs to release Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within, but not a remake. It's perfect just the way it is.			"

												This is a solid and enjoyable adventure game and the remastering of a classic. It's interesting, beautiful and a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to fans of the original as well as new players.People seem to be a bit consumed by nostalgia and were ready to rip into this new version, but the negative feedback is without ground at times. The voice acting is much improved over the original, especially the awful Tim Curry with his broken-down accent. Scenes are beautiful, and although the composition is problematic at times, it doesn't really detract from the experience.There are some glitches, but they are minor.			"

												Despite being a huge Sierra On-Line fan, I'll admit that I didn't know about the Gabriel Knight series until Jane Jensen's Kickstarter in 2012. After buying the trilogy and playing them for the first time during the campaign I instantly fell in love with the Schattenjager legacy. The combination of the point-and-click interface that I enjoyed and the dark supernatural leanings in each of Knight's cases made me wish that I came across them during their initial run. The stories and atmosphere were perfect for a horror fan such as myself and to find out that ""Mystery Game X"" (as it was known back then) was another game in the series (albeit a remake of the first one) made me happy. And this game still holds true to the original in every way with an updated interface and a facelift worthy to be called a Jane Jensen title.			"

												I missed out on a lot of classic adventure games by not returning to PC gaming until the late 90s. The Gabriel Knight series was one that I missed completely, which makes me doubly thankful for remake efforts such as this. Through a fresh layer of polish, it's very clear to see why Gabriel and his cohorts were so widely acclaimed in the genre. However, it's also clear that this remake might not be the best way to experience the series.Gabriel Knight, if you've never met him, is a bookseller and aspiring novelist in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He's a listless Lothario, a fact that his charming assistant Grace and punchy police pal Mosely are not hesitant to harp on. Despite his appearances he soon becomes entangled in a murder investigation that leads into the darkest corners of New Orleans, where voodoo and ancient curses hold sway. There's an interesting mix of historical and kitschy voodoo to delve into, which helps give the game a more grounded feel even when things start getting crazy.Unraveling this mystery is done in the grand old tradition of classic point-and-click adventures. You can travel by map to a number of hotspots around the city, each with features to examine, items to pocket, and colorful characters to question. It's important to note, though, that this being a traditional adventure means there's some antiquated design to contend with. Puzzles are logical and items have real-world uses, for the most part, but identifying exactly where or when to do something isn't always clear. In fact there are more than a few points where you'll find yourself wandering aimlessly because you need to stumble across an unforeseen event to progress. The remake does try to punch up the gameplay past traditional pace, though. There's not a lot of clutter in these scenes so important elements are usually easy to pick out, and dialog options that move the plot forward are highlighted for uncultured knuckle-draggers who don't want to bask in the game's fully-voiced dialog.I'll be honest, I wasn't sold on the voice acting at first. It's a big deal for Gabriel Knight; even without playing any of the originals myself I was aware that the cast was remarkable. Whereas OG Gabriel was voiced by Tim Curry, remake Gabriel is someone I've never heard of, who effects a ridiculously thick Louisiana accent for every line. But it wasn't long before he and the rest of the cast grew on me, assisted by the excellent script. Grace gets some vicious burns on Gabe throughout the game, Mosely pals around like a dopey high-schooler, and even some of the minor characters like Hartridge get incredibly memorable lines.Between the entertaining dialog and the gripping story that steadily builds in intensity, there's plenty of reason to work your way through the old-school puzzles. However, the remake is marred in a few ways that sometimes make it feel like a step even further back. The 3D models for characters are attractive but suffer from stiff animations, making them look more like Sims than people. You'll also spot a number of glaring (and sometimes hilarious) bugs like heads spinning like tops and torsos contorting wildly. In dialogue both parties get animated portraits that are detailed, but move like rigged portraits... the effect is a little creepy and reminds me of the Begun of Tigtone, if you've seen that. You can skip dialogue by clicking but sometimes it only drops the voices, and continues animating silently. And if all that wasn't enough, the thing has crashed on me a few times during long play sessions.The bottom line is that Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers is an excellent game that isn't particularly well-served by this remake. And it isn't in the ways you might expect, because the new voiceovers are great in their own way and the modern amenities really do help with the pacing. No, it's just a technically weak product, beset by rough animations, visual glitches galore, and general instability. You absolutely should experience the game for its story, its moments of horror, and its contributions to the adventure genre. But as long as you're not put off by pixel art and slower pacing, you might just be better off with the original.			"

												I would recommend you not to read too much about the game. Play the demo first, it's a good representation.If you, after completing the demo find the game interesting and, want to continue your experience I would suggest that you back up your saves, before the purchase, because Steam will just delete it all upon installation of the full game.I was a bit sceptical about the game at first, especially in regards to the new boy'ish look of Gabriel Knight and this silly southern voice that is being used, but also in regard to the changes of design. It took me awhile to get past that change and I was just barely ahead of it at the end of the demo. Truth be told I was never really a fan of the GK series even though I tried my hand with all them in their own time with a declining interest, that was completely gone after five minutes with GK3. I generally despised the Sierra Adventure games, because they were so dull, traditionally old-school and unforgiving somehow compared to the humorous and creative Lucasarts Adventure games I loved. I am glad to see that Pinkerton Studios have gotten a much better hold on the game engine that severely scarred the previous Mobius game. Gone are the wandering eyes and jittery animations.. There is still a few minor flaws, but much less than before. There is also lip-syncing and it works surprisingly well. I read quite a lot of reviews about the game, the good, bad and ugly, because I was a bit lukewarm about GK, but I was curious and played the demo first and even though this new version isn't quite the same high-caliber version as the original it's not a bad game, not a bad game at all, but it's clearly not a total remastery of the old game, since they've changed the voice actors. Even though I was quite resentful of the voice of Gabriel Knight in the beginning it kind of grew on me and the accent is also more downplayed as the game goes on. The rest of the voice cast is pretty decent. My only real complaint about the game is the background Music - it's bloody horrible and totally out of place with the spirit of the game unlike the game music during cutscenes which is very well done. I was about ready to quit before the demo even got started, because of it, but I hit a key to skip the intro credits and turn off the music, which saved the day. There is a new hint system in the game, but unfortunately it's neither very intelligent nor progress based. The few times I needed it I was way ahead of the hint system and had to wait for the hints to catch up to my point of progress, because of build-in timer, that I assume has been put in place to avoid that you spoil yourself too much and even then it was extremely rare that it was useful at all. At one point it was completely useless and I had to Google for a solution, because I got a bit ahead of myself and was unable to pick up on a vital clue on how to unlock an important puzzle. There were times when I was a bit lost about my next move, because the game is a bit short of a narrative and there is a certain amount of things that you need to solve before the day ends, which isn't very clear, but the first hint of each day usually give you a list of to-do's of the day. I do not recommend using the hint system at all, because the game is actually quite short. I saw a reviewer complaining about the same animations being played every time you leave an area, but that's kind of a silly point, because you can use fast-travel everywhere. You don't have to leave any area by going to an exit point at all, because you can bring up the map at any point, which is really nice, but unfortunately Gabriel Knights current location isn't highlighted on the map at all.. Sometimes I went to places where I was already.. The same teleportation system in Mobius has transferred to GK1 as well, but there are times when you need someone to follow you that it backfires. There is still a bit of the old ghost of Sierra's unforgiving gameplay present, but the good news is that there has been added a RETRY option for those special events. I finished the game in 15 hours and I am actually a bit surprised that I had a such a good time with it. Jane Jensen was a much better writer twenty years ago, but she also had a co-writer on GK1, and that part still stands.

												Fantastic remake of the original with a strong sense of what made the original so great. The rework of the graphics and attention to detail makes this a must buy for anyone who played the original. There's obviously some caveats - as an example the voice acting wasn't remastered so the voices aren't the same as you'd remember them due to new voice actors. Everything is well within reason though and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games at all. The story still lives up to what I remembered 20 years ago which is amazing.			"

												Its one of the best adventure games I've ever played (and I've played my fair share of adventures). Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to play the original Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20 years back but this edition is really amazing!!Buy it without second thought. The atmosphere, graphs, characters, sounds, everything is amazing while still retaining the old ""golden age"" feeling. Highly recommended.			"

												Gabriel Knight, in all his chauvanistic and cheesy glory, returns in this 20th Anniversary Edition of Sins of the Fathers.  Since adventure games are having something of a reinassance these last few years, I was hoping one of my old favorites would survive the remake transition.  This return to New Orleans is not without its charm and the gameplay system has welcome hint integration, but the overall execution is lacking.The biggest issue stems from the new voice cast.  Since CD games were a fresh novelty in the early '90s some ringers from stage and cinema hopped onboard to see what the fuss was about.  This resulted in an interesting mix of seriocomic vocal perormances from the likes of Tim Curry and Mark Hamill.  The voices in the remake turn the cheese factor up considerably to the point where it detracts from the tension built into the dialogue.  The laughs from the original came from a welcome break in the tension, not because Gabriel's accent sounds like a awkward college student pretending to be someone else.The character models are also a bit off.  Their movements are really stilted, coming across more as PSX-era Clock Tower quality animations.  They don't fare much better up close as each portrait looks like they've got a constant case of the jitters.  Yes, people don't stand perfectly still when they talk, but they also don't have minor convulsions like they all had the same strong espresso in the morning.  No one's eyes line up when they speak, heightening the disconnect from the characters and scenario.  One of the things I loved about the original was the way the conversation switched to the two characters having a dialogue straight into the player's eyeline from the monitor to engage them in conversation.Jane Jensen's story still works great, and while Gabriel Knight is even more of a anachronistic character than he was when he debuted, is still charming enough to guide through the story.  Gameplay-wise, there are additions positive and negative to the core adventure system.  In the big positive corner is a hint book that runs alongside the game and disperses guidance as the player needs, providing more specific solutions depending on the scenario.  It's not perfect, and there are some notable glitches with what actions go where toward the end of the game, but it's a nice way to integrate appreciation for adventure gamer's of all skill levels.  Less effective is how the player can now hit Space Bar to put a text box over everything that can be interacted with on any given screen.  For pixel hunts it's a godsend, for screens where there is just a lot of flavor dialogue to peruse it's a nightmare.  It transforms the pleasing background environments into a text adventure and disrupts more of the careful flow.Overall it wasn't worth the price of admission.  It's not bad, just buffed to near-perfection in some areas and left lackluster in the rest.			"

												Absolutely gorgeous, this game is a faithful retelling of the 1993 Sierra adventure game of the same name.  The sound quality is stellar, the music has been brushed up and is still just as great as it was back in the day.  The art...  Now there's an area in which they delivered.  The colors are gorgeous, and the cutscene have genuine flavor.  The writing still holds up and the characters are still quite endearing.  I cannot recommend this game enough if you are an adventure game fan.  It's a classic and with this 20th edition, it endures.			"

												The first seconds of the game i thought that nothing beats the original. For starters , Gabriel's voice is not very good but you're getting used to during the game along with all the other voices who are also rerecorded with new voice actors .But as i played through the game i could't help but immerse into the stunning world of 1993 New Orleans which is so wonderfully portrayed in this remake. Jane Jensen not only did remake the original GK, she made it better in every way . The graphics are incredibly beautifull , the 3d models needed a little extra work but its not something that even remotely bothers, the locations are incredible the least i can say. The gameplay is totaly reworked adding minigames to enhance the gaming experience and to help the plot develop smoothier than the original. Only few can be said about the music which is a key element to the atmosphere of the GK and in my humble opinion Robert Holmes's score delivers. The passion and the colouring of the soundtrack is something that other adventure companies can take lessons from. On the other hand a few bugs kinda spoil the whole experience (most of them are fixed now) but nothing can stop the remake of GK to mark a new benchmark on how an andventure should be made and yes it may be a wonderfull apetizer for a 4th installment of the series.

												Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Father has such a fantastic dectective noir story that this was always worthy of a remake in my mind.The remake has solid voice acting, a few additonal puzzles (some welcome, others not so much.)If you never played the original then I reccomened this version fully, Jane Jenson worked on this remake and she was able to fix many issues the original game had. A few game killing bugs and oversights finally worked into the fail states they were supposed to be. It's funny, genuinely scary at times and is a hell of a rewarding puzzler. It all links together, every detail of the cases you uncover feels rewarding and making progress can become addicitive to see what happens next. The game is set in old New Orleans (some of these landmarks have been destroyed since Hurricane Katrina) where Gabriel is helping his friend who is a Cop investigate local Voodoo murders. For new adventure gamers this is a required history lesson as it's one of the greatest ever made and the story stands up strong today. Some of the suggestive dialogue (regarding Gabriels sexlife) are to this day still taboo compared to other games. Fully Reccomended.			"

												Best.Adventure.Game.Ever.This game held true to the original in everyway.  The new interface took sometime to getting use to if you've played the original.  If you haven't played the original, you've missed out on one the GREATEST games of all time.  To those new to the GK series, I HIGHLY recommend this title, you'll be introduced to a story you'll never forget.  Afterwards, I suggest you get the 1993 original masterpiece.The voice overs were very good overall and some could have used some touch and empashis, but it's hardly a negative in comparsion to the original.I am glad Jane Jensen brought this title back to light, it gives me hope that a Gabriel Knight IV will come to us long awaited fans.Why are you still reading this review?

Posted: July 14, 2016
												I was afraid something like this would happen when playing a 20th anniversary edition... Gabriel Knight: Sins of the fathers was the first adventure from Gabriel (the Shadowhunter) in 1993 and the first game created by Jane Jensen.At the time it was a fantastic game, it was one of the first games to include a dark subject, not exactly suited for kids, not because of the violence or blood (that was something that other games always had) but also because of the dark, dramatic, almost ghotic nature of the main story and characters. Something different at the time (and still to this day) was the research that jane did for these games, mixing historical facts, real places,  with of course a good dose of fiction to create her own story, and not just an historical retelling. It was always fun (and amazing) to go looking for these places after finishing the game, and see how much of the real world was put into the story. For me the most amazing story of all that jane had created was the one for Gabriel Knight: the Beast within, the second game, about the legend of king Ludwig II and Richard Wagner.This game, Sins of the fathers, was the first story of the series, and has all the great elements that were expanded in the later adventures of Gabriel. The 20th anniversary edition keeps this story , but at the same time tries to update the game engine, the graphics, sound and even some gameplay elements to make it more accesible to the current generation of gamers...This is one review where i'm having a difficult time with the steam system for reviews...you can't always either recommend or don't recommend a game...there are gray areas...and to recommend a game is not the same as liking a game...In this case, for Gabriel Knight, i will say that i like the game, meaning, i like the original game back when i played it 20 years ago and what it meant to me and to players at the time it camed out... That same game (the story) is still here in this 20th anniversary ed, and i'm glad i have a version compatible with current systems and accesible online (installing the old CD version is a pain...) But...aside from that, to be honest this new version is... while it looks better than the original that camed out in 1993 (of course!)...the one from 1993 was more polished and had greater graphics and sound (for that time) and this version from 2014 actually has worst graphics (for a 2014 game). So the problem here is that, what the creators of the game tried to do was (i think) do a new version with updates that make it more appealing to ""current generation"" of gamers but at the same time not changing too much and keep enough things to still make it appealing to the ""old generation"" of gamers that played the game in 1993...and the result is one game that it's not really appealing to either one of them... The graphics for this version are updated of course, they are better than 1993, but they are pretty bad for a 2014 game, and even though they are noticeable improved from the previous game of the company (Moebius) they still have several problems: the animation itself is low quality, badly animated and there are bugs like the spinning head problem (where a character in game starts spinning the head like a possesed doll) and it happens all the time, also the characters appears and dissappear when closing a door or leaving a room..the backgrounds for the game are nice...and just that, but they are far from scary or moody or anything, they simply are sterile.... The characters closeup portraits are fare better in comparison, but honestly the 2014 Gabriel version... (the most important character) seems more like a teens pop star than a shadow hunter. His hair still has that 1990s volume that was so common back in the day... but now by today standards it just seems wrong (and funny!)... that's precisely one of the things that has to be changed in 2014 if you want your character to be taken seriously...the dialogues....and the voice actors...the dialogues are too much for a 2014 game....meaning too much lines of everything...yeah...for me it was interesting to have all (or most) of the original dialogues...as a collection curiosity...but for 2014 is overkill, (even if the important dialogues are being colored in yellow) the world has changed, people has shorter attention span, and also the way stories are presented today has changed...it's not worst, it's just different, you can still put a big story like the one from Gabriel Knight in 2014, you just have to make some changes to make the thing work...it's not about caring or not caring for the original game, it is about making something that has better flow of narrative, (and again, you are trying to make a new game that will appeal to current gamers) About the new voice casting, they are doing a fine job at that...but it's not at the level of the original cast of 1993 with Tim curry, Mark Hamill and Leah Remini. Of course it would be impossible to get the original actors for different reasons (too expensive!) and also the low quality recordings (as for using the original material) so it's no surprise there but that's one thing you have to consider if trying to redo the original game...The only ""updated"" element that i think is actually better on this version, is the music, wich is done almost all over again by the original composer/producer of the game, Robert Holmes, and it is great, even if it just sticks to the original themes, it does show and advantage over the old version and it sounds great.So my review for Gabriel Knight is that, i like the game, because of the original one that i played in the 90s, the story is still there, but i don't recommend the game because i don't see this being interesting in 2014. The problem is if you are going to do a new version of an old game...you have to make it attractive for 2014... and make all the necessary changes...yeah...the fans are gonna be mad...well, this is not for the fans, a new version is for the new players.As it is, this version is only appealing to the original players of the series, like myself, but no so much to current generation. If you are doing it for the original players of the game only, then just make minimal changes, update only the things that can be updated without changing the core of the original, the things that make the game be what it is (like the Another World 20th anniversary ed wich is nice) and be clear that you are making a product that its more an historical piece of gaming than a ""new game"" wich it isn't.I know by now many people that love the game must hate me, but i will say that, there's no point in redoing and old game from another era if there's no possibility of doing it right... The translation from 1993 to 2014 in this case, and for different technical/artistic reasons had many elements lost in the process (or changed for worst), and i very much prefer to see a new game by jane jensen and a new story than a 20th anniversary edition....N/A			"

Do That VoodooAs  a gamer who's  had plenty dealings with the Voodoo Lady in the Monkey Island franchise and  toyed with a Voodoo doll in The Sims 4, I've decided that I know a thing or two about Voodoo.I've also seen the movie ""Weekend at Bernies 2"" more than a few times, so that surely makes me an authority on the subject....It's armed with this Voodoo expertise that I approach the 20th Anniversary Edition of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers.That You Do So WellIf you've read some of my other reviews, you'll know that I'm always up for a little time travel, and this review is no different, well maybe a little different...Instead of jumping into the review-well Delorean, this time we're going to dance around a fire whilst holding a python and rattling some chicken bones.There's a slip of paper burning in the fire, you see 1993 written on it as is smoulders and burns.Look into the flames and see the past.Gabriels BeginningJurassic  Park is breaking records in the movie theatres, Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" echoes around bedrooms across the land and Tim ""The Tool-Man"" Taylor struggles with his home improvements on TV.More importantly, point and click aficionados are enjoying Gabriel Knight: The Sins of the Fathers.An adventure game that introduces us to Gabriel, struggling novelist, bookshop owner and supernatural investigator all rolled into one.This charismatic ladies man will go on to spawn two more titles in the series and later, a re-mastered version of the game which saw his invention.... which leads us back nicely to this little review.Sleepless in .... New OrleansThe game opens with Gabriel emerging into his book shop, the Saint Georges book store,  following a restless nights sleep.He's being plagued by nightmares which might have something to do with the fact that he is investigating a spate of ""Voodoo murders"" for a new book.From here, you'll begin your journey around New Orleans and then further afield as you research the Murders and uncover secrets about your own mysterious past.Point & QuipThis is a point and click adventure in its purest form.There are a multitude of items you can click on at each location, all of which will invoke some sort of response, either from Gabriel himself or from ""the narrator"" (Who I'm convinced is the Voodoo Lady from the  Monkey Island games that I mentioned earlier.)Just looking around, exploring the environment can be entertaining in its own right. Click on a book in Gabriels shop for instance  and  ""Mrs Monkey Island Voodoo Lady"" will comment ""The books have been chosen for their special  appeal.... in other words nothing written by Gabriel""Whether these quips make you roll your eyes or chuckle out loud they definitely make exploring each scene fun and interesting.Cajun TwangSins of the Fathers is a ""Full Talky"" and I'm happy to report that the voice work is competently done with more suitably colourful accents than you could shake a deep fried chicken on a stick at.All this would mean nothing without snappily written dialogue and the writing here is sharper than the spines of a Mississippi cat fish.It's not Vanity if it's TrueSins of the fathers graphics have also had a major overhaul. They're crisp and colourful and I'm sure Gabriel himself would tell you he's never looked so good.The animations are smoother than the Bourbon at Mardi Gras and interface is clean and intuitive.Stuck in the BayouOf course underpinning all the prettiness is the same classic game we all loved back in the 90's.As such it's a fairly long game when compared to todays standards, you'll have clocked up around  15 hours of game play by the time the end credits roll, so getting your monies worth out of this title isn't in question.You should also keep in mind that Sins of the Fathers  puzzles don't pull any punches, you are going to get stuck from time to time, this is an adventure from a period when ""men were men, women were women and puzzles were hard"".Moving the story forward is always more than enough reward for the perseverance required.The main story arc, the characters, the New Orleans setting, each element complements the other creating an absorbing and highly entertaining point and click adventure.Voodoo MagicI've thoroughly enjoyed my time revisiting Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it's left me with a hunger for more and I sincerely hope that ""GK2: The Beast Within"" and ""GK3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" get their much deserved HD makeovers too.If you weren't lucky enough (or old enough) to play the original Sins of the Fathers  there's never been a better time to get to know Gabriel Knight in all his HD glory.If you were around for the original and remember it fondly (as I do) then I'm happy to say that this is a re-master done the right way.St George's book store is open...You really can go home again.( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )			"

												A remake of a 1993 point and click murder mystery game, this game combines classic old-school point and click adventure gameplay with a black sense of humour, a compelling story, and our hero trying to get it on with his employee. It doesn’t work out. Seriously.It has all the hallmarks of a good remake, and we recommend it.

												- technically the biggest concern are the animations - very stiff and slow, especially there is a delay when starting moving gabriel around - also skipping dialogues sometimes is done in fast forward skipping the next sentences as well, this can really use a patch-The voice Actor for Gabriel Knight appears too be tring too mimic tim curry- Non of the Orginal Voice actors no Mark Hamil, Tim Curry-The Character Redisigns are pretty bad not ugly, Inferior to the extremly detailed artwork of the Orginal-All the diolague is the same this would be a good thing but hereing the same exact diolague it gets pretty boring and outdated-The Comic Book Cutscenes are distracting and sometimes pop out of nowhere+Simply a Beautfull game faithfull till the end+Possible chance for a offical Gabriel Knight 4 now+A new way of intruducing a classic to the new generation+Some of the Voice are truly great+Classic puzzles return or have a new twist to them+Music though the exactly the same from the orginal , all have awsome rearrangements+Mimes			"

												For all intents and purposes, this is an excellent remake of a great game. A true gem among them.The graphics are great, the overall gameplay and not to mention the remastered soundtrack. I absolutely love it all, except for one thing, and one thing only:What the actual fudge is wrong with Gabriel's voiceactor? Seriously? He sounds like an old drunkard on prozac, attempting to be Tim Curry, completely failing and totally crashes and burns on impact. WHY, oh why would you attempt on a Tim Curry-impression and getting away with it turning out as bad as this? Jeez. *facepalm*Don't get me wrong, I totally recommend playing this game both if you've never, ever played it and if you, like me, spent hours on end playing the original. It's totally worth cringing each time you hear Gabriel speak XD			"

												Man, 1993 has never looked so good.  Being a fan of the original game, I just had to buy this re-mastered edition.  For the most part, this game delivers promises in spades.  The graphics look good, the music is as brooding as I can remember, and the story is just as engaging as I can remember.  If I had to pick a complaint, it would be that the voice acting isn't quite as good as the original.  I just can't get behind this Gabriel as much as Tim Curry's Gabriel.  Then again, I certainly realize that those voice actors would cost quite a bit and undoubtedly don't sound the same. With that said, if you're a fan of the original I strongly recommend you check this version out.  If you played the original when it came out, then prepare to enjoy a bit of nostalgia, and then feel old. "

												I remember pre-ordering the original Gabriel Knight 20 years ago or more.  I loved it and this remake is absolutely great.  It's not perfect, but it's definitely worthwhile to play either for nostalgic purposes or if this is your first time.  Gabriel Knight is investigating voodoo murders occurring in New Orleans with his friend Moseley who works for the police.  Gabriel is working on a book about the occult.  However, it turns out that the occult is much more real than he had imagined.  You follow Gabriel, Moseley, and many other wonderful characters from New Orleans to other places around the world.  The story is top notch and still holds very well in today's world of entertainment.Here's what I didn't like about it.  It is an EXACT replica of the original, but with enhanced sound, graphics, and new voices (which some will gripe about).  This means that the very ridiculously tough puzzles such as knowing exactly what to play on the rada drums at the end of the game still persist.  I wish they had remastered it, but with enhancements to the issues it had.  There are many graphical glitches, though not too serious.  Overall, a wonderful experience though.  Proves that adventure gaming is definitely not dead, it just needs a great storyline to go along with the rest of the game to make it in today's market.			"

The music and graphics are now in higher definition yet you get to experience the same classic story and gameplay which originally came out more than 20 years ago.

												23 years on, this one still got the best story I've ever seen in a game. It's amazing how a well written plot can bring you much better sense of immersion than a triple A all budgeted horror game that relies on jump scares and hordes of enemies. Nowadays the best stories I've seen are usually on indie games, but none of them as good as this one by Jane Jensen.			"

												As a big fan of the original series, this game was like greeting an old friend again. Everything is faithfully recreated, but it's also extremely approachable for any fan of adventure gaming in general. The story is top-notch, comparable to a very good novel. What I liked is that they balanced out the activities in each of the days, so that each day you have a clear set of objectives and a few side objectives. The voice acting is solid but admittedly not as exciting as the first game which featured heavyweight voice talents like Tim Curry, Mark Hamill and Leah Remini (before she was famous!). For people who have played prior games from Pinkerton (Moebius) or Phoenix (Cognition), this game shows some progression by the development team. The animations are now done using motion-capture so they are not as offensive as the ones from those games. The engine is still not quite as good as the old Sierra engine was, and responsiveness can be a bit slow as times. But overall it is not a major distraction.This is the best way to jump into the series at this point, and to relive a piece of gaming history. Highly recommend, can't go wrong with this game if you have any love of engaging stories, crime solving, supernatural and history - this is the game for you.			"

												The Gabriel Knight series has always been one of my favorites. This anniversary edition is fantastic because I'm seeing the game with all new eyes. I didn't feel like I was playing a new game most of the decisions, layouts and cut scenes were identical (with updated graphics), but there are a few suprises for old players. I will admit that I had to use the hint system a couple of times as I got lost but even the hint system is well setup with leveled hints to point you in the right direction instead of just telling you what to do. One fun item in this version is the star button at the bottom of this screen. At any time you can click the star to see interviews, drawings and storyboards from the orignal version in 1993 and the current version.  Highly recommend even if you've already played the original. Maybe they will do anniversary additions of the other two games :) or a whole new game! Fans can only hope.			"

												ok so its the original game (which had a huge impact on my early gamer life) but updated. but while it is OK it is not greatly implemented- animations are wooden and sometimes characters move along weird paths- sometimes you cannot move Gabriel out of the way unless you go look at something else- The UI is inconsistent - for example one action on people almost always returns 'that doesnt work that way' implying its not a person interaction option, but then it does work.- clicking doors automatically enters them whereas elsewhere gives you an action choice. this can lead to the story advancing before you have finished an area.- sometimes you have to sit through a repeated animation because the character ends a discussion, but they have no knowledge of you when you restart the conversation for the next option.- the map icon is too close to the inventory icon and if you click it you leave the current scene and have to travel back - you can't just cancel out of the map- when you click to advance dialog you sometimes have to wait until the voice has finished even though you cannot hear it anymorejust lots of stuff like this which gets annoying.

A big call i know, but its really that good - specifically how the story of vodoo and Gabriels family past as a 'shattenjagger' unfolds, and then how this plays out through GK2 and GK3 Also it was the first games to make me intersted in a real life place, New Orleans - i cant wait to go there one day and visit the locations within the game one day. Lastly this remake is a must for any fan of the original to see the new art / locations and sounds, just to hear the Jane Jensen interview within the game - my first and last video game dev crush.   ;)Thank you to the devs & Sierra for remaking this classic game!

												Remake of the of one of the most iconic Sierra Online adventure games.  To those who haven't had the chance to play the original 1993 game, the anniversary edition offers rich and captivating story and interesting puzzles in fairly current graphics cloth. To those who played the original, the remake may prove to be a dissapointing experience as a lot of the original charm has been lost in the translation to the contemporary cloth and may be better off to setting up the game from original cd-rom in dosbox.  GOOD:Excellent story woven into a detailed and captivating background of voodoo, mystery, murder and horror which is just as good today as it had been in 1993, when it first came out. Interesting puzzles and great dialogueBAD: Conversion from original 2D to 3D is bit underwhelming. While technically there's nothing much complain, the 3D reimagination lacks stylization and atmosphere of the original. As a result, the 3D art feels very sterile and soul-less, as if it had been entirely outsourced to an external company moving mechanically through the motions, having very little involvement in what they had been building. Voiceover is well done and asides from a few kinks acceptable to the ear. Performances of individual actors are quite agreeable, but fail to fill the huge shoes of the original cast of Tim Curry, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Virginia Capers and others.  Particuarly the role of Gabriel performed by Tim Curry was so excellent that lack of it in the remake is quite off-putting. On a personal note, i'd much rather see a remake of GK3 which was really interesting story-wise but features horrible 3D graphics.			"

												I played the original back in the day (Still have the disc, too), and I can say the re-make is really on par with the original. The fade in and out scenes were part of the original game, and the added feature to just go to the map from the menu bar is a nice little feature. The added puzzles and how some events and items are re-arranged gives veteran players of the series a bit more of a challenge.The character portraits while speaking with characters was a feature of the original game. They could have been done a little better, but I am not going to go off on a tirade and say they are god awful. The voice acting, I can see what they were going for. They were trying to be as faithful to the original version of the game as possible. I appreciate the effort of the new voice actors, as they had to live up to high expectations.I have encountered a bug where I will pick up the envelope from the police station, and its contents disappear, along with anything else I picked up earlier (the hair-gel and the black shirt). I had to go back and re-play picking up all of these items and keep my fingers crossed that they stay in my inventory or show up on the day that they will be needed for.Aside from the bug and minor 3D problems (sometimes Gabriel's foot will go through the counter at St. George's Books, a minor irk) , the game is incredibly faithful to the original. The new puzzles are a welcome addition, and the cut-scenes appearing like a graphic novel are just beautiful. I recommend this game to those who play the original, or those who would like a trip back to 1993, when Adventure games were in their glory. "

												Okay, I have to admit to having played to death the original Gabriel Knight games, well at least the first 2, the third just never grabbed me due to a clumsy control system and ugly graphics, decent story though.The first game was one of those adventure gaming classics if you were, like me, of a certain age.  It was, and indeed still is a pretty dark game.  Bringing in ritualistic murder with voodoo trappings and a story of... ah, I won't spoil it.The major complaint some people had with the game before this remake was even made was that the original voice actors were not available.  Let's face it, 20 years on they probably wouldn't have sounded the same, though the first time I heard Gabes voice I tried not to think of Tim Curry and it was a bit jarring at first but either I quickly got used to it or his voice settled down.  Whoever replaced Charity James as Grace Nakimura did an admirable job though she doesn't quite have the snark.A nice touch is that in every scene you can look at an 'archive', like a production section and there are things like a comparison shot of the old version of the game with the new section, concept drawings, a few video interviews.The game interface is a little less clumsy than the original Sierra interface and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.  When talking to a character the close up portraits are nice, though I think Magentia Moonbean looks a bit younger than the game suggests.It's not perfection, there are certain characters you could visit freely before like Grandma that are only accessible after a certain day and a couple of silly little puzzles, but if you're an adventure fan I recommend this.

												Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition  is a faithful recreation of the original classic. It has the same great story with some added content (including one exceptionally reworked scene). It has the same great setting with colorful and moody environments.  It has the same great cast of characters with all new, and mostly well done, voice actors (yes I miss Curry and Hamill and Remini but these new guys are just fine).   Lastly this version has a far superior soundtrack in both quality and composition.If you have played the original you will enjoy this remake IF you can set your nostalgia aside and take this game for what it is instead of what you expect it should be.  There is truly a lot for fans of the original despite some of the game's more technical shortcomings.  I think newcomers will enjoy the game because all the elements that made the original are still here.While this game isn't without its flaws (some bugs, of which I only encounterd one once and it was a crash I never saw again) I attribute most of them to the Unity engine and how it works rather than any shortcoming of the developers.  The biggets issue is the 3D, where some animations can look awkward at times (especially when characters transition from one animation to another).All in all, I greatly enjoyed this remake and I think anyone who enjoys adventure games will enjoy this one as well whethe rthey played the original or not.

												There's a certain atmosphere present in the original game that is just... somehow lacking in this version. The character models and animations look like they were lifted straight out of the Sims, and a couple of the puzzles added in this remake just don't fit, even through ""Adventure Game Logic."" (For example, there's a very out-of-place sliding tile puzzle in the *spoiler redacted* library, and a completely nonsensical mechanical puzzle in *spoiler redacted*'s house). If I'd never played the original, I might think differently on that.That said, this is like comparing steaks; even though this game's New York Strip isn't quite comparable to the original's Filet Mignon, it's still a deliciously worthwhile $20 purchase both for fans and for those who've never played the original Gabriel Knight. The remastered music is absolutely aces, and many of the cutscenes that were rendered with the original in-game engine are now rendered in a fantastic animated graphic novel style that just OOZES awesome. The voice acting is pretty amazing too, with a couple of minor exceptions. There are also a couple of really creepy sequences that weren't present in the original game that caught me as a pleasant surprise.Overall: 8/10 (versus the original's 10/10)			"

												I grew up in the 80s and 90s. I remember being a teen and seeing all these adventure games at the computer store but I couldn't afford them and my familly's 286 had a monochrome screen and could not even come close to handling one of those games. 20+ years later though games were too dated for me to really want to play. It was nice to have this remake to revisit that era of gaming that I missed out on.Gabriel is very beautifully drawn and the story is excellent (minus a few inconsistencies and the fact that Gabriel has the emotional intellegence of a gerbal). The pacing of the game starts out PAINFULLY slow and uneventful but it really comes together and picks up quite nicelly after a third way through, making the truging through the beginning quite worth it. The puzzles in this game from pretty easy to vague and you have to be clair voyant to guess them but fortunately there are very few of those. I only found myself resorting to the inbuilt hints 3 or 6 times in my play through and usually just to nudge me in the right direction. Overall, I was quite happy with this game, was playing it compulsively around the end and would probably buy the sequels if Phenix Online ever remakes them.

												I first encountered Gabe's story back in the mid '90s, shortly after it came out, and I was hooked. Granted, Tim Curry playing a good ol' Cajun gent with the body of a 12-year old boy (in-game reference) was a little off-putting, but I've always been a fan of the 'So-bad-it's-good' school of doing things. The story was darker than most Sierra titles at the time, and I was immediately hooked. Sadly, the older that game got, the harder it was to run on progressively newer machines. But then, there were two. This new version is appropriately advanced in form and function. There are a few new puzzles, and entirely new voice cast. Rather than reinvent the wheel, the new cast attempts with differing levels of success, to emulate the original cast. I actually found Malia's VO to be fairly weak, and the Dragon soundd kinda 'eh', but all in all, it was a splendid auditory experience. The updates make sense, and I love what Jane and Co have done to give the game a richer, more vibrant NOLA feel. Robert Holmes' remastered soundtrack is awesome as ever, though I do miss the original St. George's theme. Except for a few weird bugs, my time playing the game (two consecutive playthroughs thusfar) has been largely very enjoyable. For fans of Sierra's old school adventure games, and/or fans of occult/horror adventure games, whether or not they are Sierra fans, this title should be a no-brainer. The puzzles are logic-based, but fairly simple, and the game will probably leave a lasting impression. It did for me. Many kudos to Jane Jensen and her team at Pinkerton Road, as well as Phoenix Studios for putting together such a delightful trip down memory lane.			"

												One of the best point and clicks ever made when first released and this update keeps the character of the original whilst adding some unintrusive 3d effects and modern textures.  Ok, admittedly it would have been nice to flick between old and new much like the Lucasarts updates of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2, but I can live with this very happily to bring back some memories.  Shame they dumped Tim Curry though, loved his Gabriel the first time round.  Now if only they could update the second one too and shove onto Steam as well (hell I'd take a decent steam dos box emulation as playing Gabriel on TV using the Link is awesome).Highly recommend to buy, especially those seeking something else to do other than enter a server for five seconds, get shot and then electronically tea-bagged by some random person contastly shouting ""n00b"" down teamspeak.

												I grew up in the 80s and 90s. I remember being a teen and seeing all these adventure games at the computer store but I couldn't afford them and my familly's 286 had a monochrome screen and could not even come close to handling one of those games. 20+ years later though games were too dated for me to really want to play. It was nice to have this remake to revisit that era of gaming that I missed out on.Gabriel is very beautifully drawn and the story is excellent (minus a few inconsistencies and the fact that Gabriel has the emotional intellegence of a gerbal). The pacing of the game starts out PAINFULLY slow and uneventful but it really comes together and picks up quite nicelly after a third way through, making the truging through the beginning quite worth it. The puzzles in this game from pretty easy to vague and you have to be clair voyant to guess them but fortunately there are very few of those. I only found myself resorting to the inbuilt hints 3 or 6 times in my play through and usually just to nudge me in the right direction. Overall, I was quite happy with this game, was playing it compulsively around the end and would probably buy the sequels if Phenix Online ever remakes them. May even by the original Sequels if they don't			"

Sadly, the 20th anniversary revamp introduces only partial UI glitz and a whole host of bugs.  With Steam offering the original as well, I'd whole heartedly recommend that instead.			"

												I highly recommend this game!Gabriel Knight: Sins of the father, a classic point and click adventure that was once Game of the year in 1994. The expectations for the remake were therefore big. Did it succeed in achieving glory this time too? In my opinion yes. :) Graphics don't make a game. We experienced gamers have had ample proof of that. So what is it, that this Gabriel Knight remake has which makes it so special? Charisma! And more importantly, a very good and well written story, that hasn’t lost the magic even after 20 years!What did I like?+ The story + The characters + The world + The point & click+ The humor+ The voice acting+ The puzzlesWhat did I dislike?- The blood- The mutilated animals- The difficulty of some puzzles- The short length- The linear storyIf you haven't played the original game, or any of the Gabriel Knight series (perhaps because you were too young...) you’ll find in this modern version the right mix of adventure, action, plot, interesting characters, and pretty looking pictures that might just make you fall in love (again) with point & click games. Don’t forget the horror, violence, blood, murder, snakes and mutilated bodies of people and animal alike.Yes, Gabriel Knight is not for the kiddies, that much is sure. Please also keep in mind that the main subject of the game is voodoo. If this is a theme that makes you uncomfortable or that you simply don’t like, look elsewhere for your adventure. ^^First thing that strikes me in the game, after the ‘fiery’ introduction, is the southern accent, yes you heard right. That drawl *giggles* NCIS New Orleans for the Win! :DApparently it is particularly effective on the ladies lol but I must say Gabriel’s male charm leaves me quite unmoved. But I guess it’s one of the reasons I like him, he makes me laugh :) that and his ‘relationship’ with Grace Nakimura! If you ever wanted to know about New Orleans (insert the proper accent here) this is the game for you! I loved getting to know so much history and culture about it, even if only through a specific angle. :D For that alone this is an unique game. ^^ The game focuses of course on the resolution of puzzles and a LOT of talking to NPCs. Both present their challenges. The puzzles can’t be simple nor too easy and thankfully aren’t, even if  the game is logical in how to get from A to B, however, it won’t provide any help on how to do so, it makes certain tasks rather frustrating at times. The game system will, however, give you hints on all pertinent things to do as well as force you to stay on the same day until you have accomplished them.  If you are in the habit of playing mystery or detective games or even just RPG games you’ll find that the story isn’t exactly challenging, it’s not full of twists and surprises, but the trip will still be worth it, at least it was in my book. :)I guess this game just touched a nostalgic chord in me, which accounts for my good opinion of it and made me want to play all Gabriel Knight games again. :P (which I shall hopefully be doing).All things said, this game is worth trying or replaying! :) If only to help make possible other remakes of this successful series :D If Gabriel Knight can’t charm you then you must be cold blooded like a snake. Get it? :P No? Play the game please. XDPlease keep in mind this is only my personal opinion.Kind regards,Keiyan			"

												I have been a fan of ""Gabriel Knight"" for a long time now: before buying the first two games this Autumn with the Steam sales, I had already finished the third one about thrice when I was like 15 years old.People could say it is a boring series nowadays and for some aspects I could agree: there's no actual action, it's a whole plain point-and-click. But the plots... they ALWAYS catch me and this one makes no exception! I think you could even learn something through it...Moreover, I love the fact you can save whenever you want.Totally recommended to the fans of noir and retrogames.			"

												90s classic point-n-click adventure brought back to life with lots of love and lack of budget. First hour of my playthrough was almost painful and I felt close to a rage-quit after the mime puzzle. However, story and characters kept me engaged and in a couple of hours I was deeply in love with this game. I barely remember original Gabriel Knight, but remake feels very precise, sometimes even too precise - some jokes and themes from 1993 look a bit weird in 2017. However, it is a great way to experience one of the best golden age adventure games almost as it was, disregarding visual polish. Animations and voiceovers look and sound terrible sometimes, though. But there is some kind of magic that keeps you interested and deeply connected to the story and characters. I would definitely love to see other games from the series remade and hope this will happen some day.			"

I know adventure games have gone the way of the Do-Do bird because of frustating mechanics and the over all lack of patience gamers have today, but this is a truly lost unique art form.  I also sincerely hope that someway somehow she finds a path to continue the saga.  Even if it were just 1 more... I'd happily pre-pay as I imagine many would to get the ball rolling.

When you skip lines of dialog, the game actually fast forwards in time and that glitches out and sometimes gets stuck.  The developers have said that they will fix it in the next patch.  I hope, hope, hope that Jane Jensen will put out another Gabriel Knight in this EXACT format.  This game was a nearly flawless execution, so I hope that the developer will not stray on future releases.			"

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition is a bit of a mixed bag.The good- High resolution backgrounds- High polygon characters- Rerecorded sound track- Built in hint system- Behind the scenes feature (sketches, interviews etc.)The bad- Still some (very) obscure puzzles- Characters move like marionettes- New voice actors not as good as the original onesYou should get hold of a copy of the original (you can get it here on Steam as well) since it has a truly great voice cast with Tim Curry as Gabriel, Mark Hamill as his friend Moseley, Efraim Zimbalist Jr. as Wolfgang Ritter, Micheal Dorn as Dr. John, Virginia Capers (AKA grandma Huxtable) as the narrator and Leah Remini as Grace Nakimura. Even the voice cast of some of the minor characters is worth mentioning (like Jim Cummings). The new voice cast is okay, but nowhere near the level of that of the original game.The ugly- Many glitched animations. On several occasions I've seen Gabriels upper torso or head spinning around in a way that reminded me of the Exorcist. At several occasions seated characters are suddenly (partly) standing up before continuing their conversation. The butler of Malia Gedde can be seen briefly standing before the door each time he has closed it. And at one time I was looking out of the window in Mosely's office and clicked on the door to leave the room. Only to see Gabriel standing up from an invisible chair (without sitting down first), moon-walking to the door and spinning once round his axis before leaving the room. It never interfered with the game but these glitches should've been removed before release.- Musicians in the parkAnother thing that bothered me were the guys playing the banjo and electric guitar in the park. Neither of them is using a shoulder strap. I know from experience it's impossible to play either a classic guitar or a electric guitar while standing up without one and I think it's safe to assume that's also true for playing a banjo. Even worse the electric guitar IS NOT PLUGGED INTO AN AMPLIFIER!. An electric guitar that's not plugged in will make less noise than one of those cheap plastic kid guitars. Someone should have noticed this and replaced it with an acoustic guitar. ConclusionIt's worth buying, especially when it's on sale. But it's got some issues that I think you should be aware of. And it's not a worthy replacement of the original since the original voice cast isn't reused.			"

												The original version of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is one of my most favourite video games of all time and I bought the 20th Anniversary Edition expecting it to miss the very high standards I would hold it to.  I wasn't wrong.The remake is competent enough.  Many of the visuals - which is the key thing the remake has been sold on - are very pretty and the cutscenes in particular are excellent (though I would have liked a way to disable the speech balloons).  The voice acting is solid and, once I got used to the new voices, very much enjoyed them,  The story and characters still hold up while - for the most part - the puzzles are not too obtuse.  There are some animation issues and the quality of the backgrounds is not always consistent (I really don't like Jackson Square at all) but I didn't find these things too problematic.  So if you enjoy adventure games and have never played the original, then I suspect you will find the game worth the price of entry.But if you *have* played the original game I'd suggest caution, for at least in my case the remake does not improve upon it and, in fact, is inferior in several ways.  Critical here are the visuals.  While the original game managed to produce a mood perfect for the story through its dark backgrounds and strong use of contrast, the brightness and colour of the backgrounds in the remake fail to do the same.  An exception here must be made for the cutscenes which, in contrast, do an excellent job capturing the mood of the story.  Yet, ironically, this only serves to highlight the absence of atmosphere in the rest of the game.  This is most clearly demonstrated in the final scene (no spilers) which slips between cutscenes and regular gameplay.  Here, the cutscenes do all of the work while each shift back to regular gameplay spoils the tension that has been produced by them.In addition to this, changes in the pacing of the game also disrupt its mood.  Access to areas of the game is more staggered than in the original, which helps spread out the content of the game more evenly but also - for me anyway - takes away from the world-building at the outset of the game.  Moreover, minor additions to the game's content (a few small puzzles and scenes) are often out of place and stand out as obvious bolt-ons with little or no necessity (the very minor scene at the Wright family tomb, for example, left me astounded by its pointlessness).  I also found the music disappointing compared with the original (though perhaps this is simply because I grew up in the '90s and have acquired an unreasonable fondness for midi tracks!).How to conclude, then?  If you like adventure games and have never played the original, you should buy this.  If you have played the original and are interested (like me) in seeing first hand how the game was reworked, or if you would like to play Gabriel Knight again but find its old interface or graphics a deal-breaker, then you should buy the game.  But if you are wanting this game to recapture the spirit and character of the original, then I do not recommend it.  Or else, I recommend that you be braced for disappoinment.			"

												The original is one of my all time favourites, and it's always nice to have Gabriel back in 2014, a time where his relevance is almost non existent. But the truth is that this remake is far from the charm of the classic. Sure, the magnificent story and characters are still here, but we lost the original art style and voices. To do a remake nowadays should be a big and gorgeous 3D game that better reflects our time and age. Still, the core of what made Gabriel Knight one of the best adventures ever is still here.Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers - 5/5Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers - 20th Anniversary Edition - 3/5			"

												This was so much fun to play. I loved the soundtrack a lot. The story, puzzles and gameplay make this one worthwhile. The cutscenes are more basic animation, but I honestly prefer the focus on story and puzzles than spending a lot of resources on 3d animated cutscenes.I remember playing Gabriel Knight II or III in the late 90s/2000s and so I had some link to the character, but it was great fun to go back and play this very nicely updated adventure game and learn about his origin. I love games like this, and want to play more of them.  It has a little bit of gore, a little bit of drama, a lot of smarminess, and a lot of history that made the game fleshed out and fun.It was fun solving the game via Steam. The Steam badges, if you get stuck and don't want to use the in-game hint system, might give you a hint or two about what you need for some of the puzzles in the game as well.			"

												A great 'current-visuals' adaptation of one of the greatest adventure games ever created, it is not without its faults, albeit, not crippled by them either.Graphics are gorgeous, if a little *glitchy* from time to time.  I haven't experienced as many as some forum posts suggest, so who knows? Voice acting is newly re-cast due to the poor integrity of the original cast recordings, but if you appreciate GK for what Jane Jensen wrote vs. who ""spoke"" it, you won't be disappointed.  The new cast is actually quite good, if takes a bit to get used to.There are a few new puzzled added for us 'old school' players, and overall this is a great homage piece. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it a couple times over, in its new ""skin""The story itself is engaging and the characters are great.

												Phoenix Online has outdone themselves with this flawless remake edition of Gabriel Knight. This game combines being true to the original while making improvements and modernizing. And its visually stunning!+Amazing HD graphics! I love the way they kept the original composition as much as possible.+The new voice-over cast is a surprising success!+The new remastered music is wonderful!+Hints system and notes adds to the gameplay experience!-Some visual collision and sliding issues on animations, kind of jagged at times.-Had to reload a couple of times due to problems with continue functionThe new voice-over cast was initially worrying. Not so strange being a hardcore fan of the old 1993 version, having played it close to 30 times. However after a couple of hours into it, I found it surprisingly refreshing and wonderful. Especially happy to see the essence of Gabriel's cocky New Orleans character being intact. I would also mention Grace, Dr John, Mosely and Frick as outstanding performances.Visually its a balanced mix of photo and painted textures, blended with pre-rendered backgrounds and real-time props & characters. A nice touch is the ambient atmospheric particles & lighting effects.The original music is remastered by composer Robert Holmes. This is a huge improvement from the early 90s midi tracks.The bonus option to view old concept art from the different locations, combined with info and audio interviews with the original developers is a nice addition for fans of the old game.I would highly recommend this game for adventure fans, looking for a story driven game.

Add to that few new puzzles and this is THE game you need to replay even if you played the original.And if you are new then you are in for a treat - its a very clever game with lots of cool twists and amazing storytelling. You simply cannot avoid falling in love with the characters.So yes, while its a ""remake"" - its definitely one of the best ones ever.			"

												I'm a long-time adventure game fan. To this day, the original Gabriek Knight: Sins of the Father remains my favourite adventure gamel (and overall favourite game). So I was hesitant to try this remake, especially after the disappointing Moebius.However, I greatly enjoyed this. I still prefer the original, but this remake has its merits.In short? I recommend the original game, which you can get on Good Old Games. It's a good remake, but not worth full price. It's worth getting on a sale, though.Pros:-Fantastic graphics and art design. The character and location remodels are drop-dead gorgeous. They're a massive improvement to the original game. Where the game especially shines is in the panelled, graphic novel style cutscenes that made the original game so memorable. All are recreated with gusto and there are many more new ones that turn previous in-game cutscenes into the graphic novel style. The updated graphics and art style alone are worth the price of admission.-The voice work is quite good. I was worried, since Phoenix Online couldn't use the original voice work, but the new cast does a fine job. For the most part. I'll get to that.-A small handful of puzzles have been reworked. About half a dozen. Two, in particular, are very nice changes: where Gabriel needs to change his looks, and somewhere he needs to break into.The latter is incredibly creepy.Cons:-Some animations are awkward. Sometimes, the characters stifly spin on the spot like ""tank controls"" of older 3D third person games. They're rare, fortunately. There are other moments where the 3D animation is choppy or awkward, but it's still a massive improvement from Moebius.-While most of the voice acting is good, there are times it feels very stiff and unnatural compared to the original game. Little, intricate details in line delivery is lost at times. I loved Tim Curry's delivery of a German poem, but this voice actor's delivery is very deadpan. Some of Mark Hamil's little ways of spicing up Mosely's characters are lost, which hurts the character's presentation. I'm biased, though, given my love for the original.-As I said, about half a dozen puzzles have been redone. Some, unfortunately, have absolutely infuriating, immersion-breaking logic puzzles like something out of Myst. One puzzle gives little indication of what to do (a tiny, barely readable guide in a the bottom corner of the screen). They feel completely out of place with the rest of the game and are only a nuisance than anything else.			"

												Of course, this is one of the major classic adventure games.  As such, its biggest danger is comparison to ""itself.""  It does a very good job in that respect.  The new graphics are excellent.  The new voice acting is *very* good; I think that the critics on that point are more entrenched in cripplingly specific nostalgia than anything else.  The things that stand out as most noticably changed are solidly changed for the better.  The new castle design is a huge improvement over the cartoony original and links to GK2 fantastically.  The brief but powerful story edits at the police station are wonderful.  The only change I do have mixed feelings about is the much more rigorous pacing control seen in this version.  The original version generally resulted in a painfully difficult and long Day 1, but then rocketed up the tension and pace in later days.  I do think that this new story structure will avoid the risk of seriously alienating first time players, assuming that they're avoiding hints.  But gran on day 4, for example, slows down the main story a bit.			"

												Being a big fan of King's Quest 6, I thought I'd give this Jane Jensen game a try. This is a moody adventure game with a rich story and fun puzzle elements. It does suffer from a few graphical glitches, but it's not a major issue. When I played the first couple chapters, I wasn't hooked with the story and setting, but once things started picking up and strange incidents started affecting characters it kept me hooked. The game felt a little clunky mechanically, but when I set it on Fastest mode, it was fine. It seems to be quite intensive on medium-high settings. I definitely recommend this game to adventure game fans.Pros:+ Rich intriguing story+ Good voice acting+ Puzzles aren't overly frustratingCons:- A few graphical glitches			"

												Engrossing story with a character who actually changes, but not overnight. I didn't play the original, but knowing that there was an original version from the 90s made the sexist Gabriel Knight a little easier to take (I don't have a problem contextualizing), especially since the character does show some maturation. The game kept me busy and entertained enough that I wanted to play the other games in the series, but I think I'd rather see a new game instead of a retread. He can still be a rogue, but not so ridiculously bad that any thinking woman wouldn't waste her time. In any case--the voodoo plotline is interesting, and the concept of Shadow-hunter is interesting.

												For cost conscious people, the original version on GOG.com might be the better option.  You can argue that it looks better, sounds better because of the original Hollywood cast, and maybe even plays better.But all that said, the 20th anniversary edition of the game is a perfectly fine version to play if you want something that is a bit more modern.  Built in hints, some light commentary on each screen of the game, and some UI overhauls make the game a bit more accessible than the original.  As a remake, it's well done.But regardless of which version you pick up, Gabriel Knight is unequivocally one of the best adventure games in the genre.  You play as the eponymous Gabriel Knight, a novelist who gets involved with a series of murders in New Orleans.  As Gabriel learns more about the case, he also learns more about his own mysterious past, including the madness that claimed his father's life.  It's a compelling combination of a crime procedural with the supernatural world of Voodoo and Gabriel's dark and mysterious past.  It really is a great story to watch/read through, and it's the reason why Jane Jensen and this game in particular is celebrated among adventure game fans.The adventure game part of it is fun as well, with some clever puzzles and interesting solutions.  There's nothing as frustrating as the infamous Gabriel Knight 3 mustache puzzle, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck.  And even if you do get stuck, the hint system in the game will get you moving on to the next great story beat if you just want to move on and experience the story.This game is a classic and definitely worth playing if you have any interest in the genre.  Whether you pick up the original on GOG.com or the updated version here, I don't think you are going to be disappointed.			"

												I can't even express how happy I was when I saw this 20th Anniversary Edition pop up on Steam.  Sins of the Fathers was one of my very first point-and-click adventure games (I was a whopping 12 years old when it came out) and I was completely enthralled by it then.  I'm pleased that the story lost nothing over the years, and is just as unique and spellbinding as I remember it.This edition maintains all the wit and creativity of the original, with updated character graphics and location scenes to introduce it to a modern audience.  I was delighted to find that all of the things I loved about the original were retained here, including an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack.If you're a fan of the genre, and especially if you were a fan of the old Sierra adventure games, this is a must-have (along with its first sequel, which although stylistically different has a story even more engrossing than this one).10/10 would stroll down memory lane again			"

												Hearing that intro song remastered as the game loaded — I knew I was in for a treat. I'm about halfway done now and I'm just holding myself back from rushing it. It's lovely to see this game redone with tighter gameplay and less pixel-hunting. Sure, some elements of the dialog might be a bit dated and the art direction isn't always stand-out, but the core of the story is so lovingly crafted and the music is so memorable, you're going to feel like a 13 year old again discovering something great and bigger than itself. Characters are the name of the game here. Take your time to meet these great folks again and let's hope Mr. Knight comes back for more modern adventures.			"

												Question: have you ever played the original Gabriel Knight? If no, buy this immediately and ignore the reviews of anyone who is affected by nostalgia. You will love the story and the puzzles. In game hint system will make sure you don't need a walkthrough for the most part.For players of the original - it's a mixed bag. New soundtrack (some good, some not so good), backgrounds range from excellent to kind of sterile, character animation is just slow and bad and the changes to gameplay isn't that great. For example it hand holds item combining and offers many many in game hints. Though to be fair if you've finished the original you won't need them and it won't affect your enjoyment. Voice acting is hit or miss, but this is more of a nostalgia thing than a real complaint.Overall I enjoyed it, especialy since I haven't played the original in awhile. Just don't go in with sky-high expectations and you'll like it.			"

												Jane Jensen's classic point-and-click adventure game, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father, is back in a special, 20th Anniversary Edition update. Developed by Jane Jensen's own Pinkerton Road Studio and published by Phoenix Online Studio, it tells the tale of writer and rare book store owner Gabriel Knight as he discovers that the sins of the past can come back to haunt you.The original title, first published by Sierra Entertainment, holds a special place in my heart. This was the very first PC game I ever had, actually bought 2 months before we actually had a PC. I still remember seeing the box art, that hanging figure and being strangely drawn to it. It was also one of the hardest games I ever tried to run on our first PC. Figuring out that I needed to create a boot disk and what that disk needed to contain was as hard a puzzle as any I had to solve in the game! And considering this was before the Internet gave us all the answers, still a proud moment for me. Most of my DOS/Command Line skills were learned trying to run this game, skills that I still use to this day. And if ever I actually write a horror story, this game will have had it's hand in this as well.The 20th Anniversary Edition comes with glossy modern graphics, new voice acting and the story we all loved 20 years ago. It also comes with the same point-and-click gameplay it originally had. Whereas some would qualify it as classic, others would call this style of gameplay archaic. The action is slow with you clicking on something and waiting for the animation to bring the character there before doing whatever you were asking. Puzzles, which make up the bulk of the challenges, are a mixed bag. Though you'll find many to work intuitively, some are obtuse, and a few are horribly frustrating. Luckily, a new hint system was imbedded in the menu structure to give a helping hand when you need it without having to resort to the net (or a certain guide...). Unfortunately, the worst offenders require trial and error and a good bit of luck to solve, even if you know the answer. These bog down the game and will lead some to never finish the title. Which would be quite a shame. On a plus side, they modernized the interface. Though we lost the nice, atmospheric icons of the original, changing it from having them all grouped up at the top of the screen to a direct contextual ring upon selection is definitely a move that needed to be made.As I stated, the graphics were changed. Gone is the pixel art of the original. In it's stead we have new 3D High Res graphics to play with. Overall, the new graphics are rather pretty and well made, with generally smooth animation in the movements and interactions. However, I do miss the original and wish a “classic” mode had been included (though I'm not sure if they could have done this legally). Your millage may vary but players used to modern day graphics should appreciate the update. Each locale you visit is interesting, distinct and memorable and the art team did a great job of updating these. New Orleans really comes to life, from the French quarter to the bayou. Note that I did notice a few, very minor, graphical issues in my play-through. The game also features a few cutscenes. These, part graphic novel and part animation, are truly stunning works to behold. One update that I'm very happy with is the music. Re-orchestrated and re-mastered by the original composer, Robert Holmes, it is one of the highlights of this experience. I liked the music back when it was played through a not-Sound Blaster, so you can imagine how much I love the updated tracks. Luckily, I per-ordered the game and received the original sound track as a bonus. Each location you visit has a distinct musical track associated with it, giving as much to the games atmosphere as the visuals. It's so that you could almost play the game with you're eyes closed. I wish more games today would go the extra mile and bring the aural part of their games on par with the visuals like this one. On the other side of the spectrum, the voice acting is something I have trouble with. Now, this isn't to question the change in cast members. The game originally featured such talent as Tim Curry, Mark Hamil and Michael Dorn. With a low budget and 20 year old recordings, they had to get some new actors. For the most part, I felt the players were fine. Unfortunately, the two main voices you'll hear in the game, Gabriel and the narrator, are points of contention. I originally played the game on floppy disks, so I had no voice acting. So all I had was my imagination as to what our protagonist sounded like. What you hear in game is about a thousand leagues away from that. I don't feel it fits the character all that well but I did get used to it. Of course, upon looking up what the original sounded like, I can't say I Tim Curry was any closer to my imagination either. The narrator is another situation as well. They kept the same idea as the original, a New Orleans accented lady to add to the atmosphere. But yeah, no, I can't say it was that great of an idea on either case. At times, the narrator sounds tired or bored and the rest of the time the accent just gets grating, especially when you can't find the solution to a puzzle. Of course, you can always mute the narrator if you'd like. Still, as stated, the rest of the voice acting was fine. For me, the highest of the high points in this game is the story and characters. The story is fully enjoyable, blending elements of magic and occultism from the old world and the new in a fashion that's still pretty unique. The things you do and the places you visit and why all form a very interesting arc between good and evil, past and present, and love and duty. The main characters are likewise well developed and realized, showing more than one trope or dimension. I played through this more than once when I was young and still enjoyed the story and characters this time around. Ultimately, this version of the game suffers from the same problems and issues that it has always suffered from. And I'm not sure how authentic it would have been if they had been removed. I can say that if you're a fan of old school point-and-click adventure games and their unique sense of logic, or if you were a fan of the original but can't play it anymore cause one of the disk died on you (still sad about it), you should check this out. But this isn't the adventure that's going to change your mind if you don't like this kind of game.			"

												Long story short - it's adequate. Not terrible. Positives:There's a solid foundation here. The original is an extremely good game, and the remake (for the most part) doesn't mess it up, but rather improves it.The more detailed art style does improve some things, such as the cinematic cutscenes and confrontations.Some of the locations are a bit more interesting.The commentary is good.The narrator doesn't take forever to finish each torturous sentence (you will still turn her off, naturally)Grace's voice is far superior to the original.Negatives:Some of the locations are quite sterile. A lot of minor animations and touches are omitted for the sake of economy. Fewer spots you can interact with, fewer unique reactions.Most of the new voices are adequate, but don't quite measure up to Worf / Joker.The commentary is quite sparse. I'd actually prefer a proper artbook, where you can see the comparisons in detail and the designers would (hopefully) have things to say beyond the very obvious.The new puzzles are terrible, awful, horrible, time wasting pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall:Unlike some other remakes or sequels to 20 year old games I played recently, I did not regret the time I spent playing this game. It wasn't bad. Just... not very good.  Remember that the original trilogy can be purchased on GOG, and... wait for a sale, maybe? Detailed impressions: http://xander77.livejournal.com/25366.htmlEdit - I've been told that this review is a bit biased towards people who played the original back in the 90's, and don't mind 90's graphics much. Fair enough - if you don't mind somewhat dated puzzle style (the game wasn't really updated in that sense) and would prefer moder-ish graphics, then this is highly recommended. Or, at least more highly recommended that the original version on GOG.			"

Also, the game is kind of stilted, moves weird and feels like a game made as a college project vs the polished game by a real game studio.I still recommend the game for those who loved the original, and maybe someone who always wanted to play it and don't want to track down and deal with the original game.

												I was always faithful to Sierra games, but had continually bypassed this one.  I would stand in my favorite computer game store, looking at the back of the game's box trying to convince myself to buy it.  ""Hmm, this probably doesn't have boobs and dirty jokes like Leisure Suit Larry.  Voodoo?  Meh, I'll pass.""  I had, however, played GK: The Beast Within as soon as it came out, (probably because I loved the groundbreaking FMV aspect in playing Phantasmagoria.  The first one. The second one was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.)  I enjoyed The Beast Within and figured I should someday play the first game in the series.  Twenty years later.  Winter sale, boom.  This game was enjoyable, I guess.  I didn't LOVE it.  I should have remembered my 14-year-old self when I knew I wouldn't be into the story.  I was hoping it would be at least a little bit scary or suspenseful.  I like horror and the paranormal, not weirdos wearing animal masks dancing around a fire with a snake.  Zzzzzzz.  I live in the city and see much worse things on the evening news.I don't regret playing it, but I think it's more for people who have a nostalgic attachment to it.  I personally like the Black Mirror series better.Pros:NostalgiaEasy In-game hint systemSome curse words. Cool.Cons:Your best friend dies so you steal his wallet and max out his credit card.  That's a♥♥♥♥♥♥move.No boobsBoring Voodoo story.  Unless you're into that type of thing.  Weirdo.All the beds shown in this game were messy/unmade "

												I'm on the fence with this one. The voice acting is terrible. If you've ever wanted to walk around and have a bad Miss Cleo impersonator narrate your every move then rejoice! I'm also not quite sure what accent Gabriel is doing. The puzzles are moderate, for the most part, and there's actually a fair amount of accurate information about the Loas, but [POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD] the whole Vodoo human sacrifce plot is trite and pretty offensive. [NO MORE SPOILERS]  I'm guessing this game was orginally released around the same time as The Serpent And The Rainbow by Wade Davis. The game does manage to have some pretty spooky moments and reminds me of the old sierra adventure games in the best possible way. Wait until it's on sale and pick it up if you are a point-and-click adventure fan. It's an adult game with a darker tone and a good amount of content.  Overall, it's meh and just eeks out a postive recommendation.The interface is pure clunky crap.			"

												I own the original Gabriel Knight game, with the remake there is one thing that doesn't sit well with me.....the voice acting.The original game sported an all star cast :Mark Hamill (as Mosely) Tim Curry (as Gabriel)Virginia Capers (as the narrator)Leah Remini (as Grace).The new voice cast had much to live up to but while they did a good job it's still not there, especially the narrator. Virginia Capers delivered a stunning performance in the original. Her voice created the perfect atmosphere and verily from all the actors who acted for this game she outshined them all (at least for me). It's a pity that they didn't use the original voice cast recordings.That being said the game is still the same ole Gabriel Knight with added bells and whistles.  Finished it in under 8h I have replayed the original so many times that I have practically memorised everything (and yet every so often I'll still replay it).			"

												Nah, looks pretty poor compared to the original. Graphics could be much better, the audio was recorded by amateur people and the game engine doesn't live up for nowadays standards. Pretty sloppy for such a classic game remake. It makes me want to run the original game that made me spend so many hours learning about Voodoo and African American culture when I was a teenager.Just download the original one from an Abandonware site, run it under DOSBox and enjoy the full experience of a true gem from the 90's. If you liked the modern remake, this will make you change your mind. Just give it a try if you're really into retro adventure games, you won't regret.			"

												Good remake of a great game! They dont make them like this anymore so it is fortunate that this jewel can be presented to a new genaration of gamers in updated format. Characters and plot is human and believable as opposed to flat stereotypes served up in most of the adventure or RPG games produced today. Story, pacing and art is excellent and you quickly immerse and start to feel for the characters  and is genuinly thrilled about uncovering the mystery while you feel more and more dread at the approaching darkness. Even the puzzles are mostly smart and funny and logical.  Only negative finding is the small pauses encounted when narrative is running and before control is relased back to player.As a gamer with more than 30+ years of playing this is still among my top twenty. I hope they will do remake also of GK2 and GK3 (the latter being almost as good as the first game) or why not a  new GK4.			"

												The best!!  What a great remake.  There are a lot of remakes out there now for the 1990's dos/windows games and this one is the BEST so far.  I love the voices and the person to disses Gabriels voice is crazy.  It is prefect for the character.  The remake is so true to the orginal you think you are playing the old game and then you see old photos of what the game was really like you stop and say, ""was it really like that""?  What they did to this game today is what I thought it looked like as a child only 20 years later.  Great job!  Great Game!  One of the best stories EVER for a computer game!  Please remake Night 2!  Its a bloody mess with all the video but maybe you could make it like this and we can all enjoy Night 2 in a new light?Cheers!			"

												Awesome classic old school adventure game. Of course it would be nice to have the original voices back. The new voice actor sounds like he'h trying to impersonate Nicholas Cage. Still a great game tho.			"

												Uptown girl fell in love at first sight with a downtown boy at a crime scene, who later impersonated a police officer just to talk to her, then slept with him a few days later at his place. Yeah, it sounds stupid back then and it still sounds stupid now.The 20th Anniversary Edition is perfect for newcomers to enjoy one of the better adventure game a couple of decades ago back when the genre was hot. Too bad the gameplay doesn't age well and it might turn off most newer generation of gamers. The only thing that really bothers me with this edition is the MC's voice acting. It's horrible.RECOMMENDED			"

												So I finished up Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary over the weekend.  And the most important thing to say – if you like adventure games and haven’t played this one, you really should.  If you have played this one, the remaster is well done and it is worth playing again.It is fairly impossible to review this game without considering its source.  Certainly I missed Tim Curry as Gabriel, Leah Rimini as Grace, Mark Hamill as Mosley, Michael Dorn as Dr. John and Virginia Capers as the narrator.  But the new voice work is pretty good and everyone does a fine job.Graphically it certainly stands out from the original.  Not that it is top of the line, but many things that were difficult to distinguish are now clear and readily visible.   The music has been redone and of all the aspects of the game – this is my least favorite.  I loved the original themes and while they are there have at times been reworked and do not hit me the same way, but were never so far out of place that I found myself thinking them just plain wrong. The puzzles have been given a once-over in some ways.  Not everything takes place or at the same time in the original, and this doesn’t hurt things.  If anything, most of the puzzles are too easy, but then that could be a lot of memory from previous playthroughs shining through.  There are plenty of hints through the story, dialog, journal and activities so that if you’re paying attention it shouldn’t be overly hard.It is the story that still shines the most.  All the rest is the delivery of this tale which has been a favorite since Gabriel first walked out of his bedroom in St. George’s Books. And while there are a few differences in how the story is told, it is still interesting if you will take the time to discover it.In short, while not perfect, it makes many improvements that make for an enjoyable experience for someone who has played the game a few times over the last 20 years or someone who is being introduced to the world of Gabriel Knight.

												As would recommend it as a remake, but the game itself is very hard to finish without a walkthrough, it's not the remake fault anyway, I still prefer Gabriel Knight 2 is my favourite. I recommend it if you want to play the remake of the original, I don't recommend it if you're just looking for an adventure game to play, there lot better ones.			"

												This is an amazing remake of one of the coolest point and clicks around. Although there's no Tim Curry voice acting, the guy doing Gabriel Knight is pretty good, as are the rest of the cast and the new animation looks gorgeous. The story looks exactly the same, although it seems some scenarios are switched around in the order they occur. If you have played the original you should have no bother completing the puzzles, because the changes are minor. If you haven't played Gabriel Knight before then all the better, this remake should help pull in the new wave of point and click adventure fans created by indie developers who have gone back to my favourite genre. These remakes of classics (Broken Sword Enhanced version, Monkey Island remake) sit well along with new games (Walking Dead, Broken Age) which have brought back adventure games.I just hope this provides the springboard for new Gabriel Knight adventures (I'm not interested in remakes of the second or third game!)

												I got this for backing Moebius on Kickstarter.  When this was announced, I nearly forgot about Moebius and jumped on the hype train for this.  The original was one of my favorite games nearly two decades ago.  To this day, I still LOVE the original but I greatly appreciate this HD Remake.  Since the last time I beat Gabriel Knight, I have finally made it out to New Orleans and fell in love with it.  Replaying the HD remake made me nostalgic for both the city and the game.  While I do miss Tim Curry, Leah Remini and Mark Hamill as the voices, the conversations and characters still work.   I am incredibly biased and would have loved this game regardless if it was horrible, so I am going to name some things that might hinder the experience for new players:- Some clunky animation- Puzzles that are kind of out there and might be a little nonsensical.  - Interface is a little dated- Some cringe worthy moments that didn't really work in the original.  There is much to see, read, and explore in this game that these issues didn't phase me too much.  I loved the story, MOST of the puzzles, the environments and the characters.			"

												Ah nostalgia. I remember playing GK: Sins of the Fathers way back when in the 90's, it was probably one of the first pc games I'd ever played and 20 years later it still had me wanting to replay it.The storyline is great, the remastered artwork is great, the setting is great, overall I think it's great.Point and click games seem to be a thing of the past these days or free to play on tablets etc but they lack the length and depth of games like GK. Even though I can pretty much remember every puzzle and how to get through each day I still have a sense of excitment about this game. I just hope they find a way to remaster re-release GK II and GK III.			"

												A fantastic, modern remake of the old Sierra point'n'click adventure. The story is still golden, and I'm happy Jane Jensen is still out there, making sure her masterpiece doesn't get buried that easy. Few of the pixel hunt puzzles have been properly remade this time which is a really positive thing, and the internal hint system gives just the proper reminder and nudge when you've get back to the game next time or just can't remember all the details since it contains a massive amount of more or less accurate information - especially historical - amongst the fantasty elements.Now, if we only could have a proper tv series...!And remember: what can you tell me about voodoo?

												Engrossing story and cumulative suspense make the remake as good as the original - better, if you consider the beautiful, detail-studded high resolution art. Voice talent may lack Curry but is very strong nevertheless. Gabriel+Grace are convincing but the narrator with her Cajun/Jamaican accent is probably my favorite. Great puzzle integration. Medium difficulty with nothing illogical. That said, keep an eye out on smaller objects, especially in the background. It's not a pixel hunt but as I said, each location is rich with artistic detail which can distract from what you need to interact with. The only thing I don't like in the game are the 1 or 2 arcade/timed sequences, which really don't fit within GK's grand adventure game universe.			"

												Absolutely stunning game. The original GK was a masterpiece when it came out in the mid 90s (was it really that long ago?) and this new version brings home just how intelligent, powerful, moving and funny the original was. The new engine is a little clunky in places, and I suffered a few glitches here and there (mostly in the form of crashes, which mostly happened to me during the early stages of the game), but the remastered soundtrack is incredible. One of the greatest adventure games ever made - make the effort to play through the game and you'll be richly rewarded.			"

												Steeped in Voodoo lore this game is a classic point and click adventure, and also one of my all time favorites. If you only choose to play this game as an interactive story, then it is totally woth it. The puzzles are all easy enough to figure out if you paid attention, plus this game includes a journal feature that offers hints, and if nothing else, there are comprehensive guides on the steam community page should you ever need them.With all the hallmarks of classic games: murder mystery, a sarcastic narrator, and impossibly deep pockets, there is absolutely no reason not to support this publisher and play this game.

												Man, what a cool story. This game plays just as well as it did 20 years ago (which I fondly remember playing new). It does have what a lot of people would hate about adventure games, which is that you can be stuck for a while all because you didn't pick something up at one location, or you have what you need, but it isn't obvious what you're supposed to do. This version has a hint system included that gives you more and more information as you ask, with a delay between hints.The graphics have been updated, though the feel is rather ""indie."" All in all, a really interesting story wrapped up in a decent game. Worth the price of a movie ticket at least. Recommended!			"

												Enormously well made re-issue of THE single most scary game from my youth (I played this when I was around 10-11 years of age) Apart from a small number of minor annoyances, this was great! I, for one, don't enjoy something like being able to show all hotspots by just pressing the space bar, The small number of additional puzzles were unnecessary but that didn't really bother me. The pronounciation of the New Orleans French was overdone. And I rather disliked the ""Scoring System"".It just distracts from playing this for story-progression and replaces it with an achievement-hunter vibe. The Hints-system was an addition I chose to ignore but I understand why it's been added, Gaming has become a HUGE deal and gamers aren't as patient with their games as they used to be (especially when it's not an action-packed game) so without some small hints, some players might not bother completing the game, I don't want to complain about the hints system, It's just present, If you don't like it you can just let it sit idle (Nobody forces you to use it). My biggest issue in this game was the rather unresponsive controlling of Gabriel, especially in the Wheel-within-a-wheel mound in Africa, (Y'all know what sequence i mean, I don't want to spoil) But all these minor ""Issues' just don't add up to the sheer amazingness of the story, or the game as a whole! The price is also not too steep for a game that will keep you occupied for several hours (I blasted through this rather quickly, but I played the original just a couple of months ago) I rate this remake a solid 9/10.

I did have an initial installation issue on my Mac (super quickly and kindly answered by Aaron at postudios), but that disappeared after a re-install.Some of the Gabriel's more adolescent jokes haven't aged well over 20 years (I also believe that Tim Curry's boyish charm made them more tolerable at the time), but overall it's still a delightful game brought back to life in this edition.

This one is exceptional.  And don't let the GKSOTF walkthroughs ono-line trick you.  Those are for the earlier version, not this 20th anniversary release.  They've thrown a few change-ups in there.  It's not as easy as you might think.  And to all those who hated Gabriel's voice, I'd like to say your nuts.  I thought he sounded sexy, like the actory Matthew McConau♥♥♥♥ and what's not sexy about him!!			"

												This really is a great remake of a great game.  There are obviously some concsessions to be made in the voiceover department, and some of the additions (like not having all of the locations available from the onset) don't mix well with the rest of the game, but overall this is a fantastic game.I consider the original to be one of my favorite games of all time and I've played it more times than I can count, so this remake had a high mark to reach.  I was a kickstarter backer & played some of the earlier builds of the game.  When I was playing those early builds I was concerned about the voice cast, but after playing through the whole game, I give a hearty thumbs up for an impressive job at filling some incredibly large shoes left by the original cast.  All of the voices are definitely based off the original, and even the worst of it doesn't detract much (if at all) from the game.  On major positive point is that the narrator speaks MUCH faster than Virgina Capers.If you're on the fence about buying this game, get off that fence and just buy it!!!			"

												21 years after the original came out in 1993 we have the HD version of Gabriel Knight 1: Sins of the Fathers, updated with new art assets, re-recorded voices and soundtrack. This means the loss of celebrity voice talent present in the original, but I think the improved audio fidelity makes up for it (feel free to look up the originals on youtube and hear for yourself). The scenery, dialogue content, plot and puzzles are kept identical to the original. The game contains a journal in which you can view developer interviews, sketches, story-boards and screenshots for the original. I found myself looking in the journal to compare the old and new first thing at every location in the game. It's clearly a very nostalgic experience. Since the game features a higher resolution more details have been woven into the background in many areas, but the core gameplay is just as it is in the original. Gabriel's appearance seems to change for every game he's in and the 20th Anniversary Edition is no different. I think his features have become slightly too androgynous though (my mental image of him is formed by the original), but whether it's better or not is entirely subjective. For the newcomer to the series the 20th Anniversary edition is clearly preferable to the original, which is probably much too pixelated to be appreciated by eyes used to HD graphics. This is an inventory based point-and-click adventure game: Gabriel moves between various areas in which he can observe, pick up items, manipulate items, combine items, use items upon objects and talk to people. You progress through the game by unlocking unique dialogue options uncovering important plot points and solving puzzles which usually involves the use of found items. You can use a highlight feature to show interactable objects on the screen, which is rather convenient at times reducing paranoia ""what if I missed something? Better search every pixel again!""The puzzles sometimes requires strange solutions but the game has a built in hint system, where you can unlock tiers of hints (increasing in details) to prevent frustration.The game is deservedly loved for its story among fans, but you might not believe it from the first few hours of gameplay. The mystery plot takes a bit before it gets going. The games humor is mostly self-depreciating on Gabriel's behalf and tends to portray him as a shallow person, which might feel slightly off-putting initially. Same may apply for some of the accents used in the game, but after short habituation I found it rather refreshing and atmospheric. Bottom line: Faithful recreation of the original game with updated assets. Slow paced but very worthwhile mystery plot with sometimes weird puzzles. Recommended for those who appreciate point and click adventure games and those who liked the original.			"

Better search every pixel again!""The puzzles sometimes requires strange solutions but the game has a built in hint system, where you can unlock tiers of hints (increasing in details) to prevent frustration.The game is deservedly loved for its story among fans, but you might not believe it from the first few hours of gameplay. The mystery plot takes a bit before it gets going. The games humor is mostly self-depreciating on Gabriel's behalf and tends to portray him as a shallow person, which might feel slightly off-putting initially. Same may apply for some of the accents used in the game, but after short habituation I found it rather refreshing and atmospheric. Bottom line: Faithful recreation of the original game with updated assets. Slow paced but very worthwhile mystery plot with sometimes weird puzzles. Recommended for those who appreciate point and click adventure games and those who liked the original.			"

												This game is awesome.  The remake really does the original justice.  Other than the gross mispronunciation of the word ""Lagniappe"" over and over, the game and remade music is really awesome.  The story is really engrossing, and the characters are really memorable.  I want everyone I know to play this game just so I can talk about it with them :)Even if you didn't play the original, try this out. Seriously.			"

												first discovered this game back at school when a friend lent it to me. I spent many, many hours at a friends house playing this and I don't know about them but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having just finished playing this HD Remake it brought back so many good memories. If you have ever played the original (or any of the GK games for that matter) I would recommend revisiting this in the remake. If you've never played any of the GK games and you're interested in point and click puzzle adventure games, I DEFINITELY recommend giving this a look-see.			"

												The storyline is what makes the Gabriel Knight saga still playable 20 years later which makes you overlook the clunky animations or illogical dialogues at times. I wasn't especially happy with the voice acting and the b-rated American movie lines from characters but this game is 20 years old that's how ""cool"" people spoke on movies and games back then. I just wish wholeheartedly this game will fund a 4th Gabriel Knight game and I wish there is the option of it being a full motion video game like The Beast Within which is the best game I have ever played storywise.

												I'm pleased to finally have had the chance to play Gabriel Knight since I never had the opportunity to play the series back in the 90s. Being an adventure game fan, I've heard good things about it, and I was stoked.Let me start off by saying that the theme is really interesting, a welcomed change of pace.It's rare to find games that feature voodoo, cajun, or New Orleans culture in a respectful manner.I think in the 90s, Gabriel Knight was hailed as a cutting-edge franchise because it was a modern noir murder mystery story set in New Orleans, featuring POC characters, and it was quite violent for a video game at the time - a point & click, no less.With that chunk of history in mind, and the 17+ hours I've spent playing the game, it's safe to say that it is pretty good!But, I do have a bone or two to pick, and I'll explain why in detail.To be honest, it was really difficult for me to really connect with Gabriel and appreciate him as a character; but, over time, I grew to appreciate the game and other characters, instead, and then it became much more enjoyable.I feel that the characters, music, and atmosphere is what really made the game for me and it was what kept me from uninstalling the game because I was so frustrated with Gabriel being little more than a womanizing dream boat - who falls in love with a woman after only knowing her for three days! (And she explicitly told him she was uninterested, at first)Story-wise, I felt that Gabriel was a flop, in the beginning at least, and I thought the love-at-first-sight and playing hard to get aspects were uncomfortable and unnatural (but it was a popular theme in 90's story-telling, I'll admit). Also, Gabriel had very little character development up until the peak of the plot, which was disappointing because it made him seem even more of a pretty boy cut-out instead of the formidable hero he was - literally - destined to be. But, my personal gripe aside, it was a good adventure game; I had fun with the puzzles and I enjoyed interacting with the characters, too! (Mosely and Grace were wonderful, I just wish that they were a bit more involved.)This was a good remake, and I hope that the other two games will be redone so that they may have a chance to reconnect with old fans, and inspire new fans, as well.

												""Cabrit sans cor"" is all I have to say. Figure out what that means and tell me you don't want to play this game... these words have haunted me for almost 20 years...not kidding. I fondly remember my days spent indoors, during incredibly hot summer days in Georgia, playing Sierra games. They were such amazing adventure games and something altogether different from my console titles (SNES at the time I think). But stumbling upon Gabriel Knight really has remained as my first discovery of a ""sleeper"" hit game. Knowing now that the main devs involved were partly responsible for King's Quest and Phantasmogoria makes total sense and a perfect way to describe this game: the gameplay of KQ mixed with the dark and sinister spector of Phantas.The tale of Voodoo, murder and noir dectective skewed N'awlins style is a true classic. The author of the script really did a great job capturing the flavor of the south (sometimes moreso than the voice actors...), and as a southerner I can tell you that is not an easy thing to do. The dynamic of the characters is well crafted, and the tale is tense and masterful. Morover, I love the film ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and this game certianly has a similar ""Southern Gothic"" feeling. The bizarre cast of characters, wrought iron fences, the sweet smell of magnolia and gardenia, the heavy wet air of New Orleans, the general ease that the old South did once proffer, and a glimpse into the darkest shadows surrounding some of the best kept secrets haunting the opulent manors and old money that flow in the veins of old surviving Southern towns and cities. It has depth in both story and gameplay, but some may not really enjoy the point and click play. It can also get a little repetitive; having to travel around and explore places you've alreday been to just to try and find one thing or one detail about one thing you missed...it can bug you. Also, one of the classic faults (if you can call it that) of old Sierra games was the quality of the backgrounds sort of hiding, or at least obscuring, the paths the player needs to find. Also, some gamers may not understand the whole ""open the inventory to combine items to equip them all/get them to work"" sort of problem solving required to solve some puzzles, if they can find the puzzle to begin with- looking at you clock puzzle... Trust me, if you play this game you'll find it. Truthfully; that's what I love about the games, but I admit that it isn't eveyone's cup of tea- you have to spend time IN the game. Click on everything, explore every corner...and the new option to press a button to reveal all interactable objects is AWESOME... you used to have to click blindly until you got a GUI box to pop up. It's a great game you 90's gamers may have missed and one newer gamers may never hear of again! Thanks for the reboot, so happy to have it in my library again!			"

												It's kind of annoying there isn't a ""meh"" option, because while I couldn't recommend this game as a MUST HAVE, I'm not going to go out of my way to say NEVER EVER EVER PLAY WASTE OF TIME.  Sadly, they couldn't get Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. to reprise their roles, and there are extended sequences that prevent simply reusing the original voice samples.If you've never played a Gabriel Knight game, you will most likely enjoy the updated version.  If you're a fan of the original series, you might want to pass unless you get this on sale/as a gift, then why not because trading cards = free money.Things that are legitimately improved:- Gabe's design is more consistent with his look in the original 2nd and 3rd games- the cutscenes are a little more coherent- the ""point of no return"" in Day 10 has been changed so you can go back if neededThings that have tolerably changed:- Jason Victor does a pretty good version of Tim Curry's Gabriel Knight- Ned Clarke and Dave Fennoy also come pretty close to the original Mosely and Dr. John- a handful of bonus mini-game extended puzzles that make no sense but at least it's bonus material- exhausting dialogue choices (usually) removes them from the list of options vs. leaving them to clutter the screen- MOST of the artwork is prettyThings I really don't like:- Cissy Jones sounds more like Charity James (original GK3) than Leah Remini- Amy Ingersol's Malia sounds much less sultry than Leilani Jones- the ""bobble-head"" interview animations look incredibly unnatural- the character animations in general have that typical stiff, soulless puppet look, particularly with sequences that would need sudden movements (the tap-dancing kid, Magentia's ""don't be frightened by what you see"" snake dance that instead looks like ""I'm wearing a snake and slightly shaking in place"")- a bug where I put two ""snake tiles"" in place and was IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED (may or may not be reproducible, I haven't tried extensively)- also, what's with Grace's walk cycle--it looks like she's gonna fall over any secondOverall, I guess it's okay, but don't go too far out of your way to get it.  I'm only going to say ""yes"" to recommending it because I don't hate it enough to give it a ""no.""			"

												Awesome remake! Totally recommended for those who hasn't played the original game and also to fans of the original GK series. The new voice cast may not be as splendid as the original, but is still good and faithful to the original voice direction. Other then that, all of the elements of the game have become significantly better with this remake (amazing graphics, better UI, background music...). As for the story, it remains almost completely faithful to the original game (at least from what i can remember), except from a few parts that has new puzzles and scenes. The developers commentary and extras were also a very good call. A 9.5/10, surely!			"

												A wonderful remake of the 1993 original.I've been sceptical about my reaction to the new voice-overs. Being a  fan of the fantastic original, I thought I could still hear the voices Tim Curry and Mar Hamill echoing in my mind.But apart from Gabriel himself, all of the voices sound very familiar to the original. Even the narrator has the same ""elderly woman"" sound, commenting the players actions with a great blend of irony and partial impassiveness. The Musical score and the graphics are a faithful recreation of the original game, even improving the overall atmosphere due to the higher detail found in the backdrops. I do recommend buying it, it's a great game for old fans and newcomers as well.			"

												Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition is a great remake of the old Gabriel Knight game. I remember to have played the original game very young, solving puzzles and having conversations that I really didn't even understand at the time. It was nice and exciting adventure back then and it still works very well. The story takes you in its grasp and forces you to explore more everytime you play.The puzzles are good and logical most of the time. For some players the old adventure game playing mechanism might be little stiff, but for me it still works nicely. For the players who have also played the original game there are also some extra illustrations and sketches from the old game and interviews of the game developers which are very interesting.As for cons you might consider voice acting, which is mostly pretty solid, but Gabriel's voice started to annoy me in some point. Maybe it's just me. I managed to live with it though so that's not really a problem. Still a great story and a great game for every point and click adventure gaming friend out there. HIghly recommended.			"

In details:Plot - interesting and amazing - 9.5/10 In addition you can learn lot's of interesting stuff related to vodoo culture/religion.Graphics - well, it's is OK, sometimes 3D animations are really funny, but nothing too shameful. On the other hand cut scenes are made as an animated comic and are awesome. So 6/10 (but 9/10 for cut scenes).Sound/Musinc - 5/10Gameplay - although it has some glitches it's mostly quite comfortable 7/10Overall - strong 8/10 for me. It should also be mentioned that the game has ingame hint system. So in case you are stuck you don't need to go google solutions, but you can unlock layers of hints to help you through.			"

												This really is a great remake of a great game.  There are obviously some concsessions to be made in the voiceover department, and some of the additions (like not having all of the locations available from the onset) don't mix well with the rest of the game, but overall this is a fantastic game.I consider the original to be one of my favorite games of all time and I've played it more times than I can count, so this remake had a high mark to reach.  I was a kickstarter backer & played some of the earlier builds of the game.  When I was playing those early builds I was concerned about the voice cast, but after playing through the whole game, I give a hearty thumbs up for an impressive job at filling some incredibly large shoes left by the original cast.  All of the voices are definitely based off the original, and even the worst of it doesn't detract much (if at all) from the game.  On major positive point is that the narrator speaks MUCH faster than Virgina Capers.If you're on the fence about buying this game, get off that fence and just buy it!!!			"

												Let me preface this by saying that I couldn’t possibly say enough awesome things about this 20th anniversary revamp by Pinkerton Road of the classic game. As far as games I’ve played so far this year, this one was one of my most anticipated and most enjoyed. That probably sounds ridiculous to some, but nostalgia has a way of doing that to me. After all, the Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight mystery made my list of favorite retro games, so that this one is also an old favorite should be no surprise.You can read the full review on my blog: http://www.pcgamergirl.com/review-gabriel-knight-sins-fathers/ "

												This was a very enjoyable revisit to a great story and fun adventure. I played the original and all of its sequels when they first came out and even though i remembered roughly how the plot would flow, it was still fun and atmospheric to redo it, and a satisfying trip down my gaming memory lane.Initially, i found the strength of Gabriels accent really annoying, and some of the lines really cheesy, but as i played that mattered less and less, and I focussed on the nicer graphics, story and plot.There is a really useful hints function within your in-game diary that prevents the annoying stagnation and walls you can sometimes hit in puzzle/adventure games. There are two levels of hints. The first level is a gentle one, and wont completely steal the satisfaction of solving the puzzle or days tasks. The second level hint, if you use it, is a much more detailed ""cheat"", that will state plainly whats required. There is a timer function that prevents you clicking the hints straight away.I really enjoyed replaying this game, partly out of pure nostalgia, and partly because it is a worthwhile modernisation of a fondly remembered game. I was especially satisfied by the art material and graphics from the original game being viewable within your in game diary also. That content gets unlocked as you progress.If you have love for the original, and would simply enjoy replaying it with new clothes, buy this game (again). I did, and dont regret it.			"

However, the voice actor that was selected for Gabriel just sounded like he was a tough guy in some Western movie, not a famous affluent author. The quality of this person's voice and drawl just ruins the game for me. If you don't care about the quality of the voice acting, then the game is executed in the expected manner and from what I slogged through is reasonable and entertaining to play.			"

												I loved the original version from the 90's, and the replay value for me was moderately-high; it contained well acted scenes with talents such as Tim Curry.  Unfortunately, this reboot of GK doesn't include Tim, which IMO was the foundation of the original.  The new actor portraying Gabriel will take some getting used to.  Otherwise, this is a solid Point & Click game with an interesting storyline.			"

												I pressed Alt + F4 almost immidiately after I've heard voice acting, I'm sorry, but this isn't just cheesy, it almost hurt. And of course I tried to give the game another chance, but just one more line from that Gabriel character and I couldn't stand it. Actors are so incredibly bad as though it's a porn movie.I absolutely do not recommend this godawful thing.			"

												Sadly I can’t recommend this remake.  While the story and gameplay remain relatively true to the original, the technical improvements are a mixed bag.  It feels like they tried to put a quick coat of paint onto an old piece of wood.  It lacks the charm of the original game, which I’d recommend over the remake.			"

												After played another Phoenix game - Cognition, I really have quite high expection on this one.But I disappointed..........Puzzle level is really HARD, but the story is  weak and sometimes non-sense.How is possible a person could take his own heart out?Some part of the game is fun, but most not.......

												I guess this game is only for those adventure gamers that want that nostalgic experience.This game started getting on my nerves very soon. There are very good point and click games out there, for example the latest broken sword part. That was an excellent one, but Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition I can not recommend.  "

												Gabriel Knight: SotF twenty years on is still a great thriller-esque story. Dealing with the primary theme of Voodoo, it's easy to tell throughout the game that rather than a shallow Hollywood approach, extensive research was made to make its portrayal of the subject authentic. Whether it actually is or not I have no idea, but it at least feels that way through the 10 hours or so it'll take to play.In the early 1990's this & similar titles such as Broken Sword pre-dated the rise in popularity of historical based thrillers from the likes of Dan Brown which arrived ten years later along with their subsequent movie adaptations. So fast forwarding to 2015, another ten years later,  new comers to this game might feel the original uniqueness of the premise a little played out.This modern adapation of the original, has strayed away from the CGA style backgrounds and pixel art sprites of the original to a somewhat cheap looking 3D render engine with some backgrounds redrawn more painter-esque.I feel this kills the atmosphere & tension that was underlying the suspense & dread of the original, especially when it reguarly freezes up and characters perform odd actions (such as Gabriel lifting his telephone by what looks telekinesis).The voice acting has also been redone, with Gabriel (originally by Tim Curry) now having a rather emotionless deep southern drawl. Initially grating, I did become accustomed towards it, but it's not a spot on the original voice. It's also missing (what was then) a star VA cast such as Mark Hamill, now replaced with unknowns. I presume the rights to the originals were too expensive to obtain but it suffers overall as a result. Audio cuts out before the dialogue lines are finished and the interface which could have actually done with an overhaul feels clunky and inefficient.They've changed the character portraits and design of several characters. This may have been an attempt to make the game seem less dated, but as all the newspaper dates in game are still in 1994 I don't think Gabriel having his original era themed haircut is a problem that needed addressing.Some positives have been added such as developer commentary & a retry option for when you die, meaning that saving every 10 minutes isn't crucial (though you probably should anyway, this is a Sierra title after-all). The comic style cutscenes are also quite impressively done.While still one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, if you're not a newcomer to the genre & can appreciate the /feel/ that pixel art used to offer,  I'd recommend sticking with the original over this remake. If you're looking for a solid story with challenging but mostly fair and logical puzzles to solve then you won't go wrong with this modern, yet slightly flawed, take on a classic.			"

												This game is great, although I have a gut feeling that the original experience in its day was probably slightly better.This kind of game-play really suits me, as I am a working dad, and usially ""play-time"" is sparse. Much of the game is exploring static sites, and the concept of daily events is cool. I can play this at evenings. sometimes only for 10-15 minutes exploring a site, or simply having one conversation, and I still feel that I have achieved something, furthered my progress...,It's kind of retro, without being retro. Its a perfect combination. -Besides, New Orleans is an awesome settiing for the ""Voodoo murders""!!If you think you might enjoy this, then you probably will. For me this game has certainly given more enjoyment than many other recent games.

												Fantastic remake. The graphics are stunning compared with the original game, but of course 20 years of technology help that along.  I liked the new voice-overs too.  They couldn't get the original actors, but if they had, the original actors are now 20 years older as well, so it makes sense to have a new crew.   The music is improved by an order of magnitude as well.  I liked the fact that Jane Jensen did not mess with the original story, although certain theings got moved to happen on certain days to balance out the game play.  There is also a new graphic novel that tells the back-story -- from several hundred years before.  It's available from the game menu.  There's also a lot of additional content available on every scene, comparing the old to new images as well as interviews with members of the original crew.  The additional content is also available from the game menu (in the Archive).  I definitely recommend the Gabriel Knight remake as one of, if not the best, adventure game ever.			"

												Never played the original but did play GK2 the beast within when I was a kid.Puzzles are very challenging and I had to go back to the walkthrough every now and then to know what to do next. This gane is a classic and reminds me of those 90s cheezy adventure games with very hard difficulty spikes. Artwork is amazing and VO is top notch, though I would prefer Tim Curry and Mark Hamill from the original game. Love the gothic style atmosphere and dark themes. Overall story starts out pretty good but the latter end was a bit boring. Still a highly recommended game. 7.5/10			"

It was brought up to modern times without destroying what made it great in the past. If I had to pick on something it would be the voice cast. And that is not saying that they did a bad job, its just so hard to live up the excellent original voices. If you liked the original, then you should get this version as well. And if you have never played the original then do yourself a favor and buy both this and the original. Either way you will enjoy one of the best adventure games made.			"

												I did not have a chance to play the original Gabriel Knight in the 1990s, for some reason I played through Monkey Island series, and then gravitated towards RPG games.Now 20 years later I find myself with a girlfriend that adores mystery and adventure games, AND who played through all the best Point&Click games of the 1990s, however never finished Gabriel Knight. Needless to say we sat down and powered through the game on a Sunday.The game is very, very enjoyable. The graphics are beautiful, I especially liked the hand-drawn backgrounds, reminding me of the Monkey Island series.For people worried about the lack of logic to the puzzles - fear not. I'm happy to say majority of them are quite straightforward, and after a moment you can figure out what to do. If you are still stuck the game introduces a GENIUS hint system, which tells you what you should do to move the plot forward.To sum up - very well done remaster of an incredible game. Glad I played it.			"

												Honestly, I haven't played the original, but this game was fantastic, so much fun. I love that the concept art is included so you can see how the designs changed and improved from the original -- there's still a little bit of that early 90s feel too. The only aspects that needed improvement were the controls, which were slow or unresponsive at times (Gabe strolls at crucial moments), and some glitchy character models (Exorcist-style head spinning). Other than that, everything from the soundtrack to the ending is pretty satisfying for someone who likes urban fantasy/mystery plots that don't take themselves too seriously. It makes me wish that this game sold well enough at release to increase the chances of a sequel.			"

												As a remake of an old game it does quite well, but seriously, they dug out the old version and put it on steam for less.If you're here because you're already a fan, turn yourself around and go play the original, there is nothing for you here. If you're here because you heard its awesome, it is. Buy it, play it, then buy the origonal and play that for the better voices, better music and classic feel.  "

												I've never played the original gabriel knight games, so I'm new into the storyline, but I gotta say, if you're a story driven gamer Like me, you should give this one a go.Basically, Play it for the marvelous story, the gameplay is good, not great, but  if the graphics are an important factor in your gaming experience.... steer clear of it.First the good:The Story is interesting and develops at a nice rate, and draws you in with every chapter - or day - you play through.You follow gabriel Knight, a writer that investigates a series of murders with voodoo roots in New orleans in 1993 with the police department for his supposed best seller, and then the story grows deeper.I found it quite charming that they didnt try and modernize it, quite refreshing.The voice acting is quite good, and the scripts are witty and enjoyable. 10/10 in this part.Now... the bad:being this a point and click you wont expect QTEs or car chases, or fighting segments, But the characters could move in a really disturbingly clunky way. You need gabriel to go to on side of a room to get... a pair of scissors. he will crawl there, take the scissors, say something and then, there's a pause.Its a couple of seconds in which the character stays still, you cant control it, or order any actions and you just have to wait for it to pass. Its as if you took the scissors, and then needed to look at them and think ""oh these are scissors, Scissors cut stuff. NOW i can move on"". This was a recurring thing and it broke down the flow of the game more often than it should.Another thing, that really disappointed me, was the appearance. It was a bit all over the place. I'm not obsessed with graphics, but its a bit of an eyesore that You're playing a remaster issued somewhere between 2013/14 and the models seem to be out of the sims 1, with clunky animations and odd textures. This by itself isn't bad, but you have beautifully painted backgrounds and lovely cutscenes in a painting like style. THEN you had another style of art in the same game, when you interacted with NPCs. Two drawn portraits would appear over the game with facial animations that sometimes cutted down the drawing on the lip or brow area and that had Nothing to do with the cutscenes Nor the game models.  I would love love love to see it in some sort of animated style like... I don't know, any of the daedalic games, consistent and according to the marvelous story.			"

												Never played the original but did play GK2 the beast within when I was a kid.Puzzles are very challenging and I had to go back to the walkthrough every now and then to know what to do next. This gane is a classic and reminds me of those 90s cheezy adventure games with very hard difficulty spikes. Artwork is amazing and VO is top notch, though I would prefer Tim Curry and Mark Hamill from the original game. Love the gothic style atmosphere and dark themes. Overall story starts out pretty good but the latter end was a bit boring. Still a highly recommended game. 7.5/10			"

												I never played the original. I enjoyed this one story very mutch.Gabriel is a bit slimmy and creepy ( who owns just white tshirts and jeans? ) and his voice is so creepy, it takes a bit to get used to. But the story is quite nice and the other characters ""normal"" and interesting.Some puzzles felt a bit obscure.Overrall it is a good game.			"

The remake is amazing.Textures, animations, SOUNDTRACK, and STYLE of the traditional point and click is mastered in this game.Learned everything about the Voudoun (voodoo) culture that possibly exists.

												I can't understand how I could have missed this game before. It just the kind of games I like! A very strong and interesting story (Based on the comics that I recommend too!) The remastered version is well elaborate and the graphics are beautiful. Beside the seriousness of the happenings the story line has some humoristics aspects that makes this game so unique. I strongly recommend it!  "

												A solid point and click game. With some good characters. Great story/plot. Intersting with some decent /good twist. Is pretty hard . But, thanksfully you got a hint box that can help you if your stuck even tough i have to admit that i had to use a walktrough on some parts. Cant say to much towards it soundtrack i played it mainly on mute (reasons). The puzzles makes sense enough. And is just long enough too, so it dont overstay it welcome, yeah i recommned it and while the gameplay and how you combine and use itmes might be a little difficult at the beggining you will eventually get the track of it sooner or later.NB: there are some circumstances you have to do things in a specific order.  Witch is pretty lame as it might in worst case force you save over a other save files, thus i suggest you to have at least two saves after each in \ game day.			"

												Paulliee TVGabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is one of the greatest Point N Click adventure games ever made, So this remake has a lot to live up to and for me this is the best remake of any Point N Click game so far, it truly lives up to expectations and even exceeds them in many areas, the artwork all the way down to the dialogue and music is just superbIs is a must buy game that truly puts the classic series back into the modern era10/10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwp1-vl7tVQ "

												""Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers"" (1993) - great classic quest by Jane Jensen, like the rest of the GK trilogy.Original game looks like dark thriller, sometimes in goth style. Atmosphere of the remake - brighter (lighter colors all around) and a bit cheerier.""20th Anniversary Edition is a bit more linear than the original... Many general background animations have been removed or not included... Some characters completely removed, or replaced with non-speaking individuals..."" General Changes between original GK and 20th Anniversary Edition [gabrielknight.wikia.com]My advice - better buy the original version of the ""GK"" and enjoy an excellent adventure game. I recommend this ""20th Anniversary Edition"" only if you hate old-school pixel graphics.GK1 Original:   8/10GK1 20th Anniversary Edition:   5/10			"

												I loved Gabriel Knight Sins of the Fathers when it first came out and playing this new re-make makes me so happy, it's like falling in love all over again. To be honest I do not think it would have been the same just playing the old game because after 20 years you have higher expectations of resolution and graphics (at least I do). Now I just hope that there will be more re-makes of the other two GK games.10/10			"

												The first adventure game I recall playing was Adventure and Zork on my Atari 800XL. I sucked at both, and don't recall I ever completed either, or even got pass the first or second rooms! By the time I got my first PC I'd missed most of the golden age of point and click adventures and didn't really buy any until a few years back when GoG first got started. Since then I've bought and played quite a few, but this is the first ""remastered"" game I've played.Gabriel Knight is a pretty ace game. I think I'll have to buy the originals from GoG so that I can check out the second and third games as they (currently) don't have a remastered version. It will also be interesting to see how the original voice cast works (Michael Dorn is always a favorite of mine). It will also be interesting to see the old graphics - the Anniversary Edition content doesn't really show much, bar some very very low res images of the different locations.As for the remake. Well. At first I thought I was going to hate the game as I didn't like Gabriel's voice at all. Fortunately that passed and I got used to it. I thought the voice acting was well done, and the audio overall fit nicely.Graphically, the game is pleasing, often with photorealistic textures and subtle animations. But at the same time, the 3D feel of the game is decidely ""off"". Scenes look flat with 3D characters just plonked on top. Hard to describe but readily visible. Mind you, it didn't detract too much from the game, and the fact that the backgrounds were more subtly coloured than interactive objects meant that it was easier to see things to pick up etc, without the asinine ""glow"" effects that modern games have embraced. The comic book style cut scenes were nice too.The story was pretty cool and kept me interested all the way through.There were some minor bugs though, for example at once point my journal got updated with an entry. Fair enough you might think, the journal updates as you progress through the game. Unfortunately it updated with an entry which had nothing to do with the puzzle I'd just solved, but instead with a piece of information that was a bit of a spoiler for part of the game I'd yet to do. Slightly annoying, but nothing too serious. More humourous were the occasions where the characters perhaps thought they were Beetlejuice, and their heads would rapidly spin around. Happened a few times and got a good chuckle each time.Some of these adventure games are hit and miss with me, and are either incredibly easy, or so difficult I just end up following the script from a walkthrough. GK was inbetween this, I did have to revert to a walkthrough two or three times (although it has a built in hint system I never activated it), but on the whole the game was logical (albient occasionally bizzare in said logic) and not to taxing on the old noggin.Final game score 360/362... dammit Jim!

												Voodoo down in the Bayou.  You play as Gabriel Knight, a sometimes successful, sometimes creepy, playboy and author.  You haven't sold a book in like, forever, but that doesn't stop you from owning a book shop in downtown New Orleans and employing Grace, your assistant who helps you with writing and managing your shop.  She also stays even though you can't pay her- and despite your *constant* creepy advances.  Currently you are working on a new book involving voodoo and it just so happens there has been a string of ""Voodoo Murders"" in the Crescent city.  You happen to be buds with one of the detectives on the case and ask him if you might look around....for the story, of course...  I'm not normally drawn to these kinds of game, the point and click genre, but between Alpha Polaris and Gabriel Knight, I'm hooked and looking for more.  Also you get to learn about voodoo.  Who do?  You do.  Do what?  Learn about the voodoo.Pros: This game intrigued me and sat on my wishlist for nearly a year before I got it cheap on a sale.  At first the game seemed a little slow figuring out the interface and the controls, and the story seemed wanting in the beginning, but when the wheels start turning, they start turning good and fast.  The story hooked me and though the ending was a little ""meh"", I felt overall joyed by this game.  The art and visuals were appealing, and the voice acting was actually good, despite me initially hating Gabriel's accent - I've grown to like it now.  Cons: Plotwise, I did have to check the internet every so often for clues on what to do next to keep the story progressing. And not innocent clues like ""the key you need to unlock the door is on the shelf next to it, you silly!"" but more of ""You need to pull the lever in the basement to open the secret panel on the wall in the dining room to access the hidden keypad where you dial 39A90 to open the garage door so you can get the rock to smash the kitchen window to scare the bird so it drops the key.  But you have to talk to Paul first so he can tell you the code, and if you don't talk to him the code won't work.""  There were at least three instances of this where there was no indication as what to do next.  The first one, without spoiling involves a mime, a hotdog, and a small child. Good luck!Overall: 9.5/10			"

												Lovely remake of an adventure classic. It has an intriguing story and most of the time first class voice acting. Music, background and character are quite compelling, too.Unfortunately it also suffers from some severe problems: Lots of animations are glitching and look weird, some puzzles are being unnecessarily hard, because of the pathing of Gabriel and this is very subjective: The voice actors for the narrator and Gabriel are both rather special. I got around to liking the narrator, but Gabriel's voice actor sounds like a fifty year old pervert, sorry.Overall I still enjoyed to play it and it's a real shame they won't do the other Gabriel games as well.
