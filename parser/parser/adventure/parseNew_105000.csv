												A New Beginning tries to share a positive message about climate change, our future, and our resistance to change, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The game is not terrible: it has its good points, and if you've ever wanted to play a dimwitted token female with a seemingly quite severe case of scoliosis who wears a sweater that covers only her boobs, then this definitely is your game.Pros:+Good message+The art is quite nice+The ruined future setting that occurs near the start of the game is very compelling+The support team answered my emails quickly and were very helpful when I encountered a game-breaking bugCons:-The English voice acting is atrocious. If you want to play the game, set the sound the German with English subtitles - the German voice acting isn't too bad.-The English translation is not very good. There are a lot of grammatical errors and problems with colloquialisms that really should have been caught by a native English speaking proofreader before the game was published.-There are a lot of bugs. Mainly I encountered translation bugs: various items popping up in Russian or Spanish. I also found a game-breaking bug, however, which required a replacement save file from the support team to get past.-Everyone moves so slowly that I found myself screaming at the monitor a few times. Quickly, we must hit that switch before the facility explodes! Now, let me just take a leisurely stroll across the room. Wouldn't want to work up a sweat.-The game is extremely resource-heavy, and I can't figure out why. My computer heats up while running this game as much as it does while playing a modern shooter.-Many of the puzzles are absurd. Several of them require knowledge that the average person just wouldn't have. I needed a walkthrough to get through most of it, and many times I realized I would never in a million years have thought to try the thing that ended up being necessary. There's also a fair amount of pixel-hunting for tiny items that blend in.-Between the slow movement speed of the characters and the seemingly never-ending cutscenes and dialog, by the time I was 1/3 of the way through the game I just wanted it to end.-The ending isn't nearly as clever as it's trying to be, and felt rather anti-climactic after all those hours of listening to people talk and watching them crawl across the screen to the sound of suspenseful music.If you can get the game cheap, enjoy ridiculous puzzles, and have a lot of patience for slow movement and long cutscenes, then feel free to give this one a try. If you're used a faster pace or just want something you feel you can solve without a walkthrough, I'd pass this one over.			"

												A New Beginning - Final Cut is a point and click adventure game that contains a strong graphic novel aesthetic to all its cutscenes, but it’s the beautifully rendered 2D artwork that brings the world to life. Daedalic’s previous releases such as Deponia and Edna & Harvey had a similar aspect but overemphasized color and cartoony humor. The tone here is much darker as it complements the rather dire storyline. The backdrops are beautiful and the character models have a much more realistic style to them than we’ve come to expect from the developer. The mixture of early 80s haircuts and futuristic technology somehow goes well together. It also helps the aesthetic that the music in this game is perfect with a sensational orchestrated soundtrack that goes beyond expectations.While it can be a bit preachy about using up all natural resources, melting the polar icecaps, and destroying Earth through human ignorance and greed, you feel a bond between characters, and even the world, that a lot of games fail to establish.The characters evolve through the story, properly accepting their roles and feelings towards certain situations.It's not often that I consider a game hard to put down, but I found myself getting deeply invested in the plot as it unravelled thanks to its convincing characterisation and an increasingly gripping storyline. Although there's an obvious environmental focus, there's also a strong heart to the story and it's this that powers your desire to play on.The puzzles are solid as I have found myself stumped on several for near half an hour.In short, I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy point and click games. Be sure to check out the Deponia trilogy if you have not already.			"

""Steam. Not smoke.""A New Beginning is one of Daedalic Entertainments' ""pretty good idea, done nonchalantly"" games. Thus, it is a great potential story wrecked with many bugs, bad translation and a half-baked ending. I had really some major expectations from this game, with themes such as time travelling, environmental pollution and mass awareness but... No, it doesn't cut. This is not how it's done. This is not how it should be done. All this tension, all these ominous warnings, all this thrill and this action... and this ending? This is not a climax! Are you mocking me?Sorry, my annoyance gets the best of me sometimes. It's storytelling time. Here, we have the elderly Norwegian bioengineer Bent Svensson who spent all his life working in the laboratory to produce energy from algae for the production of safe energy in hopes for a better future for the planet. After a breakdown that he suffers due to exhaustion, Bent is sent to retirement - the purgatory of a workaholic. He now lives in a small cabin in Norwegian Fjords, away from work, away from stress and away from responsibility. ""Calm down, Bent"" says his psychiatrist. ""You are not responsible of saving the world"".Oh, she couldn't be more wrong! Bent Svensson's silent misery in retirement is suddenly interrupted by the visit of Fay, an odd young woman who claims that she time travelled from the future to find him. According to Fay, she comes from a future where the mother earth is at her limits and about to perish for good due to years of pollution, violent climate changes and toxicity. As part of an operation called 'the Phoenix Plan' she is sent to the past to prevent a disaster from happening to alter the course of time. ""Only you, Bent"" says Fay, ""Only you can save the world!”I know I was intrigued after the brief introduction to the game. The environmental theme, financial conspiracies, bioengineering, time travel, ecoterrorism... What else I can expect from a sci-fi environmental adventure? Right? Sadly there is a truckload of bugs and irritable mistakes within this game which will simmer down your enthusiasm. There is a common bug that makes your inventory unreachable, thus unable to complete an action to progress which triggers a couple of times, starting with the end of chapter 2. You should either ask Daedalic support for a save game where the bug isn't triggered, or pray you got plenty of your saves to try again.The graphics are beautiful, this is already a trademark for Daedalic. Cinematic cut scenes are arranged in a comic-style manner where comic panels are presented with speech bubbles over characters, alongside voice acting. The comic style character artwork is a great idea of presentation, but my issue comes with the translation. As Daedalic being a German firm, I assume for original voice acting and script to be in German. So the English translation is... well, horrible. Word puns and scientific explanations are totally lost. There are many, many spelling errors within texts. The speaking animations do continue long after the voice acting is already stopped. With all these errors, it becomes really hard to get into mood and take either character or the story seriously.About the gameplay itself, it is your basic point and click adventure. Item combinations do make sense, and nearly always they go along with an engineering view point. Lots of things to fix, physical reactions to mind, machines to manage and operate. Thus, it becomes obscure sometimes for you to be able to think of needed ways to progress. Puzzles themselves are very realistic, to a degree of - yet again, becoming obscure. I am usually very good at solving such puzzles without a walkthrough, but in the case of this specific game, I gave up. I personally think there is no one who would be able to solve all puzzles without the help of a walkthrough for this game.I do not give up on games with good stories due to bugs, really. If I managed to play Anna to the end, and enjoyed every single moment of it, I'm positive bugs do not pull me down. My problem was the negligence in story persistency all together. Some characters made a shallow appearance and remain unvisited and unmentioned for the rest of the story, which prevents us from emphasizing with them altogether. Aside the character of Bent Svensson himself maybe, characters aren't more than some pictures with speech bubbles. There is no personality, no cause-effect relationship in their actions, no reasoning to their thoughts or dialogues. There were some character inconsistencies, like a trained radio operative like Fay being borderline clumsy, just to force the storyline in a predetermined course. Every disaster or twist in the storyline is foreseeable and determined, aside from a really anticlimactic ending.All in all, this is a mediocre game with incredible potential wasted terribly. Am I sorry that I played this? No, not at all. Gave me some thinking to do on the theme itself of course. But nothing I wouldn't get from reading Greenpeace bulletin or National Geographic. On sci-fi terms, I'll keep reading H.G. Wells.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												So, i read the reviews on here. Everyone is going on about bad voice acting. Blah, blah. Really ? Ok, so let me help you if you are interested in this. Buy it. Play and finish it. This game is worth your money and your time. That is the bottom line. I loved the subject matter, and the game made me feel a sense of loss when i finished playing it as i grew close to the characters. Thus, it has a great story and great characters. Could the voice acting have been better ? Sure. But i played this for the adventure. There is a message here in this game, and i feel it is a good and honest message. Look after our planet and our children will have a place to live. It creates a sense of loss and longing as it shows you what could happen if we dont change our ways. It was a really great thought provoking graphic novel. And it will stick in my head for a long time to come. The puzzles are good, i could solve some of them quite easy. They are challenging, but not impossible at all. This game has a lot of emotion in it, It made me think back to old adventure games in the 80s. It has some great level design and locations.I love the art style and the color palette because it fits the game perfectly, creating the right mood. Helping to create a world that pulls you in and keeps you there. Everything compliments each other well, and creates the Ambience tied together with a great musical score. I really would like a sequel to the game, and would buy it for sure.			"

												Classic point & click game with an interesting thriller / sci-fi story. It's also pretty big game, it took me around 9-10 hours to complete it. The problem-solving in the game can be solved with mostly logical thinking, but there might be some puzzles and problems that seems a bit out there - not Lucas Arts out there if you know what I mean. The only thing that drags it down is the terrible english voice-acting (the voice-acting might be better in another language though). The lead female sounds like a robot from time to time. The story also gets a bit weird and ""jumpy"" at the end. But still. I would recommend the game. It's a fun sci-fi thriller with a message.			"

												Adding together all the elements, playful and creative, A New Beginning is not hard to be recommended as a purchase more than recommended to lovers of adventure games as well as the best the genre has been able to express, looking at the outputs in the shops and the main ones in digital delivery, in 2011. the sci-environmental theme is treated in a serious and interesting, used as background for telling stories and characters that accompany the player in the completion of a good number of puzzles, designed for variety and challenge. Too bad for some high and low and smudging techniques that are repeated in the products signed Daedalic Entertainment, otherwise fantastic in terms of design and artistic qualities.			"

												Overall - lacking.The graphics are pleasing enough, and the music is nice. That said, the English voice acting is simply atrocious. A reader program is better to listen to, the intonation has nothing to do with the emotional content of the dialogue, and sometimes it's just plain wrong for English.Oh, and the character design. Why does Fay have a uniform including a sweater that ends under her boobs? And does she have a back problem? She stands and walks with her spine bent in a highly unnatural shape, which is just painful to look at.The characters themselves are also shallow, and even though in some reviews I've read about 'character development', that mostly means that they grow from one-dimensional to maybe two. And that's for the protagonists. About one of the main supporting characters, Duve, all I got to know was that a: he's upset with his father (understandably) for sacrificing their family for his work, yet b: he continues his father's work out of some sort of duty perhaps, though he claims to hate it, and c: he's gay. The latter had nothing whatsoever to do with anything, apart from mentioning that Bent ""would have been okay with it"", and providing a clue for solving a puzzle. Talk about token minority.The plot seemed forced sometimes, and after the final plot twist, had motivation issues at some points in retrospect. All-in-all, it felt rather forced and didactic, and the conclusion really didn't make much sense to me.Certainly not a game I will ever play again, and not one I could recommend, as much as I'd like to promote eco-conscious games. Only reason I played it through was that I hoped for satisfactory ending. I didn't get it.			"

												It's a neat game that I would say. The message that game tries to convey is pretty great and so far this is one of the point and click adventure with a different genre - ""eco triller"". Let's take a look at the pros and cons of the game and my verdict Pros 1. I really love the comic book style , it reminds me of XIII . Superb , something which was not done in this genre2. The game's humour is great as pointed out by someone in the review , you'll have some good laughs every now and then3. The length of game is long , it took me about 12 hours to complete it. It's not short , there are lots of things to explore4. The ending is superb5. Good price point (buy it during sales as it is worth it) 6. The ability to skip puzzles Now there are some serious flaws in this game as well which sort of ruins the whole gameplay experience Cons 1.  Could not understand some puzzles at all . Some of it I was totally lost.  It was nice to have the skip button but I am a kind of person that wants to finish puzzle.2. The whle 4:3 resolution , it is very bad if you have a huge screen , this makes it annoying finding things. I did not know about the space bar feature to reveal all the clickable items , I had a hard time finding some of the pixels. I am guessing this is because of the hand-drawn graphics and such3. Spelling errors and gramamatical errors - There is a lot of the game. Some of the options are in another language such as in Russian or Greek. I do hope that the developers did put some effort at least in ensuring that these are ironed out. English is not my primary language but even I could see the errors that they make.4. Subpar voice acting , I felt the voice actors lacked of emotion especially in certain parts/events of the game. They just sounded bland , lacked of soul and depth Verdict Just grab this game if it goes on sale , and if you are an adventure fan who is into a totally new genre of story (not the typical ones you woul expect !). Despite the drawbacks , it is still a good game to play. You'll have to give credits to the details esepcially the backdrops and sch "

												One of my first computers games was Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and that game set me along life with a love of point 'n' click adventure games. I've played them all by now, but like a good addict, I am still trying to find the one that will give me an experience like playing Kings Quest VI, Day of the Tentacle, or Sam and Max: Hit the Road again for the first time. ""A New Beginning"" does not do the trick, but it is a good start for a genre that has seem some revitalization in the past few years.The Good:* Although it may be odd to say this, I really love the menu UIs in this game. They're unique and very fitting for a game that has comic-book style cutscenes.* While many point 'n' click adventure games suffer from ""find the pixel"" syndrome, A New Beginning ends this frustration by letting the player highlight every point of interest on the screen by holding down the space bar. This might be a negative if you're a hardcore player, I  suppose.* I see people complaining about the game's length on the internet (they think it's too short). This game is long! I felt the game was about to end while I played chapter 6, and compared its length to Day of the Tentacle. Little did I realize the game was far from over and there were actually 8 chapters!* Puzzles are straight-forward - there are no ridiculous puzzles and I only resorted to the ""try every item on every item"" strategy once or twice. That being said, this game is slightly easier than every other point and click adventure game I have played in recent memory. The easiness is due largely to the generous verbal clues. A guy says ""I can't hear?"" Try the megaphone. Your character says ""not with my bare hands?"" Try using an item. If you play the first three chapters thinking the game is a walk in the park, though, just wait until the later chapters - it gets much more difficult!* Although it is now pretty much standard for the genre, I do appreciate the fact that there is no way to ""screw up"" and ruin your game by using the wrong item somewhere, or by dying.* The game's humor, although used much too infrequently, is top-notch and intelligent.* The ending is really, really, really good. I won't spoil it for you, but if you didn't enjoy the game, the ending might make it pay off for you.* Goes for as little as $2.49 during Steam sales.The Bad:* Some puzzles are a bit weird. I thought I had assembled an antenna, but could not figure out why the game would not let me progress further despite having used all parts in all possible configurations. I used the handy ""solve puzzle"" feature and learned that I had only built about half of the antenna, somehow. With no way to go back and solve the puzzle legitimately, I shrugged and moved on.* Because of its hand-drawn graphics, the game only runs in a 4:3 aspect ratio.* No pause feature that I could find - I missed two semi-important cutscenes because I accidentally pressed escape, thinking it might pause the dialogue.* There are a large number of bug reports on the Steam Forums. The only bug I encountered was an item (a valve on an oil rig) that was not highlighted when I pressed space, and would not let me interact with it until I got very close to it. I encountered the same bug later with a receptionist at the power plant.The Ugly:* Frequent grammar and spelling errors, and most of the dialogue is quite awkward. Although the voice-acting is remarkably bad, the voice artists honestly didn't have much to work with: awkward sentence constructions, phrases that should have been abbreviated, etc. At one infuriating point in the game, there is a puzzle having to do with language in Chapter 4, but the solution makes little to no sense in English. I stumbled upon the correct solution by accident. Some words in the game were never translated to English at all, or were incorrectly translated to Russian or Spanish. The developers could certainly have done a bit better with localization for the English version.The Verdict:Give this one a play if you are into point 'n' click adventure games. It is not as good as Daedelic's other big game, ""Deponia,"" but still a solid game and avoids some of the mistakes that Deponia made. I would definitely recommend anyone to at least give it a try if you see it on sale for $5 or less.			"

												[WARNING. SPOILERS]this is the first Daedalic Entertainment game i've finished and... actually regretted playing.This game has the potential to be a fun, enjoyable game. Puzzles, tricky areas that would not be the automatic response and even an additional level of depth to point and click that allows for pop-up actions (more about that in the negatives.). As always with Daedalic Entertainment, it's beautiful to look at and tha characters are... more or less believable. They make sense and seem easy enough to relate to. Daedalic Entertainment have also coined a 'hold Space to show Items you can interact with', this has made me so much more likley to buy one of their games just for that aspect alone! the character animations, although simple and repetative, always seem mostly in place and with exception of a few moments (if you want to pick) usually look perfectly fine and don't break immersion at all.However... the entire game paints the image of 'the world is ending, it's climate change but you can fix it'. at no point did I feel hopful for the characters.We're dealing with an aeged man who has ruined his relationship with his family, estranged his son and apparently made very little effort to fix that. you're also playing as a person who, during the entire game I was expecting to turn out to be lying to me and was unfortunatley not dissapointed. The 'good guys' turn out to be... well... kind of pathetic, sad and myserable people that I didn't want to even think existed, let alone play them for the whole game. The antagonists were rather unbelievably over-evil (MWAHAHAHAA! I WILL PAVE OVER THE WORLD TO MAKE A GLORIOUS SEAL-SKIN CAR-PARK!) and the storyline rather felt overly preachy...The entire cast were unpleasant in even degrees... in fact, the person I liked the most was a doorman with an anger problem and a complex about his baldness!The general gameplay is point-and-click with the occasional puzzle. The puzzles were good and mostly self-explanatory, but the point-and-click was point-and-hold-aim-and-click for everytbing... that took extra time that was not needed when right-click-to-examine and left-click to walk to, pick up, adjust etc. would have sufficed.The right-click for inventory was not actually needed at any point and could easily have been removed entirely and replaced by having the inventory there all the time. the only time it became needed to quickly open your inventory is if a game-event had closed it for you.I did not feel like I had anyone on my side in the entire game. When i'm playing as him, i'm waiting for her to♥♥♥♥♥♥him over. When i'm playing as her, i'm waiting for us to do something strange and un-kocher.The son, he was downright unpleasant. The old-friend from work was needlessly suspicious and came across as kaniving in places. The best-friend seemed... well... i don't know all that well beause i was honestly expecting him to mess us over too! he was too nice compared to the rather unpleasant crowd we were already in!I can't complain enough about the worst of humanity in this. We have cheaters, liars, mercinaries, needless aggression, paranoia, disbelief, angst and all the other shades of things you don't want to spend an afternoon immersed in.The storyline of 'time travlers come back to fix the world' is great. I was all for that! the idea of them coming back from a climate-desolate wasteland is a perfectly stable platform... what fails however is that they drop a plot-twist on us that... well, let's face it was rather un-needed!""we came to this reactor to stop it blowin up!"" becomes ""we came here to blow it up""... umm... why?Honestly, it boiled down to 'grab that stuff and run for it!'. the machevilian ""let's tell the goodie all my plans"" was old before this game was made and really made the ending of this... a total mess!I've seen twist endings, back-track endings, not-as-you-expeted-it endings, the-goodie-is-the-baddie-is-the-goodie endings... but the sudden change of heart makes your one character seem totally heartless or a derranged sociopath, the baddie is... let's face it, totally insane for his plans and the other baddie is desperatley in need of a lead-lobotomy!""it's ok, we reconciled this kid with his father and even managed to bring his sexuality into it almost out of the blue without any apparent reason""...umm... yay?what have we resolved here? One character we were really not that set up to like has got fame, another character we probably should not dislike this much is going back to killing himself with over-work and his son, who needs to get a grip for most the game, is all right now?you might as well have written ""and they all lived happily ever after""!Oh, but it's ok, that person who let themselves get baked in radioactive steam instead of getting into one of the many easy-to-access doors on that level left you a picture to remember how she and all the other people you met from her time betrayed your trust, nearly got you and your family killed, killed off one of your oldest friends, destroyed most of your life's work and... should I go on?The ending felt forced, bolted on and almost irrelevant to the rest of the game. The problem was that whole areas of the game had the same feeling.""this is a great big conspiracy"" why? everything points that way. Everyone says it's an accident and refuses to talk more about it... soooooooo? Why was everyone acting needlessly suspicious? No apparent reason. One person takes it to their grave and the other betrays you brutally without any kind of apology.I actually felt miserable finishing this game. The gaming completionist in me refused to step away, but I was damn close! had the ending not appeared when it did, i would not have finished the game.""No matter how beautiful the weapon is, it will hurt no less when turning against you""Technical bugs were rife in the game. Many areas had options that were not translated. clicking on one item to examine blinked the subtitle and played no audio so if there was any useful information there, i missed thatThere are parts where the subtitles run off in the FMV but the audio has not even started.The dialogue overlaps itself, jumps pitch and volume mid-sentance, often lacks the correct inflection for the mood it's used and sometimes comes across as just plain wooden and eerie.One moment, i'd be listening and the voice sounds warm and involving... while describing an inane object... then to describe something important, it sounds cold and emotionless? the mixed signals in this were easy enough to overlook, but when it changed pitch, volume and feel mid-sentance? split-personalities or bad dubbing...There were miss-spelt subtitles, incorrect words and sometimes, the wrong used entirely.Top it all off with the common feel of mid-eighties cartoons where the baddie just wants to make a new motorway or spill oil into the sea and realising that they might as well be brow-beating you for having the light on. Honestly, i would not have been surprised to find that this was endorsed by an extremist wing of a climate change activist group!Yes, we get that nuclear power isn't the best, let's all feel damn sad for this. now, how dare you have multiple monitors on. We all poison every living thing in the woods for no particularly well-explained reason. Deforestation, fossil fuels, melting ice-caps... Anyone remember this from school? I DO care about the environment, I'm happy to recycle, I proudly turn off lights and electrical devices not in use and rarely use more than what I need... I don't need a game to make me feel guilty for the environment change. I would urge point-and-click enthusiasts  to buy ANY Deponia title instead of this. If you want somethin a little more serious, buy 'night of the rabbit'. Daedalic Entertainment deserve all the support they can get, but this game is going to a special place in my ""games I regretted playing"" list.			"

												A New Beginning is a point and click adventure game, by the German based developer Daedalic Entertainment. Hence, the English dub of the game leaves a lot to be asked for. Many of the intonations are painfully out of place, though the voices do match the characters to some degree. The German version suffers from none of these issues and is quite nicely voiced. If you're able to, I'd recomend playing that version. The game itself is your standard adventure, not really genre defining or groundbreaking, but the puzzles are well designed and have a good flow to them. There is relatively little scrounging around for items, and although you may be stumped from time to time, you probably won't require a guide to help you through. The visuals are also quite nice, the game has a comic book aesthetic which is a good match. The game's biggest failing probably lies in its heavy handed plot which is constantly trying to shove the dangers of global warming and nuclear down your throat. Though the writing is at times quite clever most of the time the game sounds like that environmental science class you had to sit through in 7th grade. The story is generally pretty sound, but starts to fizzle out at the end. Overall it's a well-crafted game with a plot that doesn't live up to the polish of the rest. I recomend it if you're a fan of adventure games, but if you aren't you're not missing out on much.			"

Search the Scene, Inventory Items, Puzzles & Dialogue.  5/10.Very cool story about Time-Travel & Eco-Disaster.  7/10.Kinda comic-book looking graphics, that sometimes unravel down the page in panels (like a comic) as the story/ dialogue unfolds.  6/10.Music was appropriate for the different scenes, & the Voice Acting was fine.  6/10.All in all, i really liked the story (no spoilers from me, read the Store page), which is why i play these types of games. The puzzles were fairly straight forward once you think about them a bit. I got this on sale for 99cents, so i got great value for my (almost) $1, but i'm not sure if i'd feel the same if i'd paid the normal $9.99.If you like Point & Click games with a decent story, then you probably already own this game anyway, but if u don't, & you see it on sale (usually 99cents), then get it for sure.A New Begining- Final Cut.  6.5/10.Also, it's a pretty easy Perfect (100% Achievements) Game.

												6/10 - What to say about A New Beginning. Well the art style is lovely; colourful and detailed, and the story although strange at times is interesting throughout. If you can get past the God-awful voice acting of the main characters which seriously sound like Microsoft Sam or from the Go Animate program then you'll enjoy it.			"

												A beautiful little adventure. It has nicely drawn characters and backgrounds and a good story with a twist that keeps you entertained. The voice over is good, but feels a little choppy at times. The controls need getting used to for an adventure, but are easy enough. I really enjoyed playing it.			"

												Firstly a note on the voice acting and how I got past it.... it's bad.  I knew it would be based on the majority of the reviews here, but my god I wasn't prepared for how painful it actually was.  It's as if they grabbed random people off of the street and made them read lines of dialogue with no context.  It's so poorly done that it just doesn't make sense.  I was so turned off by it that I was going to give up after an hour.  I did find that I was able to continue by switching the language back to German.  While not perfect, they at least tried to emote and it synced up with the mouth animations on the panel scenes given that it was the native language of the game.  Just go into it as if it's a foreign subtitled game.  I know that turns a lot you off, but it's still better than the English voice track. that said...A rather disappointing outing from Daedalic.  I tried harder than I usually would to give it a fair chance to impress but it never actually came through. Screens/Backgrounds are well done.  The biggest compliment I can give here. Story was lacking in my opinion.  Written too loosely and eco-preachy to the point of borderline annoyance. Characters were weak and two dimentional.  Many of them so unlikable (looking at you Bent) that it was hard to care or empathise with them enough to desire any kind of resolution on my end other than soon forgetting them. Puzzles are challenging, but fair.  To be honest, I was so tired of it all by the third act that I power FAQ'd.It's currently $2.  Hard to say ""Don't Buy"" at a price that low, but I sure wouldn't recommend paying more.  I'll remain a longtime Daedalic fan for what they've done to reintroduce and support P&C genre adventures in recent years, but this  is an effort that can easily be swept under the rug.			"

You need a lot of patience to deal with the constant eco babble and the bad voice acting, as well as some small bugs; but if you stick with it you will be rewarded with around 10 hours of detailed art work and a good story. Buy it on sale.+ Lots and lots of pictures. There's a lot of time that's gone into that.+ The story gets really good from around chapter 4 onwards.+ Around 10 hours of gameplay.- Some bugs. The ones I got most were 1. that the game would sometimes think I was clicking my mouse when I wasn't, causing the text to skip (meaning that I missed some of the dialogue) and 2. that there was sometimes a Russian or German word to click on or sentence spoken by a character, even though I played the game in English. The latter only happened two or three times and I always knew what to do, so it wasn't that big a deal. The former I solved by saving often (or just not caring what was said).- ""I'VE GOTTA SAVE THE PLANET. I'M GONNA CRY OVER THIS DEAD BIRD. WHY DOES THAT GUY DRIVE SUCH A WASTEFUL CAR? WHY DOES NO ONE LISTEN TO ME?"" Every. Five. Minutes. If you're not necessarily into the whole ""I must save the earth right now"" thing, you'll need a LOT of patience to try and ignore Fay (and Bent)'s constant eco babble.- Baaaad voice acting (especially main character Bent). But: either I got used it after a while or it just gets better towards the end.			"

Short version: 73%‘Terminator’ meets ‘Captain Planet’ in this point ‘n’ click adventure that may be more preachy in its message than it was supposed to be, but it still tells an interesting story with simple, yet entertaining puzzle mechanics.Long version:It is difficult to write something about saving our planet from pollution without resorting to tired speeches, but ‘A New Beginning’ almost managed to do that. Almost. While it is not just some pro-environmentalist propaganda, and the theme is integrated well into the story, sometimes the message it tries to convey is little more than a PSA after a Saturday morning cartoon.Said story is an interesting baggage as well, since it likes to switch narrative styles. Initially, it is a time-travel tale set in the apocalyptic future, as presented by the first protagonist, Fay, who went back to 1982 to convince a retired biologist, Bent, to continue his research into clean energy. This leads into a family drama between Bent and his son, which somehow turns into a James Bond movie against an evil energy mogul who hides in his private fortress in the jungle. And finally, the entire plot just ends in a very Shyamalan-like twist.Gameplay is almost as varied as the storytelling: we start with relying on inventory-related puzzles in the future segments; dialogues, distraction, and some investigations in the initial chapters set in the present; and finally, old-school point ‘n’ click adventure insanity for the conclusion. This variance is refreshing to some degree, and it usually fits well within the current narrative, but it also feels like as if the game struggles to find its own identity and just experiments with whatever the creators just came up with. The result is an enjoyable, but probably too distracting product that can be recommended to adventure game fans only.			"

												An interesting climate change story, with time travel, dual characters, nice graphics, cool comic strip cut scenes and a nice take on point and click mechanics make for a fun game. But oh ,, my .. lord .. of .. pants .. the voice acting and dialogue is dreadful. Its as if they recorded each word individually and you've dialled an automated call centre for the conversations. I normally enjoy exhausting dialogue trees, but this is so jarring, I would find the path of least resistance most of the time.This is a real shame as you feel there is some humour hiding behind the poorly translated dialogue and some characters come off as real♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ making you cringe at some of their lines. Thats possibly the point for some characters, but it comes across poorly done and in some instances, just plain wrong,The problems don't end here, plenty of bugs are scattered throughout, repeated text, scenes out of sync, characters pop around the screen and cut scene crashes. A tip here, if you do get stuck at a crash, you can skip the problem cut scene by hitting escape. These bugs are not frequent enough to be game breakers, but they do break the immersion.But.. I played til the end, the story and puzzles kept me coming back. It would have been a thumbs up if the dialogue had been implemented better. However, I cannot recommend the English version at full price, so a wobble to a thumbs down for me, but point and click fans should consider it if its in a deal or part of a better package..			"

												Like classic point and click adventure games? Well, if you can look past the awkward audio timing, mediocre voice acting, and bugs, then you can still look past this game for something better. The story is pretty predictable and none of the characters are believable. The puzzles are either obtuse and illogical or just stupid. The San Fransico section is particularly bad. The animations are choppy and awkward throughout. There's a subplot that I guess they just forgot to conclude along with the unsatisfying ending. But at least the suffering doesn't last long as you'll reach that ending much faster than you might expect. 20 hours of gameplay is promised, less the 10 was delivered. I managed to stretch it to 13 by leaving it minimized to cook dinner, search the internet for a solution to a game breaking bug, and rebuild a server.So, if you bored and this is on sale for less than a dollar, go ahead. Just do yourself a favor and turn off the voice acting. It would be a better game for it and there's no audio for the subtitles they forgot to translate anyway. Oh, and hitting the spacebar is your friend. Not that the game bothers to tell you that.			"

												Out of all honesty, for those who are thinking about getting this, ask yourself if you're willing to spend time on a game that will boggle your mind with puzzles, if you find that fun, then you need to buy this game. If you don't like puzzles and go for the plot, you can still search the walkthroughs on a website, but although you will find it less entertaining that it normally would go out as a gameplay experience. If you hate puzzles thoughout then obviously its a no-no.Fay: The girl you play in the game, has the best plot story, although i'm almost done with it (1 chapter left) i find her character development a great balance between what the plot indicates and situational events occuring around her.Bent: I find it difficult to understand his reasons of collaborating within the plot, first half he goes into denial, the second half he goes through reasoning and his character development doesnt change through that and when you arrive at the Labratories at the Sea you might think it is boring, and yes because our limited options prevents us from doing anything at all by that stage.Gameplay: Crazy as it may seem I loved the gameplay, its just a few minor tweaks that may help it out, a bit of specification would be nice, and the atmosphere really does get to you when you're feeling the situation current at hand.8.5/10			"

												So....this is a game I really wish I could enjoy. Conceptually, it is worth consideration even though the story is fairly cliche (world is mostly destroyed by nuclear disaster and the remnants of humanity travel back in time to try and stop it from happening). Outside of the obvious issues that the topic of time travel always carry with it (poorly thought out ramifications to actions being foremost on that list), the real issue with this game is that, since the sotry is so cliche, it really needs strong gameplay and voice acting to make it worth slogging though. The puzzles are in fact decent. Nothing too mind bending, but on the low end of Daedalic par for the course. The voice acting, however, is simply atrocious. If you are going to spend 10 or so hours with an adventure game, and the story is sub par, the voice acting better be on point. It isnt in this game, and as much as the completionist in me wants to retire this game under the ""finished games"" folder in my library, I cant bring myself to listen to the actors anymore.IDK if you will enjoy the game, but me personally, it goes into the never finish files.

												I recommend this game, as it's like most Daedalic point & click games: the story is good, the characters are okay (In the english dubbed version they sound really annyoying - but the personalities are quite developed), and the comic-like parts looks really great.But then the negatives:As good Daedalic is at making a good story, they are so bad at adapting it to another languages. So far: I've found a cyrillic alphabet (I think russian) option at one of the point of the oil rigGot a male guard referenced as she""Hier is it"" (hier is german)""Savie the world"" in epilogueThere are  options for modifying how loud are: speech, music, and sounds. But you can't modify the cutscenes, they will boom at you with your computer's  currently set volume.Also the game doesn't saves your volume settings, they are getting reseted by restarting the program.Lastly: the game CONSTANTLY changes between alga and algae. The whole plot is centered around this organism yet they can't decide how to spell it.The voice acting is just terrible. I mean the characters are speaking clear, they are easy to hear, but they sounds like somebody's reading a really boring book. At one point the main character burst out, saying I think ""no"" numerous times, because  somebody just straight out accused him of not taking his experiments seriously, while his family and private life was non-existant, he was so dedicated to his work. Hell, I'm more angry about burning my hand like this guy was. They could have said ""No, I don't want scrambled eggs"", the emotions were just as ""intense"". The plot twist part's voice acting is just plain atrocious, no better word.Epilogue's voice and subtitles are out of synchron, too.At the end:Well made story, poorly executed in english, but it doesn't hinder you in any ways in completing (and kinda, enjoying) the game. Full price is 10$/€, it's maybe a little too high considering there is no replay value. If you can get in a sale at/below 5$ or in a bundle, go for it!			"

A New Beginning - Final Cut is a Point & Click adventure game. At the turn of the 26th century, mankind is about to be extinct as the last few hundred left won't survive the next solar flare. Sent back in time to prevent a climate catastrophy, Radio-operator Fay approaches Bent Svensson, a retired physicist, in hopes that his work an algae-based power source could save the world.Pros: The story is interesting, having a slightly dark tone to it. You alternate between characters, viewing the story through their eyes, or through the way they tell their story. All cut-scenes are comicbook-styled boxes and text bubbles, while the gameplay scenes all appears hand-drawn in the most classical fashion of Point & Click games, topped with often dramatic tone-setting music. You must regularly interact with the environment and/or your inventory to solve puzzles, while standalone single-screen puzzles may be skipped after a few attempts, for those who want to.Cons: The immersion is totally broken by the bad voice acting. The voices themselves would portray the characters fine for the most part while other times it's just silly, but the lack of any conviction in the way the dialog is so blatantly read directly off the script is what kills it. There are sync problems with the cutscenes, with reading pauses when the text changes line, sometimes even in mid sentence! There are a few translation glitches in some subtitles or interactions, and in a variety of languages, too (I saw some French and I believe some Russian, while playing the English version). The sprite animation is very frame-by-frame and not very smooth.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youI may have been harsh on the game's technical and audio flaws, but I nevertheless enjoyed my ride through the story. Sometimes optimistic, sometimes bitter, the game really made me wonder whether it would have a happy ending or not. In the end, I do recommend this game to anyone who wants to find out for themselves.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Even if you're a big fan of point-and-click, I'd only recommend you this title during a sale. Or just go play the Deponia series.			"

												A New Beginning is an interesting point and click adventure game based on the concept of climate change. I don't normally play these kind of games however this one drew me in for some reason. I think it might have been the concept of climate change that kept me so interested. The game and the cutscenes especially had a really cool art style reminding me of a graphic novel.There were several issues throughout the game unfortunately including localization problems where text was displaying in Russian and also several puzzles that I had to restart to get to work correctly however these were mostly minor issues and none stopped me from completing the game completely.Pros+ Awesome art style+ Interesting puzzles+ Fantastic storyCons- Several minor but obvious bugs throughout the gameVerdict: 7.5/10			"

												My Take: An okay point and click adventure with a nonsensical plot about climate change. It's fairly short, if you're dedicated to playing it, then it shouldn't take more than about 6 hours. The puzzles are dull and convoluted at times.Graphics: The art is fairly well done, but the animations can be a little jittery at times. While the resolution can be set to widescreen, the game is played in 4:3; so you've got pillarboxing and unnecessary screen scrolling.Sound: Voice acting is wooden and mostly boring. Not too much happening in the sound effects department. Prepare to hear a lot of clicks.Music: Enjoyable enough to make this game a less arduous task.Controls: Not really a fan of the “left click to bring up options wheel” scheme when left click is also move. Right click opens/closes your inventory.Did I Finish It: Yes.Will I Play it Again: If I really am bored and want to grab the four remaining achievements, maybe. I doubt that'll be any time soon though.Should You Buy It: If you really wanted to play every point and click adventure on Steam, you could probably do worse than this.			"

												A New Beginning - Final Cut is a point and click adventure game from Deadalic Entertainment.You start the game as a retired bioengineer Bent Svensson, trying to live his peaceful life in a shack (well, a more luxurious shack) somewhere in a Norwegian forest. But just as he is going on about his everyday life, a young woman, a time traveler named Fay invades the privacy of his home and tells him the most imaginative story he has ever heard; about a future with no hope, where the clean air and fresh water are hard to find, and the planet is dying (Fallout anyone?).And Bent is supposed to be the person responsible for the planet salvation, so Fay convices him to go with her to try and stop the exact event that started the process of the extinction of life in the future.The story is well written and while it may sound cliched, it makes enough interesting twists and turns to never make it seem boring or repetitive. The characters are well done, and have real and believable motives for their actions throughout the game.From the graphical and accustic standpoint, Deadelic always delivers and this game is no different. Beautifully drawn backgrounds and landscapes, well done comic-like cut-scenes and a great voiceovers accompanied with an atmospheric soundtrack make for a great gaming experience.The game is not hard, and all the puzzles and actions needed to make progress make sense and should not leave you bashing your head for two hours, trying to figure out what to do next. It took me about 15 hours to finish the game which is a pretty decent length for a p'n'c game.And now, some negatives. Sometimes the text in the game becomes russian or german for a brief second (for example when inspecting an item) or the characters glitches out and disappears from the screen. On one occasion I couldn't access my inventory so I had to reload the previous game save. Also the bomb defusion puzzle has a bug, where the counter on one of the sides adds an extra +1 so you can't complete the puzzle (again reloading fixes it). So nothing too serious, but it could annoy you, especially if you haven't saved in a while.Score:+ beautiful hand drawn backgrounds+ great voice acting and atmospheric soundtrack+ decent length for a p'n'c game+ interesting story line with some cool concepts of the future- bugs- sound disappearing at timesA well done adventure game, for old school p'n'c players and anyone willing to give it a go. A solid 8/10.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game, at least at full price.To begin, A New Beginning is a point and click adventure that has some decent strong points. It has great music and background set pieces. Oftentimes, it is lighthearted and doesn't take its ridiculous premise that seriously, and there are even some decent introspective moments interspersed throughout. It has a very likable main character in Bent Svensson. Its best points during gameplay come in the form of straightforward puzzles that require heavy critical thinking but do not require you to, in the words of another commenter, 'have a telepathic link with the developer.' A New Beginning is at its strongest when its newest puzzle doesn't require heavy backtracking but still asks you to put in some decent legwork to find the solution.Still, I wouldn't recomend this for a person looking for a casual, more cinematic experience. This game can get real hard and real specific, sometimes overly so. Sometimes the solution will be hidden in one line of dialogue that can easily be skipped over, or just require you to figure it out with no context. This can get exhausting and frustrating, ending up in lots of unnecessary backtracking and head scratching. The really obscure solutions serve to drag the game down into tedium, and stacked on top of the many non-logic related flaws of the game make it hard to reccomend this game.The minigames are almost all maddeningly difficult, and they are just purely standalone logic puzzles you'd expect in a puzzle book. They do not require any knowledge of the plot and can be skipped (at the price of foregoing an achievement), but attempting them for full completion can serve to ruin any momentum you've had advancing the game. It doesn't help that some of them offer really no clues to completion. For two of them, the answers were so difficult to figure out I just looked at a walkthrough so I could nab the achievements, which left me a little bit bitter that my wins weren't legitimate.Then there are the optimization problems, which are the worst aspect of this game. For a game which is mostly sparsely animated 2D sprites walking around static backgrounds sometimes there will be random frame drops and freezeups. The game's coding is heavily unoptimized in the sense you can straight up break the game. During some event sequences, if you click where youre not supposed to it will run another event simultaenously, which can break the whole thing. One time, clicking one thing triggered an event that was supposed to be triggered by another. At one point I think I accidentally triggered an event that caused an object to be drawn onto my character, which locked up the controls and made it impossible to advance. Good thing I had saved. On top of that, the english voice acting and translation brings issues as well. Often times it is not fully synced to the characters lips, which meant they just slapped the voices on top of the sprite speaking the original language. There are random text and dialogue skips, times where the subtitles are just completely different than what is being said, some actions are untranslated and left in Russian, and the subtitles can lag behind the dialogue. The subtitles cna go haywire in particular if you glitch the game accidentally, and let me emphasize you can glitch the game just by clicking through dialogue. Also, some of the voice acting is a bit awkward, not fitting the situation.Finally, the story. It makes no attenpt to hide its criticism of free market capitalism and exploitation of the environment, and at some points implies that the end justifies the means in regards to ecoterrorism. Thats the major gist of the story, and when its not lighthearted, it is either ridiculously convoluted or preachy and obnoxious. The other main character is an accomplished radiooperator and can solve complex puzzles but still manages to come off as ditzy (she's still one of the stronger female characters I've come across.) It probably has one of the most abrupt and disappointing endings ever as well.I wanted to like this game. I put in all the time I could to get 100% completion, and at points I really enjoyed specific aspects of it. Sadly, as a package it fails to deliver.5/10			"

												The story has many changing points and has some really good surprising moments and shocking truth for us all (like Deponia and The night of the rabbit).The graphics are not so my style (miss a bit more details) but at the end they worked really good for the whole game (overseeing movements that arent important for me) and the parts splitscreen reminds me on XIII a bit but decide yourself with the trailers/ screenshots and sound too.Because of this really important message the game has, the challenging puzzles (you can skip after a short time or use help) and the moment you dont expect i give this game 98 % for point and click fans. I hope you enjoy this game like me (maybe you want buy the game with 33 % or more discount). P. S. i was kicked 1 time out the game at the end where you only chose the dialogs but thx auto save i waste maybe 1 min and then at the end i skip all texts and the part i kicked out with ESC.

												A truely great point and click game as always from Daedalic. Like with their later games, the Deponia series, they manage to balance the story and events between humour and grave seriousness in a way that makes it into a rollercoaster ride of emotions. I really got attached to the characters as the story progressed. This is a hard thing to do, but Daedalic has made it a red thread throughout their catalogue. Technically you can see that this game has come of age, but it is a visually beautiful game. With great detail in the scenery, and nice classicaly animated characters, It holds up well. The cutscenes are done in a cartoon strip way and with little animation, but it does fit the style of the game, and I totally buy it, and get sucked right into the story. The only real downside of the game as I see it, is that the audio sometimes break the immersion. There are some points in the game where characters speak or react in a tone that isn't natural. This does however only occur a few places, and the music and the rest of the dialogue makes up for it.I really recommend this game to any point and click fan!PS: Thought I spotted some nuclear plant pipes on the Oslo skyline, Daedalic. This country only has two underground research plants!			"

												the story is very interesting, the graphics and the gameplay are cool, however, the puzzles are not very intuitive as there are items and combinations that didn't really occur to me, so i got stuck too many times. plus, it took me a while to get used to the controls as you have more types of interactions with one single object, or to figure it out that i can inspect items in invetory as well, for example. plus it has long sections of the game with only cutscenes and no interaction.i'm still confused if this i need to recomment it or not, it's been kind of frustrating at time, and i definitely wouldn't play it again. not really sure if it's worth the money.

												A New Beginning is a preachy point and click adventure game which oversimplifies a complex environmental issue. Has a decent story but horrible voice acting, pretty graphics and somewhat challenging puzzles amidst gamebreaking bugs and bad translations. I haven't played the original version, just the English translation so I can't fully atest to the game's merits, but as it stands I'm torn between recommending this game to others or not.On one hand some might find the bad voice acting and shoddy storytelling distracting, but on the other hand, some just want a good old-fashioned adventure game. I'd lean towards a Yes, but only for avid fans of the genre. This was my first game from Daedalic Entertainment. I hear others are much better and this game hasn't quite succeeded in putting me off trying them.			"

												Very decent point&click adventure with a message and morale.You control Fay, a woman from the future on a quest back in time to save the planet as its dying in her world, and the man she meets, Bent Svensson, a scientist, whom Fay believes can save the world.The sound and music is decent there is definitely some flaws in the voice acting, particularly with main character Fay. Others also seem to 'overact'. Fays posture is also terrible, nobody can stand like that with a normally shaped spine.Anyways; the rest of the game is decent, but you will probably need a guide at some of the puzzles. There is normally a reset button, on only one puzzles (water pumps) it's possible to ♥♥♥♥up so you need to reload. Note that the game does not autosave outside of remembering where you are, so you must save in order to get around this one puzzle if you want the achievement for playing all minigames. I also had Fay get stuck at one point, forcing be to reload from a save. It also has some weird bugs; for example a rock/plank puzzle I was obviously supposed to walk over the plank, then  pick it up and put it towards the next rock, but when I clicked to pick up the plank, Fay would walk over to the rock I was on before, then pick it up. She did this three times before she finally decided to pick it up on the rock she was supposed to be on. Had it not been such an obvious solution I would have thought I did something wrong and backtracked/messed about other things for a long time. I assume the puzzle requires perfect positioning or something.Also 2 times in the game were the 'use item' options in Russian and near the end at an important scene the subtitles is in German with no English voiceacting. Very annoying.Some of the achievements are also mutually exclusive, so a save must be made before some puzzles/encounters to make life easier. The story is about saving the world from environmental disaster, so yes, there is quite a lot of talk about saving the environment and all life is precious etc. It did not bother me much as it was part of the story. The story is long, 12 hours+ without skipping anything and the ending was imo very interesting. Recommended; but be aware of possible bugs, lacking voice acting, and environmental talks. Save often in many slots, and keep a guide at hand for the most complicated puzzles.			"

												I'll recommend the game, but not at full price. Don't buy it for more than 4-5 euros.The game isn't too hard, but not to easy (as long as you don't skip the puzzles, but who would ?). It demands thinking, logic and memory. The ""hard"" parts, the puzzle, can be skipped, so if you're just here to live an adventure, it will do.The drawing are most of the time beautiful, especially landscapes and large pictures. Unfortunately, the animations are sometimes really odd (or totally ♥♥♥♥ed up, but you can't say that on Steam). During the cut scenes, the sound / image / subtitles are way too often no synchronized, so the narration is hardly enjoyable. Moreover, Fay is suffering so hard of scoliosis, I wonder how she still stand.As for me, I separate the the game in two parts : First part, you discover the plot, the characters, the goals. It's a nice part, well written, with various environment, the year 2050 was particularly nice to go through. The second part, on the other hand, is heavy and not that interesting. One of the biggest problems I found in this game, is the lack of psychology and deepness in the character. Someone close to you dies ? Ok, nevermind, just go on. You are betrayed by everybody ? Ok, nevermind, just excuse yourself and I'll forget it. Someone who tried to harm you died ? Ho my god, bring the sad music and the cut scene ! That's not making sense at all, even if Fay is used to see dead people, and even if Bent is an old  disillusioned man, there is no way they would react like that. Add this to some cheesy dialogues, and you might want to punch them in the face once in a while.The scenario is quite good however. Climate change, collective responsibility, how far will people go to save mankind, sounds good to me. Too bad the activists are, once again in a video game, represented as fanatics or stupid hippies, but nevermind, the storytelling is good (if you can pass over the synch problems I spoke before).I'm a bit frustrated though, because I find the game way too short, and the ending too quick. But it IS a good game, a good point and click where you should think and reason. Even if my review is mostly negative, but it's harder  to me to describe why I enjoyed rather than what I didn't enjoyed in the game, in particular because english isn't my native language.			"

Nice puzzles that I will admit I did get stuck on but still fun.  There is like only one part that if you do thing in the worng order you have to load your last save. Glad that is only an issue once. Still love the game though. If you like point and click adventure games you will probably like this as well.			"

												I really really really wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. Unfortunately, upon starting the game and playing through the very first puzzle, the chump that designed it decided it would be hilarious if they hid one of the items that you needed to solve the puzzle inside of the most illogical and horrifically stupid places possible. The methodology in which the first puzzle was completed was pretty much the way that a human being would have solved it after drinking a gallon of bleach while boiling their head in a vat of prune juice. First puzzle aside, the second puzzle was more enjoyable and the storyline progressed interestingly. However, it was at this point that my sound suddenly stopped working. I checked to see if I had accidentally hit my mute button, I triple checked the in-game sound volume, and I restarted my game about six times to try to get it to work. Alas, the sound did not return and the game decided to add further insult to injury by somehow eradicating my autosave and all of the progress that I had made so far. So yeah. I really wanted to play this game. Unfortunately, I could not play it in the end and I would rather watch someone else play it on YouTube so I don't have to experience the frustration of not only solving irrational and illogical puzzles but solving technical issues as well.

												A New Beginning - Final Cut is really a mixed bag of pro's and con's. I really like the story but sometimes it gets so sentimental, and some of the dialogue is just downright cheesy. I like the point-and-click mechanism, but sometimes I want to move faster than it does. The art is beautiful. The voice acting is terrible at times, and the voice audio is so choppy I didn't know if I could get used to it; but I eventually tuned it out because I wanted to see what happen's. Sometimes the actor's emotion doesn't match the emotion of the dialogue, which is also very annoying. Another big con for me is it's only in 4:3 ratio and no widescreen option is available, or coming. You would think all new games these days would take advantage of the whole screen. Another really annoying flaw.Usually I get quickly bored with point-and-click adventures, but for some strange reason, despite it's many flaws, I'm compelled to keep playing and see it to the end. Is the voice acting bad, yes. Is the 4:3 ratio annoying, yes. Can the interesting yet overly simplistic story get cheesy, yes. Is it worth playing, for some reason, yes - 6.5/10*My all-time-favourite point-and-click adventure is Gemini Rue.			"

												pretty good old fashioned point'n'click! nice time travelling story (with twists) about climat change and the endangerment of our planet. nice backgrounds, interactable objects not obvious, nice cartoon animations of the characters, shame the heavily pixalated contours sometimes. puzzles are good, inventive, not particularly challenging, it's linear, mostly one objective after another sadly, but not overly easy either (sometimes you have the idea but the execution needs some more thinking...how to get Dr.Braun to the bathroom took me a while). there is humour in the dialogues but A New Beginning isn't an over the top comic poin'n'click as others Daedelic games such as Deponia (I like both genres btw). some minor bugs that don't get in the way of the game.I recommend it! refreshing, story driven, nice artwork "

												A New Beginning is a smart and at times thrilling adventure game that feels like it could be a lost LucasArts classic. The puzzles are tough but not ridiculous, and the story is clever and very compelling. I wish I could say the same for the design conceit--like almost every other game that tries to add comic book elements, it doesn't really work. Still, most of the art is great (again, very much a throwback to the old LucasArts and Sierra games of my youth) and the score is wonderful as well. The script and voice acting at times leave a little something to be desired, but for whatever reason I actually found the voice actors' stiffness to be somewhat charming. A far from perfect game, A New Beginning is still fun, challenging, and worth the time you'll put into it.			"

Thankfully, some can be skipped. Some people may like these puzzles, but I derive more pleasure from exploration and character interaction, and these silly puzzles just get in the way.2- Constant Missing key syndrome. Sometimes its just a tiny little detail that eludes you, and you hit a brick wall. I hate this. I rather disinstall then have to deal with these bad design choices.3- Melodramatic. Oh noooo its the end of the world! Everyone is dying! Oh nooooo! Your friend died too! Oh noooo...4- Unoriginal. Doesn't do nor improve on anything that other Point n' Click adventure do.Honestly, I didn't really enjoy this one... But I suppose it has its merits. It has smart themes, its just not very fun.Recommend to anyone who enjoys complicated puzzles. "

												Ok. So the English voice acting...was...at times...truly terrible. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this game - proper voice acting would have made it so many times better. There are occasionally random sentences in German that apparentally didn't get replaced with English, the sound mixing can be uneven, and the acting stilted. Be that as it may - I felt like the acting at least got progressively better over the course of the game - or maybe I just became more accustomed to them..HOWEVER, I truly became very immersed and invested in the story of the game by the halfway point or so. In the end, this is one of my favorite point-and-click adventures that I have played within the last year.			"

												I began this game cynical it was going to be full of milk bottle recycling, kitten saving and tacky eco guilt. However, I ended up being gripped by a very serious plot with good momentum and beautiful art. Thankfully, moral ambiguity is a bigger theme than the eco stuff.The strongest point of A New Beginning is its puzzles. They're the perfect difficulty to pose a challenge while not stalling the pace. They're logical, well designed and fun.The games weaknesses are a few technical and translation glitches, the characters aren't particularly likeable, and a few things don't make sense, including the ending. The game as a whole feels a little unfinished, like they were definitely on track to making a perfect game but then got forced to release it in its current state.However, I was pleasantly surprised with this game and enjoyed it. At the price, it's a must have for adventure game fans. I will be checking out the other games from Daedalic after discovering this.			"

												So let's talk quickly about the plot: If you're trying to convince the world that we should do something about global climate change, making Nuclear Reactors out to be the boogeyman is counter-productive. In the absence of some magic algea, it really is the best technology we have for changing the levels of pollution being dumped into our environment. A coal-fired plant (the dirtest AND most radioactive plants in existence) would have made a better villian.If you can put that aside for a moment and push past some of the seeming preachiness, you'll find... what appears to be a very amateur production with high quality art. At least, it seems that way. Push a bit harder and you start feeling more depth. Push all the way to the end, and you will find that the writers are using your prejudices against you to lure you into...Well, that's all I'll say. It really is a good game. If you like adventure games (especially if you loved Syberia), you will get more than your money's worth out of this one!			"

The way they portrayed the female lead character bothered me, they made it seem like she was a little dumb and almost child-like at times.

												I spent the day playing this game from beginning to end and enjoyed every second of it. I will admit that I never NOT use walkthroughs when it comes to these puzzles games. There were definitely some puzzles where I needed to check the walkthrough whether because I was too stupid to analyze the situation or because the logic was not really evident. There are a couple of minigames throughout the game and I've actually managed to solve most of them without skipping them (which you can do by the way) or looking up the whole answer (I took a quick glance on how the puzzle mechanics works). The puzzles aren't too hard once you get the gist of what you have to do. You may or may not need a quick glance at the walkthrough but managing to complete them with skipping definitely made me feel satisfied about myself, you know, convincing me for a moment that I'm not a complete idiot. I liked the comic style of the cutscenes but I loved the art style of the environment. It's realistic looking, vibrant, and detailed. I giggled seeing a box with Hello Kitty on it in the water control room at the power plant. There are lots of scenes that wowed me because the charactes whom are kind of cartoonish are so little in this relatively big realistic environment. There were more areas in the game than I expected, which makes the exploration quite fun and the environment more enjoyable. I can understand how some people did not enjoy the voice acting. Some lines feel a bit forced or lack a bit of emotion. But only some, I really liked the voice acting in general because it really gave the characters personality. For the subtitles, there are often typos but personally the good voice acting compensates for it. I don't know what more to say apart that the story is interesting (who doesn't like time travel plots?), the visuals are great, the characters are cool, the music is ambient... If you don't mind glancing at the walkthrough a few times, I definitely recommend this game even if you don't really enjoy puzzles. However, if you refuse to look at the walkthrough or skipping the mini games, I wish the best of luck. Get the game.  "

												Finding a new favorite band with a wide-ranging catalogue often presents the early works question. What to do and say about the things the band recorded before finding their own style and making a breakthrough? Listening to that may present new perspectives on their best work but is that reason enough to actually try and enjoy it on its own merits? This is the question I thought often during my hours with A New Beginning, one of the first titles from my recent favorite, Daedalic Entertainment.Many key strengths presented later are already here, particularly those related to craftsmanship. The whole of the story is well laid out and plotted, with twists all in place and the whole progressing logically throughout with interesting puzzles challenging the brain. Another trademark is the orchestral soundtrack covering a wide range of moods and emotions. And finally comes of course the hand-made art showing once again that no tesselations can ever replace the human touch. Making parts and assembling them is one thing but then breathing life into the result is another and this is where the game sadly does not succeed. The eco-conscious bent of the story is laudable but the tone is too educational and the contrasts are simply much too black-and-white. There was no room to disagree about anything or anyone or make alternative interpretations to what the writing told me. Consequently there was an airless quality to the entire experience. No characters had enough detail to give them life beyond caricatures with calculated positions in the story (and the message). Dialogue contained many odd phrases that smack of poor translation. A grim security officer shuts off doubt with ""Fiddlesticks!"" and in more than one life-threatening situation ""Good grief"" gets used too.These lecture-like qualities are made even drier by problems in presentation. The voice acting was of very poor quality throughout, there is simply no way around it. The entire cast managed to sound colorless as if concentrating on clear pronunciation and nothing else. The worst offender was perhaps the female lead who sounded so shrill and robotically cheerful I yearned for Lydia for the first time in my life. And while the artists did their best with the milieus there is only so much anyone can do with oil rigs and conference halls from 1982 where most of the action take place. The date makes sense from the thematic perspective but wastes the promise in the strong first chapter in the game, which happens in the future and has an interesting storytelling idea that was thrown out for the rest of the game. It is also unfortunate that while the places in this eco-thriller include Norway and Brazil the natural sights are not shown, unlike helicopter interiors or pump rooms. Overall the aesthetics are best described as having a metallic, inorganic quality to them which contrasts completely with the other Daedalic adventures I have seen so far.Serving as the final coffin nail were many technical flaws and issues. First off, this is a game from 2010 -- without widescreen support. I had to set my screen resolution to 1024 x 768 before starting the game to avoid the black borders. Granted, the game did look good then but it was an odd thing to do regardless. The game is also littered with typos and words from other languages, including Spanish and Russian. ""Grapeseed oil"" without the G was the most unintentionally chilling typo I have seen in quite some time.I wanted to like A New Beginning and it actually feels a bit unfair to lay out so much criticism to an indie adventure made with very limited resources. But no matter what the comparison, the genre classics, contemporary games from other studios or other Daedalic adventures, A New Beginning falls short and cannot truly be enjoyed on its own either. I gained more insight than pleasure from my gametime and would recommend others interested in the genre to look at other options instead. Early demos or shaky debuts from good and great bands may find their way into record collections on the strength on their other albums but cannot truly be recommended to those without fan powers.

												The game has absolutely terrible voice acting (reminds me of Birdemic) and there are several translation bugs, but if you can get past that it's a pretty fun game. I'd call it a diamond in the rough... If you get stuck and you probably will remember this one helpful bit of information. When you think you've searched everywhere and found everything remeber to inspect them items you have in your inventory. Sometimes you can break/alter/combine items to progress.  Also, you'll want to use every speach option possible because they can trigger changes in the game that help you get to the next point. I'll also warn you about 3 bugs here I've incountered. SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Bug 1: When you come in contact with the guy in the security room looking at the moniters DO NOT talk to him then click anything in the room, it'll cause the game to glitch up. Wait till the conversation is done, then you can feel free to explore the room. Bug 2: When diffusing the bomb sometimes the numbers on the screen can be wrong and it can cause the bomb to be undefuasble. You can either skip the mini game (they allow you) or you can restart and try again.Bug 3: When you get the guard drunk towards the end you'll have to steal his keys. Here's where the bug can come in. If you don't replace his keys with the keys you have in your inventory you wont be able to move out from behind the table.That being said I'd give gameplay and only the gameplay a 7/10			"

												This is an adventure game that tells a mature and semi-realistic story, that will engage you in this alternate reality that could, after all, be our planet's future. Despite some minor bugs, spelling errors and a, sometimes, bit forced dialogue from the voice acting, I highly recommend A New Beginning for every point & click lover out there and for those that are only getting into the genre as well. And a warning for all you guys that might be interested in playing this title - they mention the game has 20+ hours of gameplay, and that is a huge overstatement, as I finished it at a slow pace and I completed it in 10 hours.

												Man, I really wish I could give a thumbs-up to the game-play, but a thumbs-down to the story. As a game, I really enjoyed the puzzle-solving aspect and the beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds (though the character animation leaves a little to be desired - Fay's posture and walk are perplexing, to say the least). Like many good point-and-click adventure games, the puzzles involve thoroughly searching your surroundings to find needed objects, and then figuring out where and how to use them. Other times, making certain dialogue choices when interacting with other characters will lead you to your goals. I got stumped quite often - sometimes I'd just fumble into the right solution, and other times I'd work it out logically - but in the case of the latter, there were many times when I'd think I was on the right track, only to find I was still several steps away from the solution. While there are harder adventure and puzzle games out there, at least this one can be enjoyable for people who are both fans of the genre and newcomers.What may make the game less palatable is the story - if the heavy-handed, sometimes unintentionally-funny preaching about global warming doesn't put off even the environmentally-conscience, then the ending that seems to go against everything the rest of the game stood for probably will. The game's plot doesn't stay focused on one reason for mankind's destruction, shifting from global warming to a more catastrophic event, and then there's something about a solar flare which is going to wipe out everyone, anyway, no matter what they do to the environment. (Seriously, pick one disaster and go with it!) And the ending kind of makes you feel like it was all for nothing, along with leaving several questions unanswered.The voice acting is mediocre - I've seen some pretty harsh criticisms of it, but I've heard worse, so I wasn't terribly bothered by it. Sometimes it doesn't match the onscreen text or gets details confused. Examples: ""Chrome Dome"" is said in one scene where the words ""Bald Pate"" are clearly spelled out, and at another point, the dialogue can't decide if it's DH54 algae or DH45 algae. Also, use the knife on Bent in the final puzzle if you want to see Fay mouth two lines of text in German (the game's original language) with no voiceover. These issues, plus weird glitches like dialogue cutting off at the end of a sentence and poorly matched lip-synching give the impression of a lack of polish for the English translation.Oh yes, the world's savior is named Bent Svensson. Yeah, I know, maybe it's a legit Norwegian name, or maybe it's short for Bentley. It still sounds hilarious to English-speaking audiences.Rating: 2.5/5			"

												This game totally caught me by surprise. It started with a cliche about saving the world and I thought it was going to be one of those dull sci-fi plots but as the story progressed, a lot of issues were explored with regards to that theme. The costs and consequences of our actions on the environment, the triggers needed to make us change our habits, and the ethos of different minded-individuals were questioned. The dramatics were well played out; the soundtrack compliments each scene perfectly, the build-ups to climatic events were exciting, and the graphics were outstanding in their details -- the images used had the right angles and impacts on the viewer. The game mechanics are simple, based on interactions with the environment through point-and-click. The challenging part of the game is more of its mental aspect. You have to use a bit of logic and maintain a lot of awareness of your environment or else you will miss out items or tasks integral to the story's progress. What I really like about this visual novel is its comic-styled graphics. It's like seeing a comic book played out in motion to you during its cut scenes and it places you in the comic book world when you are playing the game. Aside from a few subtitle errors and delays as well as frustrations that come with figuring things out, this game is a great puzzle action game. Also, it helps that you can skip some of the mind-boggling puzzles. You can get Steam achievements out of succeeding them as well as skipping them. Is it replayable? If you are an achievement-♥♥♥♥♥, then yes, there are things to play for so make multiple saves at various points if you do not wish to go back to the beginning all over again. If not, once is enough, which is about the only other discouragement from getting the game.			"

												Now what can I say about this game... First of all the voice acting was truly atrocious, so bad that at times you wondered if they'd use a text-to-voice converter for some of the characters. It's obvious that the game suffers overall from bad translation, which is a bit odd because Satinav was made by the same company  and they had much better voice actors and the translation was all-around pretty decent. It's sad, because this game had a mature, unique and interesting story with an important message about environmentalism, the future and climate changes caused by humans recklessness (even though the game became unnecessarily preacy about it at times) which could have been much better delived had the translators and actors done a better job. I just wish I could've played the game in German (the original language of the game) with English subtitles, but no such luck unfortunatley :( As is expected with Daedalic's games - the handcrafted 2D art is beautiful, the music was overall really good, while the puzzles for the most part remained logical and not overly complicated or complex. As a side note; It was funny that one of the protagonists was Norwegian and that most of the occurances in the game happend in Norway - which is a rather rare thing to see in a video game :p			"

												Background:I got this as part of a Humble Bundle and completed the game.Impressions:Since I was enjoying the developers other title 'The Whispered World' so much I decided to give this one a try. And while it's a much more serious game it does suffer from a lot of minor problems that spoil a reasonable point-n-click adventure.Firstly the tone is rather grim and layers on with some really heavy handed moralising about carbon emissions. There are some odd disjoints with our eco hero killing a bird he had just been talking to, seemingly without a care in the world.The story is one of time travel, climate change, eco-terrorism, murder, corporate espionage and regrets. Sounds fun doesn't it. Sadly there are attempts to make the plot appear dynamic and urgent but the laconic movement and speech of the characters strip every ounce of drama way. It doesn't help that our hero is called Bent Svenson and referred to as Bent continually and visually depicted as hunched over. This is counter balanced by the perky and optimistic Fay from the future whose odd posture has her back constantly arched with her breasts pointing skyward.The voice acting stands out as particularly poor in the English version. The lead male character speaks with the same deadened tone if he is examining a phonebook, finding a dying friend or staging a dramatic escape. Similarly the lead female has the same chirpy readings no matter what the situation. Just as bad are the stock phrases that Bent utters, I never want to hear a character again utter ""I am a Scientist. Not some sort of Dada artist."" ever again. I was put in mind of a badly dubbed foreign movie where the tone was lost on the voice actor and so the performance feels mismatched to the situation. Despite this initial irritation I started to enjoy the ineptness of the voice performances, being a sucker for bad sci-fi movies I got more out of the game once I viewed it in that light.By the time the game ended I was left wondering what the point of the time-travel plot was as the game would have played the same without it. Worse still I was left wondering what impact the events had on the future, which is what I was expecting to be the point of the game.The Good:*The story is both interesting and underused.*The inventory and interaction system is simple and effective.*I was very rarely stuck for what to do, if a few puzzles were poorly explained.*Spacebar reveals all clickables in an area.*The visuals are all good, especially the backdrops.*The comic strip cut scenes were an interesting visual delivery method.*Clicking skips repeated dialogue, double clicks speed you to exits.The Bad:*Terrible voice acting. The sound is clear but the actors obviously didn't rehearse, record together or care.*The stock 'I can't do that' phrases for Bent repeat often and sound really silly. *Dramatic scenes are setup as time sensitive but in reality are slow paced.*Some actions aren't translated into English, but you can figure them out.*Lack of puzzle variety.*The antenna puzzle was an early example of a simple puzzle made difficult through lack of information.*There are several deaths, some on screen and with blood, that seem to have zero impact on the characters or story.Recommended for:Mature Point-and-click fans who like James Bondesque bombastic plotting, hammy sci-fi, badly dubbed movies and an interesting in climate change.Conclusion.5/10. A decent idea with good mechanics and visuals ruined by poor English translation, nonsensical character actions and a grand plot idea that loses direction.			"

												Status:completed primary story, still have a few achievements left to 100%Story lines are the most important (arguably) thing about an adventure game, I will keep this review as spoiler free as possible however there are a few locations that I am going to talk about as well as some things that get established quite early on. If that is unacceptable stop reading now, I shall quickly summarize here: this game should be a 7/10 but is quite buggy so unfortunately I can only reward it a 5 or 6. The graphical style and voice acting are very nice and the storyline is somewhat engaging. If you are a fan of the genre then it is worth a try. None of the bugs I encountered broke the game and if you are willing to look past that then you may indeed rank the game higher.So my quest to play all and review my games library finally got to A. Unfortunately my magpie sense tingled and I recently purchased another bundle which has set me back onto the numbers. Also steam recently reclassified this game into N which I suppose makes sense but its irked me a bit. Mind that is a issue I need to take with steam and not this game.So this is a point and click 2d game, and a pretty competent one at that. You play as one of two characters that you change between during the story, Bent, an Eco scientist, and Fay who is a time traveler from a despotic future ruined by climate change. They are trying to create a green fuel and make it the primary power source for the world as to prevent the future. I ended up enjoying the characters I was playing as. They both seem to have well thought out personalities, there isn't tonnes of back story for them though, and they do focus a lot on the environment. I have a friend who has played this game who says that they found it very preachy and there is a little bit of that, but it is to be expected. They both have dedicated their lives to this working out after all.The game has 2 main sections, one is your traditional 2d point and clicking, inventory puzzles and dialogue trees etc. the second is a single screen puzzle that you have to solve.A big problem I have seen with modern point and click games is that the difficulty level is much reduced. This is to encompass the casual tablet crowd as the lowest common denominator reaches the biggest market, and as a nerdy amiga/dosbox owning girl, I like my old school point and clicks. This game has a really nice feature which is rather than making all the interactive items stand out it keeps them plain in the background, however, holding down space will light them up. Also in the single screen puzzles which can take a while to figure out there is a skip button. I didn't use space or skip any of the puzzles but it is nice to see that they are optional. I do find the skip button a bit annoying as I feel that if you can't beat a game then you need to suck it up rather than whining to the developers to make it easier and easier however I do prefer it to them simplifying it even more. Modern point and click can be very bittersweet but this one is much more sweet than some of the rubbish on my friend's ipad.There is one place that this game seriously falls down though, and thats in the Quality Assurance. I understand that English is not the first language of the developers, and I do want to take it easy on them, but it is a taint that makes what would be an adept example of the genre unfortunately adequate. It's a shame too, because a thorough testing session should have picked these up and it comes off feeling a bit lazy and sloppy, but the rest of the game wasn't. I really do feel for the developers and I hope that people don't criticise them too hard for this.The game has numerous spelling errors but as I say, not a first language. However often the dialogue on the screen and the vocal speech are different and using completely different, albeit similar words. I found that the on screen text tended to be a bit more detailed than the dialogue so I treated that as canon. There was also an instance where a character was saying dialogue choice one when he should have been saying choice two. There are a few parts in the game where you can click to move your character into a spot where they shouldn't go, and they wander off getting smaller and smaller until they are but a pixel. Again, this is not the fault of the programmers. Character scaling while walking off into the distance is a good thing, these are boundaries that QA should be pointing out. Another time I got stuck in a bar, I could not get him out no matter how hard I tried, luckily an exit was just in view and I could double click to fast travel him out. Late in chapter 6 clicking on an inventory item was giving me dialogue all the way back from chapter 2. I'm sure if I was willing to give it a second play through I could find more bugs now that I know some of the triggers. It is a shame it is so buggy but please don't let that put you off. If you like the genre there is nothing wrong with this game at all, just maybe think about waiting for a sale.I have other games from these guys, really looking forward to getting round to them!			"

												I played a couple of Daedalic Entertainment point&click games, and they are way too simple compared to the old school adventures, in fact, nowadays it's rare to see many classic actions like ""Use"", ""Pull"", ""Open"", ""Close"", ""Push"", etc... which are useful to make you think, by increasing the number of possibilities, or in other words, the difficulty; also, this game is not open world, so there is no exploration, nothing to solve in a certain order... you have no choice: time by time, you are forced in small zones with few characters/elements, and the interaction is limited by this excessive simplicity. Furthermore, combining an item in your inventory with another item in your inventory is another inexistent or superficial aspect of this game; most of puzzles are so intuitive that you are almost guided through the solution, so as you see from my playtime, you can easily complete the game in few hours, which is ridiculous if i remember how many years i spent in '80-'90 era, by playing games of the same genre.In summary, i'm not crazy for this adventure, but i can't even say it's bad, considering that art and storyline are pretty good. I'd say it's enjoyable overall.			"

The puzzles carry their own internal logic, and except for one or two I thought were a bit far-fetched, it was all very clever.At first, when I read ""eco-thriller"", I was expecting a moralizing finger-pointing edutainment piece, but far from it. The ""big money concerns don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about our planet"" theme was there - and so it is, sadly enough, in real life - but it's just the backdrop for a good story with some twists. You could just as well call it a sci-fi thriller instead.If you like point & click adventures, I recommend this one.			"

You play as one of two characters that you change between during the story, Bent, an Eco scientist, and Fay who is a time traveler from a despotic future ruined by climate change. They are trying to create a green fuel and make it the primary power source for the world as to prevent the future. I ended up enjoying the characters I was playing as. They both seem to have well thought out personalities, there isn't tonnes of back story for them though, and they do focus a lot on the environment. I have a friend who has played this game who says that they found it very preachy and there is a little bit of that, but it is to be expected. They both have dedicated their lives to this working out after all.The game has 2 main sections, one is your traditional 2d point and clicking, inventory puzzles and dialogue trees etc. the second is a single screen puzzle that you have to solve.A big problem I have seen with modern point and click games is that the difficulty level is much reduced. This is to encompass the casual tablet crowd as the lowest common denominator reaches the biggest market, and as a nerdy amiga/dosbox owning girl, I like my old school point and clicks. This game has a really nice feature which is rather than making all the interactive items stand out it keeps them plain in the background, however, holding down space will light them up. Also in the single screen puzzles which can take a while to figure out there is a skip button. I didn't use space or skip any of the puzzles but it is nice to see that they are optional. I do find the skip button a bit annoying as I feel that if you can't beat a game then you need to suck it up rather than whining to the developers to make it easier and easier however I do prefer it to them simplifying it even more. Modern point and click can be very bittersweet but this one is much more sweet than some of the rubbish on my friend's ipad.There is one place that this game seriously falls down though, and thats in the Quality Assurance. I understand that English is not the first language of the developers, and I do want to take it easy on them, but it is a taint that makes what would be an adept example of the genre unfortunately adequate. It's a shame too, because a thorough testing session should have picked these up and it comes off feeling a bit lazy and sloppy, but the rest of the game wasn't. I really do feel for the developers and I hope that people don't criticise them too hard for this.The game has numerous spelling errors but as I say, not a first language. However often the dialogue on the screen and the vocal speech are different and using completely different, albeit similar words. I found that the on screen text tended to be a bit more detailed than the dialogue so I treated that as canon. There was also an instance where a character was saying dialogue choice one when he should have been saying choice two. There are a few parts in the game where you can click to move your character into a spot where they shouldn't go, and they wander off getting smaller and smaller until they are but a pixel. Again, this is not the fault of the programmers. Character scaling while walking off into the distance is a good thing, these are boundaries that QA should be pointing out. Another time I got stuck in a bar, I could not get him out no matter how hard I tried, luckily an exit was just in view and I could double click to fast travel him out. Late in chapter 6 clicking on an inventory item was giving me dialogue all the way back from chapter 2. I'm sure if I was willing to give it a second play through I could find more bugs now that I know some of the triggers. It is a shame it is so buggy but please don't let that put you off. If you like the genre there is nothing wrong with this game at all, just maybe think about waiting for a sale.I have other games from these guys, really looking forward to getting round to them!			"

												I played a couple of Daedalic Entertainment point&click games, and they are way too simple compared to the old school adventures, in fact, nowadays it's rare to see many classic actions like ""Use"", ""Pull"", ""Open"", ""Close"", ""Push"", etc... which are useful to make you think, by increasing the number of possibilities, or in other words, the difficulty; also, this game is not open world, so there is no exploration, nothing to solve in a certain order... you have no choice: time by time, you are forced in small zones with few characters/elements, and the interaction is limited by this excessive simplicity. Furthermore, combining an item in your inventory with another item in your inventory is another inexistent or superficial aspect of this game; most of puzzles are so intuitive that you are almost guided through the solution, so as you see from my playtime, you can easily complete the game in few hours, which is ridiculous if i remember how many years i spent in '80-'90 era, by playing games of the same genre.In summary, i'm not crazy for this adventure, but i can't even say it's bad, considering that art and storyline are pretty good. I'd say it's enjoyable overall.			"

												A great story, challenges are great and once understood they are not work intensive. The soundtrack is hair-raising, the plot is rich, with great characters, deals with a delicate theme in a very good way, and although it might look biased it will reveal some pros and cons of both sides, without loosing sight of the greater picture.It has a few bugs {some of the English menu text appears Russian, one or two dialogue lines are skipped automatically, the load time for some animations is too long and the game stutters a bit in a laptop with a Intel Core 2 Duo P8700 (2.53GHz) and a Geforce 9650M GT (2GB dedicated + 1GB from RAM), Windows 7 32bit, and even the credits don't play for more than a few seconds before skipping}, but nothing game breaking. Also, you need a little patience after clicking to load a previously saved game, as the program will be a little unresponsive for a while. But overall the story is worth overlooking those small details.			"

												Gorgeous art, Fantastic Story, some of the puzzles are challenging but that is what makes it so good, if you are like me and dislike easy obvious no brainers. I love how it has a comic feel to it at times. There are a couple things about this game I disliked  1. Horrid voice acting/overs, just terriable.2.English version has mispelled words at times.3. Every once in a while the english point and click commands were in a different languge(but i had the commands pretty much memorized at that point)Over all I recomend this game, the good def outwieghed the bad and I wasn't bothered enough to stop playing. In all actuallity i had a hard time stoping I would look at the clock and oh my it was already 4 in the morning! This game is worth the money :-) and I look forward to playing more games by Daedalic.			"

												A fun game for everything it tries to do. A solid story though nothing ground breaking. The puzzles are nice brain teasers and all offer strong hints if you know where to look. The more challenging and time consuming segments even let you skip them so you can get back to the story. The comic style cutscenes are a nice touch. The game's soundtrack fits it quite well and a few pieces in particular help to distract you from the time spent in the same areas.Time to touch on a few negatives. It is extremely easy to overlook or mouse over both key points and items and spend a fair deal of time frustrated as to why you can't progress. A few points in the game the English audio cuts out and certain text and subtitles are untranslated. A few of the puzzles and one mini game in particular are a big jump in terms of difficulty. Some of the sfx (such as birds, water droplets) are too pronounced and frequent at times leading me to periodic spurts of aggravation. While on the subject of sound, the voice acting though fitting for each character comes off rehearsed and wooden. I only encountered one bug while playing and that was at the end of the game, was remedied by a quick reload. A solid game that can work as a great distraction to other games in your library. Short but a fairly satisfying completion. Recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												Classical point & click adventure... and a good one. The puzzles carry their own internal logic, and except for one or two I thought were a bit far-fetched, it was all very clever.At first, when I read ""eco-thriller"", I was expecting a moralizing finger-pointing edutainment piece, but far from it. The ""big money concerns don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about our planet"" theme was there - and so it is, sadly enough, in real life - but it's just the backdrop for a good story with some twists. You could just as well call it a sci-fi thriller instead.If you like point & click adventures, I recommend this one.			"

												Status:completed primary story, still have a few achievements left to 100%Story lines are the most important (arguably) thing about an adventure game, I will keep this review as spoiler free as possible however there are a few locations that I am going to talk about as well as some things that get established quite early on. If that is unacceptable stop reading now, I shall quickly summarize here: this game should be a 7/10 but is quite buggy so unfortunately I can only reward it a 5 or 6. The graphical style and voice acting are very nice and the storyline is somewhat engaging. If you are a fan of the genre then it is worth a try. None of the bugs I encountered broke the game and if you are willing to look past that then you may indeed rank the game higher.So my quest to play all and review my games library finally got to A. Unfortunately my magpie sense tingled and I recently purchased another bundle which has set me back onto the numbers. Also steam recently reclassified this game into N which I suppose makes sense but its irked me a bit.

												Well... It was ok. I've been playing point and clicks since LucasFilm so have a pretty extensive history with the genre. This game gets a 6.5 out of 10. Interesting enough to make me want to finish, but disappointed by how the game played out. The beginning was rich and interesting but about mid-way the creators ran out of steam and rushed the story telling and puzzles. Also, English is not the native language so one puzzle was unbelievably, insanely, impossible, ""rip all my hair out until I'm bald"", kind of puzzle. And it wasn't even a good puzzle :( The translation mean to they solution has no made no sense (Ok, it's not written bad like that but the puzzle just didn't work). Either way, I plowed through boring puzzles and all. Looks amazing the whole way through and it has an amazing atmosphere. The core of the plot is great as well. Deserves a run through because it's a real point and click and we don't see many these days. But I wish more time and care went into the second half of the game.			"

												A New Beginning is a classic point-and-click adventure made by Daedalic Entertainment in 2010. I've recently played and completed it and I wanted to share my thoughts about it with you. Also, it's currently on a week-long sale on Steam so you can save some money if you decide to get it.The story of A New Beginning is set in the future where Earth is devastated by climate changes and human kind is facing extinction. A group of scientists sets up a team, provides them with a time travelling device and gives them a mission: go back in time and prevent the disaster! Their goal is Bent Svensson, an eco-scientist who ""invented"" blue-green algae that can supply enough energy to power the entire world... but is unfortunate enough to live in the time where money is everything and is impossible to fight the nuclear energy tycoons who pull all the strings. That time is late 20th century. During the game you will be playing with two characters: Fay, a radio-operator from the future and Bent Svensson, the scientist I mentioned before. You don't get to pick a character to control, instead the game switches from one to the other as the story progresses.As I said, it's a typical point-and-click adventure with an incredibly simple interface and controls - right mouse button brings up the inventory on the bottom of the screen, while left mouse button moves your character and offers actions for highlighted objects. That's it - simple and easy. The puzzles in the game range from super easy to normal, they are rather logical and there are never too many available rooms in the same time, so getting stuck is nearly impossible. The only problem may be caused by the infamous pixel hunting, but it's far from annoying as in some other adventures. If I remember right, I only had problems with two items I couldn't see and one was at the very beginning.Voice acting is average. Some lines are rather good, but most are plain average. Same goes with graphics - it's just average. Cut scenes are made in a comic book fashion with ""low frame rate"" and the rest... well, look at the screenshots I posted. However, this being an adventure game, neither the sound nor graphics are all that important!It took me about 9 hours to complete the game and if it wasn't for a bug I encountered I may have been even quicker. The bug I mentioned was at the very end when I had to connect some wires to get specific numbers, but after about 45 minutes of futile reconfiguring, I gave up and looked up the solution online. I was puzzled when I saw the solution because I already tried it and it didn't work. It did, after a reload. The other bugs are mainly language errors: when you click on an object you might get possible actions in a language different than the one you chose, but it really is a minor thing.Overall, it's a fun game. It has its flaws, but its simplicity makes it fun. The story progresses fast enough to make you want to see what comes next and that's what's really important. Steam version has 28 achievements and they are all rather easy to get if you don't skip mini games and explore everything on the screen.			"

 Summary:  An average point-and-click adventure game with a stupid story, a poorly written ending and a badly conveyed environmental message. But decent puzzle design. Buy it cheap, try to ignore the story and you’ll have a decent time with it.  Full review:  You play as Bent Svensson, a retired and miserable algae researcher, and Fay, a time-travelling radio operator sent from the future to save humanity from global warming. She will do so by getting people to use Svensson’s algae to produce energy instead of fossil fuels and atomic power. As characters they are… okay. You can have a lot of comments about Fay, but at least she is not Goal from Deponia, who spends the entire game unconscious and is nothing but the “Goal” for the male protagonist. Fay’s not particularly funny, but she’s okay to play as. Same with Bent, not the most uplifting character, but decently portrayed. This can be contrasted with some of the side-characters that are just god-awful. Especially Duve, Bent’s son, who I would say is probably one of the worst designed characters I’ve even seen. The voice-acting also ranges from decent to pretty bad, though I often got the feeling it was not the voice-actors fault but rather how they recorded and handled the audio files.The story is pretty stupid. Time-travel tends to bring that out in a story, but unfortunately it is not limited to just the time-travel. I appreciate the message they are trying to convey, I really do. Unfortunately it is told in such a heavy-handed manner and in such simplistic terms that it loses all meaning and is very unlikely to convince anyone. After a while they try to go a little deeper into the issues, but it is too little too late.  Other than that, the story is functional if uninteresting throughout most of the game… until the finale, which just utterly sucks. For the sake of a “twist” they completely disregard everything that has happened previously and what little rationale they had for their characters suddenly vanish. I mean, if the ending is true, why is Bent even in the game at all? Incredibly poorly written. The puzzles then. They are the standard Deadalic mix of item-based puzzles with some minigames thrown in to add variety. Overall I found the puzzle design pretty good and really the only reason to play the game. Just like other games of the genre there were some instances of puzzles not making that much sense, but these instances were comparatively few. On the other hand, there are also no real head-scratchers or anything particularly inventive about the puzzles either. Pretty bog-standard. So, why am I even recommending this game? Because the puzzles are pretty nice. And even though the story is not very good, it was not until the very end that it’s really awful. It’s an average title that you should buy cheap and play for the puzzles. Or get a really good adventure game instead.			"

												The game had nice visuals, interesting plot and decent script. There wasn't too much running back and forward, the very reason I tend to avoid the point and click genre.Audio was one of its weak points though. There was voice acting for everything yet it was often unsynced with the subtitles or had strange start and stops. The start and stops are probably from recording separetly and not getting things to match up properly. Most other games solve that problem by inputting delays that makes the start/stop a natural part.The ending was open and I like that. Makes me decide what happens next.			"

It has a decent story, putting emphasis on an issue relevant to us today: the irreversible situation of uncontrolled enviromental damage (climate change influenced by man's actions). Or as the game would have it... reversible through time travel. The puzzles aren't very hard and they are even skippable if you can't figure them out in a few minutes. The game isn't very long, about 5-6 hours, which is both a strength, because it doesn't waste time with irrelevant details and makes the story more concentrated, and a weakness, because who doesn't want more of a good thing? Overall it's a very enjoyable experience, my only tips would be a) change spoken language to German because the voice acting in English is terrible to say the least (you can do this from the panel with little bubbles that contain flags, in the main menu as you start the game), it's very robotic - you can keep subtitles in English so you understand what's being said though; b) don't try to rush actions as the game can bug out, you can also speed things up by double-clicking the areas where the cursor changes into arrows for fast-loading (so you don't have to wait for animations to finish each time).

												Well, let me start off by saying this game is by no means perfect. I got a bug/glitch with the inventory (it simply vanished, but for some reason I was able to solve it by pressing F8), the lables on actions randomly turned to a different language in a few spots, and the voice acting was a bit.. strange at times.I really enjoy 2D, hand-drawn adventures, and this is one of the most beautiful ones I played. The interface takes about half a minute to get used to, actions are a classical point-and-click we all know and love, and the characters are full of surprises. And the story... oh the story! It is strange, and weird, and very engaging, and so very worth playing. I enjoyed the mini-puzzles and found the game quite challenging at times, but none of the puzzles were too obscure or far-fetched. All in all, this is a highly recommended game for all lovers of the genre, and those who plan on becoming ones.			"

												One of the better old-school type 2D puzzle adventure games, filled with many clever puzzles many of which have sensible solutions, other than slightly wonky voice acting and some localization issues this is a brilliant addition to every puzzle adventure gamers collection. Also check out the same developers Deponia series which I highly recommend.			"

												Classic adventure with interesting characters, environments and clever puzzles. I'm actually not a fan of this kind of GFX but after a short while you are into the story and you dont wanna stop any more. At the end the story goes a bit flat but its still fine. A negative point: there is one spot where you get a steam archivement based on your decision. So watch out and do always savegames (so you dont have to play half of the game again like me) :)			"

												I am glad to finally see an adventure game that uses its narrative potential to address some important ecological themes and ideas. Even though the conclusion of the sci-fi story seems a little unrewarding, I always had a good time playing the game. Puzzles are generally solid, the hand painted graphics are beautiful and most of the (German) voice acting is well done. A New Beginning may not be perfect, but it's mature, surprising and quite simply fun to play.Cartoony graphics contrast with a mature story that deals with a serious subject of climate changes caused by human carelessness and is devoid of humor. Instead of puns and wordplays we get well written, intriguing dialogues between believable characters with vivid personalities.			"

												A new beginning is a cartoonish point-&-click adventure about climate change and energy production around 2050. To prevent an environmental catastrophe to happen, a group of organised survivors (I didn't know how to put the status of that group into suited words ;) ) time-travels back to the past to find a scandinavian scientist who might solve the problems leading to the catastrophe.As a fan of the genre, you might like - the new environmental setting of the story (which makes the game ""special"", at least a bit)- a ten hour campaign - well-elaborated characters- beautiful hand-drawn locations, such as an oil-rigDepending on what you expect from a p&c adventure, you might dislike- easy-to-solve puzzles- pretty predictable course of the main story- inconvenient controls (mostly concerning the puzzles)To give a resumé: A new beginning is not a milestone of the genre, but you get a solid adventure with a round and unspent story, nice graphics and plausible characters.

												""A new Beginning"" is just a clicker adventure, but this game has a linear story to tell in a post-apocalyptic world where the earth is destroyed by the forces of nature. It appealed to me only because of it's ""green"" agenda and kept reminding me of the backstory to the Hayao Miyazaki movie Ponyo.A very short game which may take 5-10 hours depending on your puzzle or problem solving skills. Use your moral judgment carefully and keenly and try to be yourself as you make decisions between puzzles that could decide the future for us all.

												A typical Click and point adventure game affair, the puzzles aren't too hard and seem fairly logical so far. The story while not fantastic is enough to immerse you into the game. The voice acting however, My god... I have never heard such bad voice acting. It's like they had someone read out every word in the dictionary, and then simply cobbled the results into sentences, there is very little emotion in the acting, and where there is it changes from one word to the next... Think... Shatner... on... DRUGSand... possibly.... youwillhave... an... ... ...idea... ofwhat... the... VOICE... actING... islike.Needless to say it is very very distracting and honestly it spoils the game, I can only put up with it for about 30 minutes before I have to switch off. That said, the art style is fantastic and keeps me coming back for more.Overall, if you turn off the voices and read the subtitles alone, you will probably enjoy this.			"

												A great story, challenges are great and once understood they are not work intensive. The soundtrack is hair-raising, the plot is rich, with great characters, deals with a delicate theme in a very good way, and although it might look biased it will reveal some pros and cons of both sides, without loosing sight of the greater picture.It has a few bugs {some of the English menu text appears Russian, one or two dialogue lines are skipped automatically, the load time for some animations is too long and the game stutters a bit in a laptop with a Intel Core 2 Duo P8700 (2.53GHz) and a Geforce 9650M GT (2GB dedicated + 1GB from RAM), Windows 7 32bit, and even the credits don't play for more than a few seconds before skipping}, but nothing game breaking. Also, you need a little patience after clicking to load a previously saved game, as the program will be a little unresponsive for a while. But overall the story is worth overlooking those small details.			"

												A fun game for everything it tries to do. A solid story though nothing ground breaking. The puzzles are nice brain teasers and all offer strong hints if you know where to look. The more challenging and time consuming segments even let you skip them so you can get back to the story. The comic style cutscenes are a nice touch. The game's soundtrack fits it quite well and a few pieces in particular help to distract you from the time spent in the same areas.Time to touch on a few negatives. It is extremely easy to overlook or mouse over both key points and items and spend a fair deal of time frustrated as to why you can't progress. A few points in the game the English audio cuts out and certain text and subtitles are untranslated. A few of the puzzles and one mini game in particular are a big jump in terms of difficulty. Some of the sfx (such as birds, water droplets) are too pronounced and frequent at times leading me to periodic spurts of aggravation. While on the subject of sound, the voice acting though fitting for each character comes off rehearsed and wooden. I only encountered one bug while playing and that was at the end of the game, was remedied by a quick reload. A solid game that can work as a great distraction to other games in your library. Short but a fairly satisfying completion. Recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												A New Beginning - Final Cut has everything you want in a point and click adventure game, good story, compelling characters, imaginative enviroments, and challenging but not too hard of puzzles. However, the english version of the game has some pretty poor voice acting/english dialogue. Also, the gameplay was very linear in how you could solve the puzzles.Pros - Great enviroments; the most memorable part of the game is at the beginning of the game in a post-apocalypse sci-fi enviroment. The art is beautiful. The story was gripping (until the end). There was also talk about philosophy, morality, and ethics. A good message at the end. I also enjoyed many of the characters, even a few which only appeared for a short amount of time. And, I enjoyed many of the puzzles in the game except that I thought some of them were a bit too straight forward. I like the self-awarness that the game had. For example, there is this part when you make this sci-fi antenna which had a frustrating yet satisfying part with the cubes. For the rest of the game the cubes were mentioned as being stupidly difficult. Cons - People just don't talk like they do in the game. I suspect that the dialogue was originally written in a different language and translated to english. When I heard a character say something in a strange way, it took me out of the game momentarily. Also, the ending kind of rubbed me the wrong way. The game seemed to be building up to something but then the ending was predictable and implausible. Actually, several times during the game, there were details which were implausible even in the context of the sci-fi story. Also, some of the characters were very one-dimensional, like the main villan.Over all, I recommend the game if you enjoy adventure games with an interesting message and a good amount of attention paid to deatil.

												Another great adventure game from Daedalic! Great story, extraordinary art and nice soundtrack. Heartily recommended! There were a few minor problems though:- Some puzzles give you no instructions whatsoever so you either end up clicking *everything*, looking at a walk through or skipping it (which the game allows).- The English voice acting is somewhat bland and annoying at times. A lot of people seem to be bothered by this, but it was acceptable to me.- There was a single game breaking bug right near the end which forced me to load up a previous save from about ~10 minutes earlier. There might be more of these, so I recommend saving frequently.Overall, A new Beginning was a fantastic game trying to deliver a message. I just hope it doesn't end up preaching to the choir :)			"

I definitely recommend this for anyone who is used to Daedalic games and likes adventure, point-and-click. A sidenote, I did play the game with english subtitles and German voiceactors; I felt it was better this way.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. As others have said the story is a bit preachy but the characters wouldn't have gone through all the trouble of time travel if they didn't believe in their cause so strongly, so I think the preachiness makes perfect sense. I liked the story and it had plot twists so it was always engaging. The majority of the puzzles were really good too. I've run into some menus that weren't translated into English but there's only a couple of those and it's not an issue. To be honest I wasn't a fan of the graphic novel style cutscenes but that's just my personal preference. Also there wasn't any humour which is something I've come to expect of point and click adventure games but that's not necessarily a negative. Other people seem to have a problem with the dialogue and voice acting but I thought it was totally fine.Great game, longer than I expected and definitely worth the full price for me.			"

												Ah, where to begin? It's an adventure game, or as I like to call them, sociopathy simulators. Seriously, when did you ever play an adventure game whose protagonist doesn't end up committing countless crimes, wandering around dozens of locations they technically have no business being in except to advance toward some overarching and/or loopy objective... and frequently slide back as far as they've advanced even after solving puzzle after confusing puzzle?But I digress. A New Beginning is a game with a certain amount of ecological awareness linked to its plot and setting. The problem with eco-themed games is that unless you're already into saving the environment, they probably just annoy you; nobody wants to have someone else's views foisted on them, right? But just in case you're on the fence, well, this could potentially give you a thing or two to think about. I wouldn't expect miracles, but it's a worthy attempt at least.The voice acting is passable. I'm inclined to say the voice direction, in particular, seems rather poor; as if the actors, at least in the english version, were given their lines to read in a studio with no context, no complete script, and so they have to guess at intonations when in-game you can tell some line are meant to refer to another line, which can be pretty grating, at least to me. It really impedes the establishment of any kind of mood or character chemistry, which is a shame because:The characters are, at least in a few places, pretty interesting. I was particularly impressed that someone has made a game whose protagonist -or at least one of its two- is a depressed, burnt out, retired middle-aged workaholic scientist who's lost faith in himself. A different sort of underdog, and one I didn't at all mind getting to know over the course of the game. The rest of the cast is a bit less fleshed-out than I'd have liked, but just the aforementioned character alone earns them points for originality in my book.The puzzles are a bit hit-and-miss. You may well get stuck wondering what to do, but that's what walkthroughs are for... or community guides if you want to keep it all within Steam.Overall, I'd give it a minor thumbs up - good but not great. As with most things, I'd wait for a sale -Daedalic have had some very major discounts from time to time, and you could probably do worse than a lot of their adventure games. Sorry, meant to say sociopathy sims.			"

												By far the most political game I’ve ever played, but choosing the 1980s as the stage for a game where people from mankind’s distant future travel back and try to save the environment from the negative effects of climate change totally worked. However, I would hope that sexism would be resolved in a future where humanity is capable of time travel (i.e., Salvador is a sexist chauvinist pig). The story switches between two characters, and the cutscenes play out in comic-book style panels. The controls weren’t my favorite, and I wished the aspect ratio had a widescreen option, but overall the gameplay is simple enough to figure out. There were some errors where foreign text showed up instead of the English translation, but although the voice acting was pretty atrocious, I found its badness entertaining.			"

												Just no. Sure, A New Beginning - Final Cut looks great, style which I really love in adventure games. Sadly, it's not really interesting and it have some annoying stuff. The story is hit or miss and in my case, it was miss. I could get into this game, so finally after 3rd time installing and playing it, I managed to reach ending. But what's much worse are english voices - during comic sequences it's just sad to watch. At least puzzles were a little interesting but that's all, I don't think that those little things are worth spending your time, and money, with this game. There are tons of adventure games which were made much better, and yes, there are even more games with ""adult"" stories than the one in A New Beginning - Final Cut. Maybe if you are some hardcore fan of point and click adventure games then you can try it but if you are just looking for something fun to play - you came to the wrong neighbourhood, look around for something more popular and something that can be enjoyed no matter what.

												Firstly, if you don't like point and click adventures go no further, this game isn't for you.Still here? Ok, on with the review. This is a weird game, I don't know how to put it any other way. I love point and clicks, and the idea of one with a political relevent storyline appealed to me, so I picked this up. Unfortunately, the storyline is actually pretty nonsensical, which is a death-knell for a point and click. To be fair, it does manage to raise some interesting issues, but it doesn't do anything interesting with them. Also, characters often do/say things that make little sense, and really there are big structural issues in terms of how things play out, that conspire to make things barely coherant by the end (if you make it that long).On the positive side, graphics are really quite good. Also, characters sometimes say things that are unintentionally pretty funny (I'm assuming because of an iffy translation). Also puzzles are okay I guess? Not really stand out, but not awful either.All in all, this game is not terrible. If you really like point and clicks, you might get some mileage out of it. However, buy with caution, and be prepared to be let down by the storyline if you make it all the way through. 5/10			"

												Basically, this game is about an ecoterrorist group trying to save the world by decieving, killing people and destroying things, although the main character is against violence. The story was promissing at first, but ended in a rather anticlimatic fashion, though quite surprising. One more negative point about the story is that if you have some scientific understanding, you will find the sciency stuff in this game very unconvincing. Daedalic should keep making fantasy games.Gameplay is OK, but you will be frustrated from time to time with the ""logic"" of the game. In addition, the very fact that this is a Point and Click game makes it sometimes extremely limiting when you need to inspect a certain object to solve a puzzle. Feel free to vist the walkthrough guide from time to time, no need to torture yourself.			"

												A solid point and click adventure game. A few translation issues as others have mentioned, I thought the voice acting was decent for the most part, I suspect the scripts they were given to be the cause of some of the woodeness of the characters. Some of the minor characters were overacted. This was a source of some amusement to me, others may disagree. Puzzles weren't too difficult or stupidly simple, though a couple may require a guide (easily googled) and there was one that was kind of glitchy. Story is very left wing agenda save the planet from global warming and stop evil corporation. If you own three SUVs and are an oil baron(ess) you may want to skip this one.Worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre, while it's not great it's solid, which is sadly rare for this style of game.

The visuals are great just like all the other Daedelic games, Deponia, Whispered world etc.   The only thing I did not like are the English voices. The majority of them sound like text-to-speech translation, emotionless to say the least, and the main female voice actually sounds similar to Apple's SiRi.

												It's a traditional point and click adventure game with terrible voice acting and animations, as well as sub-par translation (came across parts that are not translated at all). Other than that, fans of this genre will mostly find what they want.The story is a bit slow in the beginning, but picks up after a while. The puzzles are okay (although not spectacular) and some require a bit of thinking.The game itself successfully delivers a clear and urgent message about pollution and the effects of global warming - makes one think about it all.EDITED: So I decided to pick up on this game again. I have to admit, the story and the overall atmosphere do pick up starting chapter 3. You get more involved in what's going on and you actually feel as if you are supposed to stop the world from chaos. Came across untranslated parts a couple more times, and the voice acting is definitely hit or miss. The character animations could have also been better. Still, will play it through and see how the story unravels.			"

												I have to admit from the start: I am an adventure fanatic. I love point and click games and the adventure genre is probably the only one that can immerse me fully in the story, it feels at times like I am directing my own movie based on a very strict script. I have been playing a few titles from Daedalic lately and find them all to be pretty good, especially on the artwork side of things.A New Beginning is simply put: gorgeous! The sceneries are beautifully drawn and the comic book style cutscenes are beautiful, engaging and quite unique, I haven't seen them done in any other game so far. The only issue with the graphics side of things that I can find is the actual characters. They feel extremely out of place in some of the scenes, they difference in detail is quite striking at times and their placement in the scene looks off from time to time. A little more attention to animation and placement would have been nice to see. The interface is minimalistic and easy to access, there's no extra buttons to be pressed, a right click on the mouse and you can easily toggle the inventory.The soundtrack is also great, the composed songs really fit the game and its circumstances so it also scores high points for sound design. The only issue that I can find with this game is voice acting. Seriously, this could have been a perfect game if not for the lousy voice acting. It really sounds like the actors read line after line without putting them into context, more like a monologue than a dialogue which sounds extremely silly at times and quite unprofessional. And speaking of lines, the script is quite poorly written. You get the feeling that the characters are either uneducated or plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect people in a game to speak like a Literature PhD, but definitely not like someone who barely finished high school.Speaking of the script I should also address the story. It's a little cliche if you ask me, the kind of story that reminds you of those 90's television-made movies that try to blend action with drama, but also convey a strong message and meaning while not bothering the viewer with questions and instead putting any answers straight on the table. A New Beginning also tries to send a message but it does poorly and scarcely and only focuses on this aspect by the end of the game. It also tries to do it via the aforementioned poor voice acting leaving you rather facepalmed and laughing out loud that deeply moved and touched. It does, however, make up for it in the final scene, which unfortunately appears right at the end of the credits which can be skipped so most of the players will definitely miss this one.All in all this was a great game to play with an immersive story, great sound design and loads of puzzles ranging from moderate to hard and many actions that require out-of-the box thinking so it can be both challenging and frustrating at times. The game also has a seamless auto-save feature so if your game happens to crash just hit continue on the main screen (the autosave is not visible in the load menu).I give this one a 8.5/10			"

												I bought A New Beginning during a phase where I bought a lot of adventure games. I had just played a few good ones and wanted more of the genre. So I got a lot of them queued up when they were on sale.A New Beginning looks good if you can ignore the dated 4:3 aspect ratio. I especially liked the layered comic book style cinematic sequences. And although some of the puzzles required leaps in logic or pixel hunting that I found hard to stomache they were mostly par for the course.That's the end of the good things I can say about this game though. The writing is bad and the voice acting is shockingly worse. Truly abysmal. I think it might take the cake for worst voic acting I've ever heard in a game. By the end I just turned on the subtitles and started skipping through the sequences. If I had to hear either of the main characters deliver even one more sentence I would've thrown my speakers against the wall.The interface is clumsy and buggy. I repeatedly ran into parts where untranslated cyrillic appeared instead of the English options. Talk about not knowing what to do.Honestly, all of that pales in comparison to the real problem: the story. I like the idea of traveling through time to save the environment, but the writers got all the possible details wrong. It's like this game was paid for by coal and oil companies. They blame nuclear power for the end of the world. It's the worst kind of naive reactivism. Just to be clear: nuclear power is the cleanest, most sustainable way forward for human civilization. To pretend otherwise and preach it publicly in a game like this is the worst kind of sin. Even if everything else about the game were perfect I still wouldn't be able to support it. But there's plenty else wrong.			"

												The storyline is great - maybe even of the greatest I've ever seen - but there are some small flaws in it that don't make any sense. Still, I really loved the story, the soundtrack, the dialogues, and the characters. You must buy it! Be warned though that some of the puzzles are quite hard.			"

Disclaimer:I am not a professional video gamer.  I am not a professional video game reviewer.  I am not a professional journalist or writer.  I play and review games because I am a gamer and I enjoy doing so.  My opinions are just that, opinions.  Just because I like and recommend a purchase does not mean you have to agree with all or any of what I have said.  Please consider this while reading this review.  The goal is to share my personal opinions of a game, because I enjoy doing so, and in turn if it helps someone with their decision to purchase, then that is wonderful.ReviewI purchased ""A New Beginning - Final Cut"" because I am an adventure genre fan.  I hold these games in high regard since they are what officially started my obsession with PC gaming, back when Sierra reigned in the industry.I am aware of the rather mixed reviews that the game has received here on Steam in the reviews section, which is why I try to base all my reviews on value for the money.Some may disagree with this method, but it is the one I choose to use when it comes to older games.Currently, at the time of writing this, the game is on sale for $2.49 which is what I paid.  Based on that cost I would definitely recommend this to any fans of the genre.  I will not hesitate to warn of the immediate problems with the game though.  The dialogue is quite juvenile and the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard in a game.  According to the research this is due to poor localization.  Apparently, in Germany where this game was made, there are not a lot of American (or other language) voice actors  available to do localization for games.  The dialogue though, I am not sure if it just translated poorly or was just that poorly written.Still, despite these flaws I was able to play through the story and overall, enjoy the experience.  It might not be the most original story, or the best written, but the way it is presented to me is fresh and enjoyable.  I find the art style and animation to be appealing and the little comic style cutscenes to be a good fit.  I would say the length of the game is just about right.  At about 8 hours for completion, this is just enough without being too drawn out, or too short.   There is a decent mix of simple puzzles and your typical item combinations that make this a decent classic adventure.So, if you can overlook it's faults, and are an adventure game fan, I think you will enjoy this purchase.Pros:- Appealing Art and style- Enjoyable soundtrack- CharmingCons:- Voice Acting is abysmal- Poorly written dialogue (bad translation or just bad writing? Not sure)- Characters are unlikable (likely due to the above two points)			"

												A classic Daedalic Click and Point Adventure, with some achronogical story telling and character swapping that keeps what would be an otherwise stale story intriguing and fresh.  There were a small to moderate amount of translation errors in the English version. Great visuals and game mechanics, as usual. Still enjoyable, particularly if you have played other Daedalic's other titles. A good effort from Daedalic, but not their best.			"

												There are far more good reasons to play this game than to let it sit on your library. If you are looking for a old Point and Click games like Lucas Arts released long ago, there are options more suitable than this one out there. The biggest improvement in comparison to older adventure titles is the care put into puzzle mechanics. They don´t feel tedious, the logical distribution of the inventory carried throughout the game helps a lot. You will not carry more than 6 items at a time. This severely reduces the amount of times players will get stuck solving a puzzle. It is also notable that they were clever enough to lock areas where the players actions would not help progress the story.  The plot is entertaining enough to keep you playing but the characters are either too obvious, the kind that deducts immersion to the story.   6.5/10			"

The story is simple enough to follow, so far anyway, and the gameplay is easy to pick up.

												In A New Beginning, your mission is to save the world from the effects of climate change. It is a standard point and click adventure game. This game can suffer from a bit of the old adventure game crazy logic.  Nothing too crazy, but some of the solutions are a little out there. The story picks up and gets interesting in the middle acts, but really falters quite a bit toward the end. Also, their message about climate change is hammered home over and over again.I can't tell if it's just a problem with my computer, but it seems to be stuck in fullscreen mode with a low resolution. This must be an iOS port, which I didn't know ahead of time. That's not a deal breaker, but it could look better. The environments and characters are all drawn well. The cutscenes are all done in a graphic novel style which looks great. The voice acting can be a little jarring at times and leave a bit to be desired. The overall sound effects and music are enjoyable.This won't change your mind about point and click adventures if you aren't a fan of the genre,  but if you like them alread it's worth the time.Grade: C+			"

												This game has its good and bad moments, but it's generally enjoyable. The comic book-style art is pleasant and nicely done. The climate change / time travel storyline is long and complex, and an okay story for the most part (it gets a bit out of hand towards the end), but the actual writing falls short. Too many characters have unrealistic reactions to too many extraordinary events, just to have the plot advance. The female protagonist is not developed enough to be likeable, and the shoddy voice acting for her doesn't help either. Still, despite these flaws, overall the game was worth my while.			"

												I rather enjoyed their other point-and-click game arc, Deponia, so I picked this game up and thought I'd give it a try.  While it was entertaining and the storyline was interesting enough (although a little predictable/foreseeable in areas) to keep me interested, what really appealed to me was the animated, comic style cut-scenes.  The puzzles are challenging enough and you have the option to skip them after several minutes, which appeals to both player types.  The point-and-click game play rarely has excessive long-walking-to-interact sequences, as it incorporates quick keys for interactive areas/travel, which is also appealing.  The gameplay graphics themselves are decent enough, probably a tad lower in quality than Deponia.  Replayability is probably minimal.As with some of their other games, you can tell that English is not the first language for this game.  Unfortunately that does make dialogue a bit painful to listen to as sentences are overly structured and not quite ""real"".  There are even game play areas where translation was missed, so actions or words that are presented are in a different language.  The audio recordings for the two main characters, oddly, were the most difficult to listen to as it sounded robotic in extended conversations (which may be the case).All in all, the game provides enough entertainment to justify purchasing and can provide you with a couple nights adventure.

												While I'm usually a huge fan of Daedalic and point and click adventure games, this game wasn't really my cup of tea. While I expected from the trailer that it was going to be really heavy on the ecology rhetoric, I expected it to at least be well thought out and more of a basic subtext. Instead, it's more like they're battering you in the face with a rusty aluminum baseball bat than kindly trying to change your mind about the immediacy of problems with our environment.The villain is lame, the characters you play as are even more lame, and I had a really hard time caring about anything that was going on in the game. The gameplay aspects are semi challenging and I liked that some of the more obtuse puzzles can be skipped past at the cost of loosing an achievement. If the story and characters were better, I would have liked it. But, alas, they were not. I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												While I wanted to like this game, with its beautiful art and seemingly interesting plot, the voice ""acting"" is awful-- they might as well have used Siri's voice. It was so bad I turned off the sound, it was so distracting that it took away from the story. I had a better time when the sound was off and reading subtitles, but still, that should *not* be the case at all. The story was not really all that engaging, and personally, I didn't care much for the characters due to their shallow character development and awful voices. This is absolutely vital for a game of this type. As much potential as this game had, it really fell short due to a lack of focus when it comes to the fundamentals of what makes up a great game.			"

												I'm an avid fan of point-and-click adventure games (as evident from my game library), and I have to say that this game is atrocious. The programming is bad and riddled with bugs (audio and text often going out of sync, characters disappearing, text getting replaced with random Russian characters), but none of that would be such a dealbreaker if most of the puzzles weren't completely nonsensical and relied on the old ""try everything with everything"" approach. While the adventure game genre generally suffers from the mentioned problem to some extent, some games are better than others and actually rely on logic and don't expect you to get into the programmer's head in order to solve them. Story-wise, it's nothing special and most characters aren't even likeable.Give this one a miss. Pure disappointment.			"

												This game looks like a lot of buried potential. It has interesting setting, quite relatable characters, non very common animation style - similar to comic book, but all of this is spoiled by very buggy translation(I played English version) and engine,  Translation problems very likely come mostly from the fact that not all sound content was translated to English. So some dialogs are just fastforwarded without audio and too fast to read.  Couple of times I had to reload to restore disappeared mouse pointer. Not very convenient interface of inventory and gameplay as whole. Plot holes itself could have been justified by being the plot devices itself  (as we know Fay is terrible liar), but not all of them are so easily excusable.  If there were no bugs I would rate this game 7/10 for plot and 6/10 for gameplay.			"

The artwork was good and reminded me of the good ole days when point and click were kings(but better than old days). For some reason I liked the premise of the story but then I felt like I was being preached to like some government infomercial (like refer madness but for climate change).  Also it felt a bit ridiculous... Overall I am really sad I could not like this game more I had such high hopes.			"

												I can't recommend this game.  The environmental message is preachy and off-putting and boring.  The translation is filled with errors and weirdness that make the game feel un-polished.  The scenery is nothing special.  None of the characters are likable.  A New Beginning is the only Daedalic adventure game I've played so far that I haven't liked.  I wanted the game to be over when I was about seventy percent through (I completed the game without using a walkthrough).  Play a different Daedalic game, such as The Dark Eye or The Night of the Rabbit, instead of A New Beginning.			"

												A decent adventure game from Daedelic, however the absolutely abysmal voice acting ruins it as mentioned by other reviewers. It's seriously that bad; the phrases are spoken with completely random intonations that more often than not do not relate to the situation at all. If you buy it, play it on mute.			"

												I'm an avid fan of point-and-click adventure games (as evident from my game library), and I have to say that this game is atrocious. The programming is bad and riddled with bugs (audio and text often going out of sync, characters disappearing, text getting replaced with random Russian characters), but none of that would be such a dealbreaker if most of the puzzles weren't completely nonsensical and relied on the old ""try everything with everything"" approach. While the adventure game genre generally suffers from the mentioned problem to some extent, some games are better than others and actually rely on logic and don't expect you to get into the programmer's head in order to solve them. Story-wise, it's nothing special and most characters aren't even likeable.Give this one a miss. Pure disappointment.			"

												This game looks like a lot of buried potential. It has interesting setting, quite relatable characters, non very common animation style - similar to comic book, but all of this is spoiled by very buggy translation(I played English version) and engine,  Translation problems very likely come mostly from the fact that not all sound content was translated to English. So some dialogs are just fastforwarded without audio and too fast to read.  Couple of times I had to reload to restore disappeared mouse pointer. Not very convenient interface of inventory and gameplay as whole. Plot holes itself could have been justified by being the plot devices itself  (as we know Fay is terrible liar), but not all of them are so easily excusable.  If there were no bugs I would rate this game 7/10 for plot and 6/10 for gameplay.			"

												The worst voice acting I have ever heard, a heavy-handed political agenda, and bugs galore. All puzzles are too easy to solve and entirely skippable, Daedalic's contribution to the decline of the point-and-click adventure game genre. The tool wheel is frustrating, and context-sensitive item text will randomly turn into Cyrillic script for no apparent reason. Characters will often become permenantly stuck at room exits, forcing you to reload a previous save: So save often. I'm just glad that I didn't pay full price for this incredible disappointment. ""More than 20 hours' worth of game time"" directly translates into approximately six hours and possibly seven if you've decided to solve the puzzles yourself. Do not buy this game.			"

												The irony is in the name - ""Final Cut""......... it would've been better calling it 'Draft Copy.'The premise is ok being an original storyline.  Also, the cut scenes in graphic novel format are a good idea except it was poorly executed.  There was no voice sync at all and if you had subtitles switched on they obscure 90% of the text.Worst of all was the voice acting.  Clearly, the actors had no idea what they were reading.  It was so forced, stilted and often with out the correct emphasis I spent half my time shouting at the speakers, it's just so painful to listen to.  The translation, grammar and vocabulary was also very poor.Overall, the game has the feeling of being a rushed product which is a shame as the visuals are pretty good.  But when faced with such terrible voice acting it really detracts from the good stuff and for that reason it has zero replayability.			"

												This game starts out with a bang and the fizzles out at the start. Its the end of the world and they are sending some one back to the past. So we start with a sad sack of a man who mostly wallows in self pity at his life. We start with him trying to fix a fogger machine. So the adventure starts for 10 to 15 minutes you have to work on getting a fogger activated. Wow. Heavy stuff. You later need a part in a locked up shed. Does the sad sack know where its at? No because he got drunk and hid it. Spoiler its behind a picture on the wall. Now you would have to be very dexterous with you hands to put a key behind a picture in a framed photo. However this guy was drunk and some how  managed it. I found this game to be very tedious and nit picky. Example for the key to work you have to select said key and then direct it to the door. If you try and click on the guy to open the door you will get a I dont know where the key is I got drunk.? Ugh. So its very tedious like that. Graphics are fine. Sound is good. Gameplay bored me to tears. I watched a youtube to figure out where the key was hidden. The game is an exercise in tedium. The game might be for some who want to take a hands on approach. Me I was bored from the moment I had to fix a fog machine.			"

												Time traveling hippies are trying to save the world by begging a grumpy norwegian scientist to help them. The story really isn't too interesting, it's the kinda ”I started reading it, now I have to see it through until the end, as it would bother me not to know.” It's pretty predictable with a standard cheesy bad guy involved.As for the characters, there really wasn't anyone I particularly liked or stood out to me. Fay could have been a very interesting character by telling of her time and how she grew up, but you only get a few ideas of how her world is like. Appearently she is supposed to be so clueless about the world as she doesn't even know what coffee is, yet she knows how to use a fax. She seems to swap knowledge throughout the story. The main character Bent is unlikable. Grumpy man who can't admit being wrong and doesn't really try either even though the plot gives him several oppertunities to make things right between himself and his family. I do give the game credit for featuring a gay character. The game is extremely buggy and utterly clumsy at times. The main problem being the cursor and how you interact with things. To interact with something, you have to leftclick and hold, then steer the mouse towards the option you want and then let go. Many times I found myself struggling to select the choice I wanted. The control feels extremely unresponsive at times. Sometimes it's also hard to interact with the objects on the screen. I had to look at a guide on the internet to advance at one point, because I really couldn't make the cursor register a pair of keys unless I knew exactly in what area to click. Other times I followed a guide and I still had problems activating certain items. The game can be annoyingly picky at times. Certain times you need to open every drawer, other times you only need to click on one drawer to open them all. Due to being forced into this awkward click-hold-and-steer combination, I often find myself being unable to deselect items without having the character comment on it. Sometimes the dialogue can be quite long, so missclicks becomes tedious. Secondly, the game wasn't obviously throughouly tested. One part of the game, the dialogue skipped completely and the objects I interacted with were so unresponsive, that I missed the whole dialogue in one of the important scenes. And it wasn't just some random talk, it was a key plot event. Sometimes certain objects wouldn't trigger any reactions at all, making me wonder if I failed to click it. Other times, it caused the character to suddenly speak german! There are options in the games that are not translated at all. One door only has two russian options, neither which I could understand what they meant. The end credits are bugged, you only get to see half before the game skips and loads something else. The subtitles in the game don't always match up with what the characters say and sometimes the text loads long before the dialogue is even spoken. The voiceacting in the game was horrible! Almost every actor in the game has a wooden, monotone speech. No matter the situation, they have the same level of emotion. During critical situations or emotionally charged scenes, you really notice how terrible it is. It's obvious at times the actors aren't even trying. The main characters are unfortunately among the worst actors.I don't know whether it was a fault of the translation or because I just couldn't follow the plot, but more than half the time I had no idea what the characters wanted me to do. The characters don't give any good clues when you use objects, just some random nonsense like ”No”, ”Um”, ”Nope”, ”Hm”, ”Nah”. I don't feel like I have had this problem before with these kinds of games, usually you are provided with a clear objective. There are also times where I was quite baffled as the game seemed to skip out on it's own plot and advanced anyway. As an example, Fay decides to go looking for a person, but then she just... forgets about it? And that's even after making a huge deal about finding the person. It's unfortunate the game is riddled with so many bad things, because the artwork and style is amazing. I loved how the game plays out like a comic and the characters look drawn in every environment, blending in perfectly with the background. Visually, this game is so pleasing to the eyes. The way the comic styled art is drawn during the ”cutscenes” is interesting to watch and feels very unique. The whole game feels like reading a comic book rather than just playing a PC game. Unfortunately, the horrendous voiceacting manages to ruin it. You see Bent or Fay expressing a strong emotion, but the only thing you hear is the emotional investment of a decaying zombie.			"

												I bought this when it was on sale, so I'm not out a ton of money for the game, but had I known what it was about prior to buying a package deal, I would have saved the cash. The storyline is depressing and centered around uncompelling characters. The game has a tendency to beat the player over the head with environmentalist issues. However, the bugs and unintuitive nature of the puzzles are what make it fairly frustrating to play. I've only gotten through maybe half of Chapter 2, but the game avatar is now stuck and unresponsive to movement commands, meaning I won't be bothering to play it through in the future.			"

												The only good aspects of this game are the graphics and, a little bit, the story whereas the gameplay is awful and illogical (the kind of illogicality you usually find in games like monkey island or sam&max, ect.) and in light of the themes involved (pollution, extinction and similar, dealt in a serious way above all) you find yourself confused because it's not a humorous game neither thriller or horror game, so what? It's a mild game?! And due to this I get stuck a lot of time because I couldn't figure out what should be the ""action"" to let move along the game (I had to use the walkthrough too many times, very too!). I think the gameplay need to mirror the type of game is adopted to; so, for me, thumb down.Buy it, only if it's on really low discount			"

												Very glitchy. Full program aborting on many levels. I've also been trapped in the Brazilian bar level whichI havent currently been able to circumvent yet. It can really try your patience at times. Unfortunate because weak programming aside, I actually enjoyed the overall plot, levels, illustrations, puzzles. It really had some strengths that kept me playing. The puzzles are quite hard at times but not impossible although it would take Batman not to look up a walkthrough at least once during the game. The voice acting is comically bad for the most part and is highlighted to spectacular effect by the leading character who sounds like he is being played by a computer generated program rather than a real human being. It's dialogue is too blatant and preachy when subtlety would have been more effective in getting the audience to enjoy the story first before thinking about ecological issues. Overall it was heading to a 6/10 but i've got no forgiveness for a game that crashes repeatedly this far after its original release. Now its looking at a 4/10 and im feeling deflated and defeated. I'm currently weighing up a deep philosophical debate about whether I can be bothered to open this up again; i feel that is an important emotion to leave on record...			"

												Hello earthlings. We love video...games and we know you....would love this one.Now this may in fact be due to the translation, but this is stilted and unnatural writing and voice acting even for a robot. And not only is the message preachy but also misguided at best or horribly intellectually dishonest at worst. The game starts off with you repairing a machine who's sole purpose is to kill all of the wild life in the forest in order to keep the wood fresh, whatever that means.  So I don’t know about you, but I use a wood burning furnace to heat my home during the winter and I don’t poison all living creatures in order to keep the wood fresh. No what you do is chop a tree down (normally a dead one or one that needs to be moved) and then you split and stack it and depending on the wood you have leave It for a year to be burned later. I’m sorry I just lied to you because in order to burn wood you must use a poison gas emitter in order to kill (as the game shows) or smoke out (how this would work if you’re ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to actually do this) all living things, because when you run out of wood to burn you need to chop down the next tree, one at a time, in ten below weather and in the middle of a snow storm. This is in the first few minutes of game play and it doesn’t get better. This isn’t even preaching, this is as if an alien traveled to earth and decided to make videogame who just choose to make a game based off a popular topic and he is painfully unaware that everyone can tell he is not human.

												This was my first Daedalic Entertainment game, and I was not disappointed.This game has a deep story, which kept me intrigued throughout the game. The story gives out a strong message about global warming and the effects it had on the world in the future. Such a heart warming story. At no point was I bored or lost with what I had to do next. The puzzles were well thought out, and always kept you thinking.The best part of the game has to be the art style, with a nice graphic novel theme going on. Very fitting for all the areas in the game, be it the past and future parts.The characters were ace, I loved each and every one of them with their characteristics and involvement in the story. Even with the minor characters, which you saw / interacted with briefly.There are a few minor bugs with the game, the ones I noticed were the translations being shown in game. At a couple points, my sub titles and hovering over items would switch to Russian text. But the game remained English audio. That was the main issue I had with the game, but it usually picked its self up again after leaving and re-entering a screen.In conclusion:  The game has a strong, point hitting story.  It uses stunning novel graphics, which are very well drawn.  Fantastic and brain boggling puzzles to solve.  Rememberable characters.  Beautiful cinematic cut scenes, played out in a comic strip style.  There are some visual translation bugs, where it does switch to another language time to time.8 / 10, well worth playing at least once.			"

It's quite obvious this game was translated into english, as some of the phrases that were said just kicked out enjoyment that I had.

												The graphic novel style is cool but that's about all this game has going for it.On the other hand the list of cons stretches on:Voice acting often sounds computerizedMessy story that does a lot of jumping aroundPuzzles that ignore basic logicOut of time and misspelled subtitlesMouthes of characters move out of sync with the dialogueRequires a lot of running from one end of a level and back again without achieving muchLots of bugs that mean things don't work as they should and the game will randomly crashIt was a struggle to push myself to finish this game and I urge you not to do the same. Even if the game is on special for a few dollars don't waste your money3.5/10			"

												Very glitchy. Full program aborting on many levels. I've also been trapped in the Brazilian bar level whichI havent currently been able to circumvent yet. It can really try your patience at times. Unfortunate because weak programming aside, I actually enjoyed the overall plot, levels, illustrations, puzzles. It really had some strengths that kept me playing. The puzzles are quite hard at times but not impossible although it would take Batman not to look up a walkthrough at least once during the game. The voice acting is comically bad for the most part and is highlighted to spectacular effect by the leading character who sounds like he is being played by a computer generated program rather than a real human being. It's dialogue is too blatant and preachy when subtlety would have been more effective in getting the audience to enjoy the story first before thinking about ecological issues. Overall it was heading to a 6/10 but i've got no forgiveness for a game that crashes repeatedly this far after its original release. Now its looking at a 4/10 and im feeling deflated and defeated. I'm currently weighing up a deep philosophical debate about whether I can be bothered to open this up again; i feel that is an important emotion to leave on record...			"

												This game has a great premise, a great soundtrack and falls flat on the face due technical issues later in the game and in the last third of the game, the plot falls over itself flat on the face. Some technical notes: - don't mix savegames of non-steam versions (GOG) with the steam versions. - you cannot save after being in the jungle and you have to play through the rest of the game. - there is some bug where all protagonists are a black shilouette after loading a savegame.

												This is going to sound harsh, and its going to sound like I didn't do enough of my research or that maybe this just isn't my game, and although those things are probably all true, there is no way I could have continued after the second hour of the most terrible voice acting I have ever witnessed. It's a point and click, which I have played and have enjoyed previously, but this one just has so little action and puzzle that I sit there eventually skipping through lines to get to the good stuff. I feel like I don't need to say this for anyone who has access to watching some gameplay, but the voices--the voice acting--is terrible. Constantly line after line, the characters lead off into everchanging moods and tones so that one sentence they are mourning the complete annihilation of San Francisco and then the next line that literally overlaps their own voice, they are making a joke about an antenna.The story is really cheesy too. Scientists are coming back from the future to make people in the past recycle more. I feel like this should be maybe one episode of a children's show, and then nothing past that, I would be satisfied. Keep it in the very front of your mind that I am reviewing my personal experience of the game and someone else might like it, don't get upset that I'm bashing your favorite game (but seriously, your FAVORITE GAME?! What are you, 5?)It needs more pointing and clicking and solving of puzzles.Overall: 2/10			"

												This game is a fairly average point and click adventure.  Some people love to hate on it simply because of its story; an environmental ""save the planet OMG"" tale.  However, taking the game as a whole, I'd just say it's ok.  Not great, not terrible.  The voice-acting is mostly passable, the story is moderately interesting despite feeling like an EPA advertisement, and the graphics and environments were pretty nice.  The game also, unfortunately, falls into the same traps that many other point and click adventure games have: obscure (and I mean OBSCURE) connections between items that are necessary to complete puzzles, etc. in order to progress.  I had to use a walkthrough to complete the game...the puzzles just didn't flow naturally to me.  Most of it I could figure out, but I wanted to finish the story, not revisit the same place over and over again to find out I needed one guy in a room watching a microwave in order to steal something.It's worth it I think if you get it in a cheap bundle or on sale.  $4 or $5 at the most.

												If you are looking for a point and click adventure game, then this is an enjoyable game to play.  So if that is all you are looking for, then get this game.However, the rough english translations prevented me from enjoying this game.  It's quite obvious this game was translated into english, as some of the phrases that were said just kicked out enjoyment that I had.  I'm pretty sure that the story was quite enjoyable and believable when it was written in it's native language, but the horrible translation made everything so stupid.  If it had been translated better, I'm pretty sure the game would have been much more enjoyable.The game was fun but the poor translation prevents me from recommending this game.			"

												This was my first Daedalic Entertainment game, and I was not disappointed.This game has a deep story, which kept me intrigued throughout the game. The story gives out a strong message about global warming and the effects it had on the world in the future. Such a heart warming story. At no point was I bored or lost with what I had to do next. The puzzles were well thought out, and always kept you thinking.The best part of the game has to be the art style, with a nice graphic novel theme going on. Very fitting for all the areas in the game, be it the past and future parts.The characters were ace, I loved each and every one of them with their characteristics and involvement in the story. Even with the minor characters, which you saw / interacted with briefly.There are a few minor bugs with the game, the ones I noticed were the translations being shown in game. At a couple points, my sub titles and hovering over items would switch to Russian text. But the game remained English audio. That was the main issue I had with the game, but it usually picked its self up again after leaving and re-entering a screen.In conclusion:  The game has a strong, point hitting story.  It uses stunning novel graphics, which are very well drawn.  Fantastic and brain boggling puzzles to solve.  Rememberable characters.  Beautiful cinematic cut scenes, played out in a comic strip style.  There are some visual translation bugs, where it does switch to another language time to time.8 / 10, well worth playing at least once.			"

My feelings for the characters varied from mild disdain to out-right hostility (Salvador) and the twist at the end felt like something they shoe-horned in because it had to have a twist.  In fact they hinted at a better ending *Spoiler alert*  with the discussion of 'did our travelling back in time cause the accident' and then never spoke of it again.			"

												This has got to be one of the worst point & click I've ever played. Apart from the base artwork (not including the average comic cutscenes), the whole thing feels really amateurish. The gameplay is ridiculously messy and tedious (for example, why do we have to hold the mouse button for every single interaction, why?? and why are some elements in big puzzles so hard to click?), which is quite mind-boggling for a point & click game. Add some terrible puzzle designs to this and you get a pretty unpleasant game to play overall. Hell, you just need to go 5 minutes into the game to feel something is wrong thanks to this crazy non-sensical 1st puzzle. For this reason, I ended up using a walkthrough to get through after a few hours in, because I still wanted to know where the story was going.Speaking of the story, it feels like it's been written by some naive 14 years old who just got into environmental activism. The poor translation and dreadful acting probably doesn't help, but it still feels incredibly cheesy and convoluted, especially near the end. In fact, it felt like watching a really bad 80s movie where everything gets so ridiculous it becomes funny and that's probably what kept me playing till the end! For this reason alone, I'd recommend this game, if the gameplay wasn't so painful.Anyway, if you like point & click games, don't let this deter you from other Daedelic titles. They're usually quite successful at crafting very nice characters and universes. I especially enjoyed the Edna & Harvey and the Deponia series for instance.			"

												I played the game for a couple chapters, but eventually decided that I wasn't having nearly enough fun to justify spending any more time on it -- nor, for that matter, to justify taking up 4 gigs of space on my hard drive. It's a point-and-click puzzle game, but the puzzles are seldom of the ""reasonable challenge"" variety; they're either painfully obvious, or painfully obtuse where you only stumble across them by trying absolutely every way to be wrong (e.g., boosting a laser's power by adding a lens cut away from the plastic cover for a neon sign, which you may recognize as a technique that wouldn't work). This is often magnified by the puzzles having perfectly logical solutions that the game ignores in favor of going around in circles and repeating the same action several times until it finally gives a different result. (It even gives an achievement for putting up with the ""Quickie"" computer character that embodies one of these moments.)I grew up with the puzzle games from Sierra and LucasArts; I get that lateral thinking is a large part of the genre, and that it's easy for developers to miss the mark and come up with a ""solution"" that can only be seen in hindsight. But those games balanced it out by making it worthwhile with good stories. This game does not. It's an extremely heavy-handed story about climate change, bearing a strong resemblance to the film 2012 in its ""We're all doomed RIGHT NOW"" approach. It's not that I object to the message itself; it's that the message isn't entertaining, which is the one and only possible purpose of a video game. I'm not really geared up to spend several hours lecturing myself. Coupled with protagonists who are utterly unlikeable (one terminally depressed, one aggressively arrogant, both humorless), and there's simply nothing to make me want to play much past the beginning of A New Beginning.

But unfortunately ""A New Beginnig - Final Cut"" couldn't convince me at all.First, the story (in my opinion the most important part about a P&C): at the start the plot sounded quite interesting: a myserious woman from the future asks you to help her save the world but while I was waiting for a mindblowing story to evolve, I was disappointed by a rigmarole that didn't take any step forward until the end of the game when a ""sudden"" turning point tried to save my day ... in vain. Not only was the story's outcome in my opinion totally obvious, it also turned into an annoying preaching and made the last cutscene seem to take forever.The difficulty is quite low. I can understand that no one wants to search each and every pixel to find necessary items. That's why I decided to rather evaluate the mini-game-difficulty, and that is really poor: little puzzles in P&Cs are ment to let you enjoy a little, fresh breeze because searching for clickables can be awefully teasing. But ""A New Beginning"" doesn't offer any good or original ideas in this case; within seconds you can master all of the riddles and so they just contribute to lengthening the game time without increasing the fun.The gameplay is solid, but all animations take too much time and simply turn out to be frustrating when you're forced to backtrack or simply can't find the essential piece that's missing. Moving-Animations are not of the best quality, they look clunky and sometimes over-stylized (e.g. character postures) so that they almost appear unrealistic and ridiciulous. This might be a possible design-decision that comes along with the cartoonish graphic-style, that - in general - is rather mediocre (dreary color-set, unimpressive location-design, no high-resolution). But even if, I would state that this design-decision was a bad one, because it brakes the sympathy for the protagonists.The replayability is in my honest opinion practically zero. I personally didn't use any guides for the achievements but still it was easy-going to earn all of them in ""one playthrough"": I simply saved before every special interaction and when I unlocked one of the badges I went back to see if I could get an alternative answer/question/interaction. Unfortunately, all of the alternatives don't contribute to the story, at all.~Conclusion~""A New Beginning - Final Cut"" is - in my opinion - one of the suboptimal Point&Click-Adventures. It rather confirms some people's opinion that this genre is boring and has no challenges, at all. Additionally, it can't even convince with its story or characters. I personally really disliked the female protagonist, who took a lot of wrong decisions that simply made her look stupid, impertinent and immature; and none of this contributed to the plot in a positive way. If you're looking for a good P&C you should rather consider buying another game that is able to build up tension with a really compelling mystery that keeps you going because you want to know the secret behind the curtain (not because you want to grind achievements :P).But at least one positive thing has to be added: the game worked without any bugs or losses for me; savegames loaded and saved as intended, no glitches were found or other similar broken game-parts that let you crash or get stuck. No technical issues, at all.			"

												The story is alright, but the voice acting is less than stellar. As others have said, there are some mismatches between spoken dialogue and the text, and the biggest offense is the text randomly changing languages. It's infrequent, and usually only happens in the flavor dialogue. There was one instance where I felt like I was losing out on puzzle solving information. I don't recommend this game to any but the genre fans who just can't get enough.			"

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.I am a fan of classic point & click adventure games. And as a fan of adventure games, I want to really like A New Beginning, but I can’t. Which is sad, because the story really intrigues me, but there’s just too many flaws that accumulate and are hard to look past by in a title of this genre.The interface is very laggy. To interact with objects, you hold the mouse button, a wheel appears, and you select the action from that wheel by moving the mouse around and then releasing it. In theory that’s a nice system, but in practice the way it’s implemented in A New Beginning is very annoying. It takes like half a second to a second for the game to realize that you’re holding the mouse, and then there’s a half a second to a second animation of the wheel appearing. And this really messes with the game flow. You interact with a lot of objects in an adventure game, and check what contextual actions are available, so in a minute of gameplay approximately 15 seconds are just waiting for the wheel to appear.And speaking of actions, the wheel doesn’t have a set amount of them, it depends on the object itself. Which is why it’s so annoying when there’s a ‘Take’ action on an object which exists for the character to say that he doesn’t need it (the fact that you’ve spent a whole second or two initiating the action doesn’t help). And you get this feeling that maybe in the future you’ll have to backtrack to take this object and you’re gonna be angry on the character for not taking it in the first place (I actually can’t confirm this, since after the location with this example we go to a flashback of the second main character, but if we won’t ever have to use a fishing rod and a fishing net in the game, I’ll be angry). And you know, an argument can be applied that it was an attempt to remove the ‘adventure game logic’, when you take everything with you and possibly solve puzzles before they appear, but considering that in a later section I’ve recharged a battery before knowing why I need it, I’m not sure that applies (also I still don’t know what certain objects in my inventory in later part of the game are for, I took them just because).When it comes to ‘adventure game logic’, I think that gameplay flow should be a bigger priority than having everything make perfect chronological sense. Speaking of sense, there was a moment in the prologue when I needed to ask a second character for help. I had to ask her to hold a shutter so nothing would fall out from the fogger. But I couldn’t. I knew I had to ask her because as I failed to close the shutter and looked at it, my character said that he needs a second person to hold it before turning the fogger on, but the actual topic of the conversation with said person doesn’t appear until I actually try turning the fogger on (which leads to the exact same thought line, by the way). These kind of specific things in an adventure game are very detrimental to the experience.Adventure games are usually very story heavy. And dialogue heavy. And most of them are quite linear. This problem is usually tackled in two ways. In adventure games with linear dialogue (without ability to choose topics), conversations are usually relatively short and to the point, so you can continue exploring and figuring things out rather quickly. And in adventure with non-linear dialogue, there’s, well, there’s all the topics to choose from, and you don’t have to go through them all, you might want to just select only the important ones if you feel like it (so even though overall you’re more passive in an adventure game, you’re still active). But there was only just one (and a half-ish) non-linear conversation during the parts that I’ve played. Everything else was just comic-style cutscenes which also really slowed down the pace – you had to wait for the panels to appear in a cool way before a line was spoken. Each panel animation is not too long in and on its own, but, again, it adds up. So A New Beginning felt more like watching a visual novel rather than playing an adventure game. And even then, the conversations are slow due to a considerable delay between each line.And there’s also the fact that English voice acting is so monotone and boring that I would recommend to just switch to the original German (or maybe other translation that is actually good) immediately.But what A New Beginning has really got going for it is the beautiful art style (although, admittedly, the quality of animations may vary from action to action) and a story that has managed to intrigue me, and I want to know how it all turns out in the end. This may seem like a very short point, but it’s actually huge, and plays a lot to the game’s favor. It will have to wait though, until I don’t really have anything else to play. Sadly, I don’t think A New Beginning is well designed as a point & click adventure game. There’s too much passivity, and gameplay doesn’t flow well at all. Maybe I’m missing out. Maybe further down the road things get better. And if they do, I’ll make another post. But as it stands, this particular adventure game wouldn’t be on the top of my recommend list.			"

												I enjoy the point and click genre for the pure nostalgia of playing games on Windows 95/DOS computers. However, being a byproduct of late 80's-early 90's television I had the whole enviromentalist agenda crammed down my throat. All I ask is if you want to make enviromentalism a part of anything, PLEASE keep it subtle. With that in my mind, despite my no for recommending this game, I would give it a whirl if something like enviromentalism doesn't phase you.			"

												Biggest issue with this game? A language barrier.The company is based in Germany, so I am sure the German voice acting is spot on.Not so much the English one.Some serious cutscenes are so laughably voice acted they become funny.The artistic reditions are awesome though. If you're ok with buying a game just for art then I say go for it.The other issue is I could not beat the game without a walkthrough. It's very complicated and not straighforward at all.3/10			"

												I don't know why I continue to buy Daedalic adventure games, the writing is appalling.I'll keep this brief:ProsBeautiful settings and background paintingSome lovely soundtracksExtra minigame elements for those who like that (I personally don't)Puzzles are generally simpleOverall story is interestingConsReally poorly written, I still don't understand half of the conversations from the gameThe end sort of makes sense but its really not cleared up very wellPoor voice acting at times, sounds awkwardBuggy click device - sometimes the adverbs are in spanish or russian, sometimes the pointer simply doesnt show upSo much unnecessary pixel hunting that halts progressFrustrating characters, Salvador and Fay's relationship isn't explained, he's just instantly a jerk to her.Characters are unbelievable due to poor writing and actingPuzzles are a little too easy.Nice concept, poor delivery.Just generally tedious, don't waste your money.

												This game (a point-and-click adventure) has game-breaking bugs that prevent progress. You need to save frequently or you'll be repeating the game.Some of the puzzles are arbitrary (though that's more a criticism than a problem, and not necessarily bad, though tedious).Some text/dialogue shows in the wrong language (even after switching languages it doesn't show correctly). Though this is infrequent and only on flavor text.This game that seems to no longer be supported appears to also be unfinished.			"

												So I don't usually play point and click-adventures, neither am I a big fan of Daedalic's games. But this was on sale and since it's story seemed interesting, I gave it a shot.The story starts out with an incredibly interesting situation and holds it's tension for the first half of the game - just to then completly fall off. Like seriously, how can they put such an mediocre ending to that beginning? And then end it with such a cliffhanger, even though the game most likely won't get a sequel?The characters you meet are quite different, although most have no real depth to them and don't get much atttention on the long run. The puzzles are mostly easy, and can be skipped. The general interactions are very limited and sometimes obscure, as there is no highlighting for usable elements in the world.And then there's bugs. Not many, but some so severe that you need to restart a whole chapter (which vary vastly in size btw).The game cannot be configured and the drawn world is upscaled in fullscreen, but it's not scalable in windowed mode.I'll give this game a thumbs down, not because I could not enjoy it, but because I'm sure there would have been better games as an intro for the genre. And because of the mentioned bugs, which shouldn't exist in a game of this size.So should you buy this game? I'd say it depends. + Definitely, if you are a fan of the classical P&C genre and/or like Daedalic's stuff. ~ Yes, if it's on sale and you want a short and simple game with other than the typical ""Good guy hunts bad guy""-story. - No, if you are used to getting guided by games and/or prefer a story with more (visual) action. You should then rather watch out for some Telltale games on sale.			"

												AVOID AT ALL COST !!!CHANCES ARE VERY HIGH IT WON'T RUN PROPERLY ON YOUR MACHINE !!!(Yes, I know, the graphics look good on screenshots. Forget about them or hate yourself for spending money on this bugfest like me!)I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend the normal user to buy this sh*t.Want to know why? Well, read on ...This game here features unexpected crashes, sound stopping to work at all, overall laggyness out of nowhere and no stretching on 16:9 / 16:10 monitors.The funny thing is, when you finally got the sound working the levels for the different type of sounds are totally nuts. There really is no better way to describe this. You have to fiddle around endlessly with the in game configuration to somehow get it all working together in a way you could finally sort of enjoy this game and when this hassle is done you're blown away from the next cutscene because the levels in these are crazy loud compared to the rest of the game.WTF ?!? ... I mean really ... WTF ?!? ... I am no professional sound-editor but I know how to join different sources together so they sound fine alltogether (and nearly every other game producing company seems to know too), but the thing is, that is not my work but the work of Daedalic. The levels are so far out, sorry, but everyone in production should have easily mentioned this.At least the voice overs in this game are finally sort of enjoyable. In most older games from this company they just did sound ridiculous. So this is a plus for this game here. The graphics viewes as stills look nice to, because they feature nicely handdrawn backgrounds with wisely chosen colour palettes but the animation is horrible. In some way it's better than in other games from Daedalic (like the whispered world for eg.) but in now way are they appealing to look at.The story sound interesting too, but until now I couldn't really investigate it because the game won't let me to, at least not with sound. I mean, after every restart of the game the sound is gone. And I haven't got a clue why.Well ... after all ... As said before this game has many issues:- Sound not working or working bad,- Laggy gameplay,- Devs that won't answer in these forums here only by email (guess why),- Configuration spread over ingame and out-of- game configuration tools,- Horrbile startup loading time- No Background music in the menus- Cutoff Background music in the credits and the intro- No widescreen support (devs don't like it though gamers ask them all over the internet *lol*),- Game-breaking save-game failures- And not reproducable crashes of the whole game at random times.And those mentioned before are just the errors that I did encounter personally while trying it ot for 2 hours (actually playing just maybe about 1 hour, the rest was problem solving and waiting for the game to load). But there are a lot more mentioned here and over the internet wich include:- No sound during Cutscenes- Wrong language in Cutscenes- Game reproducable crashing as soon as a cutscene appearsBecause of all the flaws I can only hardly recommend this game for lovers of the genre, as long as you can get it to work properly on your setup, but I would never buy it for the normal price. I got mine in a bundle so I think it's ok. But don't pay more for this game than 1,99 €.And remember to avoid all other games from Daedalic unless they finally get these things addressed, because after searching the internet a little I found out that even in other (newer) games from Daedalic there are many people experiencing exactly the same problems, what leads me to think, that the problem lays in the engine underneath the games. What again is leading me to the question why these bugs aren't finally addressed so presumably a nice and simple fix for every game of the company could be released without much problems.Maybe instead of releasing one mediocre made game after the other Daedalic should start releasing fewer but well made games so they could honestly ask real money for it? They have damned so many good ideas and concepts in the past it just makes me sad, because back in the days I loved adventure games so much and Daedalic is one of the few companies still (trying to) making them today ...So the overhelming question is:Will Daedalic ever produce a fully working adventure title? Sadly chances are very low. I can only hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ up the Blackguards series ...			"

												The WORST voice acting you will ever experience for any game. It really boggles the mind how they were THIS bad at it. Go look up some gameplay on Youtube and prepare to have your mind blown over how poor it really is.There were lots and lots of problems with the translation as well. Sometimes the text would be in cyrillics, and there were lots of grammatical mistakes. On top of that the flow of the whole thing was really quite bad. As a whole I'd rate it no more than a 2 out of 10 because of the things mentioned. It could have been a decent game, but it turned out to be a huge failure.This was the first game of Deadalic Entertainment I ever played, and it will for sure be the last.			"

												It's very pretty, I'll give it that. The art is great, and the gameplay is competently old-school adventure style, like the classic LucasArts adventures of old.There are some major flaws though. The voice acting has some of the worst, most wooden performances I've ever heard. Maybe it's the English translation, but the dialog frequently comes off as incredibly stilted and awkward.Then there's the plot. Did you like ""The Day After Tomorrow""? Do you enjoy being beat over the head with the idea that nuclear power is evil, and human-caused global warming is a bigger threat than anything else? Then you'll love this game. Otherwise, it's something to roll your eyes at and attempt to ignore so you can get back to the genuinely interesting adventure game puzzle bits.			"

												This game could've gotten a 4 out of 5 from me but it won't because of the story. The puzzles are pretty awesome and it brings so much good memories of how adventure games were told before. But that only lead me so far. The story wasn't entertaining enough. It feels like I'm being force-fed into being a hippie by being Eco-friendly and crap. It felt more like a tedious lecture like I was in class or something. And the script felt so weak. having stereotypes of a washed-out scientist and a female protagonist being put-down by a superior officer with gender equality issues (and I live in a country where gender is no longer an issue for work and family). And I'm supposed to believe that these other characters are from the future?!I'm not even complaining about the voice-acting because of this being ""indie"". I can forgive that.Again, being ""indie"" isn't an excuse for telling a bad story. Adventure games are for me, 90% story and 10% gameplay.Overall, It's not entertaining. It's not hilarious like most LucasArts Classics. It's not epic as the ones from Sierra's. I really think that the developers did a great job with the items and the puzzles (and the puzzles are actually better than some of Sierra's classics.).  Even if this did just cost me less than Php 40.00 (less than US$ 1.00) I wouldn't recommend it. "

The remaining humans survive underground using a clean cyanobacteria electric generator... underground. To hide from the sun, and photosyntisis apperently. The cyanobacteria make energy from happy thoughts. Don't worry though, they can fix it all with time travel anyway. Just don't have a real form of power.			"

												A point and click adventure that has plagued my backlog for quite some time as I've tried to promise myself that I would play my library in alphabetical order. Alas I cannot for the TERRIBLE english voice acting and dialogue keep me from continuing to play this game to it's end. I've found a few glitches as well when interacting with some objects which will display russian options, but nonetheless still function. The characters themselves aren't very likable at all and none of them really have much defining characteristics. The gameplay and use of right click and combination is a little refreshing and is a step in the right direction as far as point and click interaction in a game, but could use a few tweaks. Got this in the Daedalic Entertainment Humble Bundle but seriously, the voice acting is really bad, Daedalic should really do something about this as it is one of the most important factors and would frighten people from this game. Maybe one I'll finish it.			"

												Came for an adventure game; ended up getting a lecture about climate change and an anti-nuclear power opinion slammed in my face. The ""twist"" at the end didn't help; it just made me mad and painted environmental activists in a terrible light, even the ones from the future. The ending wasn't satisfying, either; it left the conclusion up in the air on whether anything would change.The game is also riddled with minor bugs, such as russian language in the english game and the voiceover not matching the written text/captions. The voice acting is stilted and makes me wonder if they had just gotten Siri to voice Fay.I also found myself wishing I could click through the laborious comic book panels; I read at a fast pace and found it frustrating to sit through 10 minutes of panels slogging through the rote of being in front then fitting in ""place"".

												This is the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing story I've ever seen in an adventure game. Incredibly hokey, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting, completely unlikeable and inconsistent characters, logically stupid and inane plot, no sense of pacing whatsoever, with an approach so overly hamfisted and not subtle every grocery store in europe must be empty. The art direction and backgrounds are nice, but the animations are terrible, and the puzzles are all fairly basic and offer very little challenge or outside the box thinking, with every problem and its solution being fairly obvious uses of the the 2-5 items you have in each area, which are only 1-3 screens large, or an obvious giant control panel puzzle which can be deduced in a mere minute or two of effort. I will never get back the hours of my life wasted on this game.2/10  It's not broken, but don't waste your time, none of the puzzles/gameplay can redeem this piece of schlock.			"

												This is a 2D puzzle-adventure game with an eco-nut storyline.  It's annoying to play with gameplay reminiscent of old-school games from early 90's (such as Oregon Trail).  You must point-and-click on things to interact, and it is not always intuitive what you need to do.  The storyline is uninteresting and cliche, and the main antagonist is some solar flare that will scorch the earth because humans ruined the environment.  In short, this is a game that tries to establish a sense of adventure and discovery in the player, only to ruin it with an unbelievable story, horrible acting, and a difficult to navigate 2D world.  This game keeps the player at a distance and keeps you becoming immersed in the gameplay.Pros:    Interesting concept artwork    Low priceCons:    Compeletely unbelievable storyline    Outdated, low-resolution graphics    Annoying user interface    2D    Voice Acting (English)			"

												Please do not think that since this is from the same company as Deponia it will be a good game: it is not. The game is about time travellers trying to save the future by keeping us from causing climate change. This is going to be done by making a retired Swedish man whose son is apparently his direct clone (THEY LOOK IDENTICAL, IT'S HORRIFYING) invent the energy-creating bacteria from Metal Gear 2, which will solve all our problems because... someone likes Hideo Kojima?Along the way it's going to nag you that WE DID THIS and paint a world that's so hilariously ♥♥♥♥ed up that remote lakes have constant streams of trash floating up on their shores, and running a single machine LITERALLY MURDERS A BIRD... after making you solve a way-too-complex puzzle to turn it on, and needing a second person who thankfully time-travels in to hold it shut to activate it, because you jury-rigged it with a snapped screwdriver and a bicycle tube.I gave up right around the time it killed off my wiser mentor for no reason because PATHOS. Perhaps it improves. The chain of needing to break off an iron bar to bust open a door and break open a wall to pick up a pushbroom to pull down a ladder to... you get the drift.

												A New Beginning - Final Cut, is a horrible excuse for a point and click adventure game. Games in this genre are known for story telling, because the slow pace of gameplay really allow developers to flesh out really dynamic stories. Yet this game decided to tell everyone about the horrors of climate change, none to subtly, through an over the top story about humanity is ravaged by the effects of global warming and have to use a time machine to fix it. Really, they could not make this more generic if they tried. The puzzles in this game are irritating too, everything in the game looks like it can be interacted with, yet you cant, heck most of the stuff you DO interact with is some of the only things that look like they are part of a backround. Furthermore, these 'puzzles' I mentioned are really just fetch the item activites, which is obviously what people buy games to do. So yea, I don't recommend this game. It is a waste of money that could be spent on much better games.			"

												A New Beginning is an adventure game that is an incoherent mess thanks to abysmal translations and voice acting.One of the most important points of an adventure game, besides the puzzles, is the dialogue. So if the dialogue is difficult to follow, illogical, or plainly incomprehensible, no matter how well put together the puzzles and how interesting the art style, the game will not be enjoyable. This is what A New Beginning suffers from, an incomprehensible dialogue that tries to tell what could have been an interesting story, while providing contradictory insight into how to solve puzzles (telling you to do one thing but you actually having to do the complete opposite), and developing unlikable characters, leaving you to wonder how such a game won the German game of the year award in 2011 (...lost in translation?)

												A New Beginning - Final Cut is a cinematic adventure-thriller done graphic novel-style. In this charming and witty adventure, earth is on the brink of impending climate cataclysm. It's essential to travel the world in order to spare mankind and save the whole from this terrible fate. Bioengineer Bent Svensson had to resign from researching alternative ways of generating energy. Now the former workaholic lives a secluded life in the remote forests of Norway. His early peaceful retirement is invaded by Fay, a young woman claiming to be a time traveler from the future. She tries to convince him that she's here to prevent the climate cataclysm from happening and according to her, Bent's research is the last hope to achieve just that. However, his results are on the verge of falling into the hands of a reckless energy tycoon who cares for nothing but his own profit. Together, Bent and Fay now have to put an end to the imminent global catastrophe.			"

												I love Daedalic I really do, but this game is just bad, I had numerous audio pops, and even encountered a bug where the characters just didn't speak in game, no sound whatsoever... and I couldnt pick up any items so even the tutorial was impossible to beat...Then I finally got the game to work, and then it crashed and kicked me out about 30 mins in... This is a God awful game...People are saying the message is good, but most people believe global warming is a hoax, due to tons of scientific evidence that proves it to be a hoax... Just seems like a terrible story plot for a game... Almost feels like Daedalic was just forced to make this game, and that even they themselves hate this game...Even the first Edna & Harvey, as old as it is, still has better voice acting, and it works! Stay away from this one for sure. This one video I recorded where it crashes shall be my testimony to this terrible game...			"

												A New Beginning is a beautiful adventure game. It is not perfect, but the low ratings do the game by far not justice. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. But the main reason to play this game is its story and the atmosphere. Especially outstanding is the narrative technique that is used. It is told like a graphic novel and has two main characters and storylines that unfold in parallel. The game does also have its bad sides, like low resolution graphics and over complicated controls. But luckily these issues fade away as one gets used to it and sucked in by the story.			"

												More editing would have made this a 5-star adventure game, but problems with the writing broke my immersion too many times.  Like the part where a rope could have potentially saved someone's life, and you might have a rope in your inventory at that point, but you have no option to use it.  And the part in the end where Fay is completely out of character to make one plot point work that the game would have been beter off without.  Not to mention the strange bug where the volume of everything gets set to 0 and you have to manually reset it, and the localization issues where bits of Russian or in one case German text show up in the English version.  And the bug where the subtitles are out of sync with the voiceovers.  These issues aside, it's an excellent, brainy adventure game, and quite long for an adventure game.  I really like the art.  You will almost certainly need a walkthrough now and then, but there are good ones online so that's no problem.			"

As many people like to listen to original voices rather than dubs, other people may find this option interesting since you can mix and match English subtitles with German voices.			"

												The story and graphics are nice, but this game has some serious issues: dialogues are out of synch, action names sometimes pops up in a different language (like German or Russian), it suffers frequent freeze and sound sometimes goes to zero.Puzzles are not too difficult (except maybe one or two completely absurd parts), but some situations and item combinations are just nonsense and it's sometimes hard to continue without reading a guide. One thing I really can't explain is why every character moves soooooo slowly it's irritating, expecially when the game situations need fast decisions and quick actions (as often specified in the dialogues too). Sometimes if you have to send someone from where he stands to the other part of the screen you will have time to make some tea while you wait for him to arrive. Another bad thing about characters is their complete absence of empathy: if your best friend dies it's ok, just keep doing what you're doing, who cares.Anyway, the story, as said, is good and deep enough, even if I'd have gone deeper with the time travel thing. Graphic is nice and so are the graphic novel style cutscenes (even if they are maybe a little too long sometimes). The game is somehow extremely resource heavy, and I really can't explain why sometimes animations are so laggy.I don't recommend this game unless you have a lot of patience and many hours to spend figuring out absurd situations, or it's on heavy sale (i bought it for like 60p so I can't complain, but at some point was just a pain and only wanted to finish it as soon as possible).

												This game, it has some good puzzles. It has a good starting point. It has a very positive message about the environment. It even has a very good art styles. But the ending is really a letdown, that will leave you not only one but a lot of question marks.  Steam, not smoke.	 What was that?! What was that ending?! After the thrills and rush, Fay just speaks that and disappear? What was that even meant?  So smoke is more harmless than steam I guess. I dont see smoke make people disappear.	The reason I still recommend this game, is because  it does provide a good plot, and a very positive message. I am disappointed with the ending, but i do not regret to play this game. I recommended to buy it during sales.  Pros	 -Very good message delivered-Decent songs-Art styles are good-Settings are very nice and adequate to the story-Characters' characteristics are very clear.  Cons	 -Some bugs-Very unsatisfy and misty ending.    It really is the anti-climatic of the whole game 	-Weird walking pose-English translation are bad, sometimes even russian words appeared-English voice acting is just bad-Subtitles are probably done by some drunk fellas during the process.5+1/10 1marks extra for that sweater outfit on Fay.

												This is a game that is flat out average. Gameplay is a-typical point and click, the interface is poor, the voice acting is atrocious (in English) and there are plenty of translation errors and issues as well as a few bugs that are blindingly obvious and haven't been fixed.But I give it a thumbs up for any adventure fan who likes a decent tale, and I would give it a 'maybe'; if we had that option. A New Beginning tackles time-travel and all the tropes related to it, alongside Climate Change and Environmentalism. It sounds preachy and the message is rather banal and simple all the way until the very end of the game. There, the plot twist contains the true message of the game, one that is honest and brutal.Is the game worth buying just for that message? Probably not, it certainly won't amuse anyone who hates climate activism, it isn't going to be a glorious cup of tea for anyone outside of adventure / point and click hardcore nuts, but I think the message it holds is a rather reasonable and interesting one to listen to. Buy it on extreme discounts (It was a low as 0.50 when I paid for it), but don't pay full price as the game simply isn't refined enough.			"

												Pros:  Interesting story with a twist at the end Mostly logical item combinations Good voice acting and music Good mini puzzles Cons:  I had to consult a walkthrough a few times because some of the things you had to do were really obscure, e.g. making the crowd yell about clear cutting to anger the doorman and using the coins on the two screws in the jungle. Some bugs, nothing gamebreaking, but sometimes the subtitles would not match the cutscenes, and lines of text appear in Russian The ending is a bit lacklustre. I would have like the epilogue cutscene to be longer and show that the characters' actions had more of an impact on the world. "

												One of my favourites by this developer next to the Deponia series. It´s a very serious game with great characters and a great story.			"

												Not bad. The two main characters are great; and although the game drags in some points, I don't regret buying and playing it.			"
