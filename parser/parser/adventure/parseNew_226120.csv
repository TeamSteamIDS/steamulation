												I have heard this game (favouribly) being compared broadly as a kind of 'space solitaire' game. But it doesn't look or even at first blush play like solitaire, so I want to explain why the analogy works for me:In solitaire, you have the same 52 cards, arranged in such a way that their order is different, so sometimes you might get snuffed out early by an unlucky deal, and sometimes you might fly through for victory - you don't really mind which, because games don't take long so the stakes never feel so high that you'll never play it again.Weird Worlds shares some of this in common. The star system is filled with mostly the same items and hazards, but the order you encounter them switches out, so in one play through you might have exactly the item you need to best deal with an encounter, and another time you might not. This means that a lot of it is luck based, but half the fun is replaying the game and seeing where luck will take your exploration of the galaxy this time.That's not to say it's all luck - fitting out your ships with the best gear takes a bit of decision making, and it's possible to learn the function of special objects to understand whether they're worthless and tradable, or could come in handy. Plus the real time combat segments are basic, but reward people who avoid combat before becoming sufficiently tooled up. Occasionally, too, the game likes to switch things up by layering a 'meta' plot, usually difficult to resolve, above the usual exploration. Some sort of crisis which the player must solve in order to score a 'win.' These are rare, but always welcome. Like Solitaire, this is an ideal game to kill a short space of time with, but better than solitaire, it rewards repeat play with just a modicum of depth to be discovered beneath the surface.			"

												Weird Worlds: Return to infinite space9/10 on PC with SteamA delightful Rogue-like 2D space exploration adventure; upgrade your ship, collect artifacts, battle alien races, and finish in 30 minutes ! Play this game if you want to level up your procrastination badge.While ‘The Binding of Isaac’ is pressure-inducing, morally complex, and fast paced with severe depth,  ‘Weird Worlds: The Return to infinite space’ is relaxing, gentle and well circumscribed, the perfect depth for what is promised; a Short break time game permitting escape from the dull beat of the work drum.Do not read a single FAQ for this game - just enjoy exploring through trial and error. Player skill is increased through successive rounds. Random elements are introduced as the game progresses, so playing the 30 minute version is more interesting than the 20 or 10 minute versions. I wish there was a 60 minute version XDNegative comments by others include that random generation may produce unfavorable layouts of the universe. The flip side is that at some point your knowledge and experience can negate the random effects and create advantages.All you need to know: 1. Explore more of the universe by upgrading the FTL drives and navigation computer and avoid getting sucked into a blackhole.2. Be a space pirate. Upgrade your weapons and thrusters and hire mercenaries.3. Trade. Alien races will keep you guessing and are the gateway to mercantile opportunities. Trade is organized to facilitate the game and wealth accrual is secondary. 4. Comparing items (thrusters, shields ect) is straightforward and comes down to the coin values (1-5). 5. Experimenting with bizarre artifacts will uncover favorable secrets.Play this game if you want space exploration with modest effort into depth and prefer short 30 minute conclusions, orPlay this game if you have never played a rogue-like; it is the perfect gentle introduction to the rogue-like genre in a 2D Space exploration format.Nov 2015PS The spiritual and logical successor to this game - Infinite Space 3: Sea of Stars - was just released a month ago…. I have got to pick this up  http://store.steampowered.com/app/269990/ "

												A perfect 'time waster' game if you need to play something for a few minutes. It's essentially a rogue-like with some strategic elements where you find artifacts/lifeforms to take back home (for money), weapons/shields/etc to outfit your ship (and any allies you may acquire) with, and battle with hostile races. Will you return home in time to reap the rewards and retire, or will you end up as space dust in a battle gone horribly wrong?			"

												As much as I want to like this game I can't.  I enjoy the space opera, exploring, seeing new things but htis game just doesn't scratch that itch.  Here's a brief breakdown.PROS:1) it's a short and sweet game.  Want to blow a little time?  Here you go2) Easy to pick up, easy to 'master'3) There's fun to be had!  Explore space, meet new things, see how you do.CONS:1) It's -short-, as in after less than 3 hours I'm seeing nothing but repeats of things I've seen 3-4 times already2) Combat is rather dull and straightforward, rarely get any chance to try any tactics3) perhaps too easy to pick up and to master, I don't feel like there's anything below the surface I scratched 3 hrs in4) Far too much of your score and your game seems entirely dependant on the RNG at universe creationAll in all I wouldn't reccomend it.  I'd been watching it for a while and it looked up my alley but despite getting it with another bundle (so there's no buyer's regret, I bought the bundle for a different game) I'm still rather disappointed with how this turned out.  I hope the creators go on to make a more interesting, expansive 'infinite space' type game.			"

												Of all the rogue games i have played lately this one is my favorite for quick gaming sessions. Games literaly last from a few minutes to 30min tops. It has a hideous learning curve in the beginning which pretty much ensures this game will never be a big hit. (i really do recommend reading a few FAQs about what items do and how game mechanics works - learning combat by trial and error is somewhat troublesome)Try to do some exploration games first where you just try to stay alive and retire with a decent score. Once you learn the ropes go for larger maps and more combat. The feeling of beating fights that was plain impossible awhile ago is just really incredible.			"

												I find that this game is absolutely brilliant. If you like ftl but are more inclined towards controlling more than one ship at one time, this is a must play. In this game you are given a certain amount of time that you can use. Each journey (to a different solar system) takes a certain amount of time. You have to get as many points before this time ends by getting more ships, getting artifacts, etc.pros:- Fun, addictive gameplay- Easy to learn, hard to master- Variety of weapons, thrusters, drives and other systems.- Tense combat, as you know you might explode any second because of a secret cloaked enemy :D- Simulation mode (basically sandbox), this is where you can choose any ships from any race and make them fight eachother.Cons:- Lots of text, if you don't like reading this is not for you.- Ends too quickly, you lose points if you go past the timer.- Some elements of the game are quite confusing to new players (This is why I reccomend not skipping the tutorial like I did)Although I recommend this game. I don't recommend buying it. I got it in a giveway.  Story 2/5  Gameplay 4/5   Playtime 1/5   Fun 5/5  "

												This game combines all the exploration fun of the original Star Trek with the quirkiness of early science fiction pulp stories in a game that plays about as fast as solitaire. Like solitaire, it will take you a little while to figure out a strategy, then you'll play several games back-to-back. Very fun!			"

												This is a coffee break game in the old-school sense of the phrase. It's a turn-based ""board game"", with play sessions lasting from ten to thirty minutes, depending on whether you die early or play to the end.Basically, you pick a ""class"", which determines your starting gear and the value of given items (Military players will want to collect weapons and tech, Scientists will want samples of alien lifeforms with a secondary emphasis on tech, and Pirates will focus on ""treasures"", mostly consisting of otherwise useless sulptures and shiny things).The endgame score is equal parts skill and luck. You'll need to figure out what does what, and you'll need to be lucky enough to find things to do the things that do things. (Hint: Smash the Timeless Bauble and type ""Nova Cannon"" or ""Hyperdrive"", depending on which you don't have yet.)Every so often, the game board will spawn with one of three ""Major"" random events. To beat these, you'll need to either look up a game guide, or try your hand at trial and error. By the time you've got things figured out, you'll really only be playing this game to try to beat your last score. This is the primary charm of the game. ""Oh neat! I found this really valuable thing really early on in the game! I sure do feel lucky!"". The parts of the game that require skill are equally emotionally-rewarding. ""Wow! I can't believe I vapourised an entire Urluquai armada!""For $10, you really can't go wrong for something that'll always be in your library whenever you need to kill ten minutes. Time is money, especially in this game.			"

Short Overview[---] Weird Worlds is a space exploring rogue-like game.The main objective in the game depends on which of the three ships you select: Science,Pirate, and Terran.Each with their own primary & secondary objectives ranging from collecting relics,weapons,creatures, to making 1st contact with sentient life.You get 1 starting ship & have free roam to explore anywhere you want.Hazards,planets to explore(main way you get things), and battles to wage you can look forward to.Trading & hiring ships are present ,but only if they are not hostile.You have a time frame to complete set tasks, fail to do so an the amount of income you will recieve will be reduced by your bill.The profits you made are will define your score when you complete the game via retiring your ship.[---] Battles in the game are handled via a top down space ship shooter fashion in which you can only control the direction your ship moves in.The various weapons,sub systems and fleet formations keep the battles challenging.Ship upgrading is as simple as finding or trading for set item and equipping them to the slot that can house them.[---] The game has a decent amount of lore for those who like background info.Outside of the main game there is a simulation mode which is a skirmish battle mode.In this you can battle against any of the alien races and their ships.The UI is smooth and the graphics are easy on the eyes no rough around the edges. Its a short and sweet game good for 5 minute plays allow for multiple plays within a 30min-1hr period but still challenging enough to keep you coming back for more.Pick it up for a buck,buy it full price, or buy it in a bundle.Either way worth if for a quicky.

												So, i'd like to kick this off by pronouncing my love to Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. The concept is simple, but is very addictive as you scour the galaxy with your ragtag fleet of ships, destroying all in your way! Or, picking up a 4th dimensional piece of space-art to sell at the space-market. So, the game boils down to this: You're given a set amount of in-game months to explor the universe, returning to the earth-equivelant to get a score. The score is based on the events you've seen, planets visited, people, cargo, battles, and ships. These are all tracked against your playthroughs. This creates a very compelling environment, seeing as one playthrough can be completed in the time it would take to eat a sandwich and chips. The bulk of the game is spent exploring the galaxy, divided into segments that are color coded. Each planet can have one of a few things. As you travel from planet to planet, in-game months will pass. The exploration is fun, due to the game's sense of humor and cartoon art style, and it's a joy etting high tier items. The combat isn't the game's strong point. Depending on the planet you visit, you may choose to engage in battle. Your ships and their equipment are displayed against the enemy forces. You have to individually turn ships to make their weapons point the right direction, and command your ships to more or halt or escort. It's not horrible, but it's certainly annoying having a ship destroyed just because you didn't turn it correctly.Overall, i'd really reccomend this game. It's an underated classic that is well worth the price of admission, if you can stand the occasional annoyance.			"

												Weird Worlds Return To Infinite Space is a strange collaboration of genres. On one hand the gameplay is based around that of a rougelike, with all the hardcore aspects like permadeath and randomized maps. On the other, it's built around the idea of 10-30 minute playthroughs making the execution feel almost geared towards a casual crowd. Yet this is not a casual game, nor would it be fair to say it is a hardcore game. It is a compilation of the two, trying to strike a balance and for the most part, coming out alright in the end.Weird Worlds pits you as a spaceship captain out to explore the great unknown on a 10-30 year mission at the end of which you are awarded points based on your accomplishments and how much loot you manage to bring back. That is not to say that making it back is a guarantee, falling prey to hostile aliens and black holes is just as common if not more so.Most of the game is spent in this galaxy view, you direct your ship to fly towards a planet and upon arrival is hit by a random event, you might run into a shop, a free item, friendly aliens or hostile aliens or many other things. As you progress through the game you slowly upgrade your ship with newfound items getting better engines, scanners and weapons and even occasionally added on a wingman to your entourage who is equally as customizable as your own ship.Should misfortune strike and you encounter hostile aliens you are transported into a 2D battlefield where your ships do battle, your actions are limited to tell your ships where to go and who to attack and if you're lucky enough to have found any one shot ability items you get to activate those too in here. The battles are unfortunately fairly lackluster and you can do little to influence the outcome once you are committed, the only real decider being the equipment you have managed to scavenge so far.Perhaps one of the biggest flaws of Infinite Worlds is also the reason for it's longevity. The randomness of the game might make every playthrough a little unique but it might also mean you run into the highest tier engine on the first planet you visit making this particular go-round a sure success whereas other times your first trip away from home will be to a soon to be supernova explosion.All in all Weird Worlds manages to make a decent experience by combining the casual and the hardcore, in many ways it becomes sort of a solitaire for the Sci-fi inclined. A good way to waste 20 minutes every once in a while when you have nothing else to do.			"

												This is the best lunch break game that i know of.What's a lunch break game? it's a game that you can play finish and enjoy in the 1 hour lunch break even including your lunch time. You can compare and compete your friends for scores if they have the same game as you do.Since lunch break is less then 1 hour and this game don't go more then 1 hour no matter what you do..IT's a 4X space explorer that give you one ship and let you explore the galaxy..It does have a plot and several special ending/event that you can win for massive scoring.Sound, music, Graphics are or soo soo with no major flaws. But what do you expect for just some quick 1 hour fun?there are many different kinda of alien race you can meet. there many random event.. there are many ship upgrads... Luck is basicly everything for this game...Just fun explore ... find..  event.. more explore.. trade.. fight ... win.. explore.. event.. fight.. lost...It's not meant to be long . it's meant to keep you entertained 1 hour at the time. If you lucky you will find the story object and try to go for it.. (all the story event involve really hard fights).If not you play and times up and your captain retire...7.5/10.. recommend for people that take lunch breaks.. (work and school doesn't matter).			"

												Weird Worlds is another indie bundle game I stumbled upon. For a 2005 game, this is a pretty decent rouge-like space exploration and combat adventure game. After playing FTL quite a bit, it's pretty obvious where FTL got a lot of its ideas from. Much of the gameplay is very similar although the combat of Weird Worlds is overly complicated. It's kind of like SPAZ combat in some respects, but without the intuitiveness. The game does provide a combat simulator that allows you to practice as needed, but to win it's more about what equipment you  have as opposed to using any real strategy.Weird Worlds biggest shortcoming is the lack of a proper reward system since you don't really have to earn anything. You just take items as you find them or if you find the right trader you can exchange some cheap trash for the best equipment in the game. Also you are not forced into combat and can retreat anytime. Where FTL creates an environment of urgency, Weird Worlds creates an environment of casualness and I'm not sure casualness and rogue-like is a winning combination. Essentially you are given a specific amount of time to explore and collect as much loot as possible and eventually get killed or retire and get a score based on several factors.The randomness makes it fun from an exploratory perspective, but it's not really a game that captivates for replayability.

												when i first got this game i honestly didnt like it. But now that i iknow what it is and how to play it i very much enjoy it. to me this is a coffee break rougelite game. that is it isnt meant to have deep or long lasting gameplay. the idea is that each game is short, and the randomized nature of the map means that each time you play you get a short and unique experience out of it.  this makes it perfect for wasting a few minutes time, or you can keep playing game after game to waste even more time.  but saying waste time may not be the most accurate way to describe it because this is a fun and very much entertaining little game. the only downside i can think of is that the combat is very difficult unless you are prepared for it, so dont expect to blow up many enemy ships the first few times you play.

Fast 'n' Easy!Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is the second part of a series of games. If you have to describe it with only one paragraph you could say: ""It's a Starflight, or Star Controll II light game, with a lot of humorous and casual gameplay.""Actually it's really a casual game, it has permadeath functionality and you will gain scores depending on the in game achievements your captain might gather. It is fun, if you want to play a short game with some nice flavourtexts about hellworlds, aliens and such notions like... ""Don't point that on my planet!""Pros:Fast and easy casual game.Just a lot of funny stuff to read, do or happen.Cons:Can actually be too shallow.Battles are, well quite automatic...Recommended, but read below!This game actually can be a lot of fun, as long as you keep in mind that it's a game for in between. A game for small breaks, or if you wait for another session going on...But if you play this game in a more lasting way, you will soon learn that it get's repetitive, boring and shallow.So this game is recommendable to people who are on the lookout for a fast speed session, maybe between two raids, or when waiting for the pizza delivery or the doctor after you actually ate the pizza...

												this game is way more fun than it should be. you basically fly around a randomized galaxy map searching for loot and upgrades, and have to make it back to base by the end of your 20 year mission. when you arrive at a planet, it will have some amusing flavor text, as well as sometimes an item(s) you can move directly to your cargo bay and be on your way. Sometimes there will be a hostile alien ship/fleet there that attacks- this is the weakest part of the game. 100% of combat consists of taking 2 seconds to quickly decide if you're going to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked entirely or not and running away. If you stay, there's not much to do in combat, really. If you win, rewards vary. then you fly to another planet/star and try again. you can make relationships, gain new ships in your flotilla, stumble across rare phenomena like space whale migrations (played out only through flavor text, but damn good flavor text). you go back to base before your time runs out ,get your score, and a little end story, and then you start over. the galaxy is randomized again and you're starting fresh.

												Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space falls somewhere between Civ 5 and FTL, incorporating diplomacy aspects and space battles. For the majority of the game, you will be flying to different star systems, picking up valuable items, specimens, ship parts, or ambassadors to bring back to your homeworld in the Glory system. The combat can be pretty interesting when you manage to get good upgrades and recruit multiple pilots for your flotilla, but it's usually best to avoid confrontation in the beginning of the game.Unfortunately, all of the events and alien races can be seen in about 20 playthroughs on the ""long"" setting, and the long setting itself seems too short. This game would be far better if it had much more content and even longer playtimes, and I can't help but feel it would be more fun to continue upgrading your ships and battling for much longer instead of having to return back to your planet.If you like games that have some depth yet allow you to sit back and relax while playing, Weird Worlds might be right up your alley.

												At first glance, there are some superficial similarities between Weird Worlds and FTL; both are ship-based, roguelike games. But they are otherwise substantially different experiences. Weird Worlds presents the player with an open map and a fairly generous time limit to explore it in order to find upgrades and acrue wealth. This gives the game a very different feel to it compared to FTL, but it's not why I am giving this a thumbs down.I gave this a couple of attempts, putting little more than half an hour into actually playing it before I decided I was done. The reason being that the choices the game offers lack any reasonable sense of transparency. Apart from hyperdrive upgrades, none of the other things you can augment your ship with includes numbers. Everything is descriptive rather than quantitative. This may well be a valid approach. The history of roguelikes is replete with games that thrive on obfuscation and player experimentation (e.g. ""drink red potion? Y/N""). But I think it is terribly misplaced here. The combat system in the game is a little like Gratuitous Space Battles. It's a 2D map with ships on either side of the screen squaring off. The player can choose targets for each of their ships, or whether a ship holds off or retreats. The rest of the engagement is handled automatically. For me, this was instantly just a way too chaotic environment for me to learn the basic efficacy of a given ship upgrade or anything else for that matter. I am loathe to do too much comparing to FTL, as it just ends up sounding like I like that more than Weird Worlds. I do, but I also came to this looking for something different. With all that said, I have to say that what FTL does right is that it presents situations where it's possible to see what is going on step by step. While there might be a steep learning curve, and one neglected thing overwhelms you while you are busy learning about something else, there is still a constant sense that you are learning something all the time, even if you're losing horribly. Weird Worlds lacks that transparency. Whether you win or lose an encounter, it is really hard to know what helped or hindered the situation.There may be a lot of depth to the game a couple of hours in that I will never see. But I am choosing to recommend against this game because it simply offered me little incentive to keep going far enough to learn of any hidden potential.			"

												This is a dungeon crawler in space and with a spaceship instead of a hero. Sadly this game is managing the visual and overall presentation of itself much worse than ""faster than light"" or ""endless space 3"" wich are both essentially the same game but much better. I still recommend this game for people enjoying dungeon crawlers or space games.			"

												Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a great indie game if you have just few free minutes, and you don't know what to play. And trust me - even if it's very short - it's still a very addictive game. I wish to see in future similar game but with longer gameplay.			"

												It's not a bad update to the original game, since it adds more planets, more random scenarios, ships, options to do its just i would've changed a few things in terms of design. First of all the annoyingly looping radio contact noises you hear in the bg dont add anything to the experience so you could've added an option to turn that off. Also the camera is insanely too close to the ship feeling claustrophobic oddly in space and that you dont see what's ahead of you which was the allure of the first game.Also on that note, the original game is freeware whereas this costs 5 bucks or less depending on a sale, so if your a cheapskate or want to try out this series id reccommend the first over this, and really id only reccommend this to the biggest fans of the original. Hopefully the next one irons out some of the weirdness but not all of it			"

												A simple, fun, quick (10-30 minute) SF exploration, trading and combat game. The release date is misleading (that's the Steam availabilty date) since it's a 2005 game (keep that in mind when you notice there's no mouse-wheel zooming). Dozens of weapons, engines and other interchangeable ship components along with mostly useless cargo/artifacts (some have significant effects). You can increase the size of your fleet by recruiting a few alien ships (possibly also increasing cargo capacity and component slots). There are a few infrequent game altering random events (spoilers not included).Both my description and the screenshots make the game seem more complex than it actually is. You quickly realize the mechanics are pretty simple but after a bit more play find it's not quite as simple as first impressions suggest (I'd even say elegantly simple).The only technical problem I've come across is with 1920x1080 resolution on my 1080p laptop (graphics flicker). I have to play it at 720p (or lower?) res to make it work.I've played this one on and off since it was an indie GOTY nominee (from the era of ""Darwinia"") and still enjoy it. Worth the asking $10 but buy it on sale (like my frugal♥♥♥♥♥would).			"

												What I liked:-Small install, quick to begin-Easy to play a quick round or two in just a few minutes-3 different starting ship designs-A variety of ship/weapon upgrades-Intuitive controls-Ability to name ships/captain/planets-Encounter alien races with different temperaments (traders, neutral, hostile)What I didn't like:-Didn't feel optimized for high resolutions  -Much of the game UI and events are text-based and the text and UI windows were not scaled to match resolution-Combat odds heavily stacked against you even on lowest enemy threat level settings-Short session length means little time to effectively upgrade ship or explore without score being heavily penalized-Item/upgrade descriptions were not easily accessible/comparable, making it difficult to tell what was actually better-Variety seemed to run out after just a few sessions.I recommend FTL instead if you are looking for a quick-play space game, though you may have fun with this for an hour or two.

												Cute game concept that won't demand too much time the first few times around.  Predicated on series of incursions into hostile space, there is depth there, but you have to dig through a great deal of repetition and happenstance to find it.Likely a great lo-fi game when it came out, in this era of backlogs and expanding Steam libraries this game is unfortunately skippable in light of newer, similar, better titles.

												Neutral: If you wanted a sort of Space Pirates and Zombies or Star Control 2 experience abbreviated into a quick gaming session, then that's pretty much exactly what Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is.  I suspect a lot of players will feel like they just got started getting interested in exploring the game world when the session is called to an end however, and the game length does nothing to hide a certain lack of content.Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is the sequel to Adventures in Infinite Space developed and published by Digital Eel.  It offers a top-down, dual mode gameplay that is similar but not quite identical to Star Control 2.Graphically, the style will seem very similar to fans of Space Pirates and Zombies as they are very similar in style in-game.  Out of game the game uses some hand-drawn sort of comic-book art that, to speak frankly, just looks strange and unprofessional for the most part.  It doesn't fit the look of the rest of the game, and usually ends up resized into a pixellated mess.The graphics aren't what truly matters though, and the gameplay mechanics are simple but work well in the context of the game.  You have a single flagship you can select through three types that are essentially classes, each offering a slightly different play style, since they will have more or less weapons, consoles, etc available to them.  The object of the game is then to amass the most points before the time limit (determined by world size) runs out.  You gain score through the expected methods: exploration, trade, and combat.  Along the way, you'll meet different races, fight hostile aliens, and possibly find allies to help you or hire mercenaries, amassing a fleet just as you did in Star Control 2.Where the comparison to Star Control 2 ends is in that exploration.  Star Control 2 thrived on the variety and strong personality offered by each of its races, but while Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space does try to offer some, when it is given in just simple text crawls or exposition dumps, it falls somewhat flat.  That's not to say the game is without that touch of colour, just that it's nowheres near as vibrant as Star Control 2.The game has essentially two modes: a pseudo-turn-based overworld, whereby events basically happen every time you enter a new system, and a real time tactical combat screen.  Those expecting the Super Melee of SC2 from my constant comparisons thereto will be quite disappointed, as the combat in Weird Worlds is much more ponderous.  With that, though, it also feels more realistic.  Starships, especially larger ones, have a feeling of mass to them, and while it's hardly a Kerbal Space Program level of simulation, it does offer a vague approximation of how these ships would seem to actually handle.  Controls are simple but to the point, and the combat mechanics are likewise.  There is no subsystem targeting or the like, just plink away at the targetted ship until it goes boom.The central mechanic of that game length is both the games greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  It boils the game down into something you could complete on a coffee break, and this makes the game very compact and doesn't overstay its welcome, which it definitely would in a longer game given then less vibrant races and distinct weakness on the content side.  Within 4-5 playthroughs you'll have a lot of repeating motifs, despite the procedural generation.  Yet that game length does make it a good game to play while waiting for something else to down load, or in the downtime between online gaming sessions.All things considered, the mechanics are competently executed, the production values are middling, and the game length will make it or break it for you.  Personally, I would say to wait until it's in a bundle - as it often is.  It's a good game well-made, just a very shallow one.Published: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/87-review-weird-worlds-return-to-infinite-space "

												After reaching a high score now of >55,000 and >200 hrs on this game (and two roles higher than galacticorp executive) I thought I'd share what keeps me coming back. This was my first ""rogue-like"" game where you are not told how to play and what the value of the items are that you find. At first this was frustrating and I was struggling to survive missions but steadily I discovered weapons, combos and strats that worked.It is a very UNFORGIVING GAME so the learning curve is steep to get to the higher scores and if something goes wrong in combat or you judge the relative strengths of enemy fleets incorrectly, you only have a very small window of time to escape or your fleet will be wiped out. Once you engage you better hope you judged it right.I love turn based 4X games (Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate) and this game feels like a light and casual Xplore and Xterminate version of these games (there is no settling or empire building, just increasing fleet size and customisation). I play it casually but may be sucked into an hour long game if things are going well and I feel a high score coming on. Since it is turn based, I have the luxury of taking my time to consider each move and weigh my strengths and weaknesses. It is still hard to judge the relative strength of more evenly matched battles and so I still get wiped out occasionally with much chagrin! The special missions that come up can seem over whelming and only recently did I beat the bugs 1 on 1 in a fair fight.I now start with all the difficulty options on max and with a military mission base ship (I preferred scientific at the start to focus on the exploring). I find the Even Wierder Worlds mod the best extra content without making it easier (Esmarelda can take ANY item - cargo or equipped - and often a best gun!).After >200 hrs it is really just the procedurally generated maps and trying to get the ""perfect"" game that keeps me going as well as mods to change things up. Random races and random personalities of the races you meet would improve replayability in the long term.			"

 An Overlook, and Your Money.	 Let me start by saying the game is great, overall. Its nothing too amazing, but a great game none the less. Its gameplay is randomly generating thus giving the plaer an indefinite replay value, so it can be easy to get your moneys worth out of this game if its your thing. But speaking of the price, its 10$ and thats pretty on edge of how much its worth through my experience. I got it for free in a giveaway myself, and its a great game, but I'd say its more around worth 5$, if its on sale buy thing game, if its not: invest into taking some more ime to see if its your cup of tea. The Gameplay:	 On to the gameplay, theres alot to say and to keep it short I'll say this: The gameplay is a solid 8.5/10, its a randomly generated fun adventure full of things to explore. The mechanic of having to return after 30 years in-game is a unique and brilliant touch to a game of this genre. It gives you an almost arcade like feel of constantly trying to get a new highscore, its simply addicting and fun so see what you can get. Playing this game blind will make your experience ALOT better too, playing it blind will make the game so intresting to discover things, I know from experience there will be many occasions you thought youve seen everything, but suddenly a brand new ship, race, battle, etc. comes up. If these thigns sound appealing to you, look into this game more, its a really great relaxing time waster. (and I almost forgot to mention: its got quite the FTL like feel to it, but with a wide range of completely new, different mechanics.) TL;DR	 TL;DR: The games pretty good. Is it worth 10$? That depends on your likings because 10$ is the maximum price the game could be worth, if the game is on sale you should totally buy it. It's a well-made, rouge, never ending, suprising, random, curious, almost FTL-like experience that will leave you addicted to getting a higher score or explore more each time.			"

												A Spaceship Roguelike: the focus is on travelling between worlds collecting and trading items for a maximum score with a set time limit. Spaceship combat is topdown realtime , like Stardive(a far more recent game - I know) but there is far less variety and Weird Worlds is pausable.This is a simple ""beer and chips"" style of game (not that I ever let them near my computer - it just means you don't need to think much or rush any decisions).Weird Worlds seems to have inspired the brilliant  FTL:Faster than Light - Well worth acquiring if you can get this in an Indiebundle or on sale for a dollar or two.

												I'm obviously missing something about this game given all the great reviews - it just doesn't do it for me.There's a lot to love about it.  It's quirky,  and as everyone notes, a quick play to fill some time.  That said - after a handful of play throughs, there just isn't any meat here to chew on.  I tried a couple short games to get the hang of it, but you can't built your ship up enough to withstand any battles, and the game is over so quickly, you better not stray too far or you'll never make it back to base in time.Playing longer games was a more enjoyable experience.  Here too though, I found it very hard to survive virtually any combat encounter.  Other than combat, all there really is, is going to each planet and putting whatever ""thing"" you find there in cargo, every once in a while trading with a wandering store - presumable trading up for more points at end game.  Then even at end game, there's no  winning in the classic sense, just a final tally of your credits based on what you found minus what you owe.That's pretty much it unless I'm missing something.  I generally like quick time fillers, and I love quirky games, but I just can't find a way to like this one.  I don't regret the couple bucks to play it a while, but I doubt it will get much replay from me.			"

												Buy? Unlikely...Maybe. It's a space exploration roguelike, where you're expected to die often and your luck throughout the game is completely randomized. The goal is to accrue enough value through what you find in star systems, cargo. passengers, and equpment with in a limited. You start with a ship with inferior gear, and need to make trades or kill hostiles to get better weapons or more valueable trading goods. Usually, but not always, you will find a bird race early in your tavels that are willing to trade any item regardless of value, which helps you get better gear or more valuable cargo. You will encounter ""unknown"" beings at other systems, which more often than not are hostile encounters with enemies that will out gun you. You don't want to travel through nebulae as they take much time to move through, unless you have the proper equipment. This game has simplistic mechanics which actually turn out quite enjoyable, but my problem is that it's too damn random and you have to basically hope that the game gives you a good galaxy. I don't like the idea of wasting time dying and getting low scores because of ""what mood the game was in"" when it generated a world for me. If you're into space exploration and/or roguelikes, you might like it because there is enjoyable gameplay, but success through extreme randomness is not what I want to deal with.			"

Winning or getting a good high score just doesn't matter all that much; the game is all about the journey, and it's perfect if you got a half hour to spare.The game got a few hours worth of content, and since the developers made modding easy you can more than twice the value by trying out some of the mods, and many of them are both large and balanced.

												In short, a great little time-waster that, if you want to kill 15-20 minutes, is perfect. However, after playing a few hours of it in one session, it does get a tad repetitive. The combat is very tough if you don't have much equipment. I made that mistake by trying to tackle a corvette (medium class ship) alone. I died in 10 seconds flat...Aside from the quite tough combat, the general gameplay is enjoyable, with 3 different ships to start with and you can make your own fleet whilst on your travels. There's also a combat training bit where you pick which ships you want to control, have an alliance with or fight against. Good job Digital Eel :) 7.5/10			"

												Weird Worlds is a fun little rogue-like set in space. On your quest to explore unknown frontiers, you will fly from star to star, finding ramdomized loot, trading with friendly species, battling not-so-friendly alien armadas, hiring mercenaries who are not very helpful and die like flies in a flamethrower spray, and getting your loot stolen repeatedly by a mysterious Esmeralda. Most likely, many of your quests will end in failure and untimely death, but with a little bit of luck and persistence, you could become a legendary hero known throughout the galaxy. With just over a dozen stars, even the longest quest would last only about 30 minutes, and in about 5-6 hours even the most unlucky captain should see every piece of randomized loot, experience every randomized event, and thoroughly master Weird Worlds. The galaxy is a small place with little going on, but for a measly 5 bucks, exploring it is very addictive and a great way to kill a few hours.			"

												I love so many things about this game that I don't know where to start. It has an excellent atmosphere; from the quirky bits of backstory to the memorable snippets of country music you sometimes pick up while drifting through the void, it does a great job of creating a unique 'feel'. The combat is unforgiving and forces you to truly consider the consequences of every engagement, but a bit of cleverness and careful planning can help you avoid combat entirely if you so choose (and on many runs, that's exactly what I did; combat is not by any means central to the game). I love how the various random items and their lore interconnect, and how exciting the storylines have the potential to be, in what appears on the surface to be an aimless journey. The final boss, simple as it was, is possibly the closest thing to 'epic' that I have ever seen in a game.So yes. If you like roguelikes and want to try something that is more about exploration and thinking creatively rather than just killing everything in sight, check out Weird Worlds.			"

												Weird Worlds is indeed a name worthy for the title.It's a strangely addicting,""roguelike"" space exploration/adventure strategy game with a fair bit of inventory management. You start your journey deciding between 3 different type of ships, you then leave your planet called Glory to venture out on a 2 year long journey traveling in interstellar space. Along your journey you will find civilizations and goods as well as allies and foes.Mechanics is a bit clunky at some places, the graphics isn't exactly something to brag about but it's certainly succeeds in setting a vibe of mystery that hangs tight in the air.Sound varies alot with some tracks sounding decent to horrendous at best, some tracks feels out of place and the transitions between silent to full volume can produce a jump scare better than most horror games today.It's got a decent amount of replayability enough to suffice for a few hours of fun and certainly beyond that depending on your experience with the game. Don't let appearances fool you, this game offers equal fun to what you could have with FTL or any other game of this sort and is at least worth a playthrough.			"

												This is a weird game for me to review, since it felt like it was over before it had even started.Describing itself as a ""roguelike space exploration game"" I suppose that the idea is that you go through a large number of runs, but I didn't really feel inclined to do so.The game doesn't do anything wrong, but it also doesn't do anything right enough for me to fire it up and go in for another round. The combat is entertaining enough, the ship upgrades reasonably varied, the universe navigation functional.If you want a quick distraction that won't frustrate you, this might be an excellent choice for you.

It’s short, easy, fun to kill time and to play from time to time, but If you want to play something with strategic background or just want a game that you will not leave for ever after 3 hours of playing it’s not for you. This game is not worth money. It has some nice ideas but it’s very repetitive and actually there is not much to do in it. Unfortunately  Flash Trek: Broken Mirror is a lot better game than this one: it’s longer, more strategic, and you have more to do there (even building stations and start your own empire) and it’s free. Weird worlds is random, what is good but boring after a while because you have nothing to do here.			"

												After three or four playthroughs (two hours or so), you will have seen and done everything. Most of the flavor text is already used on the first playthrough, and if you have played the game once, you have played enough. What it does offer isn't very interesting nor fun.Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is mediocre.			"

												Weird worlds is a fun little and quick game for your free time, You have a mission to explore the galaxy and gather as much rare items as you can, also to meet new races to trade attack or become friend with them, the game randomly generates stars, items and events but all the fun is on having the right item at the right time to see a new event.In the end if you don't die you will have to retire because of the time limit similar to sid meier's pirates.note: most easy events to found will be repeated to youThe price is too hight for such small game, so i recommend to get it only at discount.

Get different types of weapons as you go deeper in space.  Find allies and fight enemies : D this is really epic and I am happy for the people who gave me a free key for this game as I thought it is really a lame game as its name is not appealing.. but when I played it... It went from interesting , to epic , to ADICTED xD  Try IT!!!			"

												This is an underrated game, built more for a niche audience and only providing short bursts of play before getting tiresome. Space fans and those of the gaming community starving for a true successor to the Homeworld series might find some value out of the overly simplistic space combat.Technically a rogue-like game a la Oregon Trail or Rogue Legacy, Weird Worlds' item collection and map generation keep you entertained for a time before you realize that each play session varies little compared to the next. The small amount of items and ships don't help it.If you're starving for a good space combat sim, keep waiting.			"

												I would have figured with the popularity of FTL more people would be onto this.  Though Weird Worlds predates FTL by quite a bit, both games seem to scratch the same itch; scaleable, randomized play sessions, ship cargo and weapon management, choosing the best route through the map, offbeat sci-fi humor.  There is a slight learning curve; equipment is fairly random throughout your route, and combat is pretty rough until you find some allies.  This is definitely one of those games you play five times in a row just too see what else is out there and how far you can go!   Also, don't let my short playtime on Steam fool you.  I had dumped at least 20 hours into another copy of this before repurchasing it here!			"

												I owned Weird Worlds on my iPad and played it for hours before I found it on Steam, and bought it here too. I find it to be a great diversion, a light space RPG that I can blast through without any real time commitment. It doesn't have a huge variety of content - you'll see most of what there is to see on the first few plays, but there are subtle random elements which will lead to little surprises for a while after that. Exploration is by far the highlight, finding treasures and technology and using them to upgrade your ship. Combat is probably the weak point - it's quite basic and rather difficult in early game, best avoided until you have no other options. The variety of weapon effects is nice though.Weird Worlds isn't a difficult game particularly, but as with any Roguelike there will be times when you just can't get a break. This is necessary to maintain a little sense of achievement when you do win, but for me the draw that keeps me coming back is to beat my high score and the two 'boss' events that occasionally happen.

Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a space scavenging/exploration game, with a few board game and rogue-like elements.    There are 3 different starter ships, each with a slightly different focus (alien ambassadors, military technology, ancient artifacts, etc.) and also different starting equipment.   The game was designed to be played in short bursts, each run being from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how you do.   I'll say that I enjoyed the concept of the game, and it did entertain me for a while, but overall, the game left me wishing it had a bit more to it. If you're into these games, definitely give it a try, but don't expect to get too much out of it.   A sequel is in Early Access right now, so there's hoping that they can make it the bigger game it deserves to be!   Your role is to command your ship through the universe (Small, Medium or Large), exploring as many planets as you can to collect either artifacts or technology, and also recruit other ships to your fleet, perhaps. You can either hire them as mercenaries, or they may join you when in trouble.    These different ships will allow you to interact in a friendly manner with its race, if you encounter it later on.   You have a limited set time to do all this and return home. If you fail, you'll be lost in space and it's game over.   The maps also feature Nebulas (that highly diminish your travelling speed), and Black Holes (that will suck you in... and it's game over).   This game was released in 2005, I believe, but despite being nearly 10 years old, it has a clean interface and the graphics actually look pretty good! They could have fooled me. It's a simple looking game, but that's not a problem, in a game like this.   The item pictures are also cool looking, if not cheesy (to fit the game's humor).   The music is something I can't say much about. The menu music sounded good, but in-game, the music is very limited, with a few short clips playing along with certain encounters.   The sound effects were also a bit space-y, as one would expect, but nothing noteworthy, that I noticed.   So, I'll try to get you an overview of the game mechanics.   Like I said previously, the game is mainly about scavenging. You can equip your ship with things you find/trade, or you can keep things in your cargo bay, for later trade, or even use in your other ships.   Aside from these, there are artifacts (with flavor text about the game's universe) that are merely there to increase your score in the end, and other unique items with unique effects. One can switch your place with the ships in another planet, for example (this one was particularly fun when I had an item that resisted a black hole's pull, and thus spent the whole time sending ships into black holes by switching places with them).   You final score is calculated when you either die, or reach home safely, and in time. It's based on your cargo items and ambassadors, and each one has an associated value. Different ships also attribute different values to different types of cargo.   So, most of the time, you'll be travelling from planet to planet. Farther planets will take longer to reach (the time is always displayed to you), and when in a Nebula, the time increasing immensely.   You can change this if you come by different drives. Some of them are faster than other, some are fast in nebulas but slower outside them, and some even teleport you!   Other than that, you can have different encounters. Some planets are inhabited, and these can either bring you pain and tears, or generous traders. The ambassadors and mercenaries you carry can affect this.   There are also scanners that show you when a plant is inhabited, so that you can prioritize other planets to gather strength until you enter conflict.   The trading system is pretty simple. Each item has a certain value, and you can usually trade items of similar value (or type). There is also a race that accepts anything that is shiny, so you have a great opportunity to get great items at the price of nearly nothing.   The combat system, is something that I didn't quite understand (there is a combat simulator, by the way, so that you can explore this aspect of the game alone, with everything at your disposal). Most of the time, if you engage in combat, you'll be horribly murdered. So I ended up avoiding combat until I got certain items that would let me deal with the enemies in more... ""creative"" ways (such as teleporting them into black holes, or ramming them while invisible).Combat itself was mostly controlled by the AI (which can be improved with items you collect). You could only control your ships' path, but it would mostly play out by itself.    Again, I didn't quite understand it, mostly because I didn't need to. There were ways around it, which I think is a good thing!   And this is pretty much the game. There were a few random events that could happen (like an alien ship destroying every planet in its path -- and you being chosen to stop it; or a lady thief that could be captured if you had certain items), but these seemed to be pretty rare. Perhaps this problem is associated with the fairly limited replayability of this game, compared to, say, FTL.   And here's my reasoning.   This game lacks a bigger goal. In FTL, the tough Mothership fight was something that would keep you coming back to the game. And it was engaging for a good amount of time, until you succeeded.In Weird Worlds, however, it is really easy to end the game ""successfully"". The only drive would be discovering more about the universe, and improving your score. Coupled with the game sessions' short lengths, it's easy to see the game fail to keep you interested for that long.   Besides, there aren't as many items as one would hope. In my final playthroughs, I ended up with very similar sets of items, and thus making the game a bit too monotonous. But perhaps that's my problem by avoiding combat.   Overall, though, I enjoyed the game while it lasted. It did create some interesting situations, and sometimes made me feel like the Lord of the freakin' Universe. So I think it deserves some merit!   If you like the vibe of the game and my description of it (that I hope was accurate enough), give this one a try, I'm sure you'll have fun, even if for a short time. Now, there's a lot of room for improvement, so here's hoping that the newest addition to the series (Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars -- now in Early Access) manages to expand the game as it deserves!

												Probably the best game to spend your twenty minute break on!Altrough I haven't tryed a single mod for it, I have to say that it supports mods and that is great. It also features short, but satisfying games that each time are completely random and altrough amount of items and events on your way is somewhat limited (Which can be easily fixed by installing a couple(hundred) mods), you still never know what to expect from an unexplored sector. It also supports mods.So yeah there you have it, a space roguelike a single game of which lasts 5 to 20 minutes!P.S. Did I mention mod support?			"

												Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a rogue like space exploration game. This is the game from which FTL was inspired.The game is charming in the way that only older PC titles can be, an emphasis has been placed on the writing making each run an interesting experience as you come across all manners of weird and wonderful random events as you complete your mission. The game offers some customisation allowing you to determine the size of the galaxy, your starting ship and a few other variables, these will effect the length of your game as well as the difficulty. An average run on a normal galaxy should take roughly 15 - 20 mins.Weird Worlds holds a special game and definitely worth a look if you enjoyed FTL and are looking for more, or are a fan of the 4x space genre or the roguelike genre, while it is neither it does blend the 2 nicely and creates something special.

												Pretty nifty little game, you can knock out serval runs in a hour, the idea being to get the best score. The combat is pants, i;ve never won a fight on it on normal mode not even with the best weapons and a full flotilla, it's just a redundant part of the game as i see it which is a shame because it's kinda cool looking but impossible, you'll move far too slow, you'l do barely any damage compared how much they do to you, sucks. Other than the run away from all combats it's a neat little game.			"

												This game has some issues with balancing I have only ever won a fight solo and some enemy ships are so overpowered that I can't even get a shot off before I am dead. In some ship encounters I am so out numbered I don't even see the point even trying to enter those fights when I am going against enemies 10 to 1. The shorter missions for some reason take more in game time than the longer ones. On the otherhand the rogue-like elements of various ship parts and extra items is intriguing with some references. The hiring of some allies and the other random encounters with non-hostile NPC are fun to deal with.			"

												This game was okay... ten years ago.  Unfortunately there's not a single thing this game does that Flotilla doesn't do better, and with more artistic style.  In almost every way it is inferior to Flotilla. Flotilla is 3D, has better execution of customizable ships with firing arcs, and has a much more fun galaxy.			"

												A lovely little ""lunch game"" for people who enjoy roguelikes in the same vein as FTL. Though this game focuses way less on ship/crew management and much more on the actual exploration, it still gives off a lot of the same vibe, and people who enjoy FTL should definitely pick this game up. Absolutely recommended.			"

												I great space game that is as punishing as a kick to the nuts. You will die. You will die when you do good. But when you dont die, you feel awesome. Great game time also, games last from 1 minute to an hour, depending on how awesome you are. Even thou it is much older then FTL (Faster Then Light), Its a great game to play if you enjoyed FTL.			"

												This is quite simple, yet very enjoyable game. Player has 1 ship (or later several), which flies through galaxy and explores particular star systems within limited time-frame. Some systems are inhabited and according to various circumstances player can fight, trade or help (to fight another race) inhabitatns. Game has 2 phases: strategic movement through galaxy, which depends on local environment and also equipment; and tactical real-time combat within a star system.Sucessful game ending very much depends on first several explored star systems - whether player finds fast hyperdrives, items to trade, special race with generous trade offer, etc. There are several rare scenarios which occur from time to time (maybe once per 10 games), which bring another level of difficulty and fun into the game.The interface is quite simple and also game mechanics is simple. There are several small ""gotchas"", which are not obvious (e.g. it is possible to fly through blackhole if at least one ship has special equipment, or it is possible to make peace with certain race if player has certain item in inventory).

Get the better weapons, a nice shield and a good computer and you'll be able to take down a fleet on your own though - oh, nearly fogot, an engine upgrade makes tactical manuouvering much easier as well.

												Engaged sentient machines in a battle between myself, my 3 mercenary ships of different races, and some slugs that offered to ally with me against them.

Great game, wish it had an option for longer and larger plays though. 8/10 for being awesome though a bit short on content for the price, and the lack of steamworks support was disappointing since this was conceived as a game built around the idea of being just a base for community mods to expand on.

This is one of those games that your friend at work has on his computer so that when the boss isnt looking he can slack off and play a 10 minute game of it. So I suggest that when you have ten minutes free you have a game of this and it will be 200 percent more enjoyable.			"

												I don't understand the high ratings on this game. The game has not much to offer. The things it does offer have already been done better in the past.Only played the game for a couple of minutes as the game doesn't offer a whole lot. You fly around in a galaxy to other planets or stars to find equipment to upgrade your craft. There is no expansion on planets, no R&D for better equipment. The game doesn't have a lot of eye candy either. It isn't pretty to look at which further motivates you from stop playing the game.If you want a fun experience in this genre, I would suggest playing imperium gallactica. An old game but much more fun.			"

												Where to start? Weird Worlds is a game all about strategy and going to planets to get upgrades for that ship you have. But within the whole aspect of going to planets, you will often go to planets where aliens are living on that planet and you can either kill them or avoid contact from them. If you do try and kill them, the ships they have are pretty much overpowered and are unkillable because they have all the upgrades for the ship. To honest, I only played this game for about 10 - 20 minutes but it wasn't my cup of tea since the AI are unkillable. Its a time killer game if you are bored, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

												The combat is brutal, the artifacts are confusing, all the odds are against you, and you have quite a way to go. First time playing this and I couldn't stop for a few hours. Nice short completely optional tutorial that just explains things as you go without taking control from you and a very straight-forward interface.Only two things I didn't like were 1) when ships get too close in combat they forcibly turn away instead of passing through/over/under eachother, leaving you sometimes facing the wrong way to target the enemy ships.And 2) for those ships that can teleport in combat there's no meter/countdown to show how long before they can do it again, and it's automatically executed so you can't choose to move normally if you wish.Overall I'd say it's well worth the money if you enjoy going up against unknown odds at every turn. Railguns rule!			"

												This game could be awesome in phone to play when you're bored but as in tabletop gaming feels hollow and there's just so many better games to play. Weird Worlds basically plays out like a cardboard game where you move from a location to another and something happens that may lead to you getting new items with different effect (i.e. battlewise or to aid moving) or you might encounter hostile lifeforms and battle breaks out. I'm not a scifi-person myself but I enjoy my roguelites but this was more the first one and less the last one.			"

												Unimpressive. While the general idea is nice, the gameplay is very repetitive with various items found hardly making a difference. There isn't a big goal to achieve (like in, say FTL), just score to get for amassing generic artefacts or items (I appreciate the descriptions, but all alien species are the same, just with different picture).For me, it's a dissapointment not worth the money.

												(Steam doesn't have a demo, but the internet does!) This is roughly like FTL, but with actual tactical movement of your fleet, and without FTL's final boss that's impossible without the right combo of items. On the downside, this game is VERY rough around the edges and unforgiving. It's good that games that less than an hour, because you CAN NOT SAVE at all. Text is tiny without the ""big UI"" option, but that makes some tutorial messages impossible to read! Everything has lots of flavor text, but almost no useful information. The game even merrily lets you fly into a game-ending instant-death zone (that your character knows about!) without any warning.Still very fun, although you may want to get the iPad version that's half the price, assuming the interface didn't suffer too much.

												Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a hybrid roguelike game of space exploration, adventure and starship combat set within a peculiar as-yet-unvisited region of the galaxy known as the Purple Void. Each time you play the game, a new and different ""instant space opera"" is generated at random; from locations of stars and nebulae to plot-twisting quest events, nothing stays the same. But unlike other games of its kind that go on for dozens of hours, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space plays to its conclusion in less than thirty minutes - it's the perfect lunch break game! Features also include a fully animated star map, a unique turn-based movement system, real-time starship battles, award-winning music and sound, and a robust battle simulator. Weird Worlds also has built-in support for community-created mods that can change anything and everything in the game!			"

This space strategy game (some call it Rogue-like) kept calling me to play one more game, and I heeded its call.Fast forward to the end of 2015 and I finally gave the full game a spin. The familiar menus popped up, the familiar map, and the familiar gameplay all triggered positive memories dating back to when I first played Weird Worlds, not long after building a gaming PC and joining the so-called 'Master Race' for the first time.The game boils down to these elements:1) Pick your name, ship name, and type2) Explore a randomly generated galactic map, complete with barren planets, trading posts, and alien races -- both friend and foe.3) You must explore as much as you can, bringing back items of monetary and scientific value, before time is up. This limit is imposed on you between steps 1 and 2, and is always on screen. Don't worry, you have plenty of time unless you keep battling enemies, and accidentally hit the forward button a few times like I did.Battles are, admittedly and unfortunately, rather boring. There isn't much strategic element, and honestly I escaped whenever possible.Exploration is a little bland, and limited to clicking a world, waiting to see what pops up, and then either trading, dealing with the fallout, or moving on to the next one.Alpha Centauri or FTL, this game is not.So what is it? Why recommend it? Well, a game can be played in 15-30 minutes, and if you don't binge on it (thus seeing all it has to offer in one sitting), you can return to it days, months, or years later for another quick trip around the stars, then put it back on the shelf again until next time. In other words, it's a quick palate cleanse in between meatier experiences. It can be neat discovering an interesting race, item, or upgrade for your ship.It's also dirt cheap, has mod support (note: The Star Wars one I downloaded from the official site locked up my game), and easy to learn, meaning you can play it with casual/non gamers such as youngsters and other relatives and friends.Know what to expect, and I don't think you'll be let down.

												Fairly tiny game, It does have a randomness to it, but each game (even on large) will only keep you occupied for about 10-15 mins.I'd say there's probably 2 hours worth of enjoyment out of it in total.What little of the game there is, is actually quite nice.The combat is fun and fluid, there's plenty of items and species, But it just feels lacking...

Kid-Friendly:Yes. Although there are lots of text that they might just skip through which offer hints as to what items do and what to do next.Kept/Removed:KEPT. It’s the type of game that you can pick up 15-30 minutes at a time.Good/Bad:It kept me entertained for quite a while. You have a mission which is to explore the galaxy as much as you can. You may find artifacts, weapons, shops, enemies or even allies along the way. It’s really a dungeon crawler in disguise. In order to succeed in the game, I suggest to read the descriptions of the items you pick up because as the saying goes, “knowing is half the battle”.Last Thoughts: It’s a fun diversion but I recommend buying it at a discount.

												There is very little event in this game afther less than an hour i got to see everything there was. There is no good story or event, the only point of doing anything is to get a big score. the game looks old, by old I mean the interface and the whole game feel cheap, and everyting is written very small, the art looks cheap aswell.The combat system is very basic and it almost seems useless since I got around 20 encounter and couln't  win any of them.This game feel like a free to play game you can find on the internet. Its not to bad.. but it could be a lot better and it certainly is not worth 10$ more like 2$ or less.I got this game because I liked this genre, I regret spending 10$ on this a lot.			"

												This game is a quick, light space exploration game with some intresting mechanics. Certainly not a game for everyone.I first played this game about a decade ago - and so there's probably a signficant nostalgia compoent to my review. Games that were new and innovate then are tried and boring now. The ideas that were found in this game have made their way into other games - ftl and Sid Meier's starships are two that immediately spring to mind.This game is not complex. If you want a complex spaceship flying around game many others in that realm.It is not epic. The games will be a few minutes long.  The game is that of fly around in one of three space ships (different configurations), find equipment and stuff in various systems, try to improve your lot in life, and get back to your home star before dinner the game timer ends.So, I like the game. I think that its at the right price point. Its an inexpensive indy game from a decade ago. It's not something that will take awhile to play. It doens't have hard choices. Its a fly around, get stuff, get back.When viewed in this light, the game is worthy of a recommendation. I'd like to point out a on that comparison to solitare that has been tossed around. Back in the day you'd find a copy of solitare on every windows machine sold (and pinball and hearts). One aspect of the comparison to solitare is that of ""this is a game that should be part of the 'every machine sold' package circa 2005-2006. The comparison is that of the 'a quick light game that you can play in a few mintues, or multiple times.'			"

												This could be a good game if it wasn't explained with so much reading. A narrator or even dedicated tutorial would do this game wonders, as the current tutorial is really just a lot of reading and occasionally clicking buttons, which made it very difficult to actually understand things. There comes a point when you should abide by the laws of ""showing not telling"".Also, freaky alien art in the main menu scares the hell outta me. -1			"

												This game is a gem.  Always surprising, just when you think you've seen everything that can happen, your game gets randomly invaded by space bees or something.

												Fun little game that plays from start to end in about a half hour. Roguelike random gen encourages you to replay the game for high scores. Doesn't seem to be a whole lot of content which is a shame, I see a lot of the same stuff generated all the time. Combat's also pretty lopsided unless you've got a lot of help in my experience. Fun enough to waste time on... probably not worth the ten dolar full price tag.			"

												I've been playing this game since the early betas and I have mixed feelings about the finished product.  Though simple, the beta interface seemed easier to both see and use and the graphics, in my opinion were better back then.  I'm glad I kept one of the beta builds from when the game was being developed so that I can play that version over this one.  Notably, this is not to say that this game is bad, but it is very short and I'm not sure I like how it ended up.So, the things I like about the game are the exploration elements...and that's just about it.  It's not a particularly good strategy game and unless you get really good luck with the randomizer, the enemy will almost always have the advantage in battle, meaning you avoid or retreat from fights a lot.  While there aren't a huge amount of things to indicate what is better than other things equipment-wise, you can rest assured that if an equipment or item says it does something, it most likely does it some way or another.Things I don't particularly care for are many.  They are all minor things that altogether don't make the game not worth owning or playing, but they are annoyances I can't say I like.  As mentioned above, you are largely at the mercy of the randomizer.  If you get mediocre or bad item drops, you can expect to blow up at some random time or your first attempt at battle.  The variety of equipment and weapons seems significantly smaller than in the betas.  I don't know if that's true or I simply haven't encountered many of them since I started playing again.  The graphics seemed to get a downgrade for the most part, even the pictures of cats that were used as stand-in images for things that hadn't been completed yet were better than some of the final art we got.  In the beta, items had some stats you could compare to see what was better than what and gave a lot of insight on how you might want to equip your ship.  That information is now gone, making outfitting your ship rather tedious when you realize that, though something had a better rating in coins, it ended up hurting your strategy pretty significantly when you tried it in battle.It seems like they realized they wouldn't be finished with the game anytime soon and gutted out the parts that they hadn't finished yet and then simplified a lot of graphics to finish it up.  The three ships you get to choose from at the start are all there are and they don't really affect gameplay much.  Overall, while not a bad game, it's very lackluster, nonetheless.  I had high hopes for this title, but I would have to say that I was disappointed with the end result of all that time spent in beta.			"

												= Summary =Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a time limited rogue like space exploration game.+ Keeps you interesting into discovering how to beat the game- Tutorial is unnecessarily tedious- Short game overall= Review =Your mission is to meet alien species and get items throughout space and you have a limited time to do it. Once you're happy with your exploration you may return home, retire and the game ends.When you travel to a galaxy you may either find items or aliens. Some items are useful to your exploration while others just give you points. The useful items may be weapons, shields or trusters that can be equiped. Other useful items may be used during your exploration.You may encounter friendly, neutral and hostile aliens. Friendly aliens usually just want to negotiate, neutral aliens warn you to leave and hostile aliens always engage in combat. You can engage in combat with neutral aliens, just leave them there or make peace.It is an interesting but overall short game. At first it seems like a weird game with lots of textual information but it gets very addicting once you grasp it. The tutorial is one of the worst aspects of this game. It is unnecessarily tedious and long. My advice is to ignore the tutorial altogether and just learn the game as you go. The interesting part is understanding how to explore every part of the game. For that you need to know which items are useful or not. The game is not very large however so once you beat it a few times there's not much to do besides geetting a better score. There are special events on each level so you may want to finish those as well.Anyway it is an interesting rogue like game but could have more to do.			"

Captains Log, 03.01.2017Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Weird Worlds: Return to infinite Space. Aliens and Black holes! Strange Aliens and Weird Artifacts. What does this game want from me?!First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]In Space, every Alien wants to eat your face or shoe you off to your own world! Black holes want to swallow you whole! And time, as always, is against you. But what do you actually do?You are going into space, for a limited time, to gather as many highscore points as possible. Yip, it is that anti-immersive. Sadly.There is also a space battle simulation option that I skipped in the first lookBack to the game: Easy to control, quick to pick up the how’s and where’s. User friendly may stretch the description too far, but the UI is giving the usability approach a nod of respect at least. Random encounters and random items are they key element in this…..wait. What? I thought space battles were the key element! Nope. They are not.You have to try to achieve something with the things you are dealt. The player’s mission can be a bit different, depending on which of the three possible starting vessels you choose.In its entirety, which is not a large heavenly body, Weird Worlds tries to emulate a rogue like environment for the player to experiment in with some weapon and companion setups. But the amount of possible experiments is very limited.The last point in that list might be the biggest let down and the biggest strength of this game at the same time. It is short and serves a relatively shallow rogue-like-ish experience (I have to emphasize this, because there are just so many more games that really try to be rogue or a light version of rogue. This is more like a mobile-app snack, extra light version. You have been informed.)Look and feel and sound: Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space looks weird enough. The Aliens and the Items are nicely drawn and nearly have a cute look to them. The space background upon which your space faring vessel of choice is doing its exploring is looking good as a canvas for a short game that does not interact with the background, it is just looking good. The background music is really good and fitting, the sound effects, mainly in battle, lack strength and don´t convince me that (although a real space battle would not have any audible sound in space due to the lack of air) there is actually a battle going on. Captains Orders:Weird Worlds is a special snowflake. It tries to be something that other games have done a lot better, a lot of times. But! If you are very limited in terms of time available for gaming, this just me be for you. Most other players will surelyVerdict: Overboard! I have way too many good rogue games at hand, way too many options. Not for me. Sorry game.For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "
