												Before you think this is just a generic review that bashes the game for ""not being a game"", please read the entire review.Gone Home is a first-person exploration game where you play as a girl named Kaitlin, who's just returned home after a year away. The main premise of the game is that you must find out what has happened to your family, while exploring the enormous mansion. Along the way, you'll discover a backstory about your character's sister named Sam, and her relationship with a girl named Lonnie (yes-love it or hate it-the central characters are lesbians). I must admit, while I was playing, I was excited to see what would happen to Lonnie and Sam.You play by walking around and examining objects by clicking on them (I liked the ability to rotate objects to see every little detail on them). Set in 1995, this game has tons of references to pop-culture from that time (my favorite is the X-files reference). Keep in mind that there are no enemies or scary pop-ups throughout the entire game (excluding one somewhat creepy easter egg with a cross). I personally didn't find this bad at all. In fact, I felt that the night-time atmosphere without having to worry about any pop-ups contributed to helping me enjoy the game for all that it had. Being able to look at all of the small objects is my favorite part of the game. Mainly because there are a ton of notes (which usually have something to do with the story) to read, or because the retro objects are just fun to look at.One of the main criticisms that people have with this game is it's length. It's a rather short game which you can beat in less than 2 hours. While this is one of the biggest problems with this game, it's not as bad as you think it is (well, depending on who you are). I spent my time on my playthrough [as mentioned before] looking at all of the objects in the game, and also looking for the tapes that explained more of Sam's backstory. But to be honest, once I was finished looking at all of those cute objects and beating the game, I had very little reason to play through the game again. It was nice while it lasted, but unfortunately, this may not please most people. So if you're reading this, let me give you a message: if you don't like exploration type games where you just observe objects and don't fight any enemies, stop reading this and don't even buy this game (everyone else, read on).But without a doubt, the biggest fault with this game is the the price tag: $19.99. While I enjoyed this game on my first playthrough, $20 for such a small game is just flatout robbery. If you're really interested in this game, I suggest that you get it when it goes on sale, because $20 is really not worth it in my opinion.So to sum it up: Gone Home is a nice game to play. It has an interesting story that is worth playing for, and exploring the 90's themed house just fills me with a special feeling that I've never had before. But in the end, it suffers from being incredibly overpriced, and the fact that most people can beat the game really quickly. For those reasons, I can not recommend this game to any normal gamer. HOWEVER, if this game is on sale, I would give it a try.			"

 *WARNING* This review contains spoilers So back in the year 2013 Gone Home was getting an incredible amount of praise from various video game critics. Due to this I decided to give indie developer Fullbright's title a whirl. After having played through the game though, I found out how overhyped this game truly is. It didn't come close to what some of these critics were claiming it was. They acted as if it was something turely amazing and worthy of title game of the year. Let me tell you here first, It is by no means worthy of such a prestigious title like that. It's actually an insult to the gaming industry for it to even be considered for game of the year in my opinion. The only thing you even do in this so-called ""game"" is walk throughout a house looking for clues/specific items that when interacted with will trigger voice recordings from Kaitlin's ""missing"" sister. When the recordings are triggered they will give you some small backstory on your sister and they will also give you a hint as to where you can find the next clue/item. This is what the entire game consists of and it became repetitious rather quickly. It got so repetitious to the point where the game became a chore to complete. Now repetitious gameplay isn't Gone Homes only flaw, It also has a terribly uneventful conclsuion. Before I go on to talk about that though, let me give you a brief premise of the story first. You play as Kaitlin Greenbriar who returns home to find her parents house empty. Her mom, dad, and sister are all no where to be found. YOU and only YOU must find out what happened to her family. Now that we're all caught up, let's talk about the games uneventful conclusion I spoke of. Obvious SPOILERS ahead. So it turns out Kaitlin's mom and dad are not actually missing but happen to be on a camping trip while she decides to return home. So it's just a case of she's at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Very captivating ending so far right?  So if something so interesting is going on with Kaitlin's parents something equally as interesting must be happening to her adorable little sister as well right?  Well, let's dive right into it. The reason Kaitlin's sister is no where to be found is because she decided to run away while her parents were on their camping trip due to her being in a homosexual relationship in which they didn't approve of. Yes, she ran away with her girlfriend and also decided to drop out of high school to live happily ever after in La La Land. How anyone can find this to be a good conclusion to a mytstery title is beyond me.This ending left me so unsatisfied. It is just so bland, boring, and anticlimactic. The ending did not pay off, plain and simple. I have watched episodes of Scooby Doo with more interesting endings than this for crying out loud. I truely believe the ending to this game is the entire reason Gone Home got any recognition from the critics. It really has to be because this game surely does not have reviting gameplay. It got the recognition and universal praise simply because it tackled a controversial subject like homosexuality. The ending to Gone Home  just me left exremely unsatisfied and nothing more. How so many critics thought the ending was ""great"" will alawys be a mystery to me. It just angers me that critics were most likely praising Gone Home  just because it tackled a controversial subject all while they ignore the games biggest problem, repititious uneventful gameplay.Now this game left me disappointed in many ways but what I am disappointed by the most though is that this game could have been truely great if it went in more interesting direction. Gone Home had a truely great atmosphere, it really did. There were creeks, faint creepy voices, and thunderstrkes that would all occur as you would walk throughout the house finding the clues. The first half of the game even hinted at the paranormal and seemed as if it were going to go in a completely different more interesting direction. However, instead of taking full advantage of the great atmopshere and making this a great mystery title Fullbright decided to go with an uninteresting teenage love story. It really saddens me. So in conclusion I somewhat enjoyed the beginning of Gone Home due to its a great atmosphere but the games unintersting ending and its very repetitive gameplay left me throughly disappointed. So in humble opinion this game isn't worth buying by any means. It definitly isn't worth the $20 price tag that's for sure. TL;DR: This game has very repetitious gameplay, has a very anticlimactic uninteresting ending, and is terribly overrated by critics. AVOID			"

												(Note: This review contains spoilers for the whole game. I also purchased the game via the Humble Bundle and have played it all the way through. It took about 2 hours, so please excuse my Steam playtime.)Suffers from a bad case of the Eight Deadly Words. ""I Don't Care What Happens To These People.""I dislike leaving negative reviews on Steam products, especially for games like Gone Home. It's not an awful game, by any means. But I certainly didn't enjoy it either. Honestly, I wish Steam had an ""Ehhhhh"" option with a yellow, wiggly, indecisive hand for its icon 'cause that's how I feel right now.I've got no objections to the gameplay (or lackthereof) in Gone Home. In fact there was something about being left on my own in such a detailed environment that I rather enjoyed. Rather than having puzzles in the traditional adventure game sense, the challenge of the game comes from piecing together the jigsaw-puzzle of a plot from the environment. Despite not having any mechanics to enforce progression (such as conventional puzzles), it still feels like you're accomplishing things.Naturally this comes with a trade off: if you aren't interested in the details, then you're not gonna enjoy Gone Home.But I think my biggest problem with Gone Home is that the atmosphere of the game just doesn't match the story. You arrive home late one night to find your house empty. There's a distraught message left on the answering machine, a note from your sister pleading your character not to ""go snooping like [she] always does"", and a turned-on TV playing a severe storm warning on repeat. All in all, it feels like the setup to a horror story, or at least a tragedy. I thought that something happened, something terrible, and caused whoever was at home at the time to leave in a hurry.In reality, nothing even remotely tragic happened. The reality of the situation was a teenage romance story that, for me at least, bordered on glurge[tvtropes.org]....Admittedly, I am not in the target demographic for love stories so I might be biased in that regard. But moving on.Gone Home builds up a tense atmosphere, then doesn't do a whole lot with it. Presumably the ""worst-case scenario"" buildup was meant to make the main love story plotline feel like a relief, but it just doesn't work. Sam's narration throughout the game also detracts from the mood. Her stories contain very little conflict and are, to be honest, pretty sappy.The entire narration mechanic just baffles me, honestly. Why bother letting Sam narrate her life story when you're just gonna rifle through her journal anyhow?That said, the game is not totally without its charm. The object tooltips (""Grab Cup"", ""Read Note"", etc) often changed to more personal observations (""Sam had this when she was like four"" for a folder, ""Gosh, Dad"" for a dirty magazine, etc), which was a touch of detail that I absolutely adored. Even though the protagonist was silent for most of the game, it still felt like I was playing as a character with a personality. But these moments were few and far between, and the main character might as well have been faceless for what a pitifully tiny role she played in the plot.TL;DR: this game is... somewhat enjoyable, but there's just not enough good parts for me to be able to recommend it.

												I feel I am going to get lambasted for this review but I want to be honest and give my opinion. Considering that the game has a retail price of $19.99 and yet can be beaten in just over an hour is a little absurd in my mind. That being said, I've been hearing mixed reviews on this game and I'm a sucker for a good story, so I bit the bullet and picked it up when it was discounted. I could not wait to play, turned off all the lights, put on my headphones and started up the game. The atmosphere in this game is really creepy and well done. There were so many times I felt someone was right next to me and I really started getting spooked out. Sadly, that ends what I enjoyed from the game. There are so few times I don't enjoy a video game story, but this was one of them. From the very beginning it was obvious what the big twist was going to be. I thought because of that, it had to be something else so I was excited to continue. When I found out I was right all along, I was quite disappointed. I can see why this has been getting mixed reviews, and I commend Full Bright for trying something different. Sadly in this case, the game just fell flat for me. I was really hoping I would fall on the 10/10 side of the discussion, for I hate being negative about video games. The game is hit or miss in my mind, so even though I don't recommend it, you may still enjoy it! Just know there is also the chance it will end up like it did for me =/			"

												Gone Home is a difficult experience to describe, especially when it comes to recommending it to someone else. It's an interactive short story, and I do mean short. The script for the written notes and spoken dialog probably wouldn't amount to more than 10 pages. The characters are very broadly sketched with only the smallest hints of depth and complexity. The focus of the narrative is a really pretty mundane love story which presents little in the way of surprise.What Gone Home does well though is provide a powerful injection of 100% pure, high grade nostalgia directly into the bloodstream. Nostalgia both for childhood and adolescence in general and the 1990s in particular. A story for the ages this is not. A story for people who were teenagers in 1995? Yes. Maybe.The writing is good and the voice actor who played Sam did an excellent job. That, coupled with the introspective and tender mood, is enough to carry you through at least one playthrough (80 minutes for me). That said, there's certainly no reason to play again. In fact, when you start looking back over the experience you begin to resent the numerous red herrings whose sole purpose seemed to be to obscure the real focus of the story for as long as possible.In the end I found Gone Home to be atmospheric and touching in a simplistic way, but also fundamentally shallow. The asking price of $19.99 is way, way too high. I'd recommend purchasing only when a big sale comes along, and then only if you're a fan of this genre of entertainment.			"

												Gone Home is an interactive short story of about an hour and a half. During that time, you are Katie who has just returned home from Europe and finds nobody home. So she explores the family mansion, to find out where her parents and her sister are. The graphics are nice enough, sound effects are ok and the voice acting is not bad either, which is a rare feat for indie games. But the story is what an interactive story is mostly about, of course, and unfortunately that's where Gone Home will be severely lacking for most people.I don't want to spoil the story for people who may want to experience the story for themselves, but I can say that the story is a huge disappointment if you get your expectations from elements like 'a huge mansion to explore', 'an empty house', 'mystery: where is everyone?' etc. It's nothing like what you'd think. There are no unexpected twists in the story and there is nothing supernatural going on or anything like that.The description for the game on the Steam page contains some quotes from reviews. One of the quotes mentions that the story of Gone Home is a love story. So that's no spoiler either, it's in the product's description. The story is indeed a teenage love story like you might have seen in an After School Special from the late 20th century. I don't mean that in bad way, there is nothing wrong with After School Specials, it's just so you know what to expect and who the target audience is. If you think you might enjoy a teenage love story being told while you explore every room of a mansion, you should still be careful before deciding to purchase Gone Home. It's a completely linear experience and the interactivity required is very limited, so there is no reply value whatsoever. Moreover, the whole experience only takes an hour and a half. So we should really talk about the price here. That isn't easy, though, because money is subjective: to some people, €20 or $20 means practically nothing but for other people, that's half their monthly budget for gaming. I usually tend to recommend buying games if they're on sale when I personally think they may be a bit overpriced for the value they actually offer. But in this case, I think it's safe to be blunt and say that pricing a short novel (emphasis on 'short') with extremely little content at €20/$20, is nothing less than a complete rip-off. I think I personally paid around €3.5 for it and I still feel that I paid a bit too much for what I got.For people who are sure they won't want to experience Gone Home for themselves, I'll tell you the whole story just so you'll see what I'm on about in this review. So needless to stay, HUGE SPOILER coming up... Well, where is everyone? The parents are away on a weekend trip and the sister has run away from home with her lesbian lover.. Even for an After School Special pitch, the producers would have said: ""Hmm ok, it's an interesting start for a story but what else is going on?"". To which Gone Home would reply: ""Nothing else. That's it. And that will be 20 dollar/euro please.""			"

												A nice concept, but ultimately the game is too short and not interesting enough to warrant the $20 price tag. You can rent better films for cheaper which will do the same thing and much more. Still, may be worth getting at heavy discount if someone likes drama/mystery type stories.On a side note, the main plot point seems a bit outdated, which is probably why the game is set in the 90s, when it was more relevant. It is not possible to get into details without spoilers, but I was pretty disappointed at how weak the overall message turned out to be.			"

New York Times called it the ""Best love story ever told in a video game"".. That is just an utter lie and a downright insult to the ocean of games with beautiful love stories told in them.Story is cute sure, but in the end it is shallow and dissapointing. The atmosphere is good and sometimes even creepy, though it's not supposed to be. As for gameplay there is none, just walking and rotating objects. The whole game is over in less than 2 hours and there is no replay value.Only worth buying on sale if you're having a boring night,			"

												I really did give this game a chance. I disregarded all the negative hype and just tried the experience for myself. Having beaten the game in about 2 hours I can tell you that it's not worth any amount of money. There is no sense of resolution at the end - what happened with Ranger Rick? What was the crime that the former owner of the house committed? All of these were just never wrapped up and at the end really just left me hanging. I can't recommend this game, I finished it once and have no intention of returning to it. It's short, has no resolution, and isn't even properly optimized.			"

												Gone Home is less of a game and more of an experience set exclusively in a big house using first person perspective. Not like Myst or Shadowgate, but like a first person shooter where you can walk around like Dear Esther or Half Life 2 without the guns. If you like to explore, read notes, listen to audio journals and be immersed in a fiction you might enjoy it. The basic premise is that you're in an empty house and you need to discover why. There's no real emphasis on why, you just explore. The house has a history to it and so do the characters you'll hear about. You'll never see the characters outside of a photo here and there. Heck you never even see yourself outside of a passport. There might be 3+ bathrooms in this house but there are no mirrors.The story is set in 1995 and while I'm not into story, the developers did a good job of presenting it as immerse as they could. You'll hear 90s punk music, find Super Nintendo cartridges and see plenty VHS movie names. It hinges heavily on 90s nostalgia and lesbians. Most of what you will find goes through a history of a teenager's love interest with another young woman. There are side stories such as the house's history and the previous owner's death.The house is pretty open from the start, you are able to explore freely with very little limitations. You'll find secret paths, compartments, visit several rooms, turn on dozens of lights, read notes, listen to well voiced audio journals and examine things, but never really do anything with them. You can open doors, throw objects and put them back. Again, your job is to discover what happened. Unravel the story. The only real challenge is to find half hidden notes under couches, keys and combinations to locks and safes. There is no way to lose, you will get through Gone Home if you keep going.There is no run button, just walk, look, crouch and zoom in. Again, its an exploration experience. In the menu you have a map of visited rooms, a list of journal entries, and a small inventory that you don't really need. You just collect keys. Its not like you need to see the keys, because the game recognizes that you have them when you look at a door.Gone Home is over in under 2 hours and that was with me exploring and reading everything. It is an easy sit through and play, but for $20 there is no way I can recommend it. Even for $10. It is interactive fiction, with zero replay value.			"

												An interesting exercise in environmental storytelling. Gone Home is a first-person exploration game taking place inside a single abandoned house filled with the memorabialia of its former inhabitants . You pick up objects and examine them for clues as to how to proceed. You'll read through lots of notes, scrapbooks, and other pieces of written material, which will serve as clues/puzzle pieces as well as convey details about the story. Picking up certain objects or entering certain rooms will trigger a voiceover which also explains the story to you. The interface is similar to the Amnesia and Penumbra games, in that you'll use the mouse to pick up and rotate objects, as well as close or open doors, closets, and drawers as you rummage through the house. It's well put together but by the time you get to the end of it you'll really feel like you've wasted your time. The story doesn't develop much, and since you're uncovering snippets of information about something which has happened in the past, there isn't a lot of impact here. You as the player don't have a role in the story - you're a passive observer and there is nothing for you to actually *do* besides trying to figure out what happened.This game has received a lot of attention, both positive and negative, and a lot has been written about it. At this point it seems like most people are playing it just so that they can feel like they have an informed opinion about it. If you're one of those people who needs to know what ""Gone Home"" is all about, then sure, go ahead and play it since it's relatively short anyway. For everyone else; don't waste your time. It doesn't work as a game and as a work of art it's shallow and feels insincere.			"

												Finally got around to playing Gone Home, after hearing a lot of praise from both friends and the general gaming press, having heard ""Game of the Year"" mentioned more than once.Firstly, calling this a game, at least in the traditional sense, is doing it a great disservice, as a lot of people will expect more out of it than it delivers, it should rather be described as a digital short story (and, short as in two hours, give or take, even when you're really trying to prolong the experience) than a game.Gameplay can be described as walking into a room, meticulously going over every nook, cranny and crevice until you find a piece of information (almost always on a piece of paper), and then either listening to a short audioclip that furthers the telling of the overall story, or reading a tiny bit of information about one of the sub-plots.The main story is ok-ish, albeit very clichéed, and more or less all of the sub-plots are uninteristing and will leave you without closure, and you'll just have to speculate about the whats and whys.  I must give credit for the great voiceacting, though, the actress who voiced Sam did a pretty fantastic job throughout.Furthermore, it annoyed me immensely that a lot of the clues are found in highly illogical places, it complete breaks immersion for me to think that someone would leave information of a certain nature in a highly visible place, or that notes that are decades old would still be found where they would surely have either been destroyed, or removed by the persons living in the house.This is even more compounded by the fact that the developers have done a pretty good job of making the house seem very real, more or less all drawers, closets, microwaves etc. can be opened to search for clues, but then again, this was most probably done to further the longevity of the game, you spend a lot of time opening stuff that have no items of interest in them.All in all, I can't really recommend this game, its an interesting way to tell a story, and if the story had been better, it could really have been an experience, but as it is, this game should in no way be a contender for a GotY title.

Also lots of nostalgic stuff for 90s kids, i guess.The storyline, however, is thin, and not very interesting.This game would maybe be an okay buy if it was cheaper (5 - 10 euro would be alright).

The story is far too boring and cliche. There was potential in several areas, but these aspects were never explored fully, if at all. Granted, the story was cute and sweet, but there wasn't anything special about it. This game was a waste of time and a waste of money. I was rooting for it because it had so much potential.

												This is a difficult game to recommend solely because it is not the prototypical video game. It aims to tell a story, and it does it well. For the vast majority of people I know who play video games, this is not something I would recommend to them. However, if you have ~3 hours to devote to navigating a well developed environment, with tons of details and a good story to tell, then this may be for you.There are no weapons, puzzles, or dialogue options. However, the ambience provided by the environment (i.e. music, background effects like wind and rain) give you the opportunty to experience a story in an immersive and interesting way. If you don't appreciate long movies, romantic movies, or progressive trends in video game development, this game is not for you.			"

												Gone Home is a fairly straightforward game. Through a standard first person control scheme, you are Kaitlin Greenbriar, eldest sister in the Greenbriar family, back from an extended European holiday only to find the Greenbriar family home utterly empty. The crux of the game is uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of Kaitlin's family.SPOILERS BELOW. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED. IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING GROUNDBREAKING OR WORTH KEEPING A SECRET, THOUGH.Gone Home's story is innately personal, which is why it ultimately feels hollow to witness it through the weird, voyeuristic second-hand experience of sorting through notes, filtering for meaningful information. Occasionally uncovering a milestone piece of information results in a narrated excerpt from Sam's diary, which frankly feels a little bit like cheating since the vast majority of Sam's story arc unfolds through these excerpts, rather than the notes.Sam and Lonnie's relationship is the primary story arc of the game. It evolves from a subtext-laden friendship to a romance around the half-way point. I am nothing but sympathetic for this kind of thing; and it did hit me hardest when Sam described her mother, Janice Greenbriar, insisting that Sam was going through a ""phase"", ""did not know what she wanted"", and ""just needed to meet the right guy"", but this isn't a story about runaway lesbian teenagers, it's a story about an observer finding out about runaway lesbian teenagers after the fact.This also isn't to mention the story arcs for the other characters--Terry's writing career, his obsession with the JFK assassination, his dead-end job as a hi-fi hardware reviewer, his alcoholism, and his wife's unfaithfulness--are more interesting than the relationship between Sam and Lonnie.Gone Home's limited interactivity and 90s culture nostalgia aesthetic don't quite fill the gaps in a story loaded with cliches. In another medium, Gone Home wouldn't be considered anything remarkable. It also suffers from outdated visuals and poor engine optimization (pretty much the entire house is loaded into memory, physics objects and all).It's important that as the video game industry reaches a larger audience and matures, we must also understand where mature criticism is necessary, where not to lump blind praise, and where to hold a game to the same standards that everyone else receives. I do not think Gone Home's praise is deserved, but I do not think its hate is either.Gone Home is an interesting experiment in taking the kind of environmental storytelling dating all the way back to System Shock to its furthest conclusion, but not much more than that (and I feel a little insulted that the first number code in the game is 0451).

												I got this on sale for $10, and even then I feel like I paid too much. It's a 2 hour game about a teenage romance. I was seriously disappointed in this game. The gaming media has been raving about how amazing this game is. The gameplay itself is basically Bioshock's audio diaries, you go around and search for items that will give you a piece of the overall story. The story itself, though, is very lame. The ending just makes the story even worse. SPOILERS: Teenage lesbians ruin their lives because of their highschool crush. They run off together, so one of them is going awol, which is a crime that you serve jail time for, and the other is leaving behind their 75% scholarship. So they both ruin their lives because they're young and don't know any better, and I'm supposed to think this game is amazing? No, it's not.			"

												Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.Again, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game but I just can't. I bought it because I had seen a lot of mysterious reviews that essentially said 'you must experience it'. Well I did and I rather regret it. I can see how some people would like this game and how the story may resonate with some people but it just felt overrated to me. It is a lot of money for what it is. I usually like story-driven walkabout games if they have an interesting story but this one was just lacking. Its story is borderline cliche with no twists or surprises to boast of. You unlock the story by finding snippets of it around the house but many of the objects you can interact with do nothing to advance the plot. Essentially, I went through this game waiting for the twist end or the piece of the puzzle to make it worth it and it just never happened. "

												I'm a bit lost as to what to say about this. Surely, some people might enjoy this interactive museum, but I cannot help but feel like it could never ever be wirth 20 bucks. My recommendation could have been different had the price been as well.To make it clear - this is a story that can certainly resonate with certain people, however the price makes it not worth too try and find out whether you are one of those people or not.This is a poor man's Penumbra; the game has 2 primary ways of conveying the plot (for what it's worth - more on that later) - audial diaries and various letters spread about in the house. A diary entry plays in the background each time the player finds the next plot clue, and is then added to the player's library/journal, from where they can play the recording again or read the transcript. Other than that, the house is full of various letters and cards, which can be read if so desired. The content will provide for 2 hours of play time, if explored fully.The aforementioned house is, by the way, the only location in this game. It's not very large, but has enough dark corners to make the player revisit some rooms; mostly, however, all the clues are pretty straightforward and won't require any particular pixel-hunting.The environments not very interactive, as the most a player can do is move several small objects (which represent no plot value most of the time) around. With the exclusion of a few exceptions, all interactivity boils down to opening doors, reading letters sticked on surfaces, and turning the lights on. The amount of objects that had any relevant information on them that required examining in 3D can be counted in single digits; for the record - there is an option in this game to rotate some objects in all 3 axis.The plot mainly consists of one main storyline about a girl (main character's sister). There is also a branch going into the stories of the rest of the family - the writer father, the mother and her colleague♥♥♥♥♥♥ and finally her mysterious brother the pharmacist. There is not much to be gathered all in all, but these branches do provide for a nice distraction from an otherwise monotonous story.It is hard to comment on the main story itself without going into spoilers (there are not much to be made however). It cannot brag with clever twists or an ability to create a strong emotional bond, even though there were a few unexpected moments. The ending is particularly dissatisfying - it does not solve any problems raised during the game and just reaches an easy deus-ex-machina conclusion, if such strong terms can even be applied in such case.Speaking of the social commentary side of the plot, there is not much to be either. There is only 1, perhaps two moments where some societal problems are pointed out. That is fair enough - but no further commentary has been made on these topics. Even the reaction of the characters isn't described with more than 2 paragraphs of text.The graphics are relatively stylised, yet it can still be often seen how poor they are. This game is in many ways comparable to Dear Esther, and the latter has done a much better job at visuals.It's also worth noting that the game is quite glitchy. I got stck at one point because, despite having a key to the next stage, so to say, I wasn't able to open an appropriate door. I tried restarting the game, only to see the ""New Game"" button - my save file didn't like my hard drive, apparently. Having turned to the forums, this seemed to have been a pretty widespread issue.Furthermore, objects sometimes would glitch when picked up, and not be displayed.Gladly in Gone Home it is easy to reach a previously achieved point in the plot, so even after losing my save file I wasn't set back too far.All in all, I must say that even thuogh I wasn't bored to the point of quitting the game halfway in, yet that is only due to my having nothing to do at the time. Your time is much better spent playing other games, including indie ones - it is very easy to find a better way to spend your time. If you are interested in such an interactive museum type of game, I suggest you try Dear Esther, which had managed the implementation of it much better. Finally, there is always Bastion with its narration - though that would require more actual gameplay.			"

												I'm reviewing this game merely because it's user reviews are ""mostly positive"" at the moment. It really wasn't very good and I got it in a humble bundle thankfully. If I had actually paid for this, I would not be at all happy. The game starts out with lots of tension, suspense, and mystery but ultimately boils down into a sappy, under developed story that was hardly worth the time it took to bait out. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this game, which was kind of creepy, but that is about all it has going for it. There is literally zero gameplay, all you do is walk around the house. You can pick up items and inspect them, but this is hardly even useful and some of the plot points are redundant enough that you don't even need to inspect items, just read letters.At first I thought the tags were a joke, but honestly, this isn't a game, it really is a ""walking simulator"". And that is coming from a guy who absolutely loved little inferno (another game with less developed gameplay elements). All in all, you would be wise to skip this one, it is really a snooze fest. I actually regret spending my 2 hours to finish it. 2 hours for such an abysmal game is inexcusable. It would be different the game was impactful and deep and visually beautiful like brothers a tale of two sons (which was also very short), but this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities to make up for its short duration, lack of gameplay, $20 pricetag, and lackluster story.4/10 They tried.

												Overrated, and overpriced. I really enjoy narrative driven games that actually offer something compelling. I would have let both the $20 price tag and the 2 hour gameplay length slide if it provided a worthwhile experience. Instead, I felt gypped and unable to comprehend why this game received such high critical acclaim. For a game praised so highly for it's narrative, it's extremely shallow and predictable. I found myself seeing how the story was going to unfold within the first 15 minutes or so and was already bored with the revelations by the time the game hosts the big reveals. Nothing felt like a revelation and everything felt like a cliche. f you really want to play this game and find enjoyment, don't pay more than $5 and keep your expectations for the narrative very low.

												If you scrutinize enough there won't be much trouble finding pretty much everything in the game (except I never found out what one dark room was supposed to be about). But the lighting is still painfully awful (yes, even as the sole challenging element of the game), and I won't say that the story is universally immersive or for that matter great (the voice acting was pretty good though). The story is actually pretty bad. The game is really short, in fact there should be a tag for super-short (just kidding lol). What I want to say is that even though I got it for 50% off, I still don't think it was worth the bucks. Goes to show that maybe digging what the critics say all the time may not be such a good idea after all.			"

												Critics contend 'Gone Home' isn't actually a game, but rather a poorly-written, angst-ridden, glorified walking simulator shamelessly pandering to third-wave feminists. Suffice it to say, these critics are indeed correct―overwhelmingly so.Ignoring common sense and logic, I purchased this game in the offshoot chance that I’d experience, at the very least, a reverberation of emotion.(Spoilers ahead.)The player controls Kaitlin 'Katie' Greenbriar, who incidentally returns from her overseas trip in Amsterdam to an abandoned château in rural Oregon. A presumably Methodist household, you are also introduced through various letters and business cards, your parents, Terrence and Janice Greenbriar. Terry is a failed author dabbling in mediocre political thrillers about JFK. He opts instead to write album reviews for a Home Theater aficionado magazine. Jan is a senior conservationist working at the local Forestry service. Her dedication to her career leads to estrangement from her family, leading her and Terry to leave that week for counseling.Katie also has a younger sister, Samantha, a fiery, sharp-tongued teenage writer who sends you on an 'adventure' to see where she’s inexplicably waddled off to. Wonderful.What follows is a menial tour of a well-designed dollhouse. Expect opening and closing doors, turning on lamps and other fixtures, searching over and under floorboards in an attempt to discover― a plot. Immersion is a touted feature by many reviewers, but not once have I felt immersed in the nostalgia-filled world of '95. All the proclivities and details in these rooms are offset by their distractingly mindboggling placements. (Tell me, who in their right mind would leave private letters randomly scattered all around their house?)The plot revolves around your sister and her acceptance of being hopelessly in love with Lonnie, an army brat and oddly enough, a rebellious punk rocker. They go to costume parties and riot grrl concerts, dye their hair, and protest patriarchy in all forms. Eventually, they kiss and thus sets the stage for their ill-fated Shakespearean tragedy. This not-so-subtle progression of sappy lesbian love is doled out over a painful length of an hour and a half. Then the game just ends. Lonnie elopes with Sam, abandoning her duties as a servicewoman and wanders listlessly throughout the New English coast. A misplaced hodgepodge of saccharine, sentimentalist music swells over the credits to provide a supposed, illusionary feeling of a heartfelt and revelatory experience.If you’re going to make a narrative-driven 'game' about the characters, make sure we actually get to know them first. Not through what we’re told about them, but through actual experiences that the character, as well as you and I, experience. Real emotional connections are possible in games, but not through the use of force or tedium. This trend of masturbatory, preachy kitsch (Dear Esther, BioShock Infinite, Dream) should be quickly stamped out and be replaced with games of genuine heart and depth. Don't give these hacks your hard-earned money.			"

Posted: February 15, 2014
												A big warning sign was how this game received universal praise from critics, but low scores from user reviews. I smelled ""a game for the critics"" art experiment.I'm fine with short games. I'm fine with stories with little to no actual gameplay. I'm fine with short stories with no actual gameplay if the story is any good. This is not a good story. It's hard to explain exactly why without spoiling anything, so I will put the spoiler at the end.The thing about this game is that it's built entirely on false dread. It tries very very hard to make you believe there's supernatural horror elements at work. The official blurb describes it as a mystery. Within the first minute of gameplay, you find a note on the front door begging you to not find the missing people and mysterious answering machine messages of some frantically sobbing girl. Written notes of mysterious shadows, possible ghost sightings, flickering lights, haunted house histories, and other stuff. This all turns out to phoney red herrings. The ending is one big ""LOL just kidding"" and you feel ripped off. If you took away all the false dread, no one would finish the game because the actual story is just too boring. Stories can be very effective with red herrings, tone shifts, and subverting expectations, but in Gone Home's case it's all just so tacked on and phoney. The supernatural mystery elements desperately wave their arms around like a rodeo clown trying to distract you from the fact that it's all just a mundane story about dumb teenagers.The one thing the game does well is recreating a house of the mid 90s. I think this is where a lot of the praise comes from as critics were suckered in by cheap nostalgia thrills of seeing Street FIghter II references, Super Nintendo games, VHS libraries, X-Files posters, and Riot Grrrl fliers. Maybe the game's creators have a bright future in retro interior decorating, but not in writing or game-making.$20 is insane for this. $5 would have been about right if the ending didn't leave you feeling cheated. I can only recommend this game if you want to spend $5 (no more) for a virtual 90s household simulator.SPOILER: So you find out very early on that your sister is a lesbian and took her new best friend from school as a lover. Fine, whatever. I thought Brokeback Mountain and Blue is the Warmest Color were very well done movies so I have no problem with a homosexual love story. Gone Home is not a good story. Whereas Brokeback and BitWC focused on the conflicts of the relationship, Gone Home just rolls around in it like a pig in the mud. There's no meaningful conflict to it and the end makes nothing of the fact that Sam just threw away her 75% scholarship and her girlfriend is now a wanted felon for going AWOL. It's like a more ridiculous veresion of the ending to The Graduate, and even that movie acknowledged the end as farce. It's manipulative, it's dishonest, and it avoids any conflict because the authors seem to think that giving lesbian characters or relationships any flaws would make them bigots rather than human.Just go watch Blue is the Warmest Color for a much better version of the same story. You get to see meaningful conflicts and a more honest look at relashionships that explores the ups AND the downs. The movie also features exactly as much gameplay as Gone Home, and won't cost $20.

												Where do I begin with is one?I basically bought into the hype.  Most of the major video game websites (i.e. IGN, Kotaku, etc) gave it a 10/10, and/or stated Gone Home was a, ""must play."" The fact that Gone Home could be beaten within a time span of 2-3 hours got my attention, and even though I'm not much of a horror/thriller fan, I decided I wanted to put my mettle to the test.  It's amazing how our current generation of gaming no longer needs a 30-60 hour play through to give us some emotional experience or meaningful thought.  I love Journey, the Unfinished Swan is good for all ages, and who would argue against Telltale's Walking Dead series? Unfortunately, Gone Home is not that memorable: it's a game with the facade of a haunted house, but it's only when you reach the end do you feel the disappointment and general weakness.  Gone Home (without spoiling too much) acts as more of a ""Dear Diary..."" than Amnesia or Slender.  Sure Gone Home has the classic setting of an empty cabin in the woods during a thunderstorm, but the ending is a bait-and-switch that tries to shoe-horn in something corny, than something a little more scary--an actual poltergeist or serial killer would've been a welcomed site.I bought Gone Home for $20, and I've regretted it ever since.  Gone Home isn't even worth a Steam sale.  If you really want play it, find someone who bought into the hype (like me) and ask to play it off of their Steam account or PC.  Trust me, you'll save some money, and you can thank me for it later.			"

												Far too short for the money[NOTE: If you're looking at reviews cause you saw spoilers to the plot, then you probably decided you want to get it already. In that case, at least wait until it goes on sale]The game designers bill this as a ""Story exploration video game"" (see trailer), I'd call it a walking simulator with a few puzzles thrown in, so don't expect a typical puzzle/adventure gameStory: Some people will think it is utterly fantastic, some will be disapointed -- not much middle ground here. The premise is that you arrive home from a year abroad expecting to meet your parents and sister at your house, but no one seems to be there...Atmostphere and graphics: very good, they hit all sorts of 90's references very well. A few years ago this game defined what ""walking simulators"" are.Puzzles: I felt there were too few of them for the price of the game. Again, this is a walking simulator. If you are expecting a puzzle game you will be disappointed. Length: a few hours, a little more if you want to solve and explore everything.Call it a very nice 90's-era walking simulator with an interesting backstory and a little bit of puzzles thrown in. If you are looking for a puzzle game, don't pay more than a few dollars for it, maybe $5 if you're really into 90's America references or you want to take a chance on a game with no pre-conceived notions on what the plot is going to be. If you are really looking for a walking simulator, then you probably would enjoy it more (but I still can't see paying anywhere near full price).On the bright side, this title goes on sale periodically, so if you are patient you can get it cheaply.

												I am not a teenage girl. That probably will not surprise anyone, but I feel it is an important distinction to make. Not being a teenage girl, ""Gone Home"" does not resonate with me in any way. Hell, it doesn't even resonate with me despite the fact that - once upon a time, back when dinosaurs still roamed the earth - I was a teenager. Unfortunately, this rather trite tale of a lost girl's discovery of her own sexuality requires you to emphasize with her plight. I suppose it is all sort of touching in a way, but it is not a particularly riveting story, especially given her otherwise sheltered upbringing. And it certainly does not make for an interesting game, or whatever ""Gone Home"" is supposed to be. There's something to be said for the slow and methodical exploration of her (unrealistically spacious) home, but it also feels rather mechanical as you scour the rooms for clues. I suppose voyeurs might appreciate the ability to stick their fingers into every closet and crevice, but I don't even like looking in the medicine cabinets at my friend's house, much less poking through the virtual belongings of a strange family.Much fuss has been made about how ""accurately"" the game represents mid-90s Americana, but that's not very hard to achieve. Keeping dates on a wall calendar or scribbling notes on scraps of paper are hardly long-lost arcana (I only tossed my mix-tapes a couple years ago). Heck, the lack of any computers in such a well-to-do household as presented in the game is actually an incongruity; by 1995, almost everyone I knew had a computer in their house already. I suppose for pre-teens the '90s may seem like some exotic far-away land, but for most gamers (average age: 36 and rising), waxing nostalgic about the 90s makes about as much sense as reminiscing about last Tuesday's lunch.I get that ""Gone Home"" is intended to be more mood piece than game, more art than entertainment. It follows in the footsteps of games like ""Anna"" and ""Dear Esther"". And as an experiment intended to take virtual worlds in new directions, away from the ordinary run-n-gun format of our Call of Duty and Elder Scrolls games. But both as a story and an experience, the hour-long story of ""Gone Home"" fails to entertain and captivate, being a dry, lackluster and unrewarding adventure that neither inspired nor evoked any emotion other than yawning ennui.

												I bought this during the Halloween sale for $9.99 and I gotta say... I kind of wish I hadn't. I got 111 minutes playtime out of it, and that was with exploring everything and leaving absolutely no stone unturned. The game was okay, the eerie atmosphere was okay, the story was okay... But overall left me feeling disappointed. The scariest moment I had whilst playing happened when the lightbulb in the room I was sitting in blew itself out of the fixture in my ceiling (in other words, this game is not scary in the slightest, the wiring in my house however...). It had some good ideas, but just felt a bit lackluster :(			"

												Gone Home does a great job of setting up an eerie atmosphere and then does absolutely nothing to deliver on it. It fairly quickly becomes apparent that the creepiness is meant as a misdirect and all those dark empty rooms hold little more than 90's nostalgia and a coming of age story that borrowed a little too heavily from the typical ""movie of the week"" schtick. Which is an even more apt comparsion considering how little playtime the game offers, because about the length of your average TV movie (minus commercial breaks) is about all you'll get out of this title.Still, I wouldn't go so far as to the game entirely bad. It may be short and predictable, but the time you do spend playing is mostly enjoyable. But not nearly enough to be worth the price. If you enjoy 90's nostalgia and low intensity exploration then wait until they put this game on sale, if you can catch it under $5 it might be worth the investment. Otherwise save your money and time and give this game a pass. "

												Hipster walking simulator/""interactive experience"" with a mildly affecting story that the game poops out on you every so often for doing jack♥♥♥♥♥♥My favourite part is how the whole game is steeped in this horror/mystery atmosphere which the developers have not managed (or even attempted, really) to make gel with the actual type of story the game is telling. There are no twists - it's a story that keeps moving in a straight line when you think it's going to zig or zag - and it almost feels like the horror flavouring is a cheap device to cover up the lack of depth in gameplay and the manner in which the narrative is delivered.The $20 retail price is actually offensive, as a value proposition. Very, very glad I got it for not much in a Steam sale.			"

No, instead we get a story which revolves around a teenage girls love diary. Nothing about this game is form fitting.			"

												Huge spoilers ahead.If you heard that Gone Home is ovverrated and overpriced, well, they told you the truth. The idea is not bad, I kinda liked the 90s look, but Gone Home fails as an art-game. It has not the literary charm of Dear Esther, nor an original concept, like the Stanley parable. It tries to tell a moving story, but I really didn't enjoy it. Maybe it's just me, but come on, a 16 years old girl running away with her girlfriend? That's a terrible thing to happen, and not touching at all! I was irresponsible at that age, everyone is, the ending is plain sad. I don't want to sound like a bigot, but think about it, what will happen to them? If Samantha really cared about Lonnie she would have to just let her go. Because losing your 16 years old girlfriend is not a tragedy at all, and i'm sure everyone can agree with that, unless you're still 16. The story the game tells it's actually realistic, in such a situation the two girls could act like they did in the game, but if you're mature enough, you just can't agree with their decision. That's why I didn't enjoy the story, but looks like there's a lot of people who enjoyed it, and maybe I'm wrong. Who knows.Sorry for my bad english.			"

												Games for a very long time have been about fun, enjoyment, a leisurly pass time that people use to escape the harshness of reality, or to acheive something great and experience something unique to them. Recently, though, a lot of game journalists and critics have started to talk about the need for less violent, less action-heavy, and more original games focusing on things we've never seen in games. As a result, games like Gone Home were created to fill the niche people have been looking for. What should have been (and would have been) bottom-of-the-bin indie story games have since become critically acclaimed classics. I'm not one to bash any game, since the creation of more unique games is never a bad thing, but to praise this game among others in the same genre who did it better, is ridiculous.This game was basically the almagamation of the perfect parts to create a game that appeals to exactly everything critics were looking for at the time; 2 parts visual novel, 1 part taboo story, and 99 parts contrived. The phrase ""oscar-bait"" really comes to mind when I think of Gone Home, almost as if it were a paint-by-numbers on how to create a game critics will love for that year. It delivers nothing we haven't seen already, while delivering it in a way that we've seen more than a handful of times, but it was released at just the right time and played by just the right people to get it major acclaim from journalists and critics, something alot of the other games in this genre didn't get.""Gameplay""Gone Home is an interesting beast in that it delivers all of it's gameplay in a way that we've seen before, and is still not interesting in this format either. There is no gameplay other than picking up letters, cassette tapes, random household items, and keys (to name a few) and observing them or adding them to your inventory to advance the plot. While observing these objects, you can read the text on a note, or rotate the objects to observe all sides a la L.A. Noire, and sometimes find information like lock combinations and secret locations on the map. In that respect, the game does the minimal investigation very well, but then it faulters over it by placing a million objects in the game that serve no purpose. Since the game has no direct way of really determining what is important, it's just as likely that a three ring binder could have valuable information than a book with some information on it. You could spend a lot of time picking things up hoping to get something important only to find out that everything is pointless to interact with, and only a few key elements are there for any real reason.Ultimately, it's a game that lacks any real interaction, and real mechanical substance, and leaves the player feeling as though they're not being engaged and have 0 agency in the game world they're a part of. All of these facts can be a great way to present an interesting story to the player, one they have no control over and have to experience no matter what decisions they make. Sadly, though, the game doesn't take that opportunity and just creates a bunch of hoops the player has to jump through to experience the rest of the narrative. You have to work for the narrative by way of abitrary hoops, but the game hands you the solutions, then you can continue and ""experience"" the rest of the narrative. Had they simply added some challenge, some actual thought, something like piecing together clues instead of just having the clues handed to you, there would be a very interesting mechanic in the game that would have really pushed this closer to being a game than a ""jump through the hoop to advance the plot"" story.Atmosphere and StoryGone Home is something that got stuck between being a movie and being a book. As a movie, it would've been terrible since it has nothing of substance for the person to experience other than seeing the character experience something. As a book, it has very little build up and is nothing more than just reading about someone reading some notes with very little internal dialogue and character devleopment outside of the few audio/text logs given by the sister. It delivers it's narrative in a way very few games have before, but is in such a way that no game (or any narrative) should ever be delievered. The story is presented entirely through narrative set pieces, naration by the sister of the main character, and notes scattered through-out the game. As far as I'm aware, story writing 101 is to not give the entirety of your exposition by way of indirect narrative (i.e. something the audience can't actually see occuring). If the game was you playing as the lesbian sister and seeing all of the consequences and making the choices and experiencing the hardships, this could have been a perfect story, and something we truly had never seen in video game format before.In terms of atmosphere, this is barely at ""visual novel"" levels. It has set pieces and locations that can be interpreted as showing off the mood and personality of different characters. Other than the maybe two or three set pieces that really evoke this emotion, there is very little to help visually tell the story other than creating a set-piece to something mentioned in a note or audio log. Something that really broke the immersion (or lack there of) for me, was the fact that there were a million notes scattered through this house that's supposed to be somewhat realistic. No one has that many notes in their house. It's almost as if the house is just a big collection of ""ooo look, something from a classic movie that realistically makes no sense""! There's trap doors, walls that just seemingly open up for no reason, and a totally stable cavern under the house that also makes little to no sense in reality. The atmosphere of the game is completely broken when you take the few poorly implemented ""gamey"" elements that the game tries to include, and apply them to the serious narrative the game tries to put across.My biggest gripe with this whole game, and the biggest flaw in it, is the fact that it sets up so many possible scenarios and gives a really tense, almost horror-like feeling. A lot of people have attested the feeling of constant tenseness to the feeling the character has when they arrive home to see a life they know very little about anymore. That would be acceptable if the game was invoking a sense of anything other than tenseness/anxiety. Creating a constant tenseness or minor anxiety for the sake of making a narrative point is just annoying, and results in the player feeling mentally exhausted and getting little payoff for it. Ultimately, the game taking an approach that was the exact ending it seemed to be setting out the whole time seems lazy since it doesn't match up with the eery atmosphere the game was evoking the entire timeConclusionWhat it all boils down to is a game that, if it were released any other time, would've been extremely niche, and avoided by a lot of people. It's passable at best, and presents nothing we haven't already seen done better. The atmosphere is confused, the narrative is boring and presented in an extremely unengaging way, and the lack of gameplay leaves the player in an empty ""jump-through-the-hoop"" scenario to just advance the plot to see if anything interesting ever happens. If you're looking for a game that is a visual novel, I'd aim more towards a game like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons or any Telltale game since they deliver in all of the aspects this game fails to (plot progession by more than arguous tasks, real character connection, a feeling of agency, and a real plot that is more than just some ""cute"" dialogue between characters). If you can guess the plot of a story game because you've seen the exact same elements in other mediums, then there is something inherently wrong with calling it the game of the year.			"

												Uhhh, I'm so confused after finishing this game. I don't know if that's really it, or if I missed 80% of what i was supposed to find...(EDIT:12/29 I honestly tried to enjoy this game, it just went in a direction which left me very disappointed. I'm an engineering student, and what that means....is I tend to enjoy solving anything, along with nearly always taking a very logical and ""data gathering"" approach as someone said; that is just the kind of person I am. That being said, if you are also that kind of person.....I can almost gurantee you won't enjoy this game. If you are more ""in touch with your emotions"" I can see how you could enjoy this game...I can also see how you could fall in love with the story, but as a game....I just can't say it's any good. Like I went on to say in the review, it's essentially a short audio clip from youtube...It's a ""cute"", ""good"" little story, but that's where this game decided to go. It never expands, it never dives into all the possibilities they threw in there. It leads you on a very straight forward path ( figuratively ) which you are forced into. This game isn't for me, and I would never recommend someone buying it. END EDIT 12/29)** SPOILERS ** All you do is spend 15-20 min progressing through the story of your little sister, which you can tell 2 minutes (or 5 into the game realistically) how it's going to unfold. You spend all this extra time reading about the past of the house and hearing about how it's haunted. I did have ""1"" light go out as I was walking past it though, super creepy, super sarcasm. Anyways, the story is ""good""...but honestly, if you're over 12....you've probably heard stories like it or have seen tv shows which gloss over the idea of everything. It's very cliche, at least that's how i feel. You can youtube the entire storyline/diary I'm sure if you want to save $8 or however much it costs. Or you can buy Amnesia and play through the same kind of game, but have it be worth it.			"

The end, while it was nice and a well crafted story, left me wanting content it seemed to promise from the start.  That said, I would recommend this title only for people who just want to have a story told to them.  While I love a good story, the lack of puzzles / riddles / anything I enjoy left me wanting more from this title.			"

												Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone this game is twenty dollars.I beat this ""game"" in 90 minutes. Does that sound like it's worth the price? Gone Home has been sitting on my hard rive for more than a year, and today I learn why.I'll start with what I liked, since the experience was more like a template to fill something much larger and far more intriguing. The set design was good, as were the object locations. Strange that I should comment about that, but everything makes sense as to where you find it.On that note, they do a fantastic job of making this house a home. You really understand people live here and their little quirks and habits are present everywhere. The argument between mother and daughter on the cork board was a nice touch.The sound design is also very well done for the atmospheric touch and constantly had me listening to every little bump and creak in as I made my through the house.I can tell this is a character-driven drama and one that takes the writer's heart and soul, so I'd heavily recommend the writer adapt this to a screenplay or short story. A short film would be a much better use of a subject matter that clearly means so much to the designers.Thus it pains to have to say what I'm about to say.This is worth ten dollars, and that's strecthing it. There's NO payoff at the end. The whole time the story is building to something, but the overwhelming majority of all the interesting bits turn out to be mostly red herrings. If I may compare this to Alone in the Dark: the New Nightmare for a second. In that game, there were books worth of story detailing the history of the island, the Morton family, the Abkanis culture and religion, Carnby himself, and even the corrupt Bureau 713. Little of it was actually necessary, but to gain a full understanding and context for the events of the story, you needed to read all of it. In Gone Home, all but one of the characters are dropped, and everyone else had equally interesting stories. The biggest letdown comes about an hour in after you've been expecting a turn to some type of survival horror or even suspense. Instead, I'll give you a nice spoiler I noticed as soon as I started: there is no ""run"" key.I'd probably understand who was who better if I had more frequent exposure to character's faces. Instead, I have to fumble with names, and I'm terrible with names alone. As you traverse the house in a fashion similar to Castlevania but far more contrived (it's called ""padding"" ladies and gents) you'll notice the art style actually changes. Later, you'll stumble upon half-eaten potato chip bags with fresh-lock clips. The clips look like they're from a different game altogether with a notable drop in textures and model detail. One thing that threw me on characters was how portraits and photos supposedly showed the people, but each time it was like a different artist rendition. When you first start the game, go to the left side of the stairs and look at the family portrait. Notice how the girls appear to be in a completely different style from the father?I spent most of my ""investigation"" wrestling with god-forsaken controls. I ended up spinning several times and getting hung up on doors. Navigating becomes a pain when you need to worry about boxes, which are EVERYWHERE. The game flat out tells you when you need to use certain commands in a given room, almost remosing the need for player input. In order to sift through the multitude of ultimately meaningless documents, post cards and notes, you need to select them on the tables or in the drawers. The ""crosshairs"" to do this are so specific, you WILL need to hold the little four-pixel dot in the center of your screen over absolutely everything just to make sure you don't miss anything. The ""Scooby-Doo Effect"" cherished by classic horror fans that told you something was usable is absent, which means opening a drawer does not make it obvious if something is in there you can use or read. You have to 1 be close enough, and 2 carefully move your pointer over every single scrap of paper in the jumbled mess of things in the drawer.That's another thing. When you open a door, cabinet, or drawer, you, the character, can actually block the door from opening all the way, creating the illlusion of a jammed door when all you really need to do is step to the side. And here I thought Slender: the Arrival's click-dragging doors was annoying.There are no puzzles, minimal characters, about a half-dozen dropped side stories, controls that basically fight you with with a combination of OCD and ADHD, and an ending you see coming a mile away. This game is not worth the price tag and I'm happy I got it on sale last year.			"

												I was dissatisfied with my original review of this game, so I deleted it and wrote this as a replacement.I love a good story in a video game. I'm all for LGBT rights; I'm bisexual myself. Gone Home has easily one of the worst stories in a video game I have played to date.The game's two cenrtral characters, Sam(antha) and Lonnie, are completely one-dimensional and Lonnie's sole purpose seems to be being loved while Sam is the lover, and the two both seem to have been created to appease the media and Social Justice Warriors. Disgusting. On top of that, the relationship the two get into is almost too perfect, with barely any tension and only mild interference between their parents and Lonnie leaving to join the military. There's the whole ""Waaaaaah my parents don't support it!"" thing and, again, Lonnie leaving Sam to join the military, which makes Sam sad, but saying that gives the game's love story depth is like saying a kiddie pool can be as deep as the ocean. The mansion you explore is boring and aside from looking for clues left behind by Sam, there's no real point in exploring. You do hear creepy sounds such as creaking or thunder occasionally, but it just seems there to try scaring you. The house remains pretty boring throughout your wandering. To their credit, though, some of the noises did catch me off guard a few times.The game also heavily relies on 1990s nostalgia, being set in 1995; cassette tapes (le only 1990s kids remember dis xDDDDDDDDDD) featuring '90s songs are strewn throughout the house and there's even a Super Nintendo with several games, and Sam mentions Street Fighter II several times in her writings. I'm a '90s kid (born 1993) and didn't feel nostalgic about them at all. Mostly because I still own a lot of these things, I don't need a video game to give me nostalgia over the era I grew up in when I'm perfectly capable of giving myself this nostalgia.Oh, and the ending... one of the biggest disappointments in gaming. Basically, Sam runs away from home so she can be with Lonnie forever after Lonnie goes AWOL, just before she goes to Basic Training. Why? Because they wanted to get away from their families and all their troubles and live a perfect life together or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't even care that this is spoiling it, it's just bad.This game is just garbage and doesn't deserve the praise it gets from the media. One-dimensional characters with artificial development, a boring house and trying to ride on '90s nostalgia. It's just... ugh. Not worth it.			"

												I have heard lots of praise about this game shortly following it's release, it received high reviews and general positivity all around. I decided to ignore all the commentary after that to make sure I had the greatest expereince I could possibly have by preventing myself of reading spoilers and all decussion in general by just ignoring all threads about this game. Has that given me high expectations on the game? Possibly, but I've learned that many of the reviews are extremely mixed on this game. And I can easily understand why.I wont spoil the story since it does have it's positives, so I'll keep it vague. The story itself is extremely well acted and flows well for an indie game, but the game is extremely linear akin to ""Dear Esther"" where there isn't any actual gameplay  other than walking from Point-A to Point-B. It is indeed a very relaxing game that requires little to no player requirements other than being able to listen and pick things up occasionally. The story itself is rather bland with a predictable and cliched plot that you can figure out in the first 20 min that only becomes surprising in the last 15 seconds of the game. And even then it's not too surprising. Many of the ingame items are crafted with an extremely high level of detail and flows well into the scenery of the house. But a few times things are placed in a way that make no sense on a proper timeline and are only there to complement the documents scattered about the house. Often having little to no relevance on the plot as a whole.Is this game bad? No, it's just passable. If you want to sit back, listen to a good (but not great) story for roughly 3 hours of your time. Then go for it, but I can't recommend a price point of anything higher than $5 dollars, which is what I purchased the game at. I still feel slightly burned by the price to enjoyment ratio. But I'll live. The story did have it's good points, it just had too much filler to make it shine. If the game wrapped up it's various plots into one single converging finale this game could be fantastic, but in the end, 90% of the things the game asks you to read are worthless. But that 10% is where the game really shines. It's just a victim of it's own details.			"

												From a technical standpoint, this game was really well made for an indie dev. Good sense of immersion and there are tons of things around the house that let you get a feel for what is going on in the story. However, the story is absolutely terrible. It seems like the story is geared for junior high students oozing angst. The ending was so outlandish that it made suspension of disbelief impossible. The game could have been so much better if they would have focused on one of the family members with actual problems instead of the teenage drama queen who just needs to get over herself. 4/10			"

												Since I didn't feel like a deep game due to my cold, I went for some light gaming earlier. Started & finished Gone Home in a single sitting. Cannot remember a previous time doing this. Game is very short which is not automatically a bad thing, mind you. Easily shorter than 3 hours on a first run. And that by collecting all Journal entries, cassettes, pins and whatnot.So, my thoughts. I went in with pretty much no knowledge of the game beforehand, so the game being a lesbian love-story was not expected. It's a light exploration game with minimal interaction and a focus on passive character development. I do enjoy exploring places and learning about the world via audio logs and texts when done right. This is a mixed bag. First of all, there is too little variation in characters with basically only two people having exposure, Sam, your sister and Lonnie, her love interest. That is a shame since the general cast of people is already very small, less than 10. With only Sam and Lonnie getting spotlight the exploration and adventure portion feels underused. Even though there are tidbits here and there about your parents and the previous home owner, it is just held too superficial with few, unvoiced texts and feels way too overlooked by the writing itself, so it looses any importance it could have had. The love story is done OK with an emphasis on emotions but all other characters besides Sam and Lonnie are done without any emotion at all which makes them look like robots. A real shame since slowly seeing more and more of the house would have fit very nicely by weaving various character arcs into the layout of the home. On that, the many secret passages became a real immersion breaker not by the idea itself - which fits an old, big manor with an interesting previous owner - but by sheer amount and usage. They just got away with it bearing in mind the previous owner but then again, like with other stuff it falters by underutilizing that as well. A little side story about the past owner would have been fitting. But alas, the house feels not enough like a real home but like a playground for Sam & Lonnie who only used those places. It almost feels like neither parents nor the bigger sister are a part of the house at all.Journal entries (audio logs) were done OK. It's a very little story, written OK as well. Couldn't connect towards the very ending, thinking two kids basically ran away. They are only seventeen. Feels like writers took a very cliche easy way out with the ending by making it overtly emotional with that runaway. A little inconsistency in logic with Sam was also there. At the beginning she writes her sister not to rummage around (and possibly learn anything) but towards the end she explicitly has left her messages in places only accessible by turning over the whole house? Eh, gotta throw a bit of sense out of the window to have emotional ending I guess. That goes for the whole very short game. High on emotion, at times feels forced by sheer lack of any other aspect. Not sure I'd recommend this. It offers very little in substance and variety. If you can overlook the narrow focus and at times forced story events, you will have some fun exploring the big house and basking in 90s nostalgia though. Wish there was a neutral option on Steam reviews.			"

												I am at odds with this game. I went into this, not knowing what it was about really. On the one hand, it challenged my gaming expectations, the conventions in games that I have become accustomed to. It led me to believe something horrific would occur at one moment or another and sent chills down my spine as I expected a physical oppossing force to stand in my way. If I'm to be honest, I feel this would be more suited to the medium of cinema than videgames as it's story turns out to be (SPOILER ALERT) a coming-of-age tale about the main character's (the player's) sister who discovers her sexuality. I found it's story somewhat pretentious and cheesy at times, feeling contrived and almost adolescent in it's attempts to tell a ""deep"" story. Once the finale reveals all, I had mixed feelings. I felt somewhat relieved, knowing that Sam (the main character's sister) was alive, I felt slighlty frustrated realising the implied JFK time-travel angle was nothing more than a writer's ideas and that the paronormal element would never be explored despite supernatural occurences being firmly implied and their aftermath shown in parts of the game.This is a game that felt far too pasive to be considered a videogame (by the scientific definition) and what I find worse still, is how everything you investigate throughout the 2 hour experience is all retrospective, there is never an impactful action by your character. That is to say, you never ever have any bearing on the story, as you are merely discovering what has already transpired. I felt relieved that this was not a horror game. I was intrigued with how it toyed with what I, as a gamer, am used to experiencing and expecting (generally negative things, like bad guy will show up or a ghost will attack etc.) but somewhat frustrated by it's pretention, trying to be a game deeper than a game.If you want a deep story in a videogame (that is actually a videogame as opposed to an interactive museum), play a ""Metal Gear Solid"", ""Red Dead Redemption"", ""Heavy Rain"" or ""The Last of Us"". If you want a far more fun ""game"" that pokes holes at gaming conventions and points out how gamers think etc., go play ""The Stanley Parable"" which uses humour rather than pretentious misdirection to show just how predictable gamers expectations can be.

												Well, I am not usually the one to write bad reviews for anything. Unless, the product or service is blantantly horrible. That being said: I bought Gone Home with the intention of feeling a story that would in the end leave me - philosophically and psychologically - fulfilled. My verdict: The game did not do much for me. The music is atomospheric and reminiscing, besides that I don't really have anything good to say about this game. In short, the game builds up to a very weak climax while attempting - and failing - to look nostalgic.			"

												Saw the trailer while it was in development and got pretty excited for it. I finally got a chance to purchase it and dove in knowing that it would be a short, but hopefully entertaining, ride. Unfortunatly by the end of the game I felt pretty disappointed all around. The atmosphere was probably the most interesting point of the game, sadly it was not used to it's full potential. Story was a bit cliché and there was virtually no interesting gameplay.			"

												This review contains no spoilers.The tags on this should have warned you from the beginning, but just in case: this is not a game, it's another ""walk around and explore everything, eventually leading to a conclusion"" type of experience. Gone Home has a main story that unfolds in linear fashion as you explore the surroundings, and also a lot of background detail that tells you more about these people you never interact with. All the characters actually have quite a bit of backstory, not just the one the story focuses on, and it's easy to miss all the little hints and clues that tell you everything there is to know about this world, so it's not quite as linear as your movements.However, that still doesn't mean it's worth $20 at full price; there's just not enough substance to justify it. At $4 on sale, you could go for it if you really like these kinds of harmless, non-twitchy explore type interactive experiences. If you're open to it, and you like thinking about fictional people and what their lives could be like, well, you might even get your money's worth. The hard decision for me is whether I recommend it, and I'll have to go with ""no"". It's not terrible by any means, it's a charming little slice of life experience, but it's awfully short, and the emotional and narrative payoff is really too paltry. If I'd read this as a story or watched it as a TV show, I wouldn't have walked away satisfied, and dressing it up as a game doesn't change that.			"

												Gone Home is an unconventional story exploration adventure gameThe story takes place in 1995. You play as Kaitlin, a student returning home from world travels to see her family, but nobody is at home. You walk around your empty home, in first-person exploration style and you have to find objects that uncover bits of your family's past.The actual gameplay consists mainly of exploring an environment and checking out every item available. The game is also very short, it can be finished under 3 hours.The graphics are not the greatest, though they get the job done.Gone Home takes place in 1995 and the sound reflects that. Strewn around the house are cassettes with typical mid-nineties rock on them. Taking into account the main topic of the game, the selected song are very appropriate. There are also some ambient tunes which are there to highlight certain events and plot points. A nicely done effect is that the ever present thunderstorm raging on outside constantly accompanies the game's protagonist throughout the house, sounding louder or softer depending on her location. Gone Home also features some good voice acting.I can not recommend Gone Home, the story is not interesting, it is too short and it is also boring. The sound is the only enjoyable thing in the game.If you are searching for good story exploration games, you should take a look at Dear Esther or The Stanley Parable.Sounds 7/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 1/10Atmosphere 4/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Personally, I thought this game was a little creepy.  Empty house, creepy  hidden basement, etc etc etc.  You find out more info as you proceed on with the story, but not sure it was worth the time.  Try Life is Strange instead.  It's a much better game w/ a female protagonist.			"

												Gone home is an interesting concept that grabbed a lot of headlines. If I'm to be frank,it's way overrated. This is not to say the game is bad, it accomplishes what it sets out to do quite well, but there is very little mechanics to speak of.Now, I do realize that this is what some would call a narrative focused game, and that's a fair statement, but it's $20 for less than an hour of gameplay. There is also no incentive to revisit, no extra play modes, and simply speaking from a value stand point, Gone Home is not worth it's full asking price.The lack of mechanics is not what I dislike about the game, I have no issues with games that is narrative driven, my biggest issue is that it's simply asking for too much for too little. It's not even as long as a movie, hell it might not be as long as an episode of your favorite show, yet it cost more than a movie ticket to an IMAX showing.I feel Gone Home came out during a time where indie darlings were still some thing special, and those who raised it so high on a pedestal only saw the superficial value of Gone Home and never considered consumer value in it's praise.Gone home is ONLY for the most curious, or at a heavily discounted price.

												If you already know the reveal of what makes this game ""different"" from others then you already know about the weakest part of the story.  I did not care about her trials and issues growing up.  Not at all.  She was well written for a whiny confused teenager, something I have no interest in.I was far more interested in the entire rest of the family.  Extended too.  They all had much darker histories and issues to deal with, and because the main narrative voice is a teenager, she's themed around not noticing anything but her own problems which makes her even more annoying.  The game needed more focus on them and less on the weak coming of age tell thrust into the 90s.Also it was strangely convenient that all of the doors in this house were locked in a sequence that forced you to read everyone's diaries almost exactly sequentially ordered.Well done visual novel/game ruined by the main narrative voice being the least interesting character.

												If you need a demonstration as to why you should ignore metacritic ratings and stick with individual reviewers who you've found helpful in the past, then Gone Home will give you that.  It would seem that interactive stories are a difficult genre, but as a base you have to have a story that's really worth telling.  Gone Home really does not manage this.  Without giving too much away (really, there's not that much *to* give away), it's rather mundane, somewhat angst-ridden and extremely short.  Some of the story (and the other side-stories) are told via various notes left around the house you're exploring whilst a large chunk of it gets told via letters to your character that are unsent.  As a plot-revealing mechanism, it works well, but it's let down by the rather shortcomings in the actual tale being told and by the side-stories lacking any depth.Graphically, its fine, if nothing amazing and sound effects are appropriate and reasonably well done.  Many will find the music in the game a little inaccessible - it's riot grrrl stuff which, whilst having meaning in terms of the characters, was never great music.  Thankfully most of this can only be heard through cassettes that are found through the house and can be switched off as quick as they're put on.It's not bad and its not good, Gone Home is officially in the 'meh' category.  This would be fine if the game was priced at 10-20% of the price that it's at now, but at £15 a throw, avoid like the plague.  If you're a Linux user, you may want to also note that it's a Unity engine port that was, for me, full of hang-ups, crashes and general mouse craziness.  Take away the time I spent getting it to work acceptably and the game took me a little over an hour to complete fully.			"

												Note: I want this review to be as helpful as possible. If you have something to say that would help me improve it, please make a comment.Summary:It's a game about exploration, in a very non-standard way. In fact, it is only a game because there is some interaction, with minimal thinking required to go forward. You are back to your house after a long time being abroad, but nobody's home. Gameplay:The gameplay consists of looking for clues about what happened to your family, and the game succeeds partially by being able to tell a story using bits of text, pictures, and audio diaries from the main character's sister.  The fun part about the gameplay is exploring the house and discovering each family member's story, and there are several items and songs to discover in the house that will appeal to people who, like me, have lived as a teenager in the 90's.Story:The game kept me wondering what happened to the family, why there was nobody home. Due to some elements in the game (sound, music) and in the story that had something to do with the supernatural, I kept thinking something very cool and surprising would appear at the end. Some people will relate to the drama that is being told in this game, but to me the story was not interesting enough and  there was no surprise at the end . I will describe most of what happens in the story below: The story is focused on your character's younger sister, who is a teenager, her conflicts as a  lesbian and her adventures with her girlfriend. You also learn about their father's problems as a writer to get published, among other problems that everyone has. The only character that gets a voice is her sister, and even though the lesbian subject could lead to some interesting plot twists, all you get is a final message in the end from the younger sister, and that's it. Nothing really amazing happens, no one dies, nothing supernatural or even extraordinary. So I felt that the game was a wasted potential due to the lack of a great story to tell. For your reference, I am a very experienced player, and a fan of Interactive Fiction games, with or without graphics, as well as Point'n'Click games in general. So yes, I like playing games that are more about the story than the gameplay, and this one disappoints because there is not enough drama, only a regular soap opera story.SoundThe sound effects are really good, and the soundtrack is amazing. In fact, I recommend buying the soundtrack for this game if you can!ValueI got this from a bundle, so it was not a big deal. If you are like me and, despite negative reviews, want to see this for yourself, get it on a sale but be aware that you might be disappointed with the fact that the game promises too much, and gives too little. As a side note, you'd spend your time and money better playing games like ""The Novelist"" and ""Richard and Alice"", where you are actually given interesting characters and both are also about real life dramas, and both actually make you think about life and the choices we make.

												I have not simply not reccomended because I don't think it is a game. As a matter of fact, I love ""The Stanley Parable"", and many claim that that game is not a game as well. However, the reason I disliked this game is because of the massive build-up and pretty much no payoff at the end. The game introduces tons of creative ideas and tons of things that you have to figure out by yourself. However, none of it is ever explained in any way. For example (spoilers),the kids at Sam's school have all this strange talk about the house they moved into and they call it ""The Psycho House"". Eventually, we assume it is because of the previous owner of the house, who happened to be a bit crazy. However, although this mystery is really compelling, it never fully gets explained and instead focuses on Sam's story, which, to tell the truth, wasn't even close to as compelling. Honestly, as I went through the game, I got more wrapped up in the Dad's story than in Sam's story just because Sam's story is just really stereotypical and something we have all heard before in a basic love story.Even though the characters in the relationship were both girls, it honestly didn't matter. The story would be the exact same except for some minor changes in the journal entry in which her parents find out about the relationship. As for the gameplay, I did enjoy looking around the house and trying to discover the mystery of why the family members left and about the previous owner of the house, but the only story that wasn't compelling was the character whose story was focused on the most. However, at this point, I still felt that Sam's story could be really interestingwhen I heard she was going to wait in the attic for Lonnie to return and I started to think that we would find Sam dead. It might have been a cliche, but it would have at least gave me something to think about. At this point, I finally felt that the payoff was going to happen, as I finally saw a twist that I could never have seen coming and was about to sing the praises of how good the game was and how it manages to make me think for at least just a bit. However, it completely psyches you out and delivers a stereotypical ending that leaves more questions about the story and let me down completely. Yes, it was a twist, and yes, I didn't expect, but that doesn't make it a good twist. It would be like if during ""Jurassic Park"", instead of the T-Rex making the water ripple, it was a giant clown. Yes, I didn't see it coming, but that doesn't make it good.Overall, the game was fun when you were collecting things at the beginning and for stories such as the Dad's story, but the game never risks anything and simply delivers a basic love story that was not that interesting to do.Also, I forgot to mention: I beat this game, explored a bit after winning to find the logs I missed, and only missed 1 audio log in total, all in 88 minutes. That means I can essentially beat this game 100% in probably a little more than 1 hour and 30 minutes without a walkthrough to find the other audio logs. All in all, 2.5 out of ten.Afterward: People gave this game a perfect score, and some even gave it a ""Game of the Year"" award. It just goes to show that critics arn't always right, and while you should consider the opinion of a critic, don't base your interest in a game on that only.			"

												Turn on all the lights, if you don't turn on every light switch you will never know what happened. It's that good.This is one of the most overrated games of recent time. Just because a game is controversial and nostalgic doesn't make it stand on its own. If it was released as a free project, then I would think this was an achievement. So many people praise games and movies when they do something out of the ""norm"" in the story or otherwise. But why do people consistently do it. Its like people who claim they listen only to indie music because it makes them special. But really all they do is hang out with other ""indie"" people and hate on those who don't understand them. So much for being independant.This game has great voice recordings, the texturing and the modeling are also good. I found my self smiling and almost giggling with memories as I went through the house for the first 5 minutes. But after that, I lost it. I found my self just needing to complete the predictable game just becuase I had heard it was short and I figured I might as well see the whole thing. One thing that really bothered me is that even though it is supposed to be an open exploration game, it is extremely linear, so much so that it takes away from the whole point. How am I supposed to feel like I am exploring a house, when I have to unlock sections of the house by completing certain ""find the key"" sections of the game. And to explain why this was such a bother was because so many of the plot developments (notes) about the family progress in a chronological manner over a year, in notes that are already in the correct order as you find them. Why are notes that are more recent near the end of the game, and notes that start at the beggining of the chronology are found at the beggining sections of the house? Did the mom live in the closet during the 6 month mark and then move a month later to the kitchen so she could leave behind another piece of paper. I know there needs to be a fine line of guiding the player, but I felt the devs missed it. I understand why to an extent, but at the same time It didn't take me long before I figured out I was being spoon fed a story in a faux-exploration manner.All though this game was short, it was a time consuming very short story that overstayed its welcome.I would say go though this game once because some of the few 90s references are great for anyone who grew up during that time. But it is not as great as people say it is. The house is huge, but just feels empty, and I don't mean devoid of people, just that it feels lifeless by itself. Everything feels structured in its layout and there are not that many props, just a few striking 90s references, and then a bunch of light switches, toilet paper, towels, and coffee cups. In so many ways this ""coming home"" experience could have felt more powerful. This game can't survive on the narration of a journal for the whole 15min total of narration for almost 2 hours of walking from lifeless room to lifeless room. Maybe I'm spoiled, I just finished the Vanishing of Ethan Carter and I had my self pouring over every item I found, all the while being emotionally touched by the way the story actually came together in my mind alongside the actual plot, and not just as the naration dictated. In this game I got tired of hearing the whiny sister talk and explain while I looked at glass coasters with a fern on it. Thing was I never felt like I was involved in this game, and the character you play seems just as distant. There are so many better ways to tell a story and create a depth of feelings the player can sense in the visual medium of video games, other than to just put a bunch of objects in front of me and then tell me about the objects as I chronologically come across them.Nostalgia: + (for about 5 minutes but somethings are really cool, like the inclusion of magic eye papers)Voice Recording: + (even though the subject annoyed me like someone elses slowly released fart in a small room, to me it was still very tenderly and emotionally delivered)Atmosphere and Sounds: ~ (okay, but mostly bad, good lighting, the house is lifeless though and doesn't feel like anyone could ever be home even if the game put them in there, and the thunder claps seemed really off and badly recorded.)Story: - (bland, slightly intriging for a second, and then it turns into, walk here, unlock this, walk there, while narration complains and explains)Gameplay: - (It's hard to have an exploration game where exploration really matters if I have to go through the story in chronological sections anyways, I never felt like I was figuring anything out)The only thing that made this game worth it to me was flipping the cassete case around, and around, and around, and around.  It's mesmerizing. But not worth it enough to gain a thumbs up. Give it a shot, but do not under any circumstances pay any more than 2 bucks for it.  Try and get it in a bundle.			"

Posted: December 15, 2016
												So I've been thinking for a while on how I feel about this game, and honestly my answer is just kind of...meh.I mean, what I like about it most is the gameplay itself.  This sort of going around, gradually uncovering a story and some mysteries, that's something I love in a game.  I love it when the world itself is interactive.  It's introspective, it's got just the right amount of cookie crumbs in the trail of plot discovery.  I'll probably replay it some time to see if I missed anything.  The main problem I have is that it wasn't what it was advertised to be.  It was spun as a horror game, something seriously and deliciously spooky, with a romantic side plot.  But as I played the game, I realized the ""spookiness"" wasn't really anywhere to be found, and what had originally been made to seem as a *side* plot, was really the *main* plot.  It had set me up as expecting something entirely different to be focused on, and that just sort of soured the milk when I got to the real ending.  Where are the ghosts?  Why are there so many spooky passages and whatnot in the house?  All the threads I wanted to be tied up were left unravelled, and the one I really wasn't emotionally invested in was the only one that got resolved.But maybe that's just me.  Regardless, I really don't think it's worth the price.  Luckily for me, I got it on sale, and if you'd like to play a cute little walking sim with some nicely fleshed out teen romance, I suggest you do the same.  But as it stands, I really don't feel comfortable recommending something incorrectly advertised at such a steep price.			"

												Gone Home, otherwise known as - Gone Home To My Gay Sister's Boring House in TexasI have to post this because this game just won VGX's best PC game award and it has such great reviews and I can't understand why. It's hugely overpriced for a game which is literally an hour long. Don't even wait until this game is cheaper to buy it, just don't buy it.The story was really dreadful, you know what's going to happen after you read the third letter and then the rest of the game seems to just drag it out for as long as possible. It's just ""person falls in love with person"" and nothing else happens, wow such depth. I have had more fun pooping than I have had experiencing the 'story' in this game. And yes, the story is important in this game, because mainly what you do is explore the house to find objects which, once examined, give you another letter which tells you more of the story. There isn't much more of an aim than that, apart from just picking up objects and examining them, which usually I find is a fun mechanic in most games but in this game it just wasn't.I think they like to think that including lesbians in the story makes it deeper than it actually is, and  they try to use that to detract from the deeply uninspired and boring story, which I think is pretty offensive. How about writing a decent story about lesbians instead? Maybe they actually deserve decent representation instead of this absolute trash half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt.The rest of the house serves as 90s nostalgia which is only interesting to Americans who were teenagers in 1995, and it just feels like it buys into the whole 'nostalgia sells' thing that's going on right now because for some strange reason people like looking back at things and claiming they were better than they really were. Which is how this game is, everyone is claiming it is better than it actually is. What is with all the positive reviews? Even giantbomb gave it a good review and I thought that usually they don't give terrible games 5/5. I mean in that review the writer literally praises it because you don't have a gun in the game. What a ♥♥♥♥ing nonce.Also, you can't jump, you press space and nothing happens and knowing you cant jump is like being robbed of my own physical legs irl and there are no mirrors in the entire house. wtf sort of house has no mirrors? ♥♥♥♥ me i'm out 2/10 at best			"

												Interesting idea but too passive and story has no payoff.  Pretends to be tense and dark at the start but ends up disappointing.  Gameplay is not existent except walking from room to room and listening to the story which was not great (although started off seeming that it would be).  I should have listened to the other reviewers, glad I only spent 10 dollars. I found it not nearly as good as Ethan Carter.  5/10.			"

												i felt i was playing a different game to the one everyone was raving about. this game was a HUGE let down. i completed it in under 2 hours. the story is awful. the voice acting was embarrassingly cliched. the environment isn't very interactive and close to boring. the story made me very annoyed as there was no mystery, horror surprise elements. if the reviewers out there had been more clear on the content (it's a game for confused teenagers, not adults) then I would never have bought it.

												So...finished this 'game'. I found it more of a tour through a house stuck in the 90's. Had a lot of build up - stormy weather, no one home, TV's broadcasting a warning of a current storm in the area ... But this is not a horror game, it's not even a puzzle game really.To sum it up...if you want to read through a young girls' diary and about her likes, dislikes, and relationships with friends and family than go ahead and pick it up.It was not what I thought it'd be and I'm still confused at it's extremely high critic reviews. To each their own, nice atmosphere but I just can't recommend 'Gone Home' for it's price and awkward stalking of 'my' sisters journal.			"

												As many have said, the game is only about an hour long. It isn't a game, more of an interactive story, which isn't a bad thing. I found that as I progressed through the story, it built up tension very well. I wasn't entirely sure of the next thing that would happen, and the story was portraied in a very light hearted manner.Is it a good story overall? Yes I think so, Would I recommend it to a friend? Unfortunatly, No. I feel as if there could have been more development and exposition related to the family members.  However, the story it does tell is very well written and interesting, and also touches on a taboo subject, especially during the time it is set.			"

												Summary: Your sister runs off with her girlfriend to live happily ever after. Your parents are off on a couples retreat to try to save their marriage. You arrive at your empty home and spend the next hour or so in a last gen rendered building reading notes, finding secret doors and listening to tapes of the worst music ever made. There is no 'payoff' to this 'game'. You spend the game trying to solve the mystery of what is in the attic. The answer: a note saying that your sister ran off with her girlfriend to live happily ever after. It's a glorified tech demo for an old game engine with a theme that makes people want to recommend it more than it deserves.			"

												Got this game as part of a bundle, finally decided to dedicate some time to sit down and play it. I thought it was going to be some sort of mystery/puzzle game, which I suppose was partly true. Though the mystery of ""Where is everyone?"" is never actually solved. You venture through the house, find a few trinkets, which leads to more trinkets, then in a bit over an hour or so, the game is over. No story climax really to speak of, it just ends after you pick up yet another trinket. Quite disappointing, to be honest.			"

												This isn't a game for everyone.If you go into it expecting something viscerally exciting like the Amnesia series, or something quickly-paced like Heavy Rain, you're going to be disappointed. Gone Home is the latest example of games being more than their gameplay. You won't run from monsters, lose your sanity, or track down a serial killer, but you will become immersed in a surprisingly believable, very human tale.Without spoiling too much of the plot, I will say that Gone Home is the definition of a ""coming-of-age"" story. It's about having the courage (or recklessness, depending on how you view the plot's conclusion) to follow your own judgment, and the story itself is very well-written.You play Katie Greenbriar, a young woman just returned from a European trip, who finds her family's Oregon mansion completely deserted. The main plot involves finding out what happened to your younger sister Sam, who tells her own story via a series of voiceovers throughout the game. You wander through the house, interacting with various items (papers are especially important) to trigger the next voiceover. Along the way, additional items tell other stories: about your parents, your extended family, and the house's previous owner. New paths open up around the house as you collect keys, find secret passages, and acquire the combinations to your family's locked containers.The voiceovers themselves are well done. The voice acting is a match for the script (a rare feat, especially indie games), and its content is poignant without being pretentious. I applaud The Fullbright Company for representation of queer characters that isn't gimmicky. Chris Remo's score is wonderful, especially the track that accompanies the voiceovers. The game also features music by Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy.Some critiques: mostly these relate to things I know the dev team had no control over. It's not the prettiest game you've ever seen, but given that it was made with Unity, it's not terrible. There's also no player marker on the pause-menu map. The section of the house you're in is highlighted, but at a couple of points it's hard to tell where exactly in the house you are.Some people are going to knock the lack of action in this game, but I personally think that's a bit shortsighted. Some games are like action movies. This game is more like a book. It's the clearest example I've ever played of video games as a legitimate story-telling medium, and it does so without additional gameplay elements to shore it up on a technical level. It takes some serious gumption to hang your hat on only the story a game presents. That just isn't done, not even in story-driven games like the Mass Effect series. And Gone Home does it well.			"

												Great concept, but horrible execution. As a gamer who prefers great story, atmosphere, and/or characters to gunplay, Gone Home caught my attention for precisely that: making gameplay as bare-bones as possible to make you focus on what was happening in the story instead of what was attacking you. The downside to this approach is the story must step up to the plate and be great to compensate for the lack of combat. And that is where Gone Home falls flat on its face. It initially sets itself up as a kind of murder mystery, since you come to your house, alone, with no one there at all during a storm. The reason no one is there is just poor timing on the player character's part, so that mystery is a bit of a let down. Beneath that, there's uncovering the family dynamic and secrets that have been accumulating since you left. And, quite frankly, that's almost as boring as why everyone was gone. Finding the clues is exciting at first, but that's nothing but a sense of achievement speaking. The clues themselves paint a picture based on stereotypes we've all heard a dozen times before in books, TV, movies, and every other medium out there. One voice throughout tries to make it better by adding emotion to it all, but trying and doing can be two very different things. Overall, very disappointed and very confused as to why this did so well critically.			"

												Gone Home is an interactive story in which you arrive home to an empty house, piecing together why no one is home. This is done through reading notes and signs, as well as picking up objects which trigger narrations of a character's diary log in the days leading up to your arrival.The story itself is incredibly generic and feels forced; combined with its absurdly low length (My first playthrough lasted just under two hours) it is a wonder that it garnered so many awards.

I did not find a secret entrance to an underground lab. Perhaps Chris and Jill already sealed it up.			"

												Gone Home is a 3D Adventure that plays like a “Figure out what happened” mission in an Elder Scrolls game. It involves walking down corridors and picking up badly hidden evidence of your family’s struggles along the way. Equal parts charming and clumsy, the story is brought down by an ending so cliché that it feels like a low-tier RomCom. It’s worth copping if you can find it for dirt cheap and you’re into these kind of “railroaded detective” missions, but it’s hard to justify ever buying it in a world where games like Morrowind exist for the same price.

It's extremely boring story of extremely boring people, who have clearly a lot of money and time on their hand but aren't able to do anything interesting with it. Grey, empty, boring lives. Like an average family. Who you don't wish to know if you aren't as pathetic as them.It's misleading game, misleading presentation. There is no tension or suspence. You'll be searching for another piece of dirty laundry for the whole hour. Environmental storytelling? You just read notes, Silent Hill 2 has light years better environmental storytelling.And oh god don't put this music tapes into cassette player, it'll destroy your ears.It's not drama about gender relations. Devs definitely don't know a single thing about gay people (and seems like relationships at whole) and clearly did this because gay issues is topic of the day. Main story is full blown cliche, where boy was swapped with girl.If you are from US and grew up in 90's, you'll probably enjoy references, but if you are not - freaking avoid. It's overrated overhyped pretentious trash. Thank god it's only hour and a half long. If you like good story and enjoyed Dear Ester or Stanly Parable - freaking avoid like an ebola.			"

It's sappy, vapid, and as emotionally deep as a pen cap.What's especially ironic is the main character's father in the game is taking a reaming from his own father as well as from his employer for being a terrible author; it's almost like the author of this game's love story is mirroring his own failures as an author through the game's father's subplot, which you (the player) glean from conspicuously dropped letters all over the house that end up being 100% irrelevant to the boring love story.The climax of the love story you can see coming from a mile away. There's nothing to surprise you at all in this game.I wouldn't even recommend this to lesbians who experienced young love; chances are your own stories are so much deeper and more multifaceted than this laughable excuse for a drama.

												Based on MY experience and opinion;I finished it in 2 hours completely. No puzzles, nothing excited, little to none story line. Even though I bought it in discount (thank god for that) in my opinion it did not even worth 5 Euro I spent on it. I could respect it more if it was longer & cheaper. I love & support indie games, but not this time.			"

												I really disliked this game. If you want a game full of super basic puzzles, a mediocre story (that has nothing to do with your character), and no resolution, by all means pay money for this time waster. My only consolation is that I got this game for very cheap, otherwise I would've been even angrier. There's also absolutely zero replayability. Once you know the end, the game can literally be solved in under a minute. There's nothing special about this one, just skip it and find something better.			"

												I was quite intrested to try this out as it looked very promising. Unfortunately the plot quickly became very predictable and straightforward, which is a shame because I felt there was so much more to cover in this family's story. The environment was quite nicely made, though occasionally lacked detail.  What's up with the constant ring binders??  Definitely not worth £14.99, as the main story is quite short and bland (though I spent quite a lot of time exploring the backstory, which apparently was useless after all...). Luckily I bought this from sale and I would recommend for others to do so as well. Such a shame, the story could have been much more deeper which would have definitely added more value to the game.

It was really good and the story was good but it was like an hour long? and that was with me going slowly... i bet you can finish this game in like 20 minutes or less. Not worth the money you dont do anything really apart from walk around the graphics are nice the story lacks a lot i really wish i never spent my money on this.			"

Played most adventures under the sun and enjoyed most of them. However this game is awful I feel ripped off and conned. I completed the game and thought it was dreadful - boring storyline - characters you don't care about.Ive had more fun staring at a fire for 1 hour then this ! Don't buy it !!!!			"

												I really don't get this game. It's had stunning reviews and amazing critical reception and yet I just really dislike it. I normally like story based games such as the Stanley Parable and The Walking Dead too! The story is bland and generic in my opinion and the system performance isn't amazing.Also, normally I'm fine with short games being priced highly (for an indie game) if the experience is great (e.g the Stanley Parable) but this is way overpriced. I bought it in the sale for £3.69 or something but for £15 it really isn't worth it.. I only got an hour out of it.I'm sorry but I cannot reccomend this.			"

												Grossly overrated.  This is easily one of the worst games I have ever played.But it didn't have to be like this.  Gone Home certainly constructs an interesting premise.  You're exploring the house your family moved into while you were ""studying"" in Amsterdam for a year.  No one else is here, so it's up to you to try and figure out what your family has been up to for the last year, and why everyone is gone.And the short answer is [SPOILER ALERT] nothing particularly interesting.You uncover the story by examining every loose object you find.  The vast majority of these have no use or meaning to them (how many times have I seen this 3-ring binder?), but some are essential for understanding what little plot the game has.  The fact that you can pick up and examine so many objects is certainly impressive, but it adds little or nothing to the actual game.  Some objects will trigger a telepathic message from your sisters diary, which is how much of the games plot is delivered to you.  Unfortunately, a lot of these items are miss-able, some very easily, so it's possible you'll finish the game with a few holes in the narrative.There are certainly threads that suggest something interesting.  The game hints at the possibility that some malevolent force is present, but in the end it just turns out that normal teenage girl drama is the primary cause of your families unexpected absence.  It's kind of a downer, since the game does a pretty good job of building a genuinely haunting atmosphere, but decides to waste it on something so mundane and normal.  Imagine playing SIlent Hill 2, but the only ending the game has is the joke ending with the dog at the control panel.  Well, that's what the endgame of Gone Home feels like; the joke ending of a much better game.A lot has been made of the developers previous experience on titles in the Bioshock series, and the influence is there.  One of the most interesting parts of the first two games was exploring the ruins of an experimental civilization, collecting clues (mostly audio-logs) that would help you understand the events surrounding it's downfall.  Gone Home works similarly, but while Bioshock used this idea as a fun side objective, Gone Home tries to build a full game around it, which results in making the entire experience somewhat underwhelming.Parts of the story don't even make sense.  The game ends when you find your sisters diary, which she been writing with the intention of having you read.  Since she knows you'll be home soon, she decides to leave it in the the most obvious place; the attic.Except she never tells you it's in the attic.  Also, the attic is locked.OK, so you got to find the key.  Where is it?  It's in the secret room that only your sister and her friend know about!But don't worry!  There's a map showing the location of this room.  The only problem is that it's on the far east side of the house, and that half of the house sits behind a locked door!Thankfully, you can also get to the east side of the house by way of a secret passage in the basement.  SURPRISE!  The door to the basement is also locked.Which means we'll need the key to the basement.  You're sister left that in her room... inside a locker...Oh, but you can open the locker.  You just need the combination!  It's on a piece of paper that's been ripped in half, and both pieces are hidden behind wall panels.It would seem your sister, who says she had no time to explain her sudden disappearance, found plenty of time to construct one of gaming's most pointlessly elaborate scavenger hunts.The layout of the house doesn't even make sense.  When you compare the maps of the first and second floors, it becomes obvious that the second floor isn't being supported by anything below it (save for one of the secret passages).  I know this is a really small thing to bring up, but it kind of killed what little imersion I had.Gone Home's aethetics are incredibly bland.  The models and textures scream 'first year CG Art student', but the use of light and shadows are certainly impressive.  The music largely consists of 90s riot grrl acts, a genre that relied on half-baked messages of social rebellion to make up for obvious lack of musical skill.Gone Home is the Emperors New Clothes of video games.  It seems like every game critic on the planet is tripping over each other trying to shower this thing with praise, lest they be considered too ignorant to understand the games brilliance.  The Emperor is naked, and Gone Home amounts to little more than an audio book of a badly writen young adult novel tied to a walking simulator.  The only emotion I felt at it's conclusion was the incredible sadness of having lost $20 on a game that barely lasted two hours.  If you're geniunly curious about this trainwreck, wait for a Steam sale or a Humble Bundle. 3/10			"

												Honestly I'm not sure if I would want to mark this as recommended or not. Considering I would not personally tell my friends to play it I'm going to vote ""No"" but it's by no means a poorly created game, just not a game I would recommend.The game is an interactive story-telling experience. You get to wander the house, find secrets, learn about the history of the family, and the entire time learn about your little sister and her high school experience. The entire time you hear noises in the house, the clasp of thunder, voices from nowhere, the moving of tables/chairs, and so much more. You would expect at one point for a jump scare to happen as the ambiance is set up very well. I was a little disappointed nothing happened but I can't say I expected anything.I guess my chief issue is the story seemed like it would appeal to a younger audience and I really shouldn't have been playing it in the first place. So if you're a teenager who is having trouble with authority and want someone to relate to, then pick this game up! Otherwise, you're better off letting this one by. Sadly I felt like I was strung along waiting for a plot twist that never happened. I mean... in this game they talk about ghosts and hauntings for the first chunk of it, the family leaving on various trips, the ""psycho brother"" losing all contact with the sister he loved and locking everything away, a grandfather who showed two-faced approval for his author son... and yet the entire time none of this was relevent to the story at all. You find out that the house is apparently haunted but that doesn't mean anything... YOU EVEN FIND A PENTAGRAM THAT MEANS NOTHING.I will deem this game ""teenage angst simulator"" or ""no one understands me: The Game""			"

												Spoilers possible.  With that said I thought this game would be cool.  I don't remember what I payed for it, but whatever I paid it was too much.  It's way too short, and I predicted the end very early on.  They should have made the house haunted or have the power go off at least.  What I did like was the 90's nostalgia.  I grew up in that decade so it was pretty cool taking a tour, and it did bring back memories of that time period for me.  It was just boring to me.  Not worth a playthru at least in my opinion.  They had the atmosphere going for them, and threw it away on a love story that didn't make me feel anything for the characters involved.  The music was pretty good.  You can pick up just about anything in the house and throw it on the ground.  Turn on every light and then back off again.  Find secret passages and walk around.  When it ended I was very disappointed, and felt very ripped off.  5/10 "

												Walking Simulator for most appropriate tag 2015. The entire house is there just for atmosphere, there are about 6 progress-inducing actions in-game, unlocking a new part of the house.Also dear lord this took far too long for a story that could be recapped in two minutes. With just continuous whining from the rebellious teen that's not understood by her parents. And it deals with such groooown up stuuuuf ((spooky voice)) so I guess that's what the artsy-fartsy appeal is supposed to be.If you can feel some kind of connectedness to either the main character or her sister, I guess you can feel some satisfaction, but as it is I'm just happy I didn't spend another 6 minutes listening to credits music. Refund ho!But you, astute reader as you are, might say ""how do I know if I feel connectedness if you won't tell me what it's about?""Spoiler alert:It's about repressed lesbianism.THAT'S the thing the whole game tries to blow up into something huge.Now it may be my dutch-centric lifestyle that desensitized me to gayness-related whining, or perhaps it's the copious amount of Tumblr feminazis that dulled me. But either way, if not gay, stay away.			"

												You are a young college student who returns home to find that her family is... gone?

Basically you walk around the house picking up♥♥♥♥♥♥and throwing it everywhere - getting tidbits of story (your sister narrates) as you go. That's it. You can't do anything else but flush toilets, turn lights on and off, turn tvs and radios/music players on/off, and throw useless♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere. (Hope my parents enjoy coming home to the ♥♥♥♥ing mess I left them ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE.)Only about an hour and a half of playtime (I completed it in 78 minutes though) and not much room for replayability. I won't spoil the story or ending for you, but I'll just say it wasn't that great of a story, and the ending wasn't very satisfying.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I got this in a bundle, luckily, becasue the price tag is ridiculous for what it is. I can get way better games for half the price.I can believe it took a lot of work with all the art assets and you can pick up and throw things. The story is super short, took me 54 minutes to get through it and I did explore and check every drawer and crevice. I also hated the music but that's a personal taste I think. I don't think this game is worth about 50 cents for how short and bare bones it is. Only play it if you get it in a bundle with other good games, otherwise you aren't missing much. Play To The Moon instead if you want a moving story with much nicer depth.			"

												I bought this game because it had good reviews and seemed like an interesting adventure with a story to unravel. What I found through playing it was incredibly disappointing. It felt like a stereotype-laden social commentary with most of the characters being caricatures. They were essentially symbols instead of people. Spoilers ahead:The father is an alcoholic failed writer who writes reviews of stereo systems because his uninspired science fiction novels don't sell. His uncle molested him and spent the rest of his life trying in vain to atone for it. His own father was a stodgy English scholar who was cold and uncaring to his son. His wife was cheating on him with a park ranger. One of his daughters went on a year-long trip in Europe (the player never finds out with what money or whether Katie is going to school at all) and the other is an angsty teen discovering herself with the powerful grunge girl she meets through Street Fighter. The story is a heavy-handed tale of a love that isn't accepted by the people around the lovers and it really feels like the true message the creators wanted to deliver was KICKING THE PATRIARCHY with the subtext EVERY MAN AROUND YOU IS♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some more time invested in fleshing out the characters and making the story feel less like getting clubbed in the head with a uterus-shaped shillelagh would have made for a more immersive experience.

Only reason anyone has praised it is because the story treads in an 'edgy' topic. Swap that out for something more common and the story really wouldn't be any good.I can't really recommend this to anyone as I hated the fact I walked around and read papers. There were some minor puzzles but in the end there really isn't anything to learn the story. If you are going to focus on a story, it better be impactful, meaningful or worth talking about in some way - this has none of those things. Teenagers be stupid. Yeah, deep.			"

												[This review is spoiler free and it might contain curse words 'cause it's an honest review]Hello there childrens, join me today for the most boring, akward, not-interesting journey about Sam, some girl with no personality whatsoever!As first, let's get this through: this is a first person adventure, so I wasn't expecting much action or big stuff goin on since it's all based on the plot.But why do you even make a game like this if your plot it's usless? We'll focus more on this later.The map it's surprisingly good looking, and there are lot of stuff you can interact with, and most of them will bring you back the 90s feel (such as VHS, cassette tapes etc). Most of the models looks very good, and the graphic is fine.I don't really know what to say about the soundtrack. Sometimes it's really really good and it work well with the moment, sometimes well.. it's just silly. A sad song pops up almost out of nowhere, or you find a cassette tape with a song that will make your ear bleed and grow a mouth that will ask you to stop playing the game.The voice acting it's good, but in the end, there is just 1 actress, the main protagonist talking. She's good, but doesen't help the story to look interesting. Also, her laugh makes me unconfortable.And now, the main thing about the game. The story. Short, predictable and pointless. God-♥♥♥♥ing-demmit. You have this setting: you're Sam, a girl that it's coming back home after a while to find out that no one it's home. But why? We'll see that later on.You have to explore the home to find out more about your past and to what happened to everyone. Turns out you're ""not attracted to men"" and you had a long complicated story with your partner. A love story that for most of the time it's ♥♥♥♥ing akward to listen and really made me unconfortable BUT NOT because of the sexual iterest into someone of the same gender, don't get me wrong, it was akward BECAUSE IT GET REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING RIDICULOUS FOR MOST OF THE EVENTS SHE'S NARRATING. And most of this event ends up with her crying. What a surprise.In the end, to be honest, the story could have been interesting or a little more enjoyable if something big whould happen, like some trama plot. But nope, in the end they tear apart, they never saw each other, teh edn. Boo-hoo ending I guess. Not working at all.Oh and what happened to the family, why they leave the house? I dunno. Why, do you care? Should we care? I think the story it's already good without some explanation. Effin-great.Also, this game looks easy as it can gets. There are almost no puzzles, just a bunch of combination or paper that tells you where to find hidden spots (just 2 or 3 in the whole game) and it's super short. I've beat this game in 77 minutes. And what's the best part? If you like to mess around, you could easly find the main hidden spot, get the key, go to the attic and beat the game in 3 minutes! Who designed this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Aha!Final rating: 2/10You probably need to be some Tumblr feminist girl to enjoy this story. Probably even them find this game offensive.Oh, almost forgot, this won ""Best PC game"" over ""Paper, please"" and ""Stanley Parable"". Good.			"

												Gone Home is either a bare-bones adventure game or a walking simulator which included a very small number of puzzle elements. I would suggest it is really more like the latter from a cladistics point of view; its attraction lies in that direction, and if you’re looking for really cerebral gameplay, this isn’t the place to look.Gone Home is really a story that happens to be presented in a video game format. The game consists of you (a early 20s woman who lives as an independent adult – you were in the military) coming home after a vacation in Europe to an empty house; your parents and your sister are all absent, and as you explore the house, it becomes increasingly clear that it is a bit disheveled. You find some notes from your sister scattered around, as well as various notes and scraps of life left by your sister and parents. Some of these trigger audio logs from your sister, which are really journal entries that you are listening to. These tell the story about what your sister has been going through over the last year, and the story of her relationship with Lonnie, a girl she knows.There are other stories interwoven into that one – your father, who is a failed writer who is trying to climb back on the horse while working a real job, and your mother, who is struggling with her relationship with your father and who might or might not be having an affair, or at least contemplating one, as well as the story of the former owner of the house that your family moved into while you were in the military.These stories all come together to create a picture of a family that is troubled, but not broken, and of people who are people. Your sister is an immature high school student, but she is mostly immature like rebels without a cause are. Lonnie seems to be simultaneously more and less mature; she’s a bad influence on your sister in some ways, but also seems to have a more realistic and grounded view of the world in other ways.I liked the story of the lives presented here; it is sort of everyday drama, with people struggling with real problems rather than contrived situations (much as the game likes to pretend at one point that there might be supernatural elements involved).What I didn’t like, however, was the ending; when you get to the end, it seems to sort of throw away Lonnie’s character to force a “happy ending” which, if you think about it, isn’t actually really a happy ending at all. And this sort of ruins the story to an extent, because the whole story had been about growing up and trying to accept reality and find happiness through it, and then the end has Lonnie and your sister throw all that away while making a very stupid decision which flies in the face of Lonnie’s prior characterization, as well as the general theme of the piece.I’ll also note that it is possible to sequence skip in this game; as I assumed it was more gamey than it really was, I managed to find some secret passages, including the one that lead to the very final area of the game, far before I was supposed to. This partially spoiled a major aspect of the story to me from quite early on. The worst of it is, finding these secret passages isn’t even very hard if you are familiar with floor plans and realize that there are empty spaces which, in a real house, would have rooms in them.In the end, I’m left feeling ambivalent about this game. I wouldn’t not recommend it – I thought it was a decent enough use of two hours of my time, and I was reasonably immersed in the experience – but simultaneously, I feel bad about recommending it, because in the end, the story doesn’t really feel like it actually came together thematically and tossed its build-up away for an ending that the game thinks is a happy one, but which the rest of the story (and plain logic) suggests wouldn’t be. Also, it feels overpriced for its length; I got this as part of a bundle, but throwing down $20 for a 2 hour game that you're only going to play once seems like a kind of poor deal (and, as a side note, the developer commentary, which seems like it might provide additional content, wasn't worth listening to).If you want something with actual gameplay and puzzles, you should definitely steer clear; this is one of those games which is only debatably a “game” in the first place, and while it is more of a game than something like Dear Esther, it is not as much of a game as something like The Stanley Parable.

												Sometimes I worry when my opinion on an especially beloved piece of work differs from that of the overwhelming majority of game reviewers. I wonder if perhaps I've missed something along the way. I think to myself ""Did I play this the wrong way?"" or ""Was I not paying close enough attention?"" BioShock Infinite, with its near universally high review scores and fleeting comparisons to Citizen Kane, was a recent example of the difference in opinion I felt with professional game critics. I found Infinite to be uneven, with the emphasis on narrative being overshadowed by the disconnect between it and the gameplay.And so I find myself again in a situation where I have to wonder if I've done something wrong. Due largely to the many positive comments I have heard regarding the importance of Fullbright Studios' ""Gone Home,"" I felt that I needed to play it now rather than later. The buzz on this plucky indie title is that it should be experienced by all. In some ways, I can't disagree with that. It should be experienced, but the urgency to do so is misguided.The game opens with Katie, the player-controlled character, returning home after a year abroad. While gone, her family moved into a new house, a sprawling manor with dark wood paneling that drapes every room in an appropriate sense of Hollywood mystery. The front door is locked, and taped to it is a note from Katie's sister, Sam, urging her not to try and find her, nor to snoop through her things.Playing the game is a matter of moving through the house, examining objects and unraveling the mysteries within. There are several stories to discover, from the relationship between Katie's parents, the changing courses of their careers, and a story about the original owner of the home. But the main focus of the story is on Sam, and where she has gone.Clues to what has been happening for the last year come in the way of written correspondence. Notes, some formal, some on post-its, some on desks, others torn and crumpled, move the narrative along. It doesn't hit you over the head, which is refreshing, save for Sam's story. Other than one notable surprise moment in a bathroom, I felt early on that I knew just where the story would resolve. While it didn't necessarily roll itself out as I expected, the outcome was where I knew it would end up.When I finished the game, I didn't know how to feel about the experience I had just had. The story was satisfying, if not a little predictable, and I appreciated what the game did in regards to a novel approach to storytelling. But I still felt conflicted before I could fully render my final assessment.The title builds a spooky ambiance through the ever-present rain and the sprawling, empty house. Such a decision on the part of the designers is not without merit: coming to a house you have never seen before, on a rain-soaked Portland night, would probably give anyone a feeling of uneasiness. But the game seems to rely on the haunted-house tropes to convey a level of mystery, and it doesn't really work once the game is said and done. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't immediately know how to feel when I finished the game. Part of it was realizing that the elevation of the house's atmosphere to a ""spooky"" level was not a needed inclusion. It never played out, and leads to a false feeling that something is there when it in no way is. It was a cheap way to build tension in a game whose setting exists in the same universe as you and I.Another problem I have is that I found the secondary stories to be more interesting than the story of finding Sam. Katie and Sam's parents, their strained relationships, her father's decline and seeming rebirth as a writer, these things piqued my attention more so than the story of Sam. To the game's credit, it allows you to make your own assumptions about how these side-stories resolve, and I find that approach to be more engaging than the straight-forward reveal of Sam's fate.Notes such as this one help move along the narrative and help nail a sense of place and time.My biggest problem with this game is that it cost me $20, was over in 3 hours, and has no replay value. I didn't get all the details of the stories, but I also don't care enough about them to go back and play the game anymore. All the mystery has evaporated from it now that the narrative has concluded. I largely followed leads for the other stories to see how they intertwined themselves with Sam's fate, and knowing Sam's fate has made me lose interest in the other stories.This is my inner struggle with this game: I know it's a good game. I know that it takes an interesting approach to storytelling, and for that it should be lauded. I have long felt that stories in games are largely superfluous (BioShock Infinite being a prime example of a critically successful game where the story and gameplay exist on two independent planes). Where Gone Home succeeds is in making the story the game itself. There's nothing magical about the exploration-based gameplay here, but it's the execution that makes it work. Without the gameplay elements, the story would not be as compelling, and vice versa.Gone Home is an important, if flawed, foray into the world of interactive storytelling. Its implementation of certain game elements feel forced, like shoehorning door unlocking ""puzzles"" in, and while the story itself is interesting, it concludes too quickly and predictably. It lacks sufficient variety to warrant a second-playthrough, and from a strictly value-based perspective, its twenty dollar price tag is more than most gamers would be comfortable spending. I recommend this game, but wait for a Steam sale.			"

												I knew what I was getting into, and initally I felt this was a decent game. After exploring the 100th room and throwing the 100th coaster onto the floor to look for abstract progression notes it quickly became a chore. The diary entries that make up the main story are fairly standard romance stuff. That's basically this game in a nutshell. A standard story hidden around countless rooms in a house.			"

												It is a good game, for people who enjoy the good old point and click mystery solving sorta games. The story itself is rather interesting, but will not appeal to all audiences, and the replayability and general game time it offers isn't really worth the $20. You'll get a maximum of 2 hours out of it, and that's if you go around looking at everything, picking everything up while trying to discover why your entire family is gone when you come back from a worldwide trip. It tells a good story, but isn't worth the money, and is pretty overrated.			"

												This game had so  much potential. The puzzles weren't really puzzles and it was way too easy to sequence break. This would make you miss something you needed to unlock more voice overs. I felt the story could have been better told if they put it on the cassette tapes you find around the house. I feel the devs missed a great opportunity to put in a cool game mechanic. In any case, it's not really worth paying more than a couple dollars for what you get. It was an interesting concept. I was rather disappointed with the execution. It could have been so much better.			"

												Definitely not worth buying. From the price view, original price is $20 is way too much for this short game however I got this game for around $5 but I still did not find this game worth buying. When I mean short, it is very, very short. The story is set in the 90s and have that nostalgic feel. I have to say, the story is not interesting and very boring. It only tells the story from one person's view and not her family members. You walk around ""explore"" every room in the house hoping to find something new and interesting to know whereabouts the main character's family members are and what is going on with her family members. It is somewhat both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. I find myself not knowing whether it is a ""love story"" or a horror game judging by what you find in the house and what you hear in the house. The ending was very simple, not telling what happen to the rest of the family members. I do not see why this is even a video game, making a book about it I bet it would be much more interesting. I do not know why this game got a high rating review from known gaming websites; IGN, Gameinformer, The New York Times? bahahaha. Just do not buy this game, I do not recommend it (you do not have to listen me who has played this game before and knows that it is bad) However it has some good voice acting in it and that is all. DO NOT BUY. Not even worth a penny. Save your money and buy a much better game with a much more interesting story and that is The Walking Dead.			"

												Gone Home is a first person interactive story, developed by The Full Bright Company. Being released on PC in August 2013, before a planned release on PS4 and Xbox One in early 2016. I wouldn’t say Gone Home is a game, because there is the only thing you do in this game is walk from room to room interacting with notes and books, that’s it. This game has often been marked as being a walking simulator, and to be honest, people aren’t far wrong with that notion. From start to finish there the only sort of action or puzzle, or anything really worthy of being called gameplay, would be a short puzzle involving finding hidden cupboards.  I was quite honestly bored after five minutes of starting the game. Graphically, the game is quite nice though. There are some really nicely done lighting mechanics in the game, and textures are all really high quality as well. Even items that you pick up have really nicely made graphics and textures on, such as bottles in the kitchen or bathroom. There isn’t any animation to be found in the game though; you come into contact with no moveable objects throughout the game. Gone Home is narrated well too, the voice acting is done really well, and there is from memory no sound effects that standout, just a lot of ambiance sounds of the storm going on outside. The only really shining light to come out of Gone Home is that it has a fairly compelling story. As a mid-twenties male though, I couldn’t relate to anything that was happening. You are basically reading a ton of notes, letters, diaries and posters. I was quite interested to follow the story until completion but I can’t say that I really enjoyed it all that much. It’s a very slow paced story which only really gathers paced towards the end of the game. You can get even more lore and plot from the game by searching high and low for more notes and letters if you want to. A complete run through Gone Home will take you less than an hour to finish. This is with finding most of the extra notes for more stories as well. There is no replay ability, because to be quite honest, it’s a stretch to even get one run through out of it. Technically I didn’t run into any problems. The game runs smooth and there are no glitches or bugs. Although there isn’t really anything that complicated going off on screen anyway…To sum up, I am not going to recommend Gone Home. How this “game” is priced at £14, 99 are is astounding. I picked this up when it was on sale for £1, 79 a while ago, and even now I think I have been ripped off. There is a string of pretentious reviews on this “game” that quite honestly make me cringe whilst reading.  Gone Home is quite literally one of the most boring and unexciting “games” I have played this year and cannot recommend it to anyone.  Fully expecting a wave of flame and hatred from this review, so bring it on! :) Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must play

												Caution: spoilers belowMuch like the other reviews have stated, this game isn't really so much a game as an interactive story. And even that's stretching it some - you're not really interacting with the story itself, you're just finding bits of paper and such that trigger audio clips. I bought it, on sale, without checking the reviews (I read that it was originally an Amnesia mod, thought it would be scary, and bought it as a blind 'let's play' sort of thing) and was sorely disappointed. I'd expected something...frightening, or upsetting at the very least.Even disregarding my own mistake, it was still a disappointing experience. The atmosphere is lonely and tense and foreboding, and for what? So I can walk around the house, keyed up, and find notes from my teenaged sister?For that matter - the main story merely made me mildly nauseated. Kudos, that the developers made it a lesbian romance, but while some might find it cute or touching...To be honest, I just found it frustratingly cliche. Of course our sister's name is Sam (yes, I know, it's a nickname), lesbians are all named something masculine. Of course she doesn't fit in at school. Of course she's all gurrrl power.Of course she does the incredibly stupid thing of running away from home to be with her girlfriend.It's like I'm reading a textbook romance, in lesbian flavor. There are a few sweet moments, but overall I merely wanted to slap the hell out of my sister for being an idiotic teenager. I was more interested in my parents' stories, although that's not saying much.So, to recap: This is a ""game"" that wastes its potential atmosphere in favor of a boring romance between two teenage girls. Not recommended unless you have a serious need for 90's nostalgia or happen to identify strongly with Sam.			"

												I didn't care for this game. I saw it on sale and read some cool reviews so I picke dit up. There's not much of a story here, or a game. It's kind of like reading a story about a story. The only thing about it that really keeps you going is ""What is the story going to be?"" Well. It's not really worth figureing out.It's just a story about people following their hearts, hurting other people, and justifying it because it ""feels the like the right thing to do.""Kinda like a toddler.

												Developer out of their mind. Do no support.http://imgur.com/Zw6OsHjhttp://imgur.com/nVAqaoKI've played the game to see if it was worth or not and:-Graphic is bad optimised: physic bugs dropped my fps to 3 for one minute straight.-The story doesn't make sense.-It's a walking simulator with 3 hidden codes to find. That's it.-The voice acting is remarkable, a pity has ""gone wasted"" (pun intended) on this game.However, the real disaster is the background story, the pitiful attempt at making a videogame that had LGBT themes: everything feels utterly forced and it's obvious that the developer didn't intend to create good characters who happens to be gay, but simply to create gay characters. The result is an icky character that, recording by recording, tells the player her ordinary story about being an homosexual teenager.The concept of a person coming home expecting a family and finding it empty is alluring, but the execution didn't succeed at creating a rich playground; this game can keep the user busy for slightly more than an hour, two at most. Good work recreating a '90s feeling, but the world isn't convincing enough to raise a real nostalgia.Graphic: 6/10Sound: 8/10Longevity: 3/10Gameplay: 4/10Overall: 5/10Avoid at all cost: I might overlook the flaws and tell you it's worth a couple of bucks, but I find rather hypocrite a game that shoves LGBT themes down your throat when its developer bans you for, literally, nothing.Buy A Story About My Uncle, The Stanley Parable or the free Only If, instead.

“I really haven't had that exciting of a life. There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life. So I pretty much like to make it up. I'd rather tell a story about somebody else.” ― Kurt Cobain, JournalsKatie Greenbriar comes back to her family home, one year after the mysterious suicide of grunge god, Kurt Cobain. Is this info relevant at all? Nope, not really. It's just a nostalgic anecdote to remind you that it's the 90s. The world is simpler, slower, a bit more isolated; and runs through passion and imagination for most teenagers. Internet is dial-up, we listen music from cassettes, watch movies from VHS and getting out to town on a school night is a big issue. Without the dominating grasp of absurdly advanced technology, the world is innocent compared to today. How do I know? I've been there.But this isn't my story. This is Katie's story, returning from a year's trip to Europe, only to find no one at home. Where is everyone? Mom? Dad? Sam? As any considerate sister and beloved daughter of a family would do, we explore the newly settled home of the Greenbriars to find some answers. Since the family moved into this place in our absence, everything is alien, new and even... uncanny.I'd love to tell you more about the story - and interwoven side stories, but my hands are tied, since this game is all about stories to be uncovered. I find it hard to believe that many people in the forums and countless reviewers found this game to be an exaggerated thrash. I believe this game to be a revolution in the sense of storytelling in games, utilizing no more than a basic environment, written information and some audio records to tell the story of three generations, and maybe some more.If you are in expectancy of a hideous horror game with eerie jump scares, no, Gone Home is not it. Gone Home is more like an experience, sharing a period in time, a moment so ordinary and so real. It's nothing supernatural, or extraordinary. It is a home, maybe your home, thus defines the exact description of Freud's Uncanny. From the moment that Katie comes into the front porch until the last moment of realization of the game, we really become Katie. The situation is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is so ordinary that it can happen to anyone of us, in any household. It all is so friggin real, and the real is the primary strength of Gone Home.Within this story driven exploration game, you should expect to find out just one silent reality of a household, as powerful, as troublesome and as beautiful it can be. I strongly advise for you to avoid any kind of spoilers until you'd go through the game at least once. If you are in for basic human feelings - like worry, anxiety, shame, frustration and passion; you will love this game.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												First of all, for those who are arguing this is supposed to be a horror game, it's not. The basic storyline is 'you come home and nobody is there, find out why' and not 'zombies have taken over the house and lurk in the basement'.Yes, ""Gone Home"" is short, once you know where to find the information and the keys, you can play it in a little over 10 minutes ... but that means only going through the house and triggering the ending sequence, that kind of playing will not give you the complete story. The story, however, is not just about Sam (the sister). You can also find out about your father's troubles with writing, about his weird uncle, who owned the house before the family moved in, and other stuff. Basically, the game lets you catch up with the family history during the time you were in Europe.It's an everyday story, not something great or heroic or scary. It's just the unease everyone would feel alone in a house they've never been in before, at after 1 a.m. on a night with a thunderstorm, not atmospheric horror like in ""Amnesia.""$20 might indeed be a little much for the game... and 'game' a little too much of a word for ""Gone Home"" but it does not deserve all the bad reviews it has gotten. If you want an action game, this is not for you... but that should be obvious from the description. If you like uncovering a story for yourself, you might want to give it a chance.			"

												This game is getting a lot of hate nowadays. Like other reviewers said, its not for everyone, but it was for me. Playing this game is like solving a mystery that at first is very external, and then becomes more of an internal journey of coming of age. Sweet, touching, beautiful in its details, and even dark in several ways that are easily skipped over. Its really nice to play a game that wasn't pandering soley to the demographic of straight male. For someone not in that category it was relatable, affirming, and a breath of fresh air. It's short (def get it on sale <$10), and ""not perfect"" in the sense that it isnt a ""game"" in that it doesnt have gameplay. But it is truly an innovative storytelling mechanic, seeing the human story through objects left behind. Its like 90's archaeology. Walking through my house after I finished it felt like I was seeing everything with new eyes. If you like puzzles or explosions or chase scenes in your games then this isnt for you so there is no point to buy it and then whine about how bad it is just because it doesnt resound with you.			"

												Save yourselves the $20 this costs.  This ""Interactive, Artistic, Bold"" game is actually a very tame story that you have heard many times.  The developer saw fit to make the game and house seem like it was going to tell a truly amazing story, maybe have some scares or an iteresting premise but in reality was nothing more than a teen angst tale.  I was hoping the ending would reveal a terrible secret or a wonderful revelation as to why no one was home, but the tale fell incredibly flat.

												In Gone home, the player assumes control of a young women named Kaitlin Greenbriar whom visits her home to find that her family is gone. The player proceeds to explore the abandoned house in search for clues as to the whereabouts of Kaitlin's family members. At first I was intensely interested in this game, however after beating the game for myself I was underwhelmed. Though I like games that try to tell a story through the environment, the story that surfaces from the interaction in Gone Home isn't particularly deep or interesting, and the payoff for all the buildup is ultimately dissapointing. In addition, this game can be beaten in less than 2 minutes if you know where to go and in about 2 hours if you examine and read everything in the building. Not a good value.4/10			"

												I beat this game in a  little less than 2 hours, and I took my time.  Its somewhat interesting how the story comes together.  I enjoyed waliking around the huge house and interacting with it, pretty imersive. However, the puzzles were very easy.  Overall, I would get this game only if its below 5 dollars and you like a short simple adventure game.  I can't recommend it though because of the base price.			"

												I got this game on sale, I think for just under $5. I don't think I got my money's worth, I'm sad to say. If you're curious about this game and you can find it under $5 like I did then it might be worth it but anything more would be spending too much. If I had bought this game when it first came out I would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I spent $20 on it. I really wanted it when it came out too.The story in the game was really good and hit me in the feels at the end but the process to get there was exhausting. It felt more like a strain to keep going just to get to the end than instead of it being an enjoyable experience. Sam's voice actor really pulled it together and made it worth the play but without the voice acting this game really doesn't have anything going for it.			"

												I am decently surprised that I took 1.9 hours to finish this game. I'm not known for my speed, so the average player should be able to finish this game faster.Now, some might say that the game's experience and gameplay requires bite-sized length, fine. But quality-wise? Let's just face it, the gameplay is simple, the environment is a house (well-built, I'll give them that), and the story... Well...It's a love story with a happy ending that will never work, considering that the real-life consequence of it would destroy it. That said, the plot is predictable, a writer from centuries or millennia ago has more to offer than this. Slapping the LGBTQ cause on the front cover doesn't make it better, just exploitative of the genre and social cause.That said, the story (backstory, to be precise) is well-crafted. I like the nuggets of details here and there, but it's about as fleeting as the game, what can I say?What is worse is that there is little hope for improvement, as this game isn't exactly built for expansions and sequels, and I've seen reports of the developers censoring players for voicing out their disatisfaction with this game. Some reviewers decided to fall for the LGBTQ trap and gave it top-class ratings. Nope, this developer is likely going to keep doing what they're doing, and want to look like martyrs for the cause.

												The time taken between seeing this on sale, looking up some quick gameplay footage and reviews, purchasing, installing, playing and then completing the game was roughly 1 hour. The most enjoyable part of that hour was the time spent not knowing that this game existed.This game is awful, between the nonsense diary entries and aimlessly inspecting the pieces of tat randomly strewn across the house like a crazy episode of 'A Life of Grime', this game offers nothing in the way of story or gameplay and could easily be mistaken for a tech-demo. If there was anything worth a demonstration. I finished this game and I am non-the-wiser as to the plot/story/point of this game.This game has received rave reviews by people who I can only assume are in cahoots with the developers, but don't be fooled this game is bad. Worst display of pretentious indi-hipster dirge since 'Dear Esther', and that's saying a lot.			"

												There have been many classic exploration games which have defined the genre.  This isn't one of them.  I suppose if you'd like to jump on the band wagon and pretend to be some 'gaming intellectual' who played this game and felt it was 'so deep' then by all means buy this game and play it into the ground.  Alternatively, I imagine that this game is similar to young adult novels that deal with all those confusing feelings pre-teens and young teens have about themselves.  So if you like those, do the same.If you don't want to act like a shallow elitest, or you don't enjoy young adult fiction I recommend against wasting your money.  You would do better finding a copy of any 90's TV show featuring a teenage female lead and get the same experience for what is probably a fraction of the price.The suspension of disbelief wasn't there, the themes were confusing, and the story itself was paper thin.  I spent half the game waiting for it to be a different game, and it never accomplished that.  Instead it was just a casual walk through a house on a rainy night while reading your little sister's diary like a nosey sibling and rummaging through your parent's personal business.  It is the most boring plotline ever.In the end?  You're the the most intrusively obnoxious sister/child ever.			"

												This game feels like false advertisement. If you're looking for a spooky, dark mystery with some ""boo!"" moments and at least a bit of horror, well... sorry. What you get instead is, as FABIO stated below, a big red herring, setting an atmosphere of dread and anxiousness, with absolutely no payoff. None. Instead what you get is a big, fat ""GOTCHA"" that starts to dawn on you about halfway through the game, when you're already too invested to throw in the towel. Hoping, HOPING that this game with such atmospheric reviews has some good tricks up its sleeves (it doesn't). Though I won't spoil the story entirely, it turns out to be a half-hearted love story that feels like more agenda than actual emotional attachment. I felt more for the side characters' (i.e. the parents') situations than the main storyline (i.e. your sister). I dunno. I'm not trying to belittle the message being preached here, but I felt robbed, as the trailers and videos make this game out to be what it isn't, but I guess that's because if they had advertised it as what it is, not nearly as many would want to play it.

												There is a decent amount to like about Gone Home, but at the end of it all I can’t exactly recommend this game without explaining my gripes with it first-- from there you can form your own opinion. The concept is simplistic and surprisingly engrossing. The atmosphere is great, it’s a very interesting period piece, and a lot of the story is pretty engaging; however, the main problem with the game is that everything ends up feeling artificial. For those unfamiliar, you play as a young adult returning home a little past midnight and finding out that no one is home. As such, you let yourself into the house and begin exploring. Through your exploration you will slowly unravel the mysteries of where everyone is, the house, etc. Honestly, it is a very interesting game and pretty well done. There is a sense of wonder exploring a relatively deserted and unfamiliar house—one your family calls home. The biggest gripe, though, is that the house doesn’t actually feel like a house at all. The layout and floor plan of the home you are exploring doesn’t really make much sense. I assume the home was designed in such a way as to guide players in the ‘correct’ direction, but honestly the house doesn’t really feel like a house. It feels more like a series of rooms that are connected by a maze of hallways. The room locations do not seem to make much sense, the hallways are incredibly long and winding, and honestly it just doesn’t feel like a home so much as it feels like a couple rooms held together by a thing wire. Further detracting from the immersion is the fact that apparently every single member of the home has left incredibly personal papers, letters, and memos all over the house. For a family with so many secrets, you’d expect the mom to hide letters from her friend hinting at something sinister in a better place than any random cupboard in the house. Likewise, a note that isn’t exactly hidden at all saying ‘let’s do it at this location and this time’ more or less in plain sight makes little sense. This is pretty frustrating, particularly because there seems to have been a lot of effort put into the many different family storylines.Perhaps most annoying is the character that is your sister. The letters she writes back and forth between her classmates and love interest are incredibly juvenile. Instead of presenting her as a highschool student graduating relatively soon—which she is--- the notes and slips of paper she has written read as though a third grader just found out that you can write an pass notes in class. It’s incredibly ridiculous and, for lack of a better word, lame. What really is disappointing is that your sister isn’t even the most interesting part of the story. What’s going on with your mom and dad is much more interesting, better paced, and frankly more believable. This is not to say that the story involving your sister is bad. The problem is that you can’t help but feel disillusioned by the juvenile and amateur writing of a supposed highschooler  with aspirations of attending a college for creative writing. Gone Home could have been a really great game. Instead, it’s an okay game with a really interesting idea. In general I guess I recommend the game just to try it out and form your own opinion. There is a good deal to like. I just wouldn’t expect too much.			"

												I don't have much to say except this was a a good and emotional ride, the game had a very touching story however was very short. If anything I will thumb this game down because the price i've paid for it and what it had to offer. It is very linear and once you're done, you will never pick up this game again unless you want to run around, look for clues to activate events which leads to the conclusion.  1 hour is exactly how long it took me to beat this game and thats just running around and finding the things. This thumbs down is not for the fact that its a bad game, some people might like this, this thumbs down is for the PRICE of the game during the time I bought it, the time spent, the replay value, and the amount of negatives I found wrong with this title.+ Good story+ Decent graphics+ Good immersion- Gameplay was sorta boring, wanted it to offer more, you basically explore find clue that activates the next sets of events and done.- Very short- Linear- Not what you think it is, a horror game and thats what it amkes you believe, sometimes you'll get scared FOR NO REASON.- NO REPLAY VALUE			"

The setup is cool, the atmosphere is suitably unnerving, but the story, which let's face it, is the main point of this game, is simply not that interesting.  To make matters worse, it is told in a completetly nonsensical way that has it progressing in parallel to the progress that the player makes as they walk through the house.  Why the notes and letters are scattered in such a way throughout the house makes literally no sense, but it sure was convenient.  Also, why the hell is the door to the dining room and kitchen locked?  The family left in such a rush that they forgot to turn off several lights and two televisions, but made sure to lock the door to 1/3 of the house?			"

												Look past the kneejerk in all facets and you'll find an ambitious but lightweight story that wears a lot of its themes at face value. Gone Home's biggest problem is that its wonderful, mostly open mansion is saddled with a linear story with A-to-B journal entries and locked doors that clearly direct the story and hamper the sense of immersion the environment is meant to bring. Once, I would have considered it woorth playing just for historical purposes, but perhaps I was wrong to perceive it would set so many trends, as it feels like its brand of emergent storytelling is on the decline if anything.Full review:

If, despite my reccomendation you still desire to play it then you will be consumed by a beautiful story that will captivate and move you.If you have money to burn or get this game cheap then I would highly reccomend it.I give gone home 9/10,but the price tag 0/10.

As for  gameplay (or lack of), it consists of just picking up or examining things, which would have been fine in the context of using it as a story-telling tool, , but the story in itself is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ thus rendering this game a pointless endevour.  I can't understand for the life of my why this game is being praised universally. Quite frankly all the shilling going on (this game winning VGX Indie Game of The Year), is just sickening, seeing as there are much better choices out there that offer much more in every respect. If you want a game first-person adventure game that is heavily narrative-based, go play The Stanley Parable, otherwise just take your money and spend it elsewhere, or just watch a playthrough on youtube.

												Gone home is set in the early 90's and you play as Kate, coming home from a trip from Europe. While the graphics and enviroment are beautiful, the story isn't that compelling. I found myself waddling around the house interacting needlessly with garbage and toothbrushes. Seemingly enough no one was home upon my return, all the lights were off, and a creepy side-story felt like an attempt at adding horror and suspense to an otherwise lackluster story. It's got some funny content, which adds a lighter side to this game, however, I felt as if the narative was very predictable. The narrator did a beautiful job at voicing and the music was decent. Overall, I would not recommend this game unless you're in for under 5 bucks and you're willing to muddle around uselessly in a beautifully modeled CGI home. 3/10			"

												Completely overatted game. The game consists of rummaging through drawers and finding things on the ground... once you find something of value the story triggers a soundbyte. The soundbytes are the main part of the game that construct the story. The elements in the game that are visual (like looking at letter) are supplemental. You never come across another entity in the game, nor do you interact with anything except turning on a faucet or flush a toilet... other than that it's open a door. You can grab an item and interact with it, like you would in a Telltale game (spinning it around), but there's no reason to, ever. It's also an incredibly fast playthrough. Way overpriced.It's like Stanley Parable with no funny commentary... just tiny parts of story that are surfaced when you find a trinket. Replay value is 0.			"

If ever there was a game that completely punctuated the difference between those who critique games for websites/magazines and those who actually purchase and play those games, it is Gone Home.

This tells me to never trust a metascore ever again and to stick to the reviews written by those who have actually purchased the game and played it. (Thank heaven for Steam reviews!)The description of the game states, ""No Combat, No Puzzles: Gone Home is a nonviolent and puzzle-free experience, inviting you to play at your own pace without getting attacked, stuck, or frustrated."" And I am usually OK with games of that sort IF they can hold my attention and are somewhat engaging. Gone Home was neither attention holding nor was it engaging. Walk around, read notes, listen to a story that clearly has an agenda to it, and that's all. The story line felt rather forced and unnatural and perhaps even a bit silly. After an hour I began to get bored with trying to reveal this preposterous story by digging through every drawer in the house in the hope that there might be another bit of info that would help the story progress a bit, I just gave up. No amount of vodka was going to make this game interesting for me. Glad I bought it on sale. "

												The hype and awe surrounding this title is extremely misleading.  There is only an hour or so of content.  The story is predictable.  I heard ALOT from PCGamer, IGN and Gamespot about the quality of the game and the excellent narrative - I now feel duped and am really dissappointed.  I am most upset that I spent my hard earned money on this cheap stunt.			"

												Unfortunately the story and exploring the game just don't make it worth the full price, in my opinion. And as a game that calls itself a story exploration experience, that kinda shows just how little the game has to offer. I could understand if the narrative were a bit more compelling, but the discovery of the story is in no way organic. I can't understand how the game made it on so many top 5 lists for the year. Maybe consider picking it up for less than $5, but even then it would be hard for me to recommend to almost anyone.			"

												I played through, and completed 'Gone Home' and was left with massive disappointment. This is no game at the end of the day, it feels more like a tech demo of sorts. Graphically, it does the job that it sets out to do I suppose, with nothing awe-inspiring to be found within. Everything is presented as you would expect with most 'home' locations in games these days. The rooms are very well decorated and do feel very realistic in their layout.Audio-wise, there's not a lot really besides a fair few audio dialogues throughout the game. They tell the story of why the house is empty, mainly through letters written by the protagonist's sister. She gives brief details on the father and mother but mostly talks about what's been going on in her recent life and ultimately, reveals nothing of significance to the person playing the game. There's nothing found within the storyline laid out before you that actually impacts upon what you're experiencing in the house and as a result it feels a very dis-jointed experience. If anything, it's extremely mis-leading as what sounds and feels like a horror game of sorts becomes... nothing. A simple traipse through an empty house.It's hard to say how the game plays when there's really no game to be found within. It's like a 3D version of those mind-numbing hidden object games, except you aren't exactly given clues in 'Gone Home' as to what you need or why. Reviewers apparently went crazy for thise game, and awards were bestowed upon it. I just don't know where the hype and praise came from because deep down, it just feels like a more advanced version of HL2's 'Lost Coast' mod, or 'Dear Esther'. If you have come to 'Gone Home' expecting some kind of survival horror, or heck, even just a game with a beginning and an end, you won't find it here. In a word? Dreadful.			"

												Gone home is not a bad game, but there is very little here. It is as you probably read an interactive, narrative. It is done well enough, but I can't say I would ever reccomend buying it. In fact I'd only do so if it was under 5 dollars. There is just nothing here that justifies the price.  Nothing here to get invested in beyond the rather predictable story.The best thing this game does is craft an unsettling atmopshere, but the game isn't the type where that makes sense so...			"

												After going home I wish I could leave it again.This game is extremely short (2 hours or less), which normally I would count as a negative, but for this game it is a massive plus. The game is boring. That's the best term I can think of for it. It's just flat out boring. A close runner-up term is ""overrated"". I truley think that the only reason this game won any Game of the Year nominations is becasue *Spoilers from here* it has a homosexual character that is not a blatant sterotype or a negative caricature. I agree that it's an important step to have characters like this in modern storytelling, but raving about it and handing out 10/10 scores is just misleading to a consumer. The story is an extremely standard one of teenage romance with the only true difference being the homosexuality. It's so paint-by-the-numbers that I had called the plot after the first two or three notes from your sister. Initially I was not too annoyed by this because at the beginning of the game they start with an atmosphere of a horror game and I thought perhaps the gay sister storyline would take backseat to something far more interesting. Unfortunatley as the game went on it became more and more clear that the horror aspect was just used as a way to pull people in enough to listen to what turned out to be a dull and cliched story. I was really, desperatley hoping that at the end the writers had done something different, such as finding out that the sister had commited suicide in the attic after her lover leaves her to join the army or something completley out of left field like her demon-ghost uncle ate her, but no. No, we just get the ""Oh, she changed her mind about joining the army and now we're going to live happily ever after away from our parents who just don't understand our love blah blah blah"" boring, cliched ending. In the end I just felt cheated by this game. There are vague rumblings about a much more interesting story within this game (ghosts, crazy uncles), but they are complete Red Herrings to keep you interested enough to suffer through the teenage angst story. Even now, several months after playing this, I still get angry when I think about my wasted time and money. I am disappointed by the game so much that I wish I could remove it from my game library, even if I didn't get any money back for it (Thankfully I got it during a sale and did not pay the outrageous $20 that the game normally costs).Seriously, if you want a purely narrative driven game then there are games that do so much better than this (Walking Dead, The Stanley Parable, The Wolf Among Us, Myst, Monkey Island, etc.). Please look anywhere else if you want a game that makes you feel, unless you love the feeling of boredom.			"

												A 2 hour long interactive picture book if you look for EVERYTHING that lasts about an hour at most (maybe longer if you don't read well, actually sit through all the sloooowly spoken dialogue, or have trouble finding stuff, I spent a LOT of time looking for things that just weren't there trying to prove to myself that I didn't waste my money).  That's the best way to describe this.  Would have made an ok short story, but as a game it's just dull.  Pick a thing up, read something or someone talks to you, move to the next thing.This tends to be my view of all walking sims, they're picture books you interact with, and honestly I'd rather just read it if there's no meat to it.  No real puzzles, no challenges and most importantly no failure state means I just can't support this being called a game.   And YES there could have been plenty of little challenges to make it a ""game"".  This is the story, from what I remember, of a teenager, they couldn't have owned a puzzle box or two to hold their things?  Couldn't have had some diary entries or notes written in code?  Couldn't have had a story item hidden and put 2-3 clues for a neat scavenger hunt?  Yes I did these things as a teenager, and yes it was fun.  You can have walking sims (which are interactive books, not games) and add content that will make it into a game.  It's not hard if you try.Now I love me the hell out of narrative, story is the most important thing in a game to me, but when the story wouldn't even be 20 pages if it were in a book, then why am I paying so much for it in ""game"" form?  If this were 2-3 bucks I'd probably say to give it a try if you like this sort of thing, but for 20 damn bucks?  No, not on your life.  When you can watch the game on youtube and get the EXACT SAME experience as playing it yourself, then: 1 it's not a game and 2 the dev failed to even try to make it one.TL;DR:  An interactive pop up book basically that's not terrible like some people say, however charging 20 bucks for this ""game"" is a sure fire sign that the devs are too damn full of themselves.  5 bucks MIGHT be ok for this but not 20 bucks.  There are hundreds of much MUCH better games out there with stories as good or better than this that feature actual game play.  And for a lot of them you can get 5 or 6 of those games for the same price.			"

												Having just played the game, I'm having trouble collecting my thoughts, but I can say that I'm not impressed nor will I look back on the 1.8 hours I apparently spent playing this. The game doesn't give you a feeling of satisfaction as you progress through it, as you find journal entries and go through large pointless excerpts related to some in-game story that you'll have a hard time convincing yourself to care about. What little characterization that was given is both bland and predictable. The main story is the same, despite apparently being acclaimed as some heartwarming and nostalgiac.Gameplay is nonexistent, with few puzzles that are about as fufilling as the rest of the game, making me wonder if the whole reason they included any puzzles at all was to prevent this from 30 minutes of predicting exactly how the story will play out.Your game experience WILL depend heavily on who you are and how you choose to interperate love stories. Don't be fooled by any review guaranteeing you will enjoy this, especially for the pricetag.			"

												More of a interactive museum than a game. The only real strong point here is there is a bit of exploration and it looks pretty good but other than that a very dull experience and might not even qualify as a game. As quite a few people might have heard the game is highly praised for its ""controversial"" subject matter but even with that the narritive is weak and poorly thought out so I believe the main draw even falls flat on it's face. The worst part about all of this is the price of admission is 20 dollars. That is absurdly high for such a lack luster experience and I regret buying this game. If it was something that was free I would have at least given it points for trying something different. TL;DR: Don't believe any of the hype. Barely even a video game.

Despite all of this, Gone Home did not resonate with me at all. It was mostly boring, as the story that it told was rather predictable and cliché. I was hoping that it would eventually catch my interest by going in some unforseen direction but unfortunately that never happened. I will say that the main character's little sister isn't lacking in wit though. I did snicker a few times reading some of the things she had left behind. Still, not nearly enough to justify the price of admission.			"

At the start I was shocked, it made me scared of the dark!I played it at the middle of the night with all the lights off.I had no idea what I was in for!Walking down the game's hallway like *Creak! Creak!*""Okay I am fine."" I said to myself with chattering teeth. ""Yes I am fine, it is just the house. Just the house, nothing to worry about.""HUGE CREAK! + BIG CRASH OF THUNDER! + EVERYTHING CREEPY!(Insert inappropriate language at you discretion)""OH goodness! oh my! oh !   oh !   oh !   oh !""Heart attack is the best way to describe this ;)""Okay I am going to turn around right NOW! ARRRRGH! ... Whew okay nothing there!""Wait!Oh no this it the past where I turn around thinking I am safe. But I am not!Deeeeeep breath""Okay I am going to turn around again... NOW! GAHHHHHHHHHHHH!""Huh? Nothing there? Quick keep moving! GO GO GO! Yes a door thank goodness!Wait!""Is... is that t-t-talking? Oh flip! I am not even looking behind myself again not matter what!!""Which leaves only one choice!GULP!""Okay I am just going to slowly creep up to that door, yes slowly........slowly""So I get to the door.................................30 seconds later......I am still at the door. Just standing there.""Well it is now or never!""Nothing........HELP!I don't want to do this anymore!Summon COURAGE!....nothing......Buck it!LEEROY JENKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""I get inside...""Oh it is just the TV?""Whew!needless to say I felt a bit stupid.So I relax a bit...........EVERYTHING HAPPENS: LIGHTNING, THUNDER, CREAKS LIKE NONE OTHER! EVEN THE DARN LIGHTS FLICKER!!!!!NOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am done!Alt+F4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Runs off to bed and cowers under the covers!""No sleep tonight!""_________________________________________________So now you are thinking:Josh (it's me name fool) how it this game bad? That sounded awesome!Yes it was :)Allow me to explain.Do you remember that new reboot 'Tomb Raider' game? (those of you who don't just follow along)Well it is quite a good game right, at least the first half is.Then it changes to full stupid!This game changes to full stupid?No, but it does get stupid.The ""twist"" that I saw coming wayyyyyyyyyyyyy before it really happened is just weird.It doesn't even feel real; it just feels... I don't know... dumb?I mean come on!From that point on the 'twist' is the only thing the game cares about, it leaves the great atmosphere behind in favour of being a social issue warrior.You getting what I mean?I want to play a game not advertising!This is the way Simmy put it:""The beginning of this game was interesting, had a great atomosphere, and kept me invested enough to want to solve this ""games"" so-called mystery. Then the development team decide to do a complete 180 near the end of the game and throw everything straight out the window. The ending did not pay off, plain and simple.""Nuff said.TL;DRIf you are here for the great atmosphere (at the start) and clean scares i.e. you see nothing that is or was alive and no blood, that sort of thing.You will find them here; but I can't help but think there are other better games for that sort of thing.If you want a 'cheap' (in more than two ways) romance; well again nothing special to see here.And well that is it. That is all it contains.Did I enjoy the start?Heck yes!Would I buy it again?HECK NO!Sorry folks			"

												For real, do not buy this game when it goes off sale. I only bought it because it cost £3.00, originally it's price is £14.99, which in my opinion is totally not worth it for this short game.Honestly, the game is very well done and there's quite a bit exploring to do and a lot of effort has been put into it but like I say it is not worth the original price, at first you have no idea what to expect... although I feel like the horror themed atmosphere kind of gives off the wrong vibe, I was expecting some scary♥♥♥♥♥♥to happen but... it didn't, just because of the vibe of it, I did read that the game is not horror but it still seemed like it was supposed to be scary.Anyway, it is cool that other small details were cool like the mother/father side story as well as the uncle but I was a little disappointed because I expecting more from one of those stories in particular. I guess it was there to prolong the game a little. But I feel like it was just a huge build up for nothing.It's a ""cute"" story, I guess, but I felt disappointed. I literally said ""is that it?"" at the end. It is short and I didn't expect it to be any longer but I was definitely disappointed with the outcome of the story. I streamed the game play and a viewer even said ""I don't get it, what even happened?"". "

This game is far to short (I completed it entirely in 74 minutes), has too many contradictions in the story, characters (even sometimes in the design of the house itself), full of pretensiouness, focuses on the least interesting character, and has a silly ending that was needlessly complicated even though there was a very obvious win win solution. My advice is that if you are at all interested in this game then wait for it to go on sale for $5 or less. This game despite being engaging at times really is not worth the $20 price tag which is attached to it.			"

												Gone Home is a walking simulator set in an abandoned house buried in overt 90s nostalgia. You slowly walk around and read various pieces of paper while turning on lights.Occasionally there is narration of a not-particularly-interesting, very 90s-teen-romance sort of story. The writer obviously thought their writing was incredible, because there is nothing else to the game.Dawson's Creek the game, without any actors. Just a house, where you read pieces of paper.Anyone who enjoyed this game would be better served rewatching Dawson's Creek and My So Called Life reruns.			"

												I played this game to see if any of the silly ""its not a video game"" or ""TUMBLR SWJ"" Bullsh*t was in anyway accurate...Well I would call this a game but not one worth 20$ (I got it for 10$ and still not really worth that to me)Lets tackle this right out the gate... The radical feminist ""Fight the patriarchy"" stuff is nowhere as bad as some dummies would have you believe. Its a minuscule little magazine that is quickly forgotten about and is not part of the games overall message in anyway. Now onto the game,This is an explorative story game about young love as a homosexual, and if that is to ""SJW"" for you just f*ck off and play a different game. Although honestly I'd suggest most people to play another game anyway because this is a very very short game.Gone Home doesn't really dive into much more than the young love story, but it tries to dip its toes in other bigger topics... That is where it fails for me not properly handling the big topics, and glancing over them like there no big deal. I will say I did have a lot of fun exploring the house and the atmosphere was superb. There were times I genuinely felt like I was in a dark stormy house all alone. For me the story didn't grab me like I felt it should it just came off pretty bland, but the potential for a story is all around. It could of been a lot more if it truly dived in and tackled the big topics instead of using them as a light seasoning. Overall I didn't get why this game is the punching bag people have made it into its not really worth that level of hate. This isn't anywhere near the level of atrocious as something like Dear Esther. Its just a short explorative story driven game... with a sub-par story.Pros:- Nice Explorative Gameplay.- Great Immersive Atmosphere.- Coming to terms with homosexuality was handled and built up well.- Made me feel like I was in 1995 again.Cons:- (As a homosexual) The handling and dealing with homophobia wasn't great, only slight passing references.- Awful garage punk rock music.- Sub-par Story / Extremely short.- Made me feel like I was in 1995 again.6/10 - Alright, not really worth your time.

However for those who enjoy a good story, then this is a game you should own. I wouldn't pay $20 for it only because of how short it is. But, if you can get it for $10 or less, I'd say it's worth it.Overall - A game for those who want a good story and nothing more.Story - 9/10GameplayNothing else needs a rating.			"

A long girlish story of two feminists...Is it the plot that comes to your mind when you think about mysterious home full of stuff hinting at panaromal activity?The atmosphere is far beyond to be called unique as after the third chamber you understand that nothing interesting waits you ahead...I only like the scenes when you heard the sound of thunder and the room was flashed with a lightning as it turned you back the hope...disappointed hope.. to face a real cryptic end...Finally, according to the plot the girl says yes to her lady-love but I say no to this game!!!

												Interactive movie is all that needs to be said. The setting was nice, but throughout playing the game there is this constant expectation of... something, but that something never really happens. It feels that the game is here to convey the story, instead of the story being a vehicle for the game as a whole. The story was cute, if a little cliche (teenager discovering her love of girls, parents not supportive, runs away). I get that the game is supose to inflate the LGBT gaming ""roster"", but I feel that ultimately the game was disappointing, and dare I say it, kind of boring.

												I know next to nothing about computers. I can tell you it has windows 7 on it and that's about it. I'm assured by someone much more technologically advanced than I am that I have ""8gig Ram, 500gig hard drive... you know what? It's an Advent Monza N2. Google will give much better information than I can.Anyway. I mention because I bought Gone Home and the Laptop doesn't like it at all. Not a bit. I can play anything else with little problem but this game wouldn't even load at first. My technologically advanced friend had a look at it, got rid of something to do with '32' and that made it so the game would open. It's slow, juddery, takes an ice-age for the character to cross the room and generally isn't much fun, which is a shame because the game itself looks quite good.There is a lot of detail gone into it and an interesting plot. Someone cared very much about what they were creating. While attempting to look up ways to fix the game, given that a refund doesn't look possible, I saw that the creators bent over backwards to help people fix whatever problems they were having.If you have the braining abilities to fix any problems you might experience, go for it. What little I've played - bear in mind this isn't much - is quite good. If you're like me an know nothing, either ask someone who does or don't buy it.			"

Posted: September 18, 2014
												I'm surprised by the near unanimous praise this game has received from the game critics. There is, essentially, nothing to really like about this game. At its core, Gone Home a simplistic means of giving a story, one that is pieced together through wandering around a spooky house and retreiving keys to open locked doors, revealing letter fragments, postcards, and magazines which inform the player on the story at hand. Specific items will cue voice-over readings from ""Sam's Journal"" (Sam, being the player character's younger sister) which are the essential bits of plot. So, it's an explortion, plot-driven game dealing with societal issues. Sounds like a winner, right?In theory, I suppose so. The game starts off well enough, with an eerie introduction to the ""psycho house"" and the first 15 minutes or so are pure exploration. We see the reamains of the father's book writings and the mother's job as a park ranger. It's interesting to slowly learn about this family's life... until you go upstairs. (a light spoiler or two may follow, so be warned. Nothing serious, just conceptual stuff). The plot begins its course, revolving around Sam, and her love life. What began with such a promising opening becomes a series of ""pseudo-exploration"" journeys (you're really just looking for the next page to move the damn plot along), while Sam delivers an incredibly sappy and cliche love story through her diary pages. And my, how saccharine it is. Just because you change the gender roles of those involved does not automatically make a stroy like this ""innovative and unique."" Sure, it's a change in perspective, but it follows the same beats, the same events that drive nearly every other teen romance ever. All the creepy atmosphere and dark undertones are completely wasted by the end. It really is unfortunate.A few other minor gripes plague my view of Gone Home. There is no player marker on the map (which, admittedly, isn't used too often), which had me lost a few times. Thankfully, the house isn't too complex so the confusion wasn't a huge deal. Another downside is the game's runtime. It can easly be beaten in under an hour, and the maximum amount of time one can spend in this game cannot be more than 2 hours (assuming they just play through the story once). There's little reason to return, and no interesting plot threads to keep you thinking. Such a short runtime has had me wonder whether this would have worked better as a short film, or a music video or SOMETHING other than a game. Although, in that case, it would probably be worse than it already is, because the story would be given directly, as opposed to the more ""vignette-esque"" presentation in the game. In any event, the game is too short to be a game. If it had to be this short, and the story could not have been told in any other format, I would argue the game should not have been made at all. I don't want to spend money on a game that will only keep me entertained for one hour, and it's even worse considering this is not a particularily good one to begin with. In short, Gone Home is a lackluster title that showed brief glimmers of promise. It was rather disappointing to essntially watch a game crumble before my eyes. 2/5			"

												If you ever wanted to experience how much fun it possibly could be,when your expensive Graphics-card is getting fried by a rather simple 3D-game,although you probably haven't seen more of it yet than a rotating cassette tape as the first loading screen - - then i tell you, go ahead and buy this game!Possibly you could have a lot more fun, like i did if you are not fast enough to try to get out of the loading screen, whose tape is rotating and rotating and rotating and rotating...and are suddenly forced to reset your machine, funnily you will know the time has come,when the cassette tape isn't rotating any more but no traces of any game in sight - - because then the PC will have gone completely frozen.Oh boy DID i have fun - inside the PC the GPU is experiencing a meltdown, but the rest of the system is ""frozen"",how funny is that, isn't it? Because strg-alt-del won't work anymore in this case...Or you are a lazy person and let things go its way and wanna watch the still-picture of a once rotating tape a further minute longer or so,(when you still believe that the game is just loading some files, but you can't say for sure, because the fan noise of your Graphics got so loud you can't hear the reading patterns of your hard-disks anymore...) until your machine will restart itself, as a result from the overheating.Sometimes the lazy way won't work though, and the machine doesn't reset itself,so you won't get around switching off your machine manually to give it some rest for a few seconds and let your graphics card cool down a bit.Anyway, it's getting even more interesting from then on, when you could be busily watching a light-blue coloured windows screen, with your OS testing file integrity of your hard disks, and if you have even greater luck,you will get completely thrilled when you watch your OS trying to repair some completely broken files from switching off the machine without having done the usual properly shutdown...Yeah, you could do this a few more times for expandig all the fun up to the max,and i promise with the following method you still may have a pretty good timeeven without ever touching the start-button of the game again,yay, three hours will fly by as if it had only been 20 minutes, to enjoy this pleasure you just have to be busy reading in the forum-section adressing technical problems, and you may find, no, you WILL find others having the same problem like you and me,but being completely ignored...at least regarding the funny boiling-GPU issue, but only if you managed to find these lucky souls if you fully dig your way through the so-far 280 threads,reading about the weirdest issues you heard about for probably a long time...http://steamcommunity.com/app/232430/discussions/1/Doing all this could squeeze out a full day of good reading time,so i have to admit i got pretty good bang-for-the-buck. Me < still reading in the forums, no, not in the forums anymore, i begin to google for a solution to get the serios stuff out from this game,the stuff i read about in some reviews in steam and other sites.Maybe you don't get all this diverting entertainment and only have to switch off your anti-virus-scanner,or only have to rename some files, or have to operate deeper in the bowels of some games files to get this piece-of-**** to work on your machine,i.e. your hardware doesn't get involved like mine did. Then poor you :-(For the masochist in me, it was a great experience !umm... i have to admit, until i tried to start this game i didn't even know i had a liability to masochism...- so the conclusion is, i already got a valuable life lesson out of this game, even without having played it for one second !This must be magic.But if you doubt you could be such a lucky dog like me getting all the unexpected and unpromised amusing time i had from buying this game,then of course don't fall for the lure especially when it's on a steam-sale...That's the second lesson i learned today:steer clear of any game, especially for this one, until you didn't have a look into it's forums,and if you still want to buy the game i tell you - for learning you're a masochist, you don't have to shell out all the bucks -you simply just could remove the fan of your hot GPU,and give your harddisks some good spanking to their case, while they're busy working...

												I was apprehensive about buying this game due to the negative user reviews, but I was curious to play it given the high scores it received from professional reviewers, so I purchased it when it was on sale for very cheap. I'm not motivated enough to organize my thoughts to the extent that I can fully express my disappointment with the game, especially given that I will likely be repeating what previous reviews have said, but after completing it I am simply bewildered that Gone Home has received the acclaim that it has.Understand that if you buy this game at full price, you are being completely ripped off. I went through the game very leisurely on an afternoon and finished it in a couple of hours. It is also pure narrative, containing no puzzles of any kind. I didn't find the story particularly engaging, and I realized long before its conclusion that the reason no members of the main character's family were home would not be remotely interesting. I do appreciate when games (and media in general) touch on themes that are underrepresented, but this game does so in a way that is far too obvious; if the player was 15 minutes into the game and then learned what unfolds in the rest of the narrative, he/she would not receive any surprises. One specific thing I did appreciate about way the story of Gone Home was presented was the subtle presentation of the nature of the parents' relationship, allowing the player to reach his/her own conclusions about, for example, the irony of the tumult present within their marriage despite their harsh judgment of their daughter's relationship.I hesitate to refer to Gone Home as a game, as it truly just amounts to walking through the house, reading notes, and listening to recordings of the main character's sister. Picking up objects in the house adds nothing to the game, so if you are hoping at least for item investigation in the vein of L.A. Noire crime scenes, you will be completely disappointed. Gameplay-wise, the one thing you do in the game, walking, isn't even particularly fluid. Walking through the house was not a fun experience.Even if this game had been free, it still wouldn't have been worth the time I spent playing it. Do not let the high review scores fool you into thinking that you should at least play this game so that you can know this segment of the video game canon. Its sole contribution is having a story that revolves around adolescent homosexuality, and it does not even do that in a way that is remotely interesting or innovative. Not only does this game not do anything new, it strips out all elements that make a game fun to play (or that actually make a game a game).This is coming from someone who loves video games of all kinds as an art form, considers unique indie games such as Braid and Limbo among his favorite games: I would not recommend buying this game at any price. I would not even recommend spending the time playing this game if you receive it for free. If you must, look up the audio recordings and listen to them, and you will truly have just about the full experience that you would if you had spent the couple of hours that it takes to trudge around the house. I think the reviewers who gave this game so much hype are completely mistaken about its quality, and I will never fathom how it could remotely be in the conversation for Game of the Year in the same year that saw the release of The Last of Us.

												I have no problem with games defined as ""walking simulators"". The Stanley Parable was funny and very enjoyable, as was Jazzpunk, Fract OSC has a great music element, Naissancee had some great platforming and interesting exploration, and Kairo had some cool, minimalistic puzzles. Correction, I like walking simulators if there's something to do in the game.There is nothing to do in Gone Home. Going into this game, I expected a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece the way the review scores were mapped out. Every reviewer was basically giving this unlimited amounts of praise. Turns out that this was a poorly written short story disguised as a ""game.""In Gone Home, you play as a person who goes home to see their family, but realizes no one is home. You go inside and walk around, to try to find journals to piece together a ""story"". The game takes around an hour to finish and it will be a thoroughly unenjoyable one. First of all, there really is no gameplay. If holding the W key and clicking the Left Mouse Button often is called gameplay to you, then you'll have a fun time. I appreciate the design, but if you're making a short story, MAKE A ♥♥♥♥ING SHORT STORY. If I pay money for a game, I'm paying money for a game. Don't give me this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about how it is an experience, or something like that. This is supposed to be a game. I expect a game. The other only thing that the game really has is story. And boy, they couldn't even do that right.If people tell you the story is engaging, they are certainly lying to you. The story is something I person cannot relate with , and I doubt 90% of people will be able to either. It also doesn't help that this is the most cliched story ever. You'll probably be able to guess the ending halfway through the game, and if you can't, you haven't read enough sappy love tales. This game probably would have been better IF they made a good story. If a walking simulator has a fascinating story, then I will be able to enjoy it. Unfortunately this falls in the same category as garbage video games like Dear Esther, which have the worst of both worlds when it comes to gameplay and story. I'm sick of people saying that this game is amazing, because this isn't even a game. This is an interactive story, that sounds like it was written by a Grade 6 child who was forced to write a story about life experiences or something like that.If you were even thinking about purchasing this game, turn away and buy something else. Luckily I had this in a bundle, but please don't drop 20 bucks, or 5 bucks even for this game. If you search up ""Lesbian Love Story"" online, you'll find thousands of stories better than this. This is an insult to gaming and gamers alike.			"

												While Gone Home contains a well written, gripping undeniably moving story I honestly can not recommend this game to anyone. Why? Because in the (roughly) two hours it took me to complete the game I did little more than walk around the titular home flicking on light switches, examining objects and listening to diary recordings. The problem, in a nutshell, is that there is not really any actual game play.While I am completely for games expanding the gaming medium and giving us deep, well crafted stories the fact that the medium is games requires there to be some actual game in there. Gone Home does not even require you to solve puzzles. Indeed, you need not examine any of the objects in the game at all to reach its end as simply wandering around the house will eventually lead you to the conclusion. Yes, if you did that you'd miss a wonderful story and some subtle back story on the characters but the point it is can be done. Gone Home tried something different in being all about story and very minimum game play. However, this is to the game's detriment because (I would assume) even the most casual of gamer would expect some kind of game play element and Gone Home simply provides none. "

A well told story that you can experience just as well watching someone else play through. Check youtube if you are interested.Gone Home has some of the best writing and storytelling you'll find in a game, but there isn't much else besides. It is a very guided experience. If you go into it expecting an interactive short story, you might be more satisfied than if you bought it as a game.

												It's a very well crafted interactive experience. I'm reluctant to recommend Gone Home because I could not relate to it at all. I got all the 90's references but I had a very hard time empathizing with the experience and the characters. Maybe I had to be a teenage girl in the 90's to grasp it. It was just uninteresting to me. By comparison, Dear Esther was more appealing and that was dry.That said, the narrative devices are very artfully implemented. The structure truly demonstrates the way that only an interactive medium like games can deliver such an experience. I liken it to a Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller walk.I enjoy experiencing interactive narratives but I'd prefer a more interesting narrative than Gone Home.			"

												The most beautiful game I ever played in my entire life, now I cry at night everytime.It's the touching story of two 17 years old lesbians.2/10 because I didn't see boobs.Seriously, this game sucks and whoever said it had a great story should be brutally killed.If you really want to try it out I suggest you to wait for a big sale because it's less than two hours long and you just walk around the house reading stuff.

												It's a teenage love story with lesbians. The story is the only reason to play it, and it's not a good one. The main character, Sam, isn't interesting at all. She's just the typical lesbian archetype. The father seems a little more interesting, in that he has such trouble in his writing. The mother and character you control are far too under developed. Sam's belongings are scattered across the house, and the cassettes are placed in strange places. The real mystery is how a bad writer and an enviormentalist can afford such a big and complex house.

												Gone Home is a short, lightly interactive storytelling type experience. You play a character that comes home and solves a family mystery by searching the house for clues. Unfortunately, the solution to the mystery is largely juvenile and uninteresting in my opinion, but even more distressing, the act of solving the mystery is not a particularly harrowing experience either.Though I am glad to see this type of story telling explored, this particular game did very little for me.

												While the story is very well done, it is not worth more than $5. The game is very short and can be completed in just over 1hr and 30min. The game allows you to pick up a lot of objects but you never use any of them (well except keys). The story elements of the parents and the paranormal force are never expanded on and are just very small (and some practically pointless) pieces to the story.  If you can get it cheap, pick it up for the good story.			"

												As I was playing this game for 30 minutes I started to have the feeling that the makers really created something interesting. One main story and multiple sub stories around it, maybe getting intertwined? But then, an hour into the game I got the feeling that the main story wasn't really that special, but who knows. And then, less than 2 hours into the game the end credits rolled past after a very predictable, cheesy and anticlimactic ending. I am glad I did not pay more than € 5,- for this, but even that was to much.			"

												Nicely designed game; lots of detail and 90’s nostalgia all over the place. And that’s about everything good about it. You’re tricked into believing there’s some kind of supernatural horror story going on; you come across creepy answering machine messages, flickering lights, mysterious ghost stories, etc. However, as you progress further you start realizing the horrible truth; NOTHING scary or even slightly disturbing is going to happen. At all. Turns out to be one of those storytelling games, and one with an incredibly lame story too.Two hours of pretty straightforward, repetitive gameplay are definitely not worth the 20 dollars. Buy it now it’s 75% off on sale or don’t buy it at all.			"

												Gone Home is amazing! Some people call a ""walking sim"" but ""Detective sim"" is a better description of what your character does: searches for clues to find out what happened before she arrived at the scene.The writing and voice acting is great. But the most impressive thing is how the story is spread throughout the house in a way that makes it an interesting story but still makes sense - i.e. the objects you find in a kitchen are kitchen objects, it's not like someone just left you a trail of notes around the house.

												The game was alright, and it had a fuzzy warm welcoming, but, if I brought the game with its full price (20) Id have a heart attact. It offered really good ideas, and I wished that other games offered more of this instead of just shooting or slicing things. Sweet thank god I got this on super discount however. It is certainly NOT for everyone, but mainly for people that like to explore and read things. So its more of an interactive adventure EXPERIENCE. No element of game should EVER be introduced in the type here. I haven't played Dear Ester or Carter yet, but this game can certainly enter in the category.I finished the game in under 2 hours.Also, what was with the terrible photos? they looked disfigured.I hope if they do another game, they have more interesting things to do, or locations to travel, or objects to interact more with than simply sticking cassetes to listen to girls scream.

It starts of as a horror-like game, and succeeds; it has incredible atmosphere and an amazing use of Nothing is Scarier.Turns out it's actually a lesbian love story.Now, separate, both of these are fine, but it tricks you into thinking it's a horror game then suddenly goes ""actually it's not lol"".

Also the story got at 1 point too predictable in the outcome.Really I thought, as I bought it out of pure curiosity from checking screenshots, it would be a little darker and creepier with maybe a little bit of blood here and there, a little bit like law and order or some other investigative game.That was a littlebit letdown.

												Ah, what to say about this game.First off, Gone Home is not a game in the usual sense.  There's no monsters to kill, no levels to gain, no achievements, no fantasy world to conquer.If you are looking for those things, look elsewhere.It's more of an interactive story.  But unlike the Telltale stories, there's no real choices to make, you are just discovering more and more of the story as you progress through the game.At this point you might be thinking, this doesn't sound like much.  And in a way, it's not.  I played through the story in 2 hours.  But what this game does, it does well.  Great atmosphere, great story.  Rarely does a game cause you to feel something when you play it - and this game did that, not for some random fantasy character that has no ties to anything real either.  No, this game reminded me how it felt to be in love.  Something that I have not felt in some time and may never feel again.  For that alone, Gone Home is pretty close to a masterpiece in my opinion.			"

												I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking it all in, chiseling each moment into the best functioning parts of my brain. This is an emotional, psychological experience. It plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, The Fullbright Company hated being The Fullbright Company, and this is the result. The experience and emotions tied to playing this game are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that real people created this, it's clear that The Fullbright Company must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since Romero. Breathing people made this game! And I can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.			"

												Gone Home is not a game; it's an interactive story. I can respect that as a genre, but I feel this game could've been so much more. I don't care what PC Gamer or IGN said, I honestly wasn't blown away by the story. I didn't find it nearly as deep or immersive as the critics hype it up to be. The characters feel flat because we're not really told that much about them. You're supposed to go hunt around for notes and things to learn more about them, but even then, I felt like I was missing something. The in-depth character development just wasn't there. Overall, as a story, it's just too broad and underdeveloped. I dunno; it just feels like Thomas Was Alone and Papers, Please did a better job of evoking character depth and emotion than this game did.I think part of the reason I was disappointed was because I went in expecting a game laced with horror elements.  That's how it opened, anyway; dark and stormy night, a lot of lights turned off... But then it just gave me this. There's virtually no gameplay to speak of other than wandering around from place to place and occasionally interacting with things to keep the story going, but that's really it. I could've forgiven that if the story wasn't so shallow and confused (Actually, I really can't quite find the right words to describe the story). I also feel I spent too much time wandering around trying to figure out where I'm supposed to go or what to do.I wouldn't say this is the best indie game of the year. I'd give that title to a game like The Stanley Parable or Papers, Please. Those games really mess with your mind and make you question yourself as a person. Gone Home is a reasonable concept that fell short in execution. If you're really curious, wait for it to get cheaper; this game is not worth full price, and I can't really recommend it even then.

												Gone Home is not a game for everyone.  There’s no combat, no action, no cutscenes, no stats, no leveling up, and no heroics.  It’s a short experience, and those who are looking at a strict dollars to hours ratio will find Gone Home one of the worst monetary investments available on the market (especially at its original retail price).  That said, Gone Home is intimately unique and compelling game for those who are drawn to a story mechanic which is tragically underrepresented in video games -- the human experience.In Gone Home, you play a young 20-something woman who has come back from travelling Europe on a late flight home in the 1990s. Gameplay starts just outside the home, where you find the house seemingly vacant with some hints that something may be wrong.  The rest is up to you to figure out by exploring the house and investigating what happened and where everybody is.  Primarily, you are following the story of your younger sister, but your parents and the old tenant of the home also form a bit of a side story -- should you choose to piece it together.Occasionally you will pick up an item which will trigger a small journal entry from your sister, but outside of that, the entire story is really yours to unfold via inference.  Gone Home draws no connections for you, but rather lets you connect the dots yourself as your travel from room to room and pick up items or just observe the detailed environment around you.  You could choose not to do this and beeline to the end of the game, but fleshing out the world in which you and your family live is the primary satisfaction of Gone Home.It certainly helps that the setting is expertly realized.  Gone Home takes place in the 1990’s, ostensibly to help explain the plethora of hand-written notes strewn about the house which help with unravelling the mystery of the house. But the entire home is crafted with obvious obsession to detail -- you’ll find lots of references to 1990s pop culture and fashion, and those living in the Pacific NW will find a lot of familiar names and places which are central to its Oregon setting.  Occasionally it does feel like Gone Home is almost pandering its setting a little too much to those who will appreciate the references, but for the most part I found it well done.The second brilliant part of Gone Home is hard to talk about without ruining the narrative a little (so if you are serious about playing this game and have not done so, maybe skip this paragraph).  Gone Home takes place at night, during a thunderstorm, in an old house with a mysterious (perhaps supernatural) history.  It’s not an inherently scary game, but it’s undeniably spooky at times.  The catch is that Gone Home makes its presentation at face value -- it lets the player craft the story into something more than it really is based on the expectations of it being a video game.  Gone Home plays on these expectations in some genius ways, and at the end of the game leaves the player with a refreshing narrative not about saving the world or killing the bad guy, but about an experience that each and every player can relate to in some way that is meaningful and personal.  If you’re the type of player looking for bang-for-buck, or something more action-oriented, Gone Home was never going to be your game and that’s fine. But everyone else should consider this a must-play, if nothing else because it is a wonderful and refreshing diversion from the norm.			"

												Don't pay 20 dollars for this please. I got it in a humble bundle as a bonus to another game I wanted. To sum it up the game is over pretentious and feels awfully ful of itself. In reality the story is average to below average. This is not the correct way to incorperate females in video games. The narritive should feel as a bonus not as a full blown what the game is about. There is ways to promote gays and lesbians in video games and this is far from it. This is as subtle as a gay pride parade. I would love smart developers to come forward and make a great game with gay or lesbian protaginist in a natural way......oh wait they did it is called Undertale.Go spend your 20 dollars on two copies of undertale.

												Gone Home has good ideas for what it's going for, but the execution is bland and mundane.  The game biggest problem is not on it's story, but it's weak interactive gameplay that does very little new things for the genre.  The puzzles are basically non existent in an experience of the game this painfully short in about 30 minutes, it just shows the poor value it offers.The visual are average at best, the look and the feel of the game is very 90's nostalgia feel but that's all it does, and the atmopshere is ok, I did get creeped out a bit, but the game loses its tension so quickly that it becomes cliche.  Hell, the whole setting and ideas are cliche that I've already seen in movies and better games.The story is nothing original, it's just another melodramatic story that was already told before.  The narrative is told through voice over journal of Samantha, letters and paperworks that you'll find in the house, I will give props to the voice acting for the character Samantha as she does bring this character to life with her performence.  The rest of the characters are one dimension, you won't care about them at all.  As for the rest of the game that commands $20 dollars is outrageous for an overrated title. Take my advice: Don't Play This Game!			"

												So I just bought this game on sale for roughly 3$ and the game is worth it as that. This game is more of an interactive visual novel, where you play as a teen girl in 1995, who comes home to find your sisters missing and your parents on vacation. Events unfold as you find notes that trigger audio dialouge of the sister explaining the set piece of the story as you gather clues in your mind as to whats going on. The game has an almost horror-feel to it in the beginning but you start to understand that might not be the case various times throughout the game. The game is about 2 hours long and has many easter eggs and tidbits that you may not realize your first playthrough (if your even considering playing it again).The story was good for what it was, and its definitely worth the experience, however would feel incredibly dissapointed to buy this at full price for the reason being that you could argue that this is almost not a game and for that I would not recommend this to most people.

												After playing this... this... I don’t even know.Well, it's not a ""game,"" it's more of a... a... an activity. It's an activity, much akin to coloring or picking at an old scab. And for that matter, you don't really ""play"" it either. You sort of just wander around fiddling with the objects, trying to find the thing that makes the story progress. It's more of an experience. You just kind of… just… do it. You finish it. That’s it.So, after finishing this activity…I rolled my eyes harder than The Exorcist.I rolled my eyes so hard that I went blind. I’m blind now. I don’t even know how I’m writing this right now. Gone Home made me go blind.I had a lot of people tell me not to play this ga--- I mean “finish” this “activity.”However, before I judge anything, I always like to give it the chance . So I did it anyway. When I got around to experiencing it, the bar was set pretty low to begin with because of all the negative things I heard. Meaning that really anything could surpass it and impress me, right?If you think that, you’d be wrong. Well, it was sort of interesting in the beginning, just getting used to how everything worked. Being alone in the house with a bunch of creepy noises was unnerving. Sort of reminded me of when I was a kid growing up in a big old house. But once I got settled in, I realized how… bored I actually was. I was able to figure out the “twist” about halfway through, but saw it through to completion anyway. I tricked a friend into buying it for me for $4.99 during the Steam summer games sale, and I still somehow feel ripped off.  I can’t imagine how the people who paid $19.99 for it feel.Many would argue that it’s supposed to be all about the story, and not the “gameplay” (and those quotation marks could NOT be more sarcastic).  But, again, the story is absolute tripe. Again, I was able to figure out the ending halfway through,  and it wasn’t nearly as deep and moving as people like Adam Sessler would lead people to believe. He even gave it his “Game of the Year” for 2013.  Wow, a game that’s not even a game winning “Game of the Year.” And I LOVE Adam Sessler. But sorry kiddo, you’re wrong on this one. This is not a game. It's a story-telling activity disguised in a video game-like format. And the story's not even all that good. I mean, maybe if the story were a bit more interesting...Well, I suppose the story might be moving for people who have gone through/are going through the same struggles as the characters. However, I personally DO know exactly what the little sister is going though, having gone through some of the same struggles myself (that’s about as much as I can say without spoiling it.) But even I did not find it as satisfying as “game journalist” (more sarcastic quotes) made it out to be. And again, my bar was set pretty damn low. And it couldn’t even surpass my low expectations. And this is the kind of game that should appeal to exactly someone like me. It's nice to see a game go this route as far as character traits go. But...Nope. Just nope.I don’t really know what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn’t this.To wrap this up, I can never recommend this. However, I don’t blame you if you want to experience it yourself. Like most people. I don’t want someone making my mind up for me, I want to do it for myself. Trust fellow gamers, not paid reviewers.However, if you can trick someone else into paying for it for you, do that.			"

												I was disappointed with this game.  I hesitate to even call it a game; it's really interactive fiction.  The story is good, and the voice acting is great, but there's just not much to actually do.  I was prepared to solve a mystery, and started searching for clues, but it isn't even that involved.  Just pick up different pieces of paper and listen to the story being told.  That's it.  And although the story is good, I'd figured out 90% of what happened to the sister very early on since it's not a novel story.In short, it's high quality, but still lacking.			"

												I bought, downloaded, installed and played through the entire game in 2 hours. The graphics and ambiance as well as the music and beaucoup of period pop references really lent a certain depth to what essentially is a coming of age love story. But that's it. No mystery, no puzzles, no conflict, no supernatural goings on. I felt mostly like this was more like a proof of concept for a game engine than an actual game. But hey, for $5.00, it was worth a try. It got rave critical reviews, but that, in the end, does not always a worthy purchase make. Tough to recommend it unless it was at the $5.00 price I paid for it.			"

												A lot of people give this game awesome reviews, and from what I've heard it delivered on everything. The atmosphere is spot on, the story is believable, the mystery is alive, and the whole thing feels very real. However, what nobody told me is that the game is boring. I quit playing three times and had to force myself to sit down to finish the story in the end.At first it was fun finding little things spread throughout the house and making the story better known and finding little secrets is always satisfying, but after looking through five rooms I lost the investment for the rest of the game. There are a couple of little things thrown in that get some sort of amused reaction from me, but the game wasn't worth the price. Save your time and money and just have someone else tell you what happens. The game delivers on what it promised, but with far too little entertainment value of any sort to be worth considering.			"

This by itself wouldn't be too bad if it were an amazing game and had replayability, but sadly neither of those are present with this game.The story was only so-so.  It started out quite strong, and was half-way decent most of the way through, but when I got to the ending it left me feeling as if I just wasted the last hour and a half or so of my time.I managed to get this on sale for only a couple bucks, so I'm not too disappointed, but for full price of $20 I really don't recommend this to anyone.

Gone Home				* 7/10I was attracted by this game because of the attention it had and because A friend of mine was playing on PS4, so I decided to give it a shot.Gone home is a walking simulator, so you just... walk... and interact with items around the house to better understand what the developer want to tell you.You're Kaitlin Greenbriar and you've just arrived home after travelling abroad for a year. Nobody's home and that's all the game will tell you. According to the genre description you'll have to walk around the house to look for items, notes, writings, letters and anything else that can be picked up as it might keep some clue to better understand the context and what happened in your house. Each time you'll read an important note or examine an important object a voice will tell a story, in form of a diary message.The house is really immense and holds ""secrets"" and closed zones that will motivate you to ""investigate"" further.Rooms and ambiences are built with care and attention to details and elements of decoration even though models and textures are not very detailed.The game has been developed with Unity and I can't really be much positive about this as I haven't still played a well optimized game built with Unity. It usualy gives really high and pretty details and models (layers of fear) with high Hardware requirements, or games with a modest look but still be heavy as hell such as Gone Home. Even with detailed shadows off it hardly renders over 30 FPS and for some unknown reason every time I launch the game it kind of freezes every first time I try to open the graphics menu and I have to CTRL+ALT+DEL And restore the game's windows to find the Graphics menu magically opened.There's no music ingame. If you want it you can interact with items around the house, as you will find musicassettes with tape players and also a gramophone. But they are kind of related to the story as they mostly reflect the characters to whom they belong.What left me kind of disappointed is the mood of the game, as this empty and dark house really gives chills and there are supernatural subplots that deviate your attention from the main story and makes you more interested in them except that this IS NOT a horror game and you will always suspect the opposite for the whole time until the end that will confirm you that there's no supernatural, never was and it has nothing to do with the main story. I mean it's okay to create subplots or divert your attention and hit you with a final revelation but i think they did too well.+++PROs+++ STORY. Thrown in your giant home after a long travel, everyone gone, you have to peek around to understand what happened and where is everyone. All the elements and documents will tell you more about your family, their story and nature, and you will feel involved with them as their everyday stories will catch your interest. This is the real core of this game.---CONs--- STORY & MOOD. Unfortunately a couple of the subplots might divert your attention too much and the dark rooms, little revelations and the emptiness of the house will only boost interest feeding the feeling this game is going to get a Horror twist... But it doesn't. And it doesn't have to because that's not the point of the game and I believe the developers have pushed this unnecessary mood a bit too much. ENGINE. I still haven't played a game built with unity that is well optimized. Gone Home doesn't excel with High poly models or great textures, nor it has so many effects in game, yet it was hard to play with more than 30 FPS. I also had to turn off some shadow details to get those performances.ACHIEVEMENTS. There are no achievements but there are trophies for the PS4 release. Now, I did my research and seems like the developers themselves are explicitly working on some bugfux release that will include achievements themselves. The moment I'll notice the update I will edit my review, but until now this point will stay here, even if it's something useless as achievements I can't stand differences in releases ""Because Sony""...I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												Gone Home is something I decided to purchase recently on Steam as it had very positive reviews and a few reviewers I like said it was worth checking out.I'm not unfamiliar with the concept of a ""walking"" simulator, in which the player is only allowed the sole mechanic of interacting with objects in game while a story plays out or is narrated or revealed. In other words, coventional gaming mechanics many associate with the idea of gaming, such as jumping alongside any form of combat mixed with very complex puzzle solving, is ignored. The Stanley Parable, with the aid of the dulcet tones of Kevan Brighting, is also such a game.The difference between the two is substance.The Stanley Parable is a very meta game that deliberately relies on tropes to then dismantle them in front of the players' eyes; it brings into question the players' interpretation of a game based or normative factors prevalent in other triple A titles, often referencing such games. The player finds themselves in an empty office at the beginning, dystopian vibes interwoven in the surrounding textures, as a narrator tries to give said player a ""ride"" through the ""amusement"" tracks of the gameplay itself in all its beautiful linearity. In gaming, this is basically the idea of getting from point A to point B often through arbitrary means. It's incredibly well done, in part thanks to the hilarious narration of Kevan Brighting.However, the same can't be said for Gone Home. Gone Home is in short an interactive story lacking any substance. There are no alternatives to the path, there are no different angles in which to tackle the path and it isn't metaludological, nor is it a metanarrative. I really wanted to like it, but sadly the narrative of ""this stuff really matters"" teen-angst narrative is the biggest pile of trope laden crap I've experienced.There is a reason why game mechanic ""memes"" that frequent some of the biggest franchises of all time, such as Mario, Zelda, WoW, Halo, Fallout, etc., are recursive, and why there exists a stark trench between story telling in novel execution and game execution for a reason. This isn't to say that story telling can't be great in games; I found myself falling for the lore of The Elder Scroll, Witcher and Deus Ex universes for the complexity of their cinematic narratives.Yet I would have not bothered with any of them if they were solely cinematic. If something is solely cinematic with the illusion of ""gameplay"" through QTEs or ""click X"" to get a little more dialogue, then perhaps it should be a TV or animated series or a movie, or perhaps a light/visual novel or in fact novel. I don't find triple A games, or many of the indie games I tend to play, tackling small segmentary slice of life narratives for good reason; they're trite, very boring to go through and highly unplayable in terms of replay value.

												After reading a intriguing review of Gone Home from an intellectual known as Nush, I decided to check it out, a game which I overlooked when I first saw the cover; thinking it's nothing special until I've watched the launch trailer and was captivated by the ambient music and narration of what I thought would be a wonderful story. I eventually ordered Gone Home and played it all the way through from beginning to end; a poignant journey of discovery and unfolding of a story which I'll hold close to my heart as it reminds me of the rare old school love that seem to no longer exist in this day and age.

												I don't understand how this is a ""captivating"" story. The ""mystery"" is trying to find someone who isn't home. They ""twist"" in her character flaw is telegraphed about 5 minutes into it. She comes across as completely self absorbed and infatuated with someone who is absolutely unlikable. Plot threads about a ghost, a dead grandfather, etc are red herrings that just pull you through because the core story isn't good enough.

												The idea of rummaging through the empty creepy family mansion belonging to a mysterious pharmacist is appealing at first, however, the story gets pretty boring and all teenage-drama like. I felt that the storylines of Oscar Masan and trouble in the family were not explored to their fullest (and they're potentially the more interesting ones).The gameplay is strictly contemplative. There are few things to do but walk and around, open cupboards/drawers/doors/panels, read notes and collect keys to locked doors. The only meaningful interaction of items with the game world boils down to sticking tapes into stereos to play them.To the game's credit, it is quite atmospheric. To maximize the immersion, I recommend to play through the whole game at once in one night while being alone at home. The soundtrack is alright as well.And yes, you can finish it in one night, as you'd struggle to spend much more than 3 hrs, which brings us to the question of the day - $19.99 for this?!!! This is a ripoff if I ever saw one! Don't buy this unless it's at the very least 75% off.			"

												Only  a very specific type of person will really enjoy this game, I feel.You're a 20 year old girl, coming home from a year abroad in Europe.  You come to your family's home, and it's completely empty.  Where's your little sister?  Where are your parents?This could sound like an exciting mystery, but actually the plot is very mundane.  There's no exciting reason why everyone's gone, and within the first 15 minutes of the game, you can easily guess what the main ""problem"" of the game's plot is, and why your sister is gone.So, you walk around the house, examine various notes and clippings written by family members, and you can piece together what has happened in your year away from home.  That's the whole game, and it's not very interesting.  If you like ""slice of life"" stuff, you may enjoy it.  But everyone else, this is two and a half hours of ""Meh"".			"

												The developer knows how to tell a story well, and how to make the player work for it without getting stuck.  However, the story was not to my taste and simply feels like an attempt to lunge into current fads and happenings.			"

												Got this through the Humble Bundle, and just finished 'playing' through. This isn't a game, it's a story. A rather poor story about two lesbians in the mid-90's. 2/10 for creepy factor, I think my heart stopped a few times thanks to the atmosphere.			"

												""I have Gone Home and I have gone home but I am not home."" -  Robert Yang from PC GamerI was slightly interested in Gone Home. It looked like some sort of creepy exploration game, that slowly builds the tension as you discover more and more. However my interest disappeared more or less when I learned it was hardly a two hour experience for the price of 20 dollars. I watched a video of the first few minutes of the game, it seemed to have that atmosphere I liked yet I still just lost complete interest. No way I was gonna buy that for 20 dollars for such a short amount of time. Of course, I, like everyone else saw the sharp difference between critics and players. Which more often than not, I agree with the players. I know how current video game critics are, and I have disagreed with most of them and their rave reviews of the latest innovative indie game or the latest flashy AAA game. Regardless, I went in with an open mind, I could easily enjoy the game. I didn't expect much, I suppose that gives the game a better chance to impress me.The story was lacking, it didn't surpass my already nonexistant expectations of the game. The story just happens as you collect the various items, you slowly find out about how your sister was shunned by everyone at school and eventually found love with another girl. That's really it. Sure, you get some more detail about how her family denies her love for another woman, and some nice tidbits about the activities they do together and the ideas of their future, yet it all fell flat. It happened, and I felt no substance. Nothing truly interesting, nothing that made me enjoy each journal entry. It felt bare, maybe even forced; each journal entry is quick and useless. I'm not one for love stories, yet I have enjoyed love stories in various non-romance genres; this is just a story of your young sister falling in love with another girl and then running off with her. I saw the twist coming, which shouldn't impact the quality of the story but yet the story had nothing going for it anyway. The characters aren't bad, the setting isn't bad, their struggles aren't bad, it just wasn't interesting; it had not a single thing going for it. It just happened, and then it was over. Story is certainly the primary focus of the game, the experience finishes before it even starts; Full Bright's narrative will leave a lackluster taste in your mouth, it's clear that the story wants to be meaningful yet never works for it. The game's atmosphere is one of the few things I think game does fairly well with. It's a nice flashback to the mid-90s. From Street Fighter to Pulp fiction, every little reference fits perfectly. It was nice seeing the details over the CD/LP player. Even the cover art of the textbooks scream 90s. They nailed making the house feel like it belongs in the 90s. The house itself feels creepy, not a soul in the home that seems both alive with knit-knacks everywhere while dead with some barren rooms filled only with boxes. The few places that feel they have life to them are both refreshing and creepy. The darkness certainly adds another edge to the creepiness yet all this creepiness and potiental terror soon washes away when you realize the game only cares about the light exploration; adding no depth to the atmosphere. While the game has an eye for detail of the era, it lacks detail in everything else. The house is lifeless in the wrong way possible, there were no extra details provided to the experience. Add some occasional random ambient noise, some creepy squeeking of the boards, a more complex engine that gives some realism to the world instead of everything you grab feeling like the lifeless assets that they are, etc. Hell, in the game you find your sister's book that goes on about her hunting ghosts, that could of been a really nice trigger to have some more creepy things happen in the house. Perhaps some creepy noises as said before, or an object making a strange shadow in a room. Yet all that potiental isn't used at all. The game's details begins and ends at the recontruction of a 90s home. The house provides no other purpose other than a lifeless realm to find some details about the family, with the sound of the thunder storm outside looping again and again. For such a short game that the developers pride in an immerisve experience, I expected the home to be leagues more complex.Graphics weren't anything impressive. In fact, the most impressive thing visually is the background of the main menu; I would of vastly prefered the game used that style instead of this vaguely realisitic style. The characters in the photos look strange and unintentionally hilarious with the aesthetic. These photos even clash with the celebrity photos that were obviously ripped from real pictures instead of applying the style used with the family photos. The textures letters, books, and anything else with text are impressive; it's nice that you can read the words even without selecting the pictures when most games would have them be a pixel mess until you select them.Sound design is minimal and lacking. I didn't expect some amazing audio but I expected something leagues more immersive. Again, the atmosphere could of been built up much better with the right use of sound design. Even some footsteps would have been nice.Voice acting is nice. I wouldn't say it was anything amazing, it was simple and nice. I got no feeling that the actresses were trying too hard, they fit their roles nicely.Level design isn't terrible nor is it good, it's always interesting to discover little short cuts or areas you didn't notice before. Gone's Home length ultimately hurts the level design for its only meant to be gone through once. The game is straightforward, if you go from room to room properly, there is no need to visit a room twice. You can just finish the game within 30 seconds if you remember a specific hidden room. The level design offers a possible ""oh wow"" moment that only works once. There is no lasting appeal for the level design because of the limited style of its content.  The house is small for length and content standards, ruining all lasting appeal.The gameplay has you explore the house and read messages and sometimes listening to them. That's it. Point and click games have mastered with variety in the gameplay way before Gone Home was in development yet Gone Home didn't even try this. Exploration is limited and utlimately wasted in such level design.Ultimately Gone Home feels like a prototype of a game, meant to wow potiental investors with a basic guideline of the game compressed into a lengthy demo. While in reality, Gone Home is a complete game sold for 20 dollars filled with potiental yet is outdone by any other point and click game that has come decade before it. Full bright prides Gone Home as a immersive, engaging tale told by the exploration in a seemingly dead home while in reality it is a game with a empty storyline that wants to engage you but never does, a house designed to immerse you yet gives up five minutes in, and gameplay that doesn't attempt anything new after the first room. This game feels like critic bait, critics went crazy over it apparantly because it offers a meaningful story. It instead feels like they are going crazy over it because it's a minimal game in a industry filled with complex games, a minimal game that concerns a plot about two girls falling in love. The story has no substance but the fact it concerns a story about characters that are not in the forefront in games, it gets rave reviews. Or even more simply, reviewers being paid off or pushing an agenda, as video game journalism has frequently been subject to. Love stories have been done better in games that don't concern love stories, hell I find KotOR II did a better lovestory with Handmaiden and that's completely optional. Don't believe people that say Gone Home isn't a game, it certainly is a game, it's a bad game.			"

												The story is about a someone who comes home to an empty house, and then explores the house. You then hear a story about the Player characters' sister and her struggles in understanding her feelings about one of her closest friends. The main problem I see, is the game is a walking simulator with the audio diary of a teenage girl attached to it, and really there isn't enough in that to keep me enthralled. (Don't get me wrong, It isn't that I dislike walking simulators, because I think that ""The Stanley Parable"" is potentially one of my favorite games of all time) But...Personally I didn't really enjoy it. I felt more emotion in playing a comicbook zombie game (The Walking Dead) than I did while playing this. Even though there are many things that I can relate to in the games subject matter including some things about the main story plot, but I rarely felt a shred of emotion whilst playing it. Some might just write this off and say I'm dead inside or whatever. But I know that isn't entirely true because there were times that  I wanted the story to be more about her problems with her adjusting to a new environment and school (meaning a bunch of problems with making friends and bullying) and that TO ME would have made for a much better story and probably would have invoked more of an emotional response from me than the actual game ever did.I would recommend buying it just on the off chance that you would like it much more than I did. But other than that chance that the game would hit your feeling much harder than it did mine, I would not recommend it.			"

												The game looks good, but it doens't feel like a game. There was a good atmosphere setup at the begining, then it develoved into a romance novel. I felt like I was reading a book (it has quite the linear path) and as well, in under a few hours, I was completed the game. That involved me picking up every single last item I could and turning it over and looking it over. I'm sure for some people this is a game that is ""fun"" but in the same way that some people like romance novels, that is not my thing.The combination of price and length is what bothers me and the fact that it is sold as a game, when really it's a romance novel come to life.

												I bought this expecting a mystery/adventure game, but from first five minutes it was already quite obvious what had happened and what the story was really about. And honestly, if not for the great soundtrack and atmosphere, I probably would have put it down before finishing. If you want a mystery game or are looking for something clever, you are in the wrong isle. This game is really just a story delivered via voice overs and written notes spread out across the various rooms in a house, and the story is really quite bland at that. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except those who want to hear a cookie cutter teen drama that focuses on incredibly repetitious expression of a teen's feelings. The story could have been summed up entirely in about 25 sentences, including the side information about the less central characters.			"

												Games of this style will often draw very polarizing reviews.  Often people will say one thing or the other: ""This is a game"" or ""This is not a game"".  The term ""walking simulator"" is frequently evoked when referring to this style of experience.  This is not a game in the traditional sense, but an interactive narrative that you indeed, experience.  And what is a game in this day and age if not an experienced narrative?  Games can be many things, especially today.  With the advents of technology such as VR, there are no limits.  Gone Home, as far as I'm concerned, is as good as it gets with experienced interactive narratives, excluding Journey.  Where Gone Home and Journey deviate is in their prose.  Gone Home is a story hashing on the loss of innocense, self discovery, alienation, family, friends, and anything in between.  Without spoiling anything, I'll say that anyone looking to have a solid, fulfilling experience that is not gameplay-centric, Gone Home is far more than a ""walking simulator"" due to how the narrative is unfolded.  If this were a corridored storytelling experience I'd slap the ""walking simulator"" label on it but Gone Home is far from.  Gone Home is a story everyone can relate to.  The experience was fulfilling and even worth a second, possibly a third play through.  It sets a bar that I doubt many of its contemporaries will ever reach.			"

												Gone Home has high quality work put into it. The audio and visuals are very well done for the type of game this is. But the problem with this game is that every GotY nomination and even the store's main page are selling an experience that is not there. I completely *get* what they were trying to do with this game, and it works for what it is, but the entire experience fell flat on it's face by the end.Know going in that what the game touts itself to be on the store page, is not what you get in the game. There is no real mystery, intrique, or anything worth noting in the plot that makes it fit the description other than, ""you get home from a year abroad, and no one is home - find out why!"" and that is literally it. This game was no different than a ""find the hidden object"" style of game, with the difference being that you are in a 3d world.			"

Oh, and the story itself isn't even good enough to make a B-rated movie out of. The only reason people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves over it is because it has a gay couple in it. Replace the red-headed female AWOLer with a male and this is one game that would of never been a blip on the radar. Throw in a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gay love story, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a ghost, a drunken father, and ♥♥♥♥♥ mother and you get GOTYAY. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't waste 20 dollars on this.

												I would like to say I was expecting a lot of this game...Although it trapped me for like 40 minutes... more or less, the initial set and environment for this game is not suitable and misleading.I, as many others, bought this game from the Humble Bundle (for luck). I don't like to read reviews or summaries of games because of the spoiler alerts so I just thought: ""It'll be a nice Terror game""... I couldn't be so wrong.Even though the story is cliché-style, it traps you from the beginning, but the ending is kind of predictable.I recommend this game if you like story telling games, but the price is too much for like 77 minutes of gameplay.Final Statement: The Oscar side story is useless, is just the little thing to catch up with the horror ""trap"" of this game.Edit to everyone downvoting it:....................../´¯/) ....................,/¯../ .................../..../ ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸ ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\ ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...') .........\.................'...../ ..........''...\.......... _.·´ ............\..............( ..............\.............\...

												Guess I should have taken time to read the negative reviews below on the page. The game is too short, presents no challenges and is basically a story that gets read to you as you wander around an empty house. You can pick up a zillion things, most of which have nothing to do with the story nor can you do anything with most of them. I played it on a newer Mac and, until I cranked down the graphics a lot, it would be slow and would occasionally crash. Unless you are just looking for something to mildly amuse yourself with on a rainy afternoon, I'd stay away from this game.  And, as other's have pointed out, $20 is way too much to pay for such a simple and uninspiring ""game"".			"

												Another important step in environmental storytelling. ""Gone home"" offers no cutscenes, dialogs or textblocks - it puts all its characters, plot points, hints and - most importantly - emotional triggers into artifacts that can be found around the house. This is done extremly precise. It´s incredible how much you know about this struggling family and their life in the 90ies after you finished the game since all you did was walking around and grabing stuff. Not boring but intense, intriguing and immersive ""Gone Home"" is a riddle that needs to be solved by everyone.			"

												I did not care for Gone Home at all and don't recommend it but not for the reasons many will assume when they see a negative review. I'm not going to argue if this is a game or not. If it is to you, that's all that matters. Those who consider this feminist propaganda are just being ridiculous, as are those who hate it because of the subject matter it covers, one tragically overlooked in video games by and large.I did not care for Gone Home because it's a thoroughly unengaging experience that tells a poignant but utterly generic story with some of the most tired methods possible. There are no mechanics in Gone Home, you simply traverse an environment, picking up and looking at objects, some of which have no importance to the story, some of which do. At certain points, you will trigger disjointed (albeit well acted) audio logs which is how the core of the story is conveyed to you. You have the freedom to wander around most of the environment but as with traditional games, you are gated off from certain areas until required objectives are fulfilled. You do not directly interact with any other characters and your character is a silent protagonist.The problem is that the storytelling in Gone Home relies on tired, unoriginal methods like gated progress and audio logs, two things people frequently railed against as being lazy, dated design but which are somehow revolutionary here. The story itself is also bland, uninteresting and cliché and personally, I've seen almost this exact kind of story told in other venues many times. The subject matter could have been explored in so many interesting ways and instead, we got an interactive after-school special that may as well not have been interactive. There's no subtlety or organic discovery as the designers claimed, the core elements of the story are delivered to you when they want them to. There is no ambiguity or room for interpretation in what's being said and just in case you still don't get it, many of the audio logs involving the core subject will have objects nearby that clearly beat you over the head with what's trying to be said. In Gone Home, you will interpret the story the way the designers want you to.There are so many other examples of games that try to tell deep and meaningful stories and are able to do so with actual mechanics and game play. Papers Please and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons are two examples released in the same year that did so brilliantly. If you have a PS3 or PS4, the Left Behind DLC for The Last of Us actually tackles the same core subject matter of Gone Home but does so wrapped around game play and I found it to be a much more impacting and meaningful experience. I can't remember more than a few core elements of Gone Home's story but I remember everything from Left Behind.What I believe was the intent behind Gone Home was a noble one but it was badly executed. If you want emotional storytelling in games, there are better places to get it and better examples of the subject matter as well. It's also 2 hours long at best which is not a great value to many either. In my opinion, this is one of the most overrated games of the last several years and so many better and similar games deserved the success this got. Maybe get it on a deep sale if you're curious but it's not worth nearly it's normal asking price.			"

												Wow.  Can I get two hours back?  I liked being able to explore the house and finding secret passages, and there was the ambience to set up a horror story or science fiction story....but none of that got used.  And the advertising blurb about ""find out what happened to your parents""....it's not about that.  Instead...you will gradually be presented with the real ""meaning"" of the game:  teenage angst about sexual orientation !?!?  Really!?!!?  Give me my two hours back!!!			"

												tl;dr great, rich story. Twice as expensive as a movie. If you buy it, buy it on sale for $10 or less.I'd like to start off by saying that I think the writing and atmosphere in this game are really, really good. The story is sweet and touching; it has many subtle facets that make it a really rich experience. In other circumstances, I would recommend this game and quite heartily, too, but the price is much too high for what it is. I took about 2 hours to finish the game and I'm the type of person to take my sweet time with exploration. I refuse to pay more than $10 for a DVD, so why should I dish out twice that for a very similar experience? I think that the video game format was a good stylistic choice for this, but it's still a very cinematic experience where you don't affect your surroundings very much.			"

												As has been said, it is not a game for everyone. I bought this game for a few bucks from the Humble Store because the concept seemed neat. As someone who doesn't play horror games, it definitely had a lot of the build-up and exposition of a horror game and then.... ended very mildly, which was simultaneously disappointing and relieving. I did think that the storyline was sweet and it was nice to see it unfold, but I'm not sure it was worth three hours of uselessly poking through a massive house and running through dark rooms, trying to find a light switch.Not sure, overall, how to feel about it. It was a good distraction for a couple hours, but I can imagine that if I had paid full price for this game, I'd be extremely disappointed with the length and lack of excitement.			"

												The worst criticism ever given in physics was ""it is not even wrong"".This is not even a game.  There is nothing to recommend or not recommend.*EDIT*Does a single person have even 5 hours in this ""game"".  Think about that before you buy.I might have even a drop of respect for someone who puts their time where their mouth is and plays this game for a good 20 hours. Games that are good get played. People who spend more time telling people how good something is instead of enjoying it themselves are viewed as dishonest and probably have either a political or religious agenda (id est, people who say how great the bible is haveing spent only 3 hours reading it in their entire life).Gone home fails not only as a game but as a story. The only part that might have made this Twilight-esque millennial trash have some redeeming value was at the end when going up to the attic, I genuinely felt concern that I might find the remains of the sister after she had committed suicide in short-sighted childish despair. That was foolish of me thinking there would be real drama or consequences in millennial trash. After all that might upset or “trigger” or challenge some poor millennial special bubble child and we can't have that. So instead we have an ending where the sister engages in pure unfettered egotistical desire without thought for family or consequence. Since it is millennial trash after all, the story must end there without exploring the consequences of such childish actions. No opportunity for growth or learning or introspection. No character development. Just millennial trash pretending to be art.Although perhaps I'm being too harsh. Maybe the value is in pure intellectual masturbation. I'm not a Christian conservative puritan (id est not a feminist) so I have no moral objections to good old fashion purposeless masturbation. Even this however, Gone Home fails at. You see masturbation is an enjoyable experience that people who partake in often repeat. How many supporters of Gone Home have even 20 hours in the game? Even 5?Gone Home fails as a game, it fails as a story, it fails as art, and even fails as masturbation.*Edit*I find people still don't understand that the problem isn't just that this ""game"" is short; It's that it's not even a story. The ""story"" is a call to adventure where in no adventure takes place. Imagine if Luke Skywalker found his home destroyed then the credits start rolling. The problem isn't that it's a short story, the problem is that it's not a story to have an introduction call to adventure without the adventure.Your sister ran away from home for reasons set up in the call to adventure. Do you try to find her to convince her to come back or support her decision? It doesn't matter as the whole ""story"" is, this happened-- the end.			"

You can pick up things and throw them around, which is pretty much the most entertaining part of the experience.

People, this game is tagged ""Walking Simulator"" and that is just slightly less than precise because it simulates walking AND looking at any ordinary thing you can pick up.  You could flush a toilet in Duke Nukem 3D but for some reason interacting with a toilet is art here.  If you like a ""Walking Simulator"" and you have both legs then you are a person I hope I never meet.			"

												Meh. That is the first thing that comes to mind, when I think about the story of Gone Home. I was pretty disappointed by it, tbh. After what I heard I expected way more and eventually it just fell pretty flat. It gets points for touching upon topics we don't see often in gaming, but ultimately, for a story-game, or an art-game, or whatever weird modifiers it has tacked onto it, the story sure feels very cliched. In some ways it feels like every story I’ve ever seen. It is told in a unique way, yes, but it could easily be the plot of a teen comedy about “finding yourself” and “becoming who you are,” or something. While the exploring and the nostalgia trip into my youth of the '90 was fun, it is not worth the high prize of 20 bucks. At all. Especially not, since you get only two up to three hours of gaming out of it, tops. If you really want it, I would recommend to wait until it is *really* low-prized during a sale to justify its purchase.			"

												Allright, this game didn't deserve all the ""hatred"" it gets. I try to explain this game's concept without explaining what this game is about. Well, you are Katie and you come home while it rains and your home is without any living. From now on, you get to explore all the house, interact with all the stuff and just discover a story which could be a part of a teenage movie...but the implementation is clever. Even though it looks like a thriller/horror game...it definetly isn't. This game lives from its narrative but it doesn't rely on it, since you are exploring yourself. You can read all the stuf carefully, which will then bring you back to the year '95...or you skip this part and just listen to the audio playbacks to find out what this story is all about. If you are not interested in a teenager movie, you should skip it. If you appreciate new game concepts and are ok with all the cliches, feel free to get it (at least on a sale). I liked it...I liked the superb writing and the ""open house exploration"" even though you are guided a little bit, since sections get unlocked with time (you can unlock all doors from the start though, but you shouldn't do that - the experience is definetly gone then.

The game really offended me and it's even more offensive that game journos give this game so much credit for the heart warming and diverse story.... when in fact it's a stereotypical story about a stereotypical lesbian in love with another stereotypical lesbian.

												I wanted to like this game but the story is so very bland and unsurprising it really didn't hold me much.  I haven't actually finished the game as of writing this review but I'll tell you that I know how the story comes to its conclusion.As a game, it fails badly, I mean, I could hardly call it a game at all and more of an interactive short story.  The fact that this game got so many plaudits makes me worry that some critics aren't judging a game for being a game but more for what it symbolises.  In this case, it was having a female narrative and plot about her sister and her sister's lover.There may be people out there that this story may actually connect with, and if you're one of them, you may find yourself enjoying it, but I would say most won't have anything that they will find they can relate to.All in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone who actually enjoys games, but if you're in for a casual, and somewhat cliché story, then maybe you'll get something from it.

												This game made me want to be a teenage girl again.  AND I'M A FORTY YEAR OLD MAN.     Is it wrong that I nearly cried at the end of this game (and a couple of times during)?  Does it make me less of a man that I can (at least distantly) relate to the feelings of messed-up teenage girls?! This game covers it all...sexual confusion, familial disfunction, first loves...even a possible haunting and/or demonic possession (do your research).    If you are a male who wants to understand young women better, PLAY THIS GAME.  What's more, if you're an aspiring game designer who wants some idea of how a tell a story, and to understand how a perfectly-structured adventure game should slowly and logically unveil its secrets, you might also learn something. Hell, even aspiring novelists or film-makers could probably learn something from this game.

												I've tried to keep this review spoiler-free, but considering that the content of this game is incredibly shallow and very easy to foresee, the things that I mention (no matter how vague, subtle and void of any real hints whatsoever) are almost spoilers in themselves. Read at your own risk.I'm really at a loss as to how this game has so many positive reviews. It really doesn't have a lot going for it, especially for the price. Luckily, I had gotten it when it was on sale for five dollars, but even at that price, I feel that it may be a bit too much. Gone Home is a casual game with a heavy emphasis on storytelling. The only problem is, the story is unbelievably boring. If you decide to pick this game up (and please, for the love of Satan, do NOT pay full price for it. $20 is robbery for what you get), get ready to say these two words many, many times throughout: ""who cares"". The game relays its character development through various notes and letters scattered all over the house; almost all of which are pointless and meaningless. The only thing you will learn about the protagonist's parents are their occupations. And you will read about it constantly. Literally over and over and over and over again, until the idea of those occupations are so unpalatable that you lose all respect for those fields of work entirely. You learn a bit more about the protagonist's sister, but really only one aspect of her life; an aspect that is so uninteresting, that it fails to help you form a connection with the character in any meaningful way at all - which is a crushing blow for the game, as she is the main focus of the story. Who is your character, you might ask? Aside from her name, you will know virtually nothing else about her. You will not care for this family at all, and you will not care about the main story. Everything you read and every audio log you listen to will make you ask ""who the f*** cares?""It's unfortunate that this game has such a lackluster story. Everything else about the game is decent, honestly; the graphics are nice, the sounds are pretty good (I especially like the music you find on cassettes scattered throughout the house), the mechanics work well. I loved the overall atmosphere as well; the pouring rain coupled with the eeriness of the empty house made for a great feeling of mystery, and it definitely made you feel alone and secluded. There are some puzzles, but they are very easy to solve. There are a couple instances when you stumble upon some creepy things, but don't be fooled by other reviewers saying this game has elements of horror. It does not, in any way. This game is purely a mystery game, but its ""mystery"" is an uninteresting one.Alright, let's sum it all up then. Gone Home is not a very good game. You won't care about these people, you won't care about the story, and you will spend twenty dollars for the opportunity to witness that state of uninspired carelessness - all in about an hour, or an hour and a half. And even after all the uncaring that you will do about this family and their story, you will still have questions. While it does technically resolve itself at the end, it doesn't address many things that you would like to know about (I won't say what they are, as to not spoil anything, but you will understand what I mean when you play it for yourself). I don't even recommend this game when it's on sale, but if you must give it a shot, then definitely wait until it's at least 75% off. You'll be very sorry if you don't.			"

												This is a short story with interactive elements. So if you are really into good storytelling, maybe you would pay $20 for it? For me, I'll pay $20 for a story experience that takes longer than one hour to complete, whether that's a book or a film or something interactive. If you're going to charge $20 for any storytelling experience that's only an hour long, it better be the most groundbreaking, heartwrenching story of all time...but this is not that.It's very well made, it's certainly a fine story, but it's not a ""$20 for an hour"" storytelling experience. For $5-$10 I would have definitely felt like it was a good purchase.			"

												Gone Home has a decent story and atmosphere, but that is all the good things I can say about it.The game is almost criminally short. At best, you will get an hour and a half out of this game. You can beat the game in all of one minute as well because the game was very poorly designed in that regard. All you do in the game is walk around, open doors and drawers and look at papers and listen to tape recordings. It is a game by technicality and certainly not one worth $20. It is closer to being a walking novel, although walking short story is a better description.

												This is one of those games I really wanted to like, and in some ways I do like it. But it comes with a lot flaws. First, this isn't a game. It's a game engine used to tell a story. I think there is a lot of potential here, and I enjoyed having the story unfold as I explored the house in ""Gone Home."" But the story was too simple and over too soon. This was barely a short story in length, and quite predictable, yet it costs significantly more than buying a good book (though I bought it during a Steam Sale.) Though the story was simple, it kept hinting at a larger story, and yet it never went there. There are too many mysteries hinted at, yet never resolved. I can't really recommend this game, but I'm excited by the potential of the genre and I hope this does well enough for more like it to come along, just with deeper and more engaging stories.			"

That is I examined every nook and cranny of the environment down to the last detail within the course of an hour.  For that reason I cannot justify purchasing this game for the $20 price tag.  The game is good don't get me wrong.  It contains an engaging story, combined with a well designed setting, and nostalgic 90's atmosphere, but it's extraordinarily short life span is what brings Gone Home down as a whole.  If only the house was twice the size and half the price.			"

												Gone home is a procedural storytelling ""game"" in the loosest sense of the word. It tells it's story through incredibly minimalist interaction with the enviroment and through the discovery of hints of the past, while listening to the ""journal of sam"". The story is entirely around this person, and not about the player character at all. And while the story is genuinely touching and heartfelt, It's not enough to make a game upon.This is a game made by people who do not truly understand the medium of video games. This story could have been told better through more interactive means, have more to do, and simply put. make it more of a game than a walking around touching and looking at things simulator. You are a passive observer, looking at things, opening a door and the most imput you ever do is putting a key combination into something. It's entirely linear, it's stupidly easy and it tops out at maybe 2 hours total.  That's less than the length of a feature length movie on average.Overall, Gone Home's story is a touching hearfelt nostalgia heavy tale that is well worth experiencing, but it is completely wrong for the medium and is ridiculously overpraised. the 20 Dollar price tag is stupdendously overpriced for such a shallow experience. Video games are not cinema, and this is an example of why it does not work. For a game with such a touching story, to be so shallow, so short and so ...boring, it's almost criminal.			"

I don't get all the hype and GOTY (Game of the Year)  talk that surrounds this game (since it isn't a game...  They say so in the ""abouit the game"" section - ""Gone Home is an interactive exploration simulator"").  It's an okay experience... but I am glad I didn't spend $20 on this.  Being from some of the BioShock people, I had high hopes... and for me, it just didn't deliver.  It's worth checking out if you get it for a good sale price (in my opinion $5 or less is the sweet spot).  90-120 minutes will get you through the game (although you may not find every little secret.)  Statements like: “Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told."" - The New York TimesIn my humble opinion.... No. Hope they can build from this and make an even better game (or experience) next time around.			"

												While the game has an interesting backstory the more you review the in-game documents and journal pieces, it's ultimately too expensive for a 30minutes--2 hour game. It also doesn't help that the story is a bit pretentious in its form, and that the ""main character"" is as unlikeable and cliche. I don't want to spoil anything, but I was left unsatisfied and you can tell this panders to a certain group in an effort to rip them off. Thankfully I got this in a Humble Bundle sale, but wish I would have bought Stanly Parable instead. Fortunately, it does have excellent graphics and atmosphere. But this indy title's pretentious story about an unlikeable character is too short for 19.99. I do not recommend it.			"

												This game left me extremely disappointed.I bought into the whole game of the year yadda yadda, and some of the other positive reviews.I really like the premise of the game. No monsters, no fighting, just walking around and exploring. It also starts out pretty good. With an eerie feel that something is wrong, and something needs to be figured out you set out on your quest.Having played tons of other games, you walk around in a constant state of alertness, thinking that something is gonne pop out and scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you at any given minute. And that's good.Sadly as the story unravels, you discover that is insanely boring and stale, bringing nothing that you couldn't see in a direct-to-video hallmark-esque movie. The accumulated playing time amounts to about the same as said movie. About two hours I reckon.Furthermore there's a complete lack of actions, tasks and puzzles. You just walk around in a spooky house opening doors in a predefined sequence, which slowly peels of the ever so thin layers of the sometimes hilariously predictable story. At times the game feels a bit like one of the many Hidden Object type of games. But they have at least a few puzzles that needs solving. At least I'm glad I bought this during the summer sale, and didn't pony up the full price of the purchase.A 3/10. :(			"

												This piece of software is a LGB and Feminist outreach project masquerading as a game. It is pure edutainment. With saying that it's not a bad experience by any measure, the atmosphere is well done and manages to build tension in a game that ultimately has no pitfalls for the player. That might have more to do with me having played survival horror games prior to experiencing this one however. It also manages to produce some 90's nostalgia, woo.  The story, if it can be called such, is so transparently designed to evoke sympathy for the player character's sister's sexuality, and heavily layered on with schmaltz and cliches about dysfunctional Christian families, that the software has the effect of 'preaching' at the player, and the only ability you have is to either turn the game off or continue on for more 'preaching'. None of that by itself would be all that problematic if we were talking about a free web browser game, or a few-pence phone app game, but this is 15 quid outside of a sale! It is so not worth it in the slightest, I bought it during a sale for a few quid, and I'm pretty sure I got taken for a ride. In short, unless you're keen on cultural marxist indoctrination, your money is best of spent elsewhere.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/07/18/gone-home/Gone Home is a game of free exploration. (Free enough to gain the popular tag ""Walking simulator"" on Steam.) It isn't as much a game as a story, and after a playthrough I feel more like having been the main character of a movie or a book than having played a game. In Gone Home, you return to your parents' home after trip abroad just to find the house empty. Why you don't know, and you walk through the house trying to figure out what has happened.So, how is the story? Good, yet predictable, and I like the concept of exploring in my own pace by turning household things around in my hands and reading through letters and newspapers. The game is, unexpectedly, not scary at all. Instead it is relaxing and piques my interest. The sound is atmospheric and contributes to a nice overall feeling. The experience is probably best a rainy autumn evening accompanied with a cup of tea.Other than that I don't have much to say. You walk around in a house, open doors, read notes, look at objects, and build your idea of what has happened.Even though the Gone Home is fun, its biggest problem is that it's far too expensive. I finished the game after 80 minutes, after taking my time and not rushing anything. The price on Steam is 20 EUR, so in the end the hourly rate is much higher than a visit to the cinema. If you like a good story and want an hour and a half of entertainment I recommend buying this game on a sale.3/10 note books "

												Interesting concept, but far too short and the story was really not that interesting. £15 for a 40 minute game with zero replayability is way too expensive, I would expect £4 or so, tops. All the rave reviews from all the mainstream publications and sites is incredibly suspicious.3 hours ""played"" is due to trading cards, not actual playtime.			"

												So my original review gave away the entire story of this game. I felt guilty for giving away such a spoiler so I have a new review.Here it is: The fact that the story in this game can be summed up in one sentence is proof enough in my mind of how terrible this game is. Don't buy it. Just find a spoiler somewhere and save yourself the $10-$20 and one hour you would have wasted on this game. (Yes, this game can be finished in under an hour. It's that short)			"

												I found the story to be very well paced, and was interested in finding out more about this family. The discorvery of various elements and necessity to read into various clues to peice facts together was very enjoyable, and the spooky nature of the house kept me on edge the entire time. However, the game is definitely overpriced. For only about an hour or so of real gameplay, and no replayability, the game is very much overpriced at $20. I would not recommend buying it unless it is on a significant sale-- a price of 8-10 dollars would have been much more reasonable.			"

												Gone Home is seriously overrated. Yes it tells a realistic story that some people will idetify with but it's so incredibly compact. Based on the very first cryptic note on the front door I expected that there was some grand mistery to be solved... NOPE. You just walk around the house reading notes for just over an hour then it ends and there is absolutely no reason to ever touch it again. Gone Home is an iteractive short story more than it is a game.			"

												The game was absolutely horrible. It tries to send a message that, let's face it, has already been shown to us hundreds, if not, thousands of times over and over and over, and this walking simulator, the best word for it, aside from expletives, is just the same message. No one cares if the whole premise of this game is about a homosexual daughter leaving her home, rather than wasting resources and time on making a game, you go and demonstrate your opinions and ideas on the homosexual equality protests, in real life, at real parliaments. Rather than wasting money, and tricking users in to buying a game that can easily be structured down into one sentence. ""Equality for homosexuals"". It's a waste of money, time, resources and effort, and let's fact it, it's just another way for YouTubers to make even MORE money. It's dressed up as a ""horror"" game, but the only horror I see is the price tag.Message to the developers: if you truly want the moral high ground ,ahow about you release the game for free?I myself do feel that homosexuals are still ""opressed"" with the light of that video that came out of the son confronting his mother, I also feel that it affects me personally due to the fact I have to wacth my gay friends suffer from being tormented or discriminated against. I've seen firs thand what can happen to those who aren't ""allowed"" to be themselves, so before anybody calls me out on this, yes, I know what this ""oppression""  does to people.Please don't buy this game, it's a way for the devs to feel happy abotu themselves and rake in all the money they can.

												Well, this is my second review for a game on here.  My first one for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim wasn't all that hot, so It's time to start acting my age and be more specific.  I'll still sound pretty rusty, but hopefully as time goes by I'll be more thorough with my reviews and be more specific about my experiences and and opinions.  Sorry, but bear with me on this one.Over all, even with a decent premise and a unique take in story telling, I wasn't too impressed. Audio/Visuals - Takes place in a first person view through an enire house that tells a story about a family.  Given the fact that the team was not the bloated size of most AAA game publishers, the atmosphere on here is actually pretty good.  Shadows casted when you turn on lights, examining objects when you pick them up (and seeing the 5.99 sticker on the holiday duck?  Priceless folks!), the thunderstorm echoing through the halls and room as you unravel the mystery of what has been going on with your family since your year round trip across Europe adds up to a great atmosphere of wonder and curiosity.  The minimal system requirements means that you can experience this short adventure without the fear of having to call the fire department.  Just make sure to get a good pair of headphones and turn the lights off.Gameplay - The meat and bones of any game.  If your looking to grab a full infantry kit, tack on an ACOG on that spify SCAR-H and go blow up some 'dem brown folks because F.R.E.E.D.O.M...............no, not here.  The game has an interesting take on exploration, going from room to room, interacting with drawers, turning on light switches, reading documents and journals, picking up seemingly mundane objects and discovering clues, and piecing together the whereabouts of your family (and specifically, the whereabouts of your sister).  Think along the lines of Dear Esther.  Story - You'll see a lot of opinions claiming that the game only got it's positive exposure due to it's take on a current civil rights movement right now.  Sadly, Im beginning to agree with them.  It's difficult for me to share it without spoiling the entire story, and I'd think it's better for you to go along with the narrative then read about it here.  But all I can say is that it overall plays out in the end like a run of the mill MTV movie special.  It's the same old story that has been better told through better channels.Overall, I was just dissapointed with this game.  I knew better then to go in expecting the likes of Fallout or Morrowind.  And I was taken in by the amount of exploration and mystery that surrounded the happenings of the family.  But while the game is proof that videogames can definitely be a great meduim for art (hell, in this day of age wackjobs consider aborted fetuses a form of art), unfortinately it loses it's luster as it goes on, turing into a tale that just jumps on the bandwagon of pop culture.

												I went into this game with no expectations and no prior knowledge. It drops you in an empty house with a storm outside, building a nice spooky atmosphere. A lot of little details and good voice acting really help build the feeling of the environment. However, that's the only thing that I can praise. I was expecting a scary game from the art style and ambience, but all I got was a dumb story about the main character's little sister. A cheesy teen romance is not praise-worthy and it's not material to be the focal point of a game. I love ""interactive stories"" more than most people and finding all the little pieces grabbed me at first, but the plot was predictable, uninteresting, and very run-of-the-mill. Hints of the mother cheating and the father's struggles with writing are only briefly mentioned before the focus returns to the stupid romance. The weak plot is unacceptable in a game that focuses so heavily on story (walking and clicking are the only gameplay mechanics - you can't even jump).TL;DR: This game is well executed, but not good. Weak points include the plot and the unsatisfying, underwhelming ending.			"

												Gone home is an unconventional game. That's all I have to say. It's a very linear experience, with its fair share of optional secrets. I went into this game with zero sequences spoiled for me which means I constantly expected ghost sightings and because of that everything felt very eerie and weird. I felt really uncomfortable expected something would happen and then nothing did. That's the beauty of this game. You're constantly expecting something to happen, something to scare you, some event that is going to pop and then when it doesn't you don't feel sad or stupid, you feel amazing because you realize the atmosphere is what makes this game. It's all about atmosphere from the setting to the sounds you encounter during your little investigation. Also everything is a huge 90s fan service nostalgia trip. SHOULD YOU BUY IT?Having all that in mind, I'd say don't buy the game at full price. The 20 euro price tag is way too unrealistic. It's a 2 hour experience and I've read almost everything in the game. Wait for a 50% sale at least. I got it in humble bundle and I'd say for that price it's really decent.			"

												Simply put this is not a game, this is a linear story that take about two hours to complete, there are no enemies nor is there any sort of conflict what-so-ever. Looking at it from a story aspect of it it still does not impress enough for that $10 price, it is filled with predictable elements and a predictable ending. This was advertized as a horror game where the protagonist goes home from a trip and her family isn't there, which has potential as a horror title, but in turn it truly is about your sister finding herself as a woman going through her teen years. Simply put this is not a game and /i would not recommend anyone to purchase it.			"

												I know a good story when I see one, and this ""game"" had an above average story; however, with that being said, the ""game"" can not be justified as a game I, and many others, like to play. You literally just walk around, pick random objects up, and let the sister do all the narrating of the story until you finish. That's it, seriously. No I'm serious, that's it. I wasted two hours of my life just hoping something more exciting than a random burst of crackling lighting startled me, but it never occurred. The story itself will be more than enjoyable if you like a romantic mystery (I do); however, the story truly belongs in a book, not a game. Honestly, you can get the same effects that the ""game"" will put on you if you read the Wikipedia summary of the plot of the, dare I say it again, ""game"".			"

It is tragically depressing.... SPOILER ALERTS!There are no enemies in this game, and though marketed as a horror game, there really is nothing ""scary"" or paranormal.Basically you unravel some clues about how your mother is cheating on your father, and you also come to find that your little sister is a lesbian who has run off with her highschool lover. The story wasn't bad, but this game almost felt like a guilt trip for anyone who didn't actively support gay rights or the lgbt community. If you are gay, you may find this hits close to home and will enjoy it more than I.Overall, felt like a game deserving of $4.99 price tag. If interested, wait for a steam sale.			"

												Gone Home has received attention and praise as a game that puts narrative before mechanics. Unfortunately, the narrative gets a free pass to be abysmally shallow for this. The major plot elements make me feel second hand embaressment for the writing, and the major plot twist is obvious that you'll know it the second you see the character in question's flannel shirt, or Jody Foster photographs, or pirate flag, or girl band. The juvinile ending that would feel right at home in a cheap young adult romance fanfiction truly lacks substance - yet the game treats it as though it's something incredible and beautiful. It's shocking that this game has been given the revere it has. Perhaps its audience and players have unfortunately never encountered real women, let alone gay women, so maybe it's that novelty that carries the game.			"

 -- WARNING --  Spoliers Ahead  TLDR = DO NOT BUY. WASTE OF MONEY!So, It starts with a strong starts, wonderful atmosphere. As you plod about the house like a clumsy theif, you rummage about the belongings of the owners and scrap together the storyline based on the items you find, notes, letters and the narrative given by ""the sister"" aka Sam. Theres a certain creepy vibe to the extremely large house (House? This should be called a manor, its huge! and remember its the 90's! The parents must be rolling in cash) and this is enhanced by the subtle hint of a ghost and odd sounds. Then the storyline takes a dive and it turns out your sister (sam) isn't actually dead or the crazy Ouiji board and pentagram and candles are just there for fun. Apparently your sister decided "" Hey, ♥♥♥♥ my parents and my sister. I'm a lesbian, and im going to run away from home with my lesbian partner and we're going to just drive around and somehow make it in life, probably get amazing jobs even though neither of us have a decent education. And to top it off, the one guy that was my friend, I friendzoned him for our entire friendship AND I stole his Nintendo"".Thats pretty much it. This ♥♥♥♥ing game, is a £15 Twilight, that could have honestly been something. It literally has points where its almost good. Or it tricks you into thinking that the storyline wasn't written by the child of justin bieber and miley cyrus. There was this point where blood was on the bath, and it was amazingly eerie and I sat up straighter in my chair. Then it turns out its just red hair dye, and on comes the narrative about Lonnie the Lavishly Lustrous Lover and the amazing Lesbian Hair Dye scene.♥♥♥♥ this game. Its not worth £15To summerise:-Pro's-- Good storytelling- Great atmosphere- Nice graphics- Wonderful Narration- Lovely way you piece together the storyline- Great Sound-Cons-- Story sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥(or rather licks ♥♥♥♥♥)- Stupidly short- Not worth the money- Abrupt and unssatisfying- Some of the handwriting looks like the person who wrote it had parkinsons- Can't run or jump, making it even more slow paced.- Pretends to be a good game			"

												Well, there is no much to tell about this game other than is a different experience compared to what's out there nowadays. This is not the typical first person shooter nor you will be solving puzzles while going through it; instead you arrived into a house which begs to be explored, while doing some exploring in the house you will be told the story of what happened to the family living in it. There is a bunch of notes and stuff to read in the different rooms which will help you understand a little bit more the story and will help you finding the clues to progress further to all of the sections of the house. Even though there is a lot of stuff to do, read and see in the house the game is a little bit short, and as me you can probably finish the game in less than two hours. Music is alright; controls are simple easy to learn.If you are looking for a different experience, well you can find it in this game; but I'll really recommend you getting this game when is on sale as doesn't worth the full price.

												Many people have cited Gone Home as a 2013 Game of the Year, while other players have griped that it is ""not a game"" and a total waste of time. The truth probably lies somewhere in between, depending upon your personal tastes. If you are looking for a twitchy adventure game or typical inventory management puzzles, you'd better reset your expectations. This game is ALL about exploration and slowly unfolding a story via its roughly 2-hour playtime. The year is 199x and you play as a young woman recently returned from a year in Europe. You come back to find your family's home empty, and you must explore the large house to put the pieces together and unlock the mystery. Despite some immersion issues (who keeps personal notes scattered all over the house in random drawers?) and reused assets, the creepy atmosphere and very solid writing keeps the game afloat and the player invested. Perhaps my favorite detail is the Riot GRRL soundtrack, featuring songs from Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, and others of the era. Having graduated college myself in 1995, this really brought back memories and solidly grounded the game in a particular moment in time. So should you play it? If you value narrative and something a little different in your games, I would say most deifnitely YES. However the 2-hour playtime makes this game hard to recommend at its full price of $20. Wait for a sale, and then let me know what you think!			"

												I love adventure games, I really do. Stories and atmospheres really stand out for me, but Gone Home... The atmosphere told me something completely different from the story. And that's a huge mistake.Poor story - really poor.No real gameplay - you just walk and look at things that 99% of them are TOTALLY useless to the ""story"".No brain usage - except for asking yourself ""How can this game win so many prizes? What's the purpose of this game?""At some point, when you find some items (that have nothing to do with the story), you'll think that the game is about to get better...But in the end you see that it meant nothing and the game was just teasing you with a real stupid ""story"".A shame. I really want my money back.			"

												The required criteria for something to labeled a game is up for debate, but it really doesn’t matter. Ask yourself: “Is it enjoyable?” If it is, then whether or not it’s technically a game is irrelevant.I enjoyed Gone Home despite it lacking typical aspects of a “game.” The main character is a girl who’s just returned from traveling abroad but there’s no one home. By scavenging the house for clues, information is revealed at a steady pace until the main plot is resolved. During this process, details about her family are uncovered, forming several subplots that I assumed would tie together. While only the big question was directly answered at the end, speculations can be made about the others.Set in the 90s, the game is packed with nostalgia; from SNES cartridges to magic eye posters (that actually work). It’s a great touch and it got a few laughs out of me, but the real value is in the mystery of the story. Curiosity kept me going, and the game kept giving me just enough motivation to keep pushing through it. At two hours it’s a little short, and I would have liked to have seen more about the parents and uncle. For $20 I can’t recommend it but if you catch it on sale, definitely pick it up.If I had to rate my level of enjoyment on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be a 6. The brevity really killed it for me, but it’s a solid story and probably deserves a higher rating. Either way, Gone Home is a great debut by the Fullbright Company, and I’m looking forward to whatever they’re next project may be.Digital Logik PC Gaming[dlgaming.net] "

												If you suffer preternatural terror of spoilers, don't read this review.The description reads, ""Gone Home is an interactive exploration simulator.""  This means you walk around looking for worthless detritus amidst a genuinely eery atmosphere.  It took me probably an hour to realize there was no actual threat in the game.  It was about that time that I also realized there were no puzzles, just places you haven't looked yet.  Felt like there was a great deal of lost potential.  It's fairly clear the author had more interest in crafting a narrative than anything resembling game mechanics.  In that respect, perhaps a different medium would have been more effective.  But all this besides, it's not even really a game.I'd just like to mention the snippet from the New York Times.  “Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told.”  I suppose I need video game commentary from the New York Times like I need a bullet in the head.  It's not even a game, and without the principal characers present, it's not really a love story--merely the echoes of a love story between special snowflake teenagers more noteworthy than it deserves thanks to the sexual preferences of those teenagers.Just thinking about this game leaves me with a lingering foul taste, something altogether and grossly sacharrine.  I can't believe they charge 20 dollars for this rubbish.  I can't believe I was fool enough to pay 20 dollars for it. "

												You won't get anything out of reading reviews for Gone Home. Don't pay $20 or anything close to it, but at least play it so you can form your own opinion. Kinda like how not everyone enjoys certain novels or films, but it's beneficial to experience it and form your own opinion. Gone Home tries to pull at your emotions and therefore will not resonate with everyone (didn't really give me the feels, had some friends feel differently though), and there is no way to know if you're one of those folks until you play it.That said, here is my ""review"" - Gone Home is better described as a ""story"" or an ""experience"", rather than a game. You step into the shoes of Katie, a young girl returning home after studying abroad. She is surprised to find the house empty - where are Mom, Dad, and her younger sister Sam?Looking through her family's belongings - a bottle of hair dye, a letter from her mom's college roommate, a note jotted on the back of a mixtape - Katie unravels what she missed. People and relationships are constantly changing and evolving, families being no exception to this, and Gone Home is relatable and touching in that sense.Would I recommend Gone Home at the $20 price tag? No. I paid $3 and think that is more of a fair price for what it offers, especially considering exploring everything only takes a little over an hour.			"

It is meant for an audience that can respect and enjoy a mature story without a lot of flash, told mostly by experiance and your own reaction.			"

												Gone Home doesn't really feel like a game, more like an experience or movie itself.  There's nothing really difficult in getting from beginning to end and only took me about an hour.  The story is engrossing and is set in the 1990's something like a more modern Stand By Me but a nostalgic and idealized look at the whole riot grrl mentality.  Gone Home though is a love story - a nice, safe, pretty love story, which seems at odds with riot grrl.  I applaud the developers for what they're trying to do and the barriers they're trying to break, I just wish there was so much more substance to this, especially for what the pricing is.  As many of the negative reviews here state, there is not enough playability, let alone replayability, to justify spending $20 on this title.  And also annoyingly while Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy supply some awesome songs to the game, neither of them appear on the soundtrack - again a lacking of substance.   "

The story is actually not that interesting, it's focused on one character only, and the glimpse at other characters (parents, yourself, previous house owner) the game gives made me thing I would find more about them, but it remains very superficial. Most people probably guessed the ""final reveal"" halfway through the game, or even before. There are very few games I regret buying, this is one of them.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It's hard to argue that the way it tells its story is captivating, and it's very rewarding to piece together the lives of all the characters invovled. If nothing else, it's a promising testimony to the potential of exploration-driven narrative.So what's the problem?The story SUCKS. (Spoilers ahead.)Towards the end of the game, I began to realise that the big 'reveal' was something I had predicted from about half an hour into the game - the black sheep of the family is a lesbian, and has run off to be with her new girlfriend. I can only assume that the developers expected this to elicit some kind of controversial or surprised reaction from the game's audience, but in honesty, I just found it extremely patronising that this kind of thing can still be considered a 'plot twist'. Is the daughter coming out as gay really significant enough to be the crux of an entire plot-driven game? Perhaps a decade or two ago. Sure, it was a nice story of a troubled young teenage girl discovering her own identity, and in a way, it was very sweet. However, the story is initially presented as something far more shocking - answerphone messages at the beginning of the game had me prepared for an out and out revenge-slasher plotline, or at least something with a little more drama. The real kicker is that the very real sense of mystery and looming dread that pervades the game all feels pointless in the end. The house as a storytelling device was a stroke of genius, and really, it's very well executed. It's just a shame they didn't fill it with a story worth a damn.			"

												Gone Home seemed to have potential. In general it was pretty creepy and you expect something to eventually happen, but (sorry if this spoils it) nothing ever does. The game is probably better if you start off with an expectation like that because you'll either A) decide then to never play Gone Home, or B) play it while keeping your hopes low. The story is okay, you find clues and then the game usually confirms your suspicions with sporadic pieces of monologue. Sound and music-- there isn't much. There is mostly silence and the occassional thunder and I liked that. When the game's music does come up it's because you triggered it and it has these warm tones that make you feel kinda good. Then there's the punk cassettes. The songs fit the game, although I found them to be annoying, barely tolerable at best. There isn't much to the gameplay. Not a whole lot of purpose to your inventory. You can interact with almost any object but there usually isn't any significance to it. Overall my expectations were too high going into this game. I kept thinking something scary was going to happen or something hugely serious, like finding your sister hanging from a noose in the next room, walking in on your parent's beating one another, your Uncle's ghost chasing you, or stumbling upon your old neighbor who came back for his Street Fighter game and is now going insane chopping up your whole family while you were away relaxing across the world for a whole f*cking year. Seriously, how well off are you that you can go on vacation for an entire year? Anyway, at one point the game basically tells you straightforward that you're going to walk in on your sister banging. And you're like wow! This game is nuts! This could be hilarious and interesting! Then the story turns and it doesn't happen. Like I said, nothing ever happens. Gone Home is really just a waste of a few hours. It's like reading a fairly dull short book that you can move around in.I originally bought this game because a friend and I thought it looked hilarious, yet people were saying that it was good. Ya know how sometimes you just want to watch a movie or play a game that seems like it might be so corny that it becomes entertaining? At worst, I figured even if it's not funny apparently it should still be a good game based on people's reviews. I got it on sale. Thought we'd have a few light beers and a lighthearted time, but the game's funny-but-not-supposed-to-be parts are too few and far between and the serious parts are too frequent that you can't even enjoy the game in that cheap way either.So if you can't enjoy Gone Home in a serious way, and you can't enjoy it in a ridiculous way, then I have no idea why you'd still want to try to play this game.

												Gone Home (Working Title: Resident Gay)Like ""The Stanley Parabel"", it's an exploration game about discovering the growing pains of Sam. She struggles of being gay in a conservative American household that gets narrated from notes and letters from her, which are scattered around the house.Believable written by Steve Gaynor (that's really his name) a self proclaimed emo wuss who worked with Karla Zimonja and Johnnemann Nordhagen on this award-winning experience. They really made an effort to create a detailed (i believe) typical household for this novella. And this is where it started to get uneasy for me..... Snooping around the house made me really feel uncomfortable. I didn't feel like being Katie investigating for what happen with her family, I felt more like being a burglar or a nosy neighbor kid and this till the end of the game.You wander around in a smaller version of a typical Resident Evil mansion. Due the ambiance and lightning it's also no less creepy since you usual go into dark rooms or corridors to find the light/light switch. It always make you wonder beforehand if something horrible is about to be revealed, especially since sometimes light is already on or turns itself off/on again for no reason. Maybe it's just the symbolism of the dark times of Sam you shed light on...or some other hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which I don't know (and obviously don't care). In reality they probably just thought it would bore people out halfway through if it was in a more friendly daylight setting.Even with all love for the details and writing, I did very little to me personally, even the Nostalgia wouldn't hit as hard I had thought since I was in a similar age as Sam in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, I feel sympathy for Sams struggle, but so does everyone else with empathy who is hearing someone elses growing pains stories. In conclusion:This game would be awesome as an completely optional side mission in an open world rpg. Just as a comparison, would you buy a polished standalone version of Vault 11 (or any other Vault) from Fallout: New Vegas for 20 €uro? If the answer is yes, then go for it. If your answer is “I played F:NV, but what was so special about Vault 11?”, then no. TL;DR version:The good:Believable writing.Love for details in the art direction/setting.The bad:A story I didn't really care nor relate too much.Way too pricey for its content (Would have more fitting to be small part of open world RPG game.)The ugly:Creepy setting for no reason or reasons which would be painfully unimaginative.The praising critics for this game.5/10: It's a wankfest for hipsters. So it's doesn't come much of a surprise why gaming journalism loved it.			"

""Lesbians are only cool when they're fetishized enough for people to get off on it."" ~ Steven, a buddy~It's amazing how much loathing GH brought out of youngsters, quick to disguise it behind 'rational,' 'objective' criticism of both gameplay and writing. Players who never think twice about writing quality were flooding the corners of the 'net with either vitriol or waxed objectivity.I adored the game. Storytelling is what I want to see focused on in video games these days, and this game delivered something truly incredible for the medium. Connections were made, emotions were felt, yadda yadda, but what I can't stop thinking about is something my friend's said for years: ""Video game people are trash.""It's a minority, but it's that very loud minority that thrives on the 'net, making these angry comments a dime a dozen. In between the disgust at the themes of homosexuality, you'll find the age-old assertion that reviewers were clearly either paid off or scared of offending The Feminazi Agenda, or, like, whatever. In reality, GH is simply bad fan fiction meant for the Lifetime channel's audience to fawn over; not worth its cost specifically because you can speedrun it in 1:30 minutes; manipulative pandering to Gen-Y'ers (nefariously plotted by the developers to fool 20-somethings into thinking they like a bad game because it has a digitally-rendered trapper keeper); rubbish because Sam's a teenager and acts like a teenager; doesn't lend itself as a video game and thus should not be reviewed by the video game press, but rather should be treated as a bad--of course--novella self-published on Kindle.Sam's side of the story treads on YA fiction tropes, and, admittedly, understanding or enjoying those tropes enhances her story significantly. (5 years ago I probly woulda agreed with the story criticism. YA fiction? Pfew, that's fer dumb kids.) Where some of the more eloquent complaints drag down on the predictable cliche, on the archetype, the simplification surrounding Sam's sexuality, and the fact that her story and hers only gets narration to, like, 'beat you over the head,' as many have so nicely put it...I saw all of this as a clear necessity of the message it was conveying and for the audience it was conveying it to. It wasn't just speaking to LGBT players, it was speaking to that sense of being an outsider we all felt and lived to some degree during our stints as dumb, selfish kids.But then the game didn't stop with her story, it wasn't just video games' Looking for Alaska in 2-4 hours, it had a handful of other tales written for entirely different audiences, with their varying depth hidden to better fit the 'adult' audience. Add that to the game's brilliant steps in storytelling: It doesn't just match John Green at his most irreverent--in those few short hours it also affects those crustier hearts: You Can Do Better.Will I care about what these folks said in 5 years? Nope. Will anyone? Probably not specifically, but it's depressing as hell to see this juvenile baloney so strongly and widely present in gamers.""its a about a lonely girl who thinks she is a lesbian when in reallity she never had a boyfirend so she justs runs away with another girl who actually is a lesbian"" -- Metacritic			"

												This a 90s 'em up heartfelt short story: a big nostalgia hit if you remember the 90s and you used a tape-recorder to get your favourite songs off the radio. Simply put Gone Home is one of the very few games that can make you actually care about another character and leave you apprehensive about the possible ending.Gone Home is similar to Dear Esther in that it is another story ""game"": only ~2 hours exploring-and-doing everything. Gone Home and Dear Esther might be ""games"", but what they strive to just let the consumer roleplay as the active agency in a story. If these stories were in print they would probably be short stories in The New Yorker. Yes, Gone Home is better than Dear Esther in my subjective opinion. Only get Gone Home if it is on sale and you like this style of game, otherwise avoid. Suprised? Well Gone Home is nothing amazing, but it does have a worthwhile story. As much as Dear Esther challenged whether it was ""ok"" to be just a story with a setting, I imagine Gone Home game will be an inspiration to the next generation of great storied games. Are we in a Golden Era of great storied games? Not yet!			"

												Definitely one of the greatest story-driven games I've ever played.  The developers have created a believable, realistic setting and storyline that completely captures the atmosphere of the game.  It's a really beautfiul game, though the price is a bit lofty.  Having played the game, I find that it is a truly great game, but $20 is a little bit pricy for 4, maybe 5, hours of gameplay, and I completed the entirety of the game in that time.  I believe I finished the story and found all the collectibles (there really aren't any) in the time period.  The replay value and price are a little disappointing, but the story and emotion make up for it.  Beautiful piece, but don't go in expecting traditional gameplay or length.  Worth the buy, but maybe when it's on sale.Addition:It's been two years since I wrote this review, I think, and it still holds true.  This game is one of the few that I can say affected me on an emotional level.  It isn't for everyone, though, that's for sure, and looking at it now, the storyline is a bit cliche, but to me, this game is beautiful.  And really, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so what more can you ask?			"

												This game has recieved rave reviews and won awards, but I've seen many negative comments from a lot of folks who played it. As someone who likes point+click and story driven games, a lot, I really enjoyed Gone Home. But if I hadn't grown up during the nineties, been around for the riot grrl scene, and lived through that era, I can't say I would have really been interested in the game or had the patience to see it to the end. This game is all about the mystery and relies heavily on the story, not the gameplay, which is quite pedestrian and tedious at times. Nostalgia is a big plus for me these days, so I did like this game, but I couldn't really recommend it for anyone else who wasn't a teen or young adult in the mid-nineties.			"

												Without ruining too much, this is one of the most atmospheric stories I've played in years. Note that I used the word story instead of ""game"". If you're expecting a traditional adventure or horror game, you'll not find it here. Instead the game manages to capture the essence of the nineties while keeping you in a constant state of psychological tension as you explore a mysteriously abandoned home (with more than a few uncomfortable secrets to discover). As someone who grew up in the 90s, listened to riot grrrl, played bass in a riot grrrl band and experienced a very similar coming of age as the invisible protagonist, Sam... I can perhaps relate to the themes conveyed more than the average gamer demographic. Perhaps because of that, I consider this to be one of my favourite games of the year. It's an experience which rewards slow-paced exploration and the ability to soak in the atmosphere of the era. It's also very short, I finished it in about four hours despite taking my time in piecing together the subtle threads of the story and exploring the manor obsessively. I don't consider this to be a bad thing, as it suits the game's purpose of telling the story of a slightly dysfunctional family and their history. There is no need to pad it out with unnecessary content. By the end, I was deeply moved and pleasantly surprised... in my opinion, there need to be more games like this in the world. Period.			"

												This is a point and click game with a FPS mechanics. I know poeple loved to hate this game saying ""it's not a game"", but honestly, all games have targed audiances and clearly this game is not theirs. No need to be a spoiled brat. I'll go to the point and say whats good:-Very smart and subttle way to make a story telling + point and click game-Mysterious backstory and environment make u feel like something is going to jump at any moment-No jumpscares (to me thats a good thing, cause in my opinion jumpscares are just a cheap way to scare u)-Great character development and voiceacting-As a lesbian I identified very much with the chraracter and felt like it was very accurate in portraing their love... and now whats not so good:-I really expected something to happen in the end-The ending, to me, was quite predictable. I was REALLY hoping for something to turn the tables. -The freedom makes a little confused to what should u do before it ends (I ended the game without seeing every room u can enter and that frustrates me)-It is indeed too short of a game for such a high price.

The game lasts less than two hours. You walk through a semi-creepy house.

												It's called an exploration game, but it should be called an ""I'm stuck in a box"" game.Let's start off by saying this $20.00 dollar game is two hours, that's right, TWO HOURS! And you usually rate a game about how much fun you had in those hours. You're stuck in a house in this game and mindlessly looking for papers that have ""clues"", and the clues lead up to nothing, expect combinations and rooms, the ending explains EVERYTHING, not the ""clues"" you find.The story is also a horrible aspect, there is a girl that's missing (I guess she's your sister or something, I wasn't really paying attention) and apparently after two boring hours, you find out that's she's gone with this girl called Lonnie or something and that's it. The ending has absolutely nothing interesting to it, and is dull as hell, I don't even want to put a spoiler tag on it so you can know what happened without wasting your time on actually finishing the game, I'm lucky I bought this from humblebundle.com for five dollars and didn't waste a WHOPPING 20 DOLLARS FOR WALKING AROUND IN ROOMS.The game-play aspect also has nothing interesting and dull, like I said the point of the game is walking in a box, literally. The rooms aren't well made and are literally boxes, and the game-play is walking in those boxes, that's it. You occasionally find clues, but they're usually where stuff is located, more rooms, and combination, the clues don't actually tell you anything about the story.In the end, the game has a good concept (going to your house after a trip). and finding nothing, but the game-play, story and game itself is horribly executed. $20 is a bad price for a crappy two hour ""exploration"" game. If you want a fun, and enjoyable exploration game, play The Stanley Parable.Also, the critics/journalists are brainwashed, I guess they're forced to write overly positive reviews for crappy overpriced indie games without explaining the aspects about the game.

												::::::Edit:::::::I was thinking about this game for a while. About my playthrough and my experience with it.Honestly, nothing was truly memorable about this game. I remember what the story was about sure, but nothing really sticks out to me about the actual playthrough.It's hard to recommend a game (experience) when there is nothing to recommend. What I can remember about my time in the game can easily be replicated in far better titles.Honestly, just watch other people play it. You'll get more of an inpact with their reactions than you will on your own.Unless this game is on sale again, don't bother with it. Watch lets plays and read reviews.::::::Original:::::*No spoilers, tl:dr*▲Good game.▲Great References.▲Attention to details is top notch.▲Story was alright▼Easy to figure out before end of game.▼Short.▼Get while on sale.*Spoilers*It's hard to say much about Gone Home, without spoiling the reason for playing it in the first place.Like everyone else has said, it's short. Really short. The time I have on it now, was my only playthrough (with me taking time to look at objects, read notes/letters, waiting around for the naration to finish) and although it was only 79 minutes, it felt much shorter. I had this feeling of angst the entire playthrough, that something could happen at any moment. (I've refused to read any reviews/watch playthroughs of games I want) But that feeling was self caused, no real reason to feel that way from the game. No enemies. No jumpscares. Nothing really disturbing/unsettling. Just your own imagination.The story is interesting enough. I personally don't care about other peoples sexual life, but that's really the only bit of story you have here. I do realize the significance of the story to the gaming world ect ect ect. Fact is, I really don't care.Was it interesting to hear? Without a doubt. Would I want to hear it again? No. In fact, I was more enraptured by the sub, sub story of the Hauntings. Trying to figure out when/where something would happen, how things in the environment(or things that weren't to be more precise) fit with the aformentioned sub, sub plot.Once you start getting towards the end of the journal entries, things start falling into place. Rappidly. You can figure out what happend about half way though, by that point, the only reaason to keep playing is to finish the game.OVERALL,The story was fine. Not my cup of tea, but a good story none the less.The details were fantastic. There were references to things, that I had forgotten about long ago. It was nice to visit the 90's again.But, for 20 bucks, not really worth it. While It's on sale though, you get your monies worth.			"

I'm still not really sure what I'm looking for. You start the game looking down.Update: OK, finished it, but the game is overall pretty ho-hum. Not satisfied that the game was worth having the mystery uncovered, which isn't really a mystery at all, just storytelling. Sam's journals are what you should be paying attention to throughout the game - not because you'll miss something, but because listening to it *is the game*.Basically you're playing a book. You have to pay very careful attention to as much as you can pick up about each of the characters and get to know who they are. There's not really meant to be ""an ending"", just characters and personality.			"

I only got stuck once, having to look up online where I could find a locker code (in a spot I wouldn't of thought to look, and dont recall any hints as to its location). Minus that one hang-up, I suppose the game was enjoyable. Having finished it, I wouldn't of played it with this post-knowledge. Like I said, the game held my interest, so I guess it was worth it for the $5 I paid. If you're a hopeless romantic maybe you'll enjoy this game.

												Gone Home is hard to review.  I didn't like it but I don't think it's a bad game.  I didn't like the main story line but I don't think it's a bad story - it is very personal, and the subject (for a video game) very surprising.  There are two distinct stories and I found the major story to be far less interesting than the parents - perhaps my comparable age contributes to that.  The biggest flaw of the game to me is the illusion of there being something more such that the story as it unfolds is quite a disappointment.  The delivery method was novel but I don't think it is something that breaks ground since the obvious linearity would be monotonous to do more than once.  To me Dear Esther was a far more impactful though at times infuriatingly unclear story.			"

The story itself I found to be extremely predictable. Anti-climactc and short, I beat this game in a couple of hours, and it has no replay value. I'm sorry, but I cannot reccomend this game. 3/10 P.S. You've no doubt heard this game exists in the bioshock universe, there is no way in hell you'll ever care about the way they are related.

												People are talking about Gone Home again, so I decided it's about time I'll try this thing... half hour in I got bored. Going around someone's house, reading their mail and stuff, it couldn't make me more unconformable if it tried. People claim it's a walking simulator and from all I've heard, those kinda games are heavily story driven. Problem is... you don't take any part in the story. All the interesting stuff had already happened and you're just too late. To be honest, you have to read a lot, go over a mountain of boring♥♥♥♥♥♥before you even get to something interesting. It's not worth the money or the time you spend on this piece of crap. It looks good... there, a token good point.			"

												Gone home was an 'o.k.' game. The playtime was a mere 2 hours, the environment was pretty neat if you like dark rainy settings at night. The sound track was awful - everytime I found a cassette tape to play, I'd have to pull it out for the sake of my ear drums. The storyline was very obvious to the point that you know whats going on after 10 minutes of play and the rest of the game you can say ""Called it!"" after every clue. I payed 7.99$ for this title during a steam sale, it was not worth it. It was atleast better than Trama. Trama and Dear Esther are similar to this game interms of playstyle, but Dear Esther's storyline and environments were much better. If you like being a sleuth and snooping through other people's personal belongings in real life, then you may enjoy doing it digitally in Gone Home - but be prepared for a plain and tedious experience with an obvious story.

												This game experiments with a lot of interesting ideas. Any one of those ideas could be the foundation of a great game. However, this game doesn't really deliver much on any of them. This is another game that wish I could give a neutral rating to. I think it's worth playing, just not at the rather bloated asking price. If you can get it for less than five bucks, go ahead and grab it.			"

												BUY THIS GAME ON SALE. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE. Unless you look at EVERY object in the game or take a break in the middle of game play, the game should take about two hours MAX to complete.This game is almost haunting, at times heartbreaking, and at other times heartwarming. Overall, though it is a quick and simple game, it is worth playing if you like story-rich games featuring a female protaganist.			"

												First of all, as many have pointed out, this isn't a game so much as an intreractive novel, much like Dear Esther. I mention Dear Ester because it's the only other one of these kinds of environmental walk-through non-games I've played. And while the storyline is more coherent in Gone Home than it was in Dear Esther, I don't really know if the ending or the payoff was as fulfilling or uplifting. Definitely the graphics don't even come close to the environment in Dear Esther.Also in contrast to Dear Esther, there's no headscratching at the end to make me think about later, or any reason to revisit it at all once it's over. Gone Home didn't make me feel smart for figuring out these clues on my own; the story is basically spoon-fed to you. I saw the ending a mile away. And though they paint it to be a happy ending, I don't think it really is if you consider the character you've been listening to, Sam, and her final decision at the end of the game. HOW WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA? Congratulations, your girlfriend is now a military deserter, which I'm pretty sure the Army doesn't take lightly. I hope you enjoy living in Canada.You've also just alienated your entire family. You're not the first person to come out to their parents whose initial reaction was negative but eventually turned around. How is running away from home going to endear them any more to you? You also just left your big sister to explain the whole situation to them once they get back from their second honeymoon to rekindle a relationship that was already on the rocks. And you also left her the task of CLEANING UP YOUR STUPID♥♥♥♥♥♥you left all over the house, because I'm pretty sure they wouldn't appreciate finding the witchcraft stuff.

												I heard about this game as being a ""revolutionary puzzle-solving game that changes the genre.""  Well, it just isn't.  The puzzles in it are hardly worth being called puzzles.  It's simplistic and bland, and is not much more than a vessel for the weak teenager love story that accomplanies the play-through.  I'm disappointed.  Don't purchase this game for 19.99, that's way too much.  You'll get about an hour and a half of""okay... that's all?"" gameplay for that price.

												Gone Home is surrounded with plenty of controversy concerning whether or not the quality of its narrative warrants the price tag of $20. Now I was recently able to purchase it at only around $7, so I wasn't as affected by this price tag as much as some. Recently in the gaming industry, the quality of a game's story hasn't necessarily been higher on average, but has actually just been more apparent and a more important factor in purchasing a game. Some games are given a ""free pass"" in its story if it has exceptional gameplay, and Gone Home is near the exact polar opposite of this. The question that you should ask yourself when considering purchasing this game is that, ""For $20, am I willing to 'play' a game that has little to no gameplay and lasts for around two hours, since the game has excellent storytelling?"". When I initially bought Gone Home, I already knew some of what I was getting myself into. Despite that, I thought I could forgive the lack of gameplay, since the quality of the story is more important to me in most circumstances. I found that I was wrong. One game I want to bring up in ""comparison"" is Bioshock Infinite. This is a game that has an excellent narrative, storytelling, and gameplay. When I was playing Bioshock Infinite I found myself thinking of the combat scenes more or less just as transitions from one part of the plot to the next. When I finished Gone Home, I asked myself if I would have minded if Bioshock Infinite had removed all gameplay. If it was just a story being told as you followed along in the midst of it all. And I would've minded, because all those ""transitions"" actually added to the quality of the overall quality of the storytelling. It makes you feel invested in the story, and that you actually have a role and purpose. In Gone Home, it seems more like a reading a book (which I love to do, although my books don't have quick-time events and save points, because books and games are two different mediums).While Gone Home is still a game, it lacks the biggest factor that set video games apart from other methods of storytelling. And that is interactivity. In conclusion, Gone Home taught me that while the narrative is still very important to me, a game still needs interactivity. This was my experience and may not reflect yours or anyone else for that matter. I merely hope this review helps make your decision easier and more satisfying in the end.Thanks for listening to my thoughts, and there are more below if you are at all interested.By the way, I do not disagree with any reviews of this game saying how great the storytelling is. I am merely saying that this game lacks what it needs the most, and that is interactivity. I am also not saying that I think the story is all that great. I just feel that the developer did an excellent job of telling the story they wanted to.Perhaps a better game to compare Gone Home to is The Stanley Parable. Both place a very large role on the narrative of the story and both do an incredible job of telling their story. Though there is a VERY large difference between the two. That difference is the interactivity in The Stanley Parable. While The Stanley Parable is extremely similar to Gone Home in terms of length, The Stanley Parable is a better game (in my opinion) because it allows the player to choose how the plot continues. From playing Gone Home and The Stanley Parable I have realized that gameplay and interactivity are not the same thing. In both games you walk around a building, go through doors, and listen to dialogue. Though The Stanley Parable gives you multiple doors and reacts to which door you choose, which makes you feel like you have a role in the game and that feeling encourages you to continue playing and experience the developer's story.

*Please do not pay twenty of your dollars for this game.*TL;DR: If you really want to hear another story about a lesbian teenager having a hard time and rebelling against her parents and getting in to punk music then just watch someone else play the game on youtube real quick and it will give you all the feels you need.Theme of game: Yet another victimization story of an American teenager. Story delivery: Walk around the house and read notes.Control: Obviously, being that there is no combative element, there was not much focus on control. Simply put, the movement controls (w,a,s,d) were awkward. Graphics: Fine for this particular game.Sound: Great for me.Overall message of the game (spoilers): Your sister is a sad teenager who's 'parents just don't get her' who got in to some weird crap with trying to connect with ghosts and started drawing pentagrams in the house and also becomes a lesbian when she meets an ROTC chick named Lonnie. Your mom has a great job working as a park ranger type person while your father writes books. These two people have one child living at home who leaves a TON of her stuff all over the house. Literally the whole house is like Sam's room. This review is a lot like the game. There's a bunch of sections of useless information that culminates to basically nothing. The point of the game is to learn your sister is a lesbian and has runaway and will probably, based on what you learn about your sister, not survive for long on her own or with her lover. For Sam, it will probably be like the movie taken except her father's not an ex CIA agent but rather a man who writes books nobody reads. Also your sister's love throws away years of dedication in ROTC and a promising future in the US Army to ""Pack everything in a car and leave,"" further driving the point that teenagers make poor decisions. The truly hilarious thing about this game is that it is basically a game where you play 1% of a ful game that has an actual story.  Normally this is fine with some indie games because they are so cheap and made by a small crew. This is a problem because the game is 20 bucks. Dumb. You are essentially focusing on tiny details for the duration of the game to tell a small portion of a boring story. Does that make sense? Exactly. What was I thinking: When I first started the game I was thinking ""Ok, cool so this is going to be really ground-breaking. Everyone, especially those that made it, have communicated that this game is truly something DIFFERENT."" So I am playing the game and I start thinking, ""Alright, this is pretty cut and dry. This story is predictable so far. OK I am pretty sure I know how this is going to end. Has it been 20 minutes yet?"" 40 minutes into the game I start to realize, ""OK I surely know how this is going to end. I guess I'll just finish it."" I then finished it for the same reason I would eat the last piece of my toast that I don't actually want or need.The only real review for this game should be in dogge form:SO BRAVE.YOU GO GIRL.			"

												Overrated. Highly overrated. The game isn't bad, but the reviews it's got off professional journalists is laughable. The game is obviously driven purely by the narrative, and the first ten minutes build an incredible suspense. But after those ten minutes, you realise what the story is about and it's incredibly lacking and underwhelming.When you create an interactive story with very minimal gameplay, you'd better make one hell of a narrative. This game doesn't do that, whatsoever.All aboard the f**king hype-train.			"

												Okay....maybe in '95 this game was innovative and ahead of its time. But today...it was a snooze fest. Glad I got in on steam sale for $1 'cause if I had paid more I'd have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Very bait and switch btw, it appears to be a haunting game and you figuring out what happened to your family when you get home. Guess what? When you do find out you're really not going to care. The narrative was interesting enough at first, but picture you're at camp and the counselor is setting up this really crazy, scary story, the wind is howling, he's got the flashlight illuminating his face in the dark, the shadows in the trees are dancing in the moonlight and freaking you out, you're all into it only to find out at the end....*drumroll....your dog ate your homework. yep. That's what this story was like. Pass unless you get it on sale. And even then, srsly consider if you're cool with a game like this.			"

												Spoilers ahead.Even when buying it on sale, Gone Home disappoints on all fronts.  Putting aside (for a little bit) it was made to obviously pander to a ""progressive"" crowd who doesn't even care if a game is fun or has a good story or even makes sense, Gone Home is a massive bait and switch.  It sets up a creepy atmosphere that eventually gets lost as you search every nook and cranny for stuff hidden in bizarre places, all while being told a story.  That story takes away from the immersion of the game play.  Instead of being led to believe something has happened through clues, which what I believed the game would be like after listening to the answering machine, you are force fed story and driven to look for things because a disembodied voice is basically telling you ""you are going the right way.""  It eventually becomes bizarre, as you realize that the person you are playing as didn't have a disembodied voice telling her to look for clues, yet you are playing as someone who is obsessively searching every nook and cranny of the house for no discernable reason other than a letter on the front door and an answering machine message from someone you don't even know.  And in the end, the story is one that was something seen for years in cheesy movies, except this time there are lesbians.  We are supposed to forgive their mistake in the end because it's true lesbian love, not acknowledge that two stupid kids ran off together after stealing a car and going AWOL.  All Gone Home does is trivialize the problems faced by members of the LGBT by barely even showing them to us, then wrapping it up in a bow for a happy ending where true love always finds a way.  And the fact this has won awards for ""game of the year"" and has received so much praise from people who don't even acknowledge the shallowness of the gameplay and the immersion flaws and only acknowledge a story that has been done countless times shows there is a bias to give anything that is seen as pushing boundaries the utmost praise, even when it doesn't deserve it.  If you want a similar type of game, once based on story, play The Stanley Parable instead.  It is a wonder how both games came out for the same award year yet the one that is more flawed has gotten more attention.			"

Story delivery: Walk around the house and read notes.Control: Obviously, being that there is no combative element, there was not much focus on control. Simply put, the movement controls (w,a,s,d) were awkward. Graphics: Fine for this particular game.Sound: Great for me.Overall message of the game (spoilers): Your sister is a sad teenager who's 'parents just don't get her' who got in to some weird crap with trying to connect with ghosts and started drawing pentagrams in the house and also becomes a lesbian when she meets an ROTC chick named Lonnie. Your mom has a great job working as a park ranger type person while your father writes books. These two people have one child living at home who leaves a TON of her stuff all over the house. Literally the whole house is like Sam's room. This review is a lot like the game. There's a bunch of sections of useless information that culminates to basically nothing. The point of the game is to learn your sister is a lesbian and has runaway and will probably, based on what you learn about your sister, not survive for long on her own or with her lover. For Sam, it will probably be like the movie taken except her father's not an ex CIA agent but rather a man who writes books nobody reads. Also your sister's love throws away years of dedication in ROTC and a promising future in the US Army to ""Pack everything in a car and leave,"" further driving the point that teenagers make poor decisions. The truly hilarious thing about this game is that it is basically a game where you play 1% of a ful game that has an actual story.  Normally this is fine with some indie games because they are so cheap and made by a small crew. This is a problem because the game is 20 bucks. Dumb. You are essentially focusing on tiny details for the duration of the game to tell a small portion of a boring story. Does that make sense? Exactly. What was I thinking: When I first started the game I was thinking ""Ok, cool so this is going to be really ground-breaking. Everyone, especially those that made it, have communicated that this game is truly something DIFFERENT."" So I am playing the game and I start thinking, ""Alright, this is pretty cut and dry. This story is predictable so far. OK I am pretty sure I know how this is going to end. Has it been 20 minutes yet?"" 40 minutes into the game I start to realize, ""OK I surely know how this is going to end. I guess I'll just finish it."" I then finished it for the same reason I would eat the last piece of my toast that I don't actually want or need.The only real review for this game should be in dogge form:SO BRAVE.YOU GO GIRL.			"

												Overrated. Highly overrated. The game isn't bad, but the reviews it's got off professional journalists is laughable. The game is obviously driven purely by the narrative, and the first ten minutes build an incredible suspense. But after those ten minutes, you realise what the story is about and it's incredibly lacking and underwhelming.When you create an interactive story with very minimal gameplay, you'd better make one hell of a narrative. This game doesn't do that, whatsoever.All aboard the f**king hype-train.			"

												this game had a touching storyline and it kept the suspense going but it left alot unexplained like what happen to the parents why did the house have so many secret passageways (maybe i just dont live in a cool house) or what was with the ghost story of oscar. all in all it was a alright game think i paid more than i should have but there was alot of time put into the graphics so im not too upset just left wanting more in the story			"

												This game has an important story to tell, and in that effect it does it quite well. The biggest problem though is that the story will have a much higher impact on people who can relate to it, but falls a bit flat, predictable and boring for others. To even call it a game is maybe a stretch. I'd rather call it an interactive story. You play as a big sister coming home from a trip through Europe, only to find the house empty in the storm. You then work your way through the house for clues of where everybody has gone off to. Along the way you open voiced-over outtakes of your sister's diary that slowly uncover what is going on. Even though you can move around quite freely in sections of the house, it still feels very much like a ""on-a-rail"" type of game where you are led through the story linearily. You can interact with quite a bit of items, but most of them are totally pointless, and not very creative. After lifting a dozen tissue boxes that are basically the same boring, useless, low detailed nonsense, you lose the interest in picking up anything else. This works against the game, seeing that you unlock clues under a few of them. Eventually I got so bored with the exploring that I couldn't wait to get done, and when I tell you that I spent a bit over 2 hours to play through the whole game that should tell a lot. I have rarely experienced getting bored with a game in such a short amount of time. This also brings us to the biggest bummer with this game. It is highly overpriced. I bought it at half off and I still feel ripped off. This needs to be priced down... ALOT.The worth of the game and the impact it leaves on you will differ a lot from person to person when it comes to this game. It is that type of story. A story I will not even start to get into, because the story IS the only selling point here, and if I reveal anything it will probably ruin it for you. Even though I got bored and felt ripped off with this game, and therefore cannot recommend it, you might have a totally different experience with it. Just don't expect too much, and definitely wait for it to be marked down, preferably a lot.It gets a merely 5/10 from me, and that is mostly for the well written story.Happy Gaming!			"

												The game is a lie. By that i mean that the game tricks you into thinking ""wow, this is very spooky and interesting"" until about halfway through the story that you realise that this is actually, what i would call, something like a romance novel between 2 girls and ends up in a un-satisfactory ending. it's very short, puzzle-like game with a sudden ending through a book. i do not reccomend this game. even if it was free.

												Quite an unusual game. It's not an action-packed game so you could be disappointed if you're used to run-of-the-mill FPS games. You return home from a spell away, and just spend time exploring the house and discovereing things in a first-person view. It is a bit slow going but makes a change from the standard FPS fare. Overall, I think a bit over-rated, but not too bad.			"

												You wander around a house being spoon-fed a linear progression of clues to get to the end. And I mean LINEAR - the house is unlocked in sections, usually more or less hallway-shaped, and if there's 3 places to search, you only find what you need to progress by searching all 3. The motive for the player is to find out more about your runaway sister who left a note on the front door. Halfway in, you know why she ran away and there's no reason to continue playing because there's no new developments. Furthermore we're never given any reason to care about anyone involved, since we're just wandering around the house of a family we never really know anything about, other than a few trivialities like how their careers are going. Not that having any reason to care would make any difference, since nothing changes or is resolved anyway. The entire game is a situation on pause and the game ends when it feels like it's told you enough.This game is devoid of gameplay and drama. It is a waste of time and waste of money.			"

												This isn't a bad game exactly, but the narrative is painfully heavy-handed; the story's spoon-fed to you by unnecessary narration instead of coming naturally through exploration. If you do pick this up, turn off the narration in the options menu and you'll enjoy it more.Great music though.			"

												Game about walking around the house and trying to figure out why there's noone here. You basically sightsee this enormous bulding, finding clues about your sister and getting a part of her recorded journal every found clue. There are some spooky elements too, added to the game for basically no other reason than adding some atmosphere to the game.The finale came quite quickly and was.. disappointing I guess? I expected more from the things that the game might have promised me when I was exploring this detailed environment. The plot isn't very original, you could see it coming from half-way through already.Interesting but disappointing.3/5 "

A few things try to throw you off and add a bit of intrigue and, in the end, the ""game"" ends abruptly and without satisfaction.Gone Home is an interesting experience, but not worth the $20 pricetag by far.  I heard great things, but left a little disappointed after only 90 minutes or so (no rushing here, either; I tried to be thorough as I explored). There may be a few clues I missed, but I can't see myself going back again just to find them at this point.			"

												So, I just finished the game.Took me just under 90 minutes.I was extremely disappointed with this game - the entire game was exploring a large house, reading notes, listening to journals and discovering the lives of the residence.  I was expecting something to happen - but nothing ever did.  The atmosphere was great, the sound of the storm outside, some of the journals, the allusions to a ghost haunting the residence - but none of these leads to anything of any significance.  Ultimately, you find out what happens to some of the family members - through journals & notes - but that's it.  With all that said - I did appreciate many of the pop culture referrences throughout the game.  Thankfully, I got this game in an ""Indie Bundle"", so at least my money went to a good cause - because if I had paid full price for this game, this review would probably include a significant amount of profanity :)			"

												This game is a total waste of money. I bought it in a Humble Bundle for like $10 along with a bunch of other games inc. Papers Please so it's not a problem for me. However, this game only uses WASD (and crouching) mechanics. That's it. You can pick up objects and rotate them, which is soooo exciting because who wouldn't wanna wonder around their... own... house... and empty the entire fridge of all its contents (see screenshot). You are a girl with an angsty teenagelesbiansister who has decided torun away from home with her angsty teenage girlfriend. It took me a couple of hours to finish the game because I was just looking at everything in the entire house, got pretty boring very quickly in all honesty. The game on its own is a decent idea and its pleasant, much like Dear Esther but definitely not as good in anyway. One of the biggest issues for Gone Home is the current price tag which sits at $20. It's not worth it. Buy it if its like a couple of dollars, or if its in some good bundle - but honestly you're not losing out if you haven't played it.			"

												A adventure-esque game in which you pick up notes and miscellaneous things in order to understand the story. It's very short; I finished it in about an hour and a half. While the story was...interesting and the voice acting was okay, at one point I was walking up a staircase and wondered if this could have been done in a different fashion. The sense of discovery as you go around the house and read into these clues is something that I feel only a video game can do, but at the same point it is literally a ""game"" in which you walk around a house and pick up pieces of paper.TLDR: Imagine a game where all you do is pick up bioshock audiologs except neither the world nor story are as interesting. The story is ""edgy"", but because of the shortness lacks heart.			"

												Let me first say that I really enjoy story-driven games, I have no problems with short and to the point games if the experience is worth it, and I don't buy all of this ""it's not a game"" crap about interactive story videogames. Still, I did not like Gone Home as I feel it fails even as a interactive story game.Although I sympathyze a lot with the issues about homosexuality that Gone Home addresses, I don't think the game manages to get its point across very well, nor to establish any sort of emotional link with the player.I have two major complaints about Gone Home.First, the narrative device used for telling the story. Basically, you explore the home while hearing your sister's diary read to you as you discover clues. At the end you find the actual diary, which is everything you've been listening to during the game.Being this a first-person game, the expectation is that anything you hear is going to be from the point of view of the main character, so when I heard my sister's voice I was expecting it to be some sort of audiolog or registration I found, instead of an extra-diegetic narrative device. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case and it ruined a lot the immersion.Second, the sister's story is overly saccharine and completely irrealistic, as if out of a badly written light romance novel, to the point that I actually wasn't able to be involved at all in the issues the game was trying to address because of the horrible writing.SPOILER ALERTAt the end, you discover that your teenage sister has escaped with the ""woman of her life"". I guess the game expects you to feel happy about this, happy that she found love, but all I could think of was ""this girl is a dumbass, her love is going to fade eventually and she'll discover she's thrown her life away.""

Finding each little bit of the story through items found in the house was interesting and felt rewarding; however, the story itself was nothing extraordinary. But the largest downfall to gone home was the length. If anything the entire run of the game feels like it could have been an opening. It is when the game feels like it is about to really begin that it ends. I would only recommend purchasing is its on sale for $5 or less, anything more and it will feel as though you had wasted your money.			"

												Patriarchy Smashing Simulator really made me realize that anyone can speedrun a game whilst you let your inner cis scum perish as you enter the attict. There's the secret door next to the stairs as you enter the house, and inside of the secret room is the key to the attict. There, I saved you 10 minutes of your life you cis scum, you may never oppress me again.Think you're ready to leave the patriarchy and stop being an oppressor? for 20 dollars you can do so in only 10 minutes!Thank god I actually didn't pay for this.

												No, I'm not going to just spout ""walking simulator"".  You can read that in the other reviews.Unfortunately, what's left after removing the game from the game is more like someone's personal self-therapy project instead of a coherent story.  There are a lot of hanging threads and details that ultimately don't contribute to the work as a whole, and the time would have been better spent shoring up other parts of the experience.  All in all, I can't recommend this.  But I could recommend some writing resources for the developers.			"

												This isn't so much.. Well, you -could- consider it a game. You -do- interact with the world, you -do- have to solve some pretty annoying puzzles, or stumble your way around until you figure it out. Honestly, most of the pleasure of this game comes from the nostalgia, for those of us who miss the 90's. If you weren't around for the 90's, then it probably won't strike any bells for you. If you were, well, for a one or two hour experience, you'll get plenty of smiles. Throughout the whole thing, you'll be pulling apart four different little storylines. In the end, I don't regret the twenty bucks I dropped on the game. It let me get a taste of highschool again, and sparked a few memories, which spawned a few smiles. That's more than worth two hours of work at my job, to me.			"

												Absolute tripe. I honestly have no idea how this didn't get panned globally. It's like the developers couldn't decide what they wanted to make. You will hear footsteps on the floors above you, loud thunder strikes, ghostly whispers, and there's a scripted instance where you pick up a crucifix and the light above you goes out. There are no actual scares or anything. It's almost as if they wanted to make this a horror game and gave up half-way through because that would've actually taken some effort. There is no gameplay in this ""game"". You cannot fail. You just walk around the house throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥about and reading notes (most are in handwriting, so good luck trying to figure that out) with the occasional voice-over. The story (which is what everyone praises) isn't good either. It's just some stupid cliche story of a young person finding out they're gay and not telling anyone else, then running away with their partner. It only took me around 30 minutes (I don't know why steam says I played an hour of this, I only played for 35 minutes) to find everything there is in this game with me never having played this before. Do not buy this, despite what all the shills on the forums tell you. It is not a good game (it isn't really a game, either) and certainly not worth all the praise it receives. I do enjoy story-driven games like this if they can do it right and engage me (like Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead), but Gone Home is just awful. It's like some freeware game you could find on moddb or something. Thank goodness I got this in a humble bundle or I would've really regretted my purchase.			"

You have to be in a certain mood though to appreciate I think and you will probably do yourself a disservice if you dont play the whole thing in one go. The game takes about 90 - 120 minutes to complete based on your pace. Definitely worth a playthrough. And I really dug the original score in the game.

												I paid a little over $6 USD for this game it it was too much.  I knew what it was going into it, so it wasn't a content or gameplay issue.  It was a lack of content issue.  It's way too short.  I read everything and picked up everything and total gameplay was about two hours.I also got to the end before I explored everything which annoyed me.  I had to go back after the credits to explore some rooms with possible clues in them.  The effect these clues were to have on me were ruined because I already knew how it ended.  It's like reading the last chapter of a book before you sequentially get there which ruins the story.This game is too short for the $20 non-sale price.  The end is easily achievable before all clues are found leading to spoiled clues if you go back and find them.  How this was a ""Game of the Year"" I will never understand.  Don't buy it unless it's only a couple of dollars.			"

												This isn't the easiest game to describe, let alone review.Some nitpicky people will even try to tell you it's not a game at all, since there's no way to die/fail/lose.There's only one level, only one thing you work towards, and then it's over. A mere 3 hours in (for me personally).That can't be good, can it?It is. It so is.The player controls Kaitlin Greenbriar who, after a year of travelling abroad, has Gone Home.Her homecoming isn't quite as she'd planned it though, since nobody appears to be there to greet her.What follows is an exploration of a large house, its history, what your family has been up to in the year that you weren't there, and why nobody is there.This exploration is done very literally, you roam through the house in a first person perspective and look at things that you find. Almost everything can be picked up and analysed, most of it won't progress the game along (should you choose you can spend half an hour looking at a pack of toilet paper from all angles). What this accomplishes is that the house you wander around in feels very real. It's not laid out like a videogame level (mostly anyway), it actually feels like a home.Some objects spark memories, either Kaitlin's or those of her younger sister, Samantha. The protagonist's are displayed along the bottom of the screen, but Samantha's are fully voiced, generally taking the form of diary entries. The voice acting is believable, emotional, endearing.The game tells you a story, primarily Samantha's, of how Kaitlin being away has impacted her life, what she's been up to, how she handled moving to a new house, how she's making new friends. Endearing is a word I've used already in this review, several times maybe even, but that's what the game makes you do. You care about Samantha, and every diary excerpt you uncover makes you care a little bit more.By the time you've finally made your way to the last room to explore (game progress is generally non-linear except for two or three segments where you have to know a trick that is only explained in Samantha's diary entries to gain entry to a new part of the house) you'll be hooked and want to know the conclusion.And I loved the conclusion. The entire game builds up to it so well, both foreshadowing and alluding, and it's amazing feat of storytelling.Treat yourself and play this game, but expect to be told a story and explore a house, not to have your reflexes challenged.Definitely, passionately and endearingly recommended.

Posted: June 13, 2014
												My first review of Gone Home was entirely positive. I supposed I focused mostly on the parents and the challenges they faced. It was a pleasant break from stealth-based horror titles and combat-centric games--a mundane mystery: where is everyone and why is the house empty?  Everything changed on my second playthrough scouring the house for every possible bit of information and with commentary enabled.  I started to see the cracks and little things that previously amused now annoy and/or disappoint.  I'd like to be clear on a few points before we begin again:  I've no problems with games that have zero combat, minimal gameplay, simple stories, independent-tier graphics, Spoilers Ahead.  I mean it, the first point gives away the ending...Let's jump into this headfirst:  Gone Home's central plot involves Kaitlin Greenbriar (the player) arriving at the family's new home (inheritted by her father, Terrance, from his Uncle Oscar) only to find that everyone's missing.  Samantha Greenbriar (the sister) provides occasional voice-overs as the player explores the house and discovers (through her sister's diary) that Samantha left with her lover, Lonnie, after their (Sam & Kate's) parents previously left on an anniversary vacation.The complications that created this situation:1 - Samantha becomes friends with Lonnie during their high school years and soon falls for her.  With biases towards sexual preferences being what they were in the 1990s, the pair face difficulty at school and further problems arise.  Samantha and Lonnie's relationship is conducted secretly until a forced exposure (truancy, low grades) to her parents.  They give Samantha the ""just a phase"" speech before placing her on restriction.2 - Lonnie Desoto comes from a military family, so naturally she prepares for a career in military service.  This places a wedge between her and Samantha as any thoughts to the future are accompanied with healthy amounts of doubt.3 - Terrence Greenbriar (the father) found success as a writer, but was dropped by his publisher after the second novel bombed.  After finding some unusual letters, I took a closer look at Oscar Masan (Terrence's uncle) and the suspicions began to pile up.  Oscar sexually abused Terrence.  This has been confirmed--long before I stumbled onto it--on the developer's Twitter profile.  Terrence's novels are attempts to find closure, but are also forcing him to relive the abuse (likely much worse in memory) and sleeping in the house where the assaults took place certainly isn't helping.4 - Meanwhile, Janice Greenbriar (the mother) has been growing more and more distant from Terrence and closer to her coworker, Richard Something.  Everything comes to a head when the parents leave on their vacation; whether Terrence has told Janice about his past abuse or if Richard's sudden engagement and marriage invitation forced her to remember her husband remains to be seen.  In their absence, Samantha has an opportunity to spend one more night with Lonnie before she ships out.  The night passes and Samantha wakes up alone.  Later she realizes Lonnie left her several messages indicating that she's changed her plans to enlist (...in spite of having a ship date?  That's desertion, madam.) and wants to spend her life with Samantha.So that's the story, why has my recommendation changed?I was unaware of Terrence's abuse during my first playthrough.  I was convinced that Janice had given up her affair with Richard in order to rekindle her marriage.  Now it seems that the only options for them are Janice helping Terrence find closure or Janice adjusting to rejection and mending any bridges burned with her spouse.  The story's become darker with every subsequent look.  Oh, well sideplots shouldn't affect the overall impression, right?  Sure, keep telling yourself that.Present for some of the commentary was Corin Tucker...yeah, don't worry I didn't know who she was either.  Apparently, getting involved with feminism sells albums when the musician lacks the ability necessary.  Don't get me wrong:  the score was fine, but the insert tracks were devoid of melody or meaning.  Corin Tucker's contribution to the commentary is largely self-promotion and the fiction that feminism is about equality for everyone.Not once during the commentary did anyone mention the parents.  Their story was what drew me in the most, but it seems those two characters are simply window dressing.  The backstory of Terrence and Oscar should have been at least mentioned  in the commentary.  Either the developers sold out during the game's promotion or they were dishonest from the start.I haven't enjoyed writing this re-review.  It's been phenomenally disappointing to realize this game is not a positive message to everyone seeking love.  Would reactions to this game be the same if it were teenage boys instead of the two girls?  I doubt it.  Honest representations of alternative relationships are hard enough to find in games without added political propaganda.  I'll end this here while I still remember the good things Gone Home had to offer.The Good:- an honest portrayal of an alternative relationship without unnecessary melodrama- mystery elements without stealth sequences- solid minimal score- excellent atmosphereThe Bad:- annoying choices for insert music, but at least they're optional- overpriced for the length of the game- limited graphics options and some performance issuesThe Ugly:- deliberate propaganda at times- restricts user access (One journal entry written by Samantha describes some very tame intimate contact between her and Lonnie and Kaitlin forces the player to drop the letter and refuses to pick it up again.  The developer points this out as if it were something to be proud of and not heavy-handed at all.  It implies female-female sexuality is in some way sacred compared to other relationships.)- crashes on ending credits if the player attempts to skip			"

												Sadly, I find myself not really sharing the same impressions of most of the professional critique.I have to say that in the last few years I've seen a lot of games like this one, and the problem is that they shouldn't have been games at all in my opinion. The story is ok(less great than what I was expecting from the reviews, though) but the problem is that you have to play through it. In this game, even walking from a room to another is a pain, the character walks unnaturally slow, I don't know why they chose to do so, maybe to add suspense, but it didn't work, at least not for me. You may think that this is something like a point and click game, but there's not one single decent puzzle in the entire game, making it really simple to complete. Sometimes you will have to find a combination for a certain lock, a code that you will easilly find written somewere, nothing that will need you to use the brain to be discovered, and those will be the hardest challenges in the game. Simply put, PLAYING this game is boring, and that will ruin the experience, no matter how great is the story. Probably it could be more entertaining watching someone else's playthroug on youtube, leaving him the boring part and enjoying the story better. This is something that the developers have to understand about this kind of games...if you don't have any clue about a gameplay to put on a good story, make a movie or something like that, not a game.

												Gone Home is a first-person walking simulator from the same team that brought you the Minerva's Den DLC for Bioshock 2. You play as a girl who just got back from Europe. She enters her parents house at the dead of night only to find it completely abandoned. The only clue of your family's whereabouts is a note on the door from your sister asking you not to look for her.First off, let's get the positives out of the way. The house looks pretty good. There's tons of clues, little notes to read, objects to interact with etc.It looks very believable, almost as if people actually live there unlike most video game mansions you find. I almost felt nostalgic while exploring it. It reminded me of the times when you were kid home alone at night and you were so scared of your own house, then you turn on the lights and wonder why you were even afraid to begin with. It's very silly to think about, but that's what I thought about the first few minutes of the game. There's plenty to just mess around like inserting casette tapes in a radio. So much to discover in your first playthrough. In fact, this sole element was what made me really get into the game for a while. There's a lot to discover about the family which sadly takes the backseat from the main plot. It's almost a flaw seeing better plot points being almost completely dismissed in favor for an average love story that really has nothing interesting about it.Unfortunately, those are the only aspects I can give this game credit for. Gone Home has very little gameplay to it. You need find three specific codes which is pretty much the only thing you need to make progress. Alternatively, you can skip it and beat the game in 47 seconds.  I even find it hard to classify this as a point and click as even though it somewhat resembles the genre, it doesn't involve the brainteasers and puzzles its known for. There's no depth to be found here. If you know what you're doing and with the right settings, you can easily beat the game in seconds. It's not that I have anything against the so-called ""walking simulator"" type of games as I love The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but even then Gone Home just feels empty and shallow. I understand that the game wants to tell a story. Fair enough, but if there's nothing interesting going on and I discover everything that needs to be discovered on my first playthrough then what's the point? The note on the door you find within seconds of starting up the game has all the answers you really need. A normal playthrough will only take you one hour. It's almost insultingly short compared to any other visual novel or walking simulator I've ever played.So if there's no real gameplay, Gone Home needs to fall back on its story. That aspect is obviously the focus so I'll cut it some slack and say that if the story was good, this game would have gotten a pass. The way it depicts said story is awful though. Once again, I have to remind you that it's a mystery game with no mystery. You find out through voice recordings which is basically an excuse to have the game take place in 90's so the whole thing can be narrated that your sister is in love with another woman. First off, this begs the question, why couldn't this narrative be told through environmental storytelling? That's what the game seems to be designed for and the development team even succeeded in certain area's with their previous project on Bioshock. It would certainly make me think more highly of this game, but that's not how it's done and as a result, it feels more like an audiobook than anything else. The story itself isn't anything to write home about either. Some argue how earthshattering it is to feature a lovestory between two women and how it breaks norms, barriers or something. While it's true that this is mostly uncharted territories for video games (not that lesbians are never depicted in video games), there are millions of books and made for TV movies structured exactly the same way. Replace a few names here and there and you've got Gone Home Part Deux. There's nothing new here at all. Not to mention that the characters are so bland that they might as well have been anything else. They could have been a straight couple in a different decade and the story honestly wouldn't have made a difference. At first, I thought the timeperiod was going to be used to show how homosexuals were treated back then, but it does not take that direction. The prejudice from the parents isn't serious enough  to make me feel anything about these characters which creates a second problem. Their romance is so perfect and happy that you have to wonder what the conflict was supposed to be or why they even bothered telling this story, because as it is, it did nothing for me and considering how it doesn't tackle a lot of problems LGBT-people deal with on a daily basis like prejudice or maybe show us flashes from how much worse it was back then from a historical point of view, it probably won't do a lot for them either.If the developers didn't think that Gone Home was worth the 20 dollars asking price and it was free to play, then I would just deem the game a failure and move on, but this is not the case. They certainly must have thought highly about this game when I can find books or even films for less than half the price with the exact same story. Did I mention it took me one hour to beat this game? That's why I advise you not to buy it. Please understand this. I'm not complaining that it is not a ""real video game"". Some of my favorite games are essentially visual novels though admitedly still more of a reliance on knowledge and skill. I'm also not saying that it is bad to have women and/or LGBT-characters as your main characters in games nor am I saying that it has to feature combat or something, but this is not the way to do it. Writers take note: when you write a character who is homosexual, don't make that their only personality trait as if that even counts for a personality trait. Most people are you know, people with a developed character. There are much better story driven games on many platforms including Steam.			"

												So very disapointed with this I must admit. My intial Impressions led me to believe this to be an entirely diffrent game much more like the popular ""Amnesia"" perhaps or an older game I used to play for the playstation one called ""The Necromican"" but the more I played I couldn't help but think this game had been misrepresented somewhat. There is very little to no mystery to  this supposed disappearance, the first couple of ""clues"" I discoverd made it too obvious I thought so I played on thinking to myself there had to be more, that this story is just leading me into a false sense of security, about to take me into this mystery that I was looking forward too but before I knew it I was already at the epilogue. I enjoyed the Exploration in it and the mechanics I can't really fault. It was a disapointment but I look forward to see what the studio will do next i still maintain the opinion that had this game been what was advertised it would have hit the spot for me. Final thoughts. This is not a bad game just misrepresented or rather that is how I felt. It was worth the sale price I payed for it but certainly not the current asking price, it is in my opinion that anyone thinking of buying this should wait until it comes down in price. At the end of the day this is just my opinion of this game based on my experiances while playing, it may differ or will be completely diffrent from others experiances of this game.			"

I literally thought the end of the game was the end of the ""intro"" to the game, and I kept googling how to get to the next part of the game. The entire game was less than 2 hours long. In addition to being extremely short, the game is hardly even a game. There are literally no choices you can make right or wrong in the game. You can't mess it up, you can't die, you can't do anything wrong. If you just click on every interactable items (and there aren't all that many), then you finish the game.

												-- 5/10, mostly because of price.- Contains one tiny spoiler.If you heard that Gone Home is severely overpriced and overrated and you're still thinking about buying a copy, whoever told you that is right and deserves a gold star. ('You Tried')Gone Home is a game that you will finish in roughly two hours, even if you backtrack and look at absolutely everything as I did, listen to everything, and pay close attention to every detail. For the time that you play it, if you enjoy a good storyline, you will enjoy Gone Home.However.Gone Home is not worth $20. Luckily, I bought it when it was on sale for $5.It is a 'love story' that ends too quickly and is not ended well. However, the experience building up to the ending is worthwhile and if you have a heart, you'll likely become at least a little bit attached to the main character. (No, not the character you're playing of course! Rather, her teenaged sister who is having one too many problems.)The ending was not what I expected and to be honest, I believe my expectation would have suited the game more! (If you played it, I think we all expected the same thing in the attic.)To sum it up, Gone Home is a short fairly enjoyable experience but along with that, it is also overpriced and in my honest opinion, not immersive enough to play through a second time unless you missed the *SPOILER* sex note *SPOILER* like I did the first go around.

												It's an interesting concept, that's for sure, its kind of original in some regards, but as a game, I really wouldn't recommend it at all.Maybe if you are still in school  and want to make games for a living as an adult, then this would be a good thing to check out, but recommending this so that you can have something to ""play"", nu-uh.I feel it's kinda pretentious, but that may be influenced by how some parts of the internet exploded with praise for this ""game"" and it even recieved the VGX award for PC game of the year, beating The Stanley Parable and Papers Please. Why did it win that award? I have no idea, maybe it just tackled a certain subject in the game and thus critics praised it for how cutting edge and forward the game is.If you feel mixed about my review, then by all means buy it and see for yourself. The asking price is way too high considering how many superb indie games are on steam for less than this (Shovel Knight, The Stanley Parable, The Binding of Isaac, to name a few) and how short this experience is.

Grade: 60/100Difficulty: Can you navigate with WASD and click a mouse? Can you read beyond a 4th grade level?Pros: There are lots of details, and I am jealous of anyone who owns THAT many books and records. There are also some nice 90's references for those of us who grew up in that decade.Cons: The atmosphere makes you feel like something is going to jump out at you at any moment -- but nothing ever does. There is the occasional thunder and a few of the lights flicker a little. But otherwise it's just you and your snooping about the house. Listening to any of the cassette tapes you find is something you do at your own risk. The vocals will make your ears bleed.Replayable: No, because the story is not worth it. In fact, the story is what ruined this game for me. It focuses heavily on the younger sister, who is just your average unhappy teenager who falls in with the ever-in-trouble rebel at school -- and ultimately leads to terrible life decisions and a hugely anticlimactic ending. Do not waste your money on this game unless it is at least 75% off -- you will feel cheated otherwise.			"

												First off, this game isn't for everyone. It has no action or puzzles and in a sense is basically a walking simulator. For those of you who do not like interactive story games, DO NOT buy this game! For those of you who do, continue reading below. I will also warn whomever is reading this that this review will be quite lengthy, but will hopefully help you decide whether or not this game is for you.I do not play many indie games, so when I saw this game for sale on Steam I thought I would give it a try. You play as a girl named Katie who comes home from a year long trip in Europe to find her house empty. The basis of the game is to ""explore"" the house and to find out what happened to your family. I say explore rather sarcastically, because even though you have to hunt for clues around the house, the game is very linear and you are forced to follow a set path. The game itself is also VERY short. I took my time to explore the house and I still clocked in at only about 2 hours at the end of the game. You can look it up online but you can literally beat this game in less than one minute if you know what to look for. So for a $20 price tag, this game is akin to highway robbery and even at a discounted price it is tough to justify.Now the story itself I mildly enjoyed. First off, the ""main"" story revolves around your sister Sam, who turns out to be a lesbian very early on in the story. I personally don't mind the LGBT themes in movies and games, as long as they are not shoehorned in (which usually indicates some sort of agenda versus good storytelling). This game kinda toed the line in that regard, as I actually started to laugh as they made the not so subtle reveal. There are also other storylines that are put in the game for some reason but are not fully fleshed out, leaving the player to wonder why they were ever in the game in the first place. The most prominent example are the whole ""exercism"" and ""psycho house"" themes. Now while I realize the developers have said that there is no violence or horror in this game and it is just about exploration, it seems counter-intuitive to create a dark and forboding environment if they were not going to fully utilize it. I really did like how a lot of the story was told by the clues left around the house like letters and notes, and piecing the story together for yourself. I'll also mention that while some of the nostalgia themes from the 1990's were appreciated (I personally enjoyed the numerous X-Files references), the fact that this game is set in that time period really has no effect on the story whatsoever. To sum it all up, I liked this game. However, the underdeveloped story and characters and the extremely short playtime are too big of faults to overlook. Add in the fact that there is no replayablility to this game and the $20 price tag and you have a recipe for disaster. I am glad I did not pay full price for this game and I can guarantee you this review would be drastically different if I had. If you see this game on sale for a dollar or two, I'd say give it a try, but at the end of the day you really aren't missing anything by passing it up.			"

												I feel bad giving this game a ""Not Recommended"". Maybe this isn't the game for me. I can appreciate the attention to detail and the atmospheric conditions, and what the game is trying to represent and convey, but the experience was disappointing to me - I felt no real connection with the story, it came across a little 'rich kids problems' given the setting of the house, this seems trivial but when you are being immersed into an environment, you can't help but notice the pure scale of the house and how it relates to how the main character of the journal lives and feels. I was disappointed there was no real character development of Katie at all really - a few scraps here and there, but never beyond surface level, and even for Sam I just couldn't make that progression in creating an emotional bond with this character (and trust me, it is by no means that I am ignorant to the situation she is in, as I have parallels in my own life I can draw from). Why was there such a build up to an occult/horror undertone and then to drop it completely? The initial feeling of tenseness soon dropped to 'is it over yet?'It didn't help that the game feels poorly optimised, and it was rare that the game played entirely smoothly.There are many interactive story titles breaking the mould in terms of storytelling and immersion - I just felt this didn't quite hit the mark. I would have been shocked to buy this for €20 though - there are books with far more depth in storytelling for half that price, and that's the only thing I can compare this to - an interactive book that has good intentions, and flickers of somthing great, but fails to really capture my heart and mind.

Its a game that is short with zero replaiblity value just beat it once and that its your done type game and beside following the many story there is nothing to do beside throwing random objects around and if you want to do that go get Garrys mod (way better in that regard) so it is a intresting story but I would advise just watch a walkthrough of it or something just at least don't buy this game for 20 bucks. Oh and here is a time stamp on how short is ""short"" I beat the game while turning on all the light and having all the water running and made everywhere in the house messer then how I found it all in under an hour.

												If you're a daydreamer who loves to here stories about  teenagers coming-of-age and realising they're lesbians through discarded notes left all around the house just waiting to be found , then yeah this is a good game.No idea why, but there's was an eerie, sinister atmosphere that always made me feel like something was about to jump out at me. Maybe it's the fact that the house is abandoned, maybe it's the violent storm going on outside, maybe it's the trees banging it against the window or maybe it's just the background music.The voice acting is flawless, however. It's like they took it from a movie. It's very sentimental and progressive and effeminate.But I would recommend.			"

The early game tricks you into further exploration by promising an interesting story, but ultimately there is nothing going on in this house. People are sad, the house is normal, everything is mundane.Gone Home is an amazing atmospheric storytelling device with spectacular voice acting, level design, and pacing for what unfortunately turns out to be a very boring story about a girl's unhappy family that have just stepped out for a bit.

												I really liked this game but i wouldn't recommend it. The story is great and unfolds slowly. Although sometimes it looks scary or there are scary-ish elements, it's not. It's exploration and minor easy puzzles (figure out lock combinations) and that's pretty much it. For me, spending money on this was like spending money to go watch a movie at a theater; I was entertained for a few hours. If you're looking for replay factory and imporving your skills or character and general heart-racing excitment, this is not for you. If you want to take part of a sort of interactive story book, stop by. This made me laugh a little and yell out at my roommates a little bit of the drama as it unfolded but I realize that it's not everyone's cup of tea. Probably not most people's cup of tea actually.Great game. Not for most people.			"

												Possibly one of the worst games I've ever wasted $20 on. I get the whole #edgy game that's not really a game thing. I'll keep it short. They used all of the stock shaders and effects built into Unity3D wrote a story that was maybe worth being part of a collection of short stories or read at a literary variety show. Game was weak, effort was weak, blows my mind they have the audacity to charge $20.Source: My eyes as a game developer.			"

												This game is a series of clues to a mystery that doesn't actually exist. The early game tricks you into further exploration by promising an interesting story, but ultimately there is nothing going on in this house. People are sad, the house is normal, everything is mundane.Gone Home is an amazing atmospheric storytelling device with spectacular voice acting, level design, and pacing for what unfortunately turns out to be a very boring story about a girl's unhappy family that have just stepped out for a bit.

												I wanted to like this game.  I tried to convince myself even after I beat the game that it was worth the purchase.  But, after some reflection, I just wasn't into this game.  I usually love adventure games and exploration type games, but I was hoping for more to the story.  The pay off just didn't seem worth the build up.  I think I was expecting more of a mystery and more drama.  Unfortunately with adventure games, if you aren't into the story, the game just isn't worth while.  I would've also liked the game to be a bit longer than an hour and a half.  To sum it up, the graphics look pretty good, the story just didn't resonate with me, and the gameplay was typical adventure point and click.			"

												The game is in the year 1995, in 1995 my dad had a cellphone at work, he was a janitor it wasn't that uncommon to have phones, and no one in this family that lives in a mansion and can afford to let their kid go on holiday for a year to Europe has one? Or notepads  made of paper for leaving messages in the hallway like a normal person? It felt like a bit of a stretch that there was no actual message from anyone waiting for her telling her anything about anything when the game starts, they where after all expecting her home, suspension of disbelief I guess...Also turn the thunder off for ****s sake... it got annoying after the 5th one let alone the 50th or 500th, I actually though it took away from the playing experience.Other then that an okay walking and read and look game if you into that kinda thing, nothing special though. Play it if you bored and don't feel like reading an actual book. I'd give it a neutral if I could, but since I can't it gets a no.I took my time and looked at everything and I'd played for 2.8 hours when I finished, it can probably be finished alot quicker if you don't lift, click and read everything.

As you approach the door you find a cryptic note written by your sister, Sam, saying that she has gone and to not come looking for her. The game involves you wandering around a mansion which your family moved into while you were away looking for clues as to her whereabouts.I really enjoyed playing Gone Home.

												TL;dr: this isn't a survival/horror. It's a commentary on social issues that happens to be in a spooky house.I really liked this game in the beginning. The house, the environment feels rich and authentic. It, simply put, was spooky in a way I hadn't experienced since playing the 7th Guest. Which is awesome. The detail of the items, the feel of the home as a 'freshly moved in' place is extraordinarily well done. Everything is believable and thought out. Little details everywhere reinforce the multiple characters and stories in Gone Home. For the small team that put this together, they should be proud of their work; it is an excellent environment for exploration.As for the story and the game itself.. well... as the game progressed, and the ""plot"" played out, the whole experience.. thinned out. Suddenly I wasn't alone in a spooky house, I was alone being fed snippets of a story that did not relate directly to me, as a player.Towards the end, it slowly dawned on me that this was not a survival/horror (which, to be fair, I supposed it is not marketed as?) It felt like I started off in a genuinely spooky movie, but ended up in a Lifetime Original. It just felt like I had come in expecting one thing, and about three quarters the way through I realized that the spookiness and eerieness of the game were just incidental. Which totally sapped the suspense out of the rest of the game.That said, I have nothing against the main story (or message, if you will) of this game. I think it addresses important issues, and is genuine and feels real. But in the context of this game, it just feels out of place. Maybe I've played too many games and feel entitled to a certian consistency in gameplay? It is, after all, the developer's right to take a game in any direction they like.I feel like the dev team started with a great idea, wasn't sure how to wrap it all together, and chose to make a social statement rather than continue to work in the direction they started in. But, that's MY feelings, and MY opinion.I would recommend this game if it was marketed differently, but as it is, gives off the vibe of a survival/horror, but turns out to be something else entirely.--bp			"

												Gone Home is a brilliant game delving into the natural story telling of just being left to your own devices in an empty house. While I could speak all about the incredible, heart touch, story and absolutely speak to how it has touched my own life experiences, I can't help but also speak to the amazing detail that went into all the other stories other than the main one focused on your sister. The mother and father both have intricate stories that are just as amazing and as detailed.Other than that the gameplay it more of that of the point and click type but in a FPS control scheme. It's not for everyone and if you aren't the type of person who is naturally curious then I highly doubt this gameplay will keep you intrigued or wanting to play. If you are then this game is going to feel like a drug to your senses and will reward you for taking that extra second to look in corners.Overall I'd recommend this game to those whom would find exploring an old house filled with stories fun, and to those whom would like a deep story.

												You are not the protagonist, and Gone Home is not your story. In most games, the players write their own stories: their actions and struggles define the game plot. Not so in Gone Home: this game asks you to explore the stories of other people (your family, mostly, including the psycho great-uncle Oscar). Your impact on these people is zero, because during the game, they're not home. Also, their stories are hidden: you need to find it in odds and ends strewn around the house, and even if you find them all, there'll be a lot left to the imagination (provided you have any).If you're a narcisstic person with no emotional intelligence, this game will leave you cold because it won't be about you, but about other poeple's feelings. If you aren't, you'll enjoy a good teenie ""chick-flick"" story told from a very different angle. If you're a child of the nineties, it's worth it for amount of love and detail that went into the whole house alone. Rarely have I wandered through a game and felt so immersed.			"

												Having a hard time recommending this one.  If you really want something different and quick (1.5 hrs) then this is for you, but if you want something thats more of a traditional game then this ain't gonna cut it.  They advertise the game as being a story exploration video game and thats exactly what it is.  You come home from a long trip and you walk around the house finding clues to your family's whereabouts.  You move room to room finding notes and getting a feel for what this family is like until you reach the end of the story. There are no puzzles to solve so the story kind of just tells itself as you enter each area of the house and the story is as simple as the gameplay.The game of the year awards aren't too surprising because the game should be recognized but don't expect anythng stellar.  Although I haven't played The Stanley Parable, based on the demo, I'd recommend that over Gone Home if you want a more entertaining story exploration experience.			"

												A great novel for the demographic for which it is intended (the LGBT crowd), this novel is too short and too expensive to be worth buying.First off, 2 hours is the average completion time of this novel.  In my play of it, I searched every room, picked up every object, and read every readable piece of paper; all of this, I did in 2 hours.  2 hours is not worth $20.  Only the most popular of movies can get people to fork over $10 to see them on the big screen, and this novel is no blockbuster. This novel, while WELL paced, is for girls with an interest in gay/bisexual relationships--take note this is not a bad thing: Although consumers interested in the game should be aware of this fact in case this kind of topic may turn them off from playing such a novel.Linearly designed, using door keys to block ways, the novel leads you down a straight path.  Yes, there are many rooms and hallways to inspect, but inevitably you will go down specific ones required for you to beat the game.  The only choice the user has is how much time the user wishes to spend looking at things other than the story-required ones.  After examining and using story-required objects the novel opens the next branch of the map.  While this disallows replayability, it is atmospheric and immerses the user into the story well.  It does become repetitive, however.It is a walking simulator (not an inherently bad thing), which means the majority of interaction is walking and looking at things.  You will pick up things and toss them down, and that is how complex it gets, which for a lot of people is quite refreshing.  This simplicity allows the novel to remain casual and not a brain teaser.  The story is not complicated either.  It tells an easy to understand story about girls becoming curious about their sexual orientation, discovering it, and then the user learns about the struggles that come with such a life.In conclusion, It is a fantastic visual novel for those who dig the story.  Sadly, it is not long, nor replayable.  It feels more like chapter 1 of a longer novel.  For someone interested in female gay/bisexual relationships, wait until a Steam sale to buy this for about $5.  For those who are not interested in an LGBT story, this novel is not for you.  It is no GOTY because it short, expensive, and has a small demographic intended to play it.  For these reasons I cannot recommend this novel.For other interactive visual novels, I suggest looking at Dear Esther and Stanley's Parable.  Both of those are admittedly short as well, but they tell interesting stories as well.  I cannot recommend them, either, at their normal prices, but during a sale they are certainly bargains.  So if you like interactive novels you may like them too.			"

												Purchased this after the win at the VGXs. Walking Simulator 2013 is truly the greatest visual and auditory journey I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing - except no. I started keeping notes at the start thinking I would have to some some puzzle or mystery. You just walk around and discover audio story nibbles - all of my notes went in the garbage. This is interesting, but in the majority of universes you should not buy this game. 4/10 for an indie title.			"

												I see why they set it in the 90's cause thats when this could have been a relevant story.It's nothing more then teenage angst and drama thats been used in a million movies, only 'twist' is that the characters is homosexual.For me personally you need more than that, if you had replace rebel girl with a rebel boy and you've seen this before.It's time that writers start creating homosexual character that is not just defined by their sexual orientation.Spent less then an hour in this game before finishing this and they are asking 19eu for this?

												Gone Home is a brilliant game delving into the natural story telling of just being left to your own devices in an empty house. While I could speak all about the incredible, heart touch, story and absolutely speak to how it has touched my own life experiences, I can't help but also speak to the amazing detail that went into all the other stories other than the main one focused on your sister. The mother and father both have intricate stories that are just as amazing and as detailed.Other than that the gameplay it more of that of the point and click type but in a FPS control scheme. It's not for everyone and if you aren't the type of person who is naturally curious then I highly doubt this gameplay will keep you intrigued or wanting to play. If you are then this game is going to feel like a drug to your senses and will reward you for taking that extra second to look in corners.Overall I'd recommend this game to those whom would find exploring an old house filled with stories fun, and to those whom would like a deep story.

												You are not the protagonist, and Gone Home is not your story. In most games, the players write their own stories: their actions and struggles define the game plot. Not so in Gone Home: this game asks you to explore the stories of other people (your family, mostly, including the psycho great-uncle Oscar). Your impact on these people is zero, because during the game, they're not home. Also, their stories are hidden: you need to find it in odds and ends strewn around the house, and even if you find them all, there'll be a lot left to the imagination (provided you have any).If you're a narcisstic person with no emotional intelligence, this game will leave you cold because it won't be about you, but about other poeple's feelings. If you aren't, you'll enjoy a good teenie ""chick-flick"" story told from a very different angle. If you're a child of the nineties, it's worth it for amount of love and detail that went into the whole house alone. Rarely have I wandered through a game and felt so immersed.			"

												Having a hard time recommending this one.  If you really want something different and quick (1.5 hrs) then this is for you, but if you want something thats more of a traditional game then this ain't gonna cut it.  They advertise the game as being a story exploration video game and thats exactly what it is.  You come home from a long trip and you walk around the house finding clues to your family's whereabouts.  You move room to room finding notes and getting a feel for what this family is like until you reach the end of the story. There are no puzzles to solve so the story kind of just tells itself as you enter each area of the house and the story is as simple as the gameplay.The game of the year awards aren't too surprising because the game should be recognized but don't expect anythng stellar.  Although I haven't played The Stanley Parable, based on the demo, I'd recommend that over Gone Home if you want a more entertaining story exploration experience.			"

												Gone Home is an atmospheric walking simulator that can be finished in a mere hour if you don't search through everything in this grotesquely huge house in the suburbs..Gameplay.The game is presented in first person perspective. You move with wasd and left click to pick up and examine things. You can turn objects by holding down the right mouse button or toss what you're holding by left clicking again. Going through the house, you'll read various documents and letters that explain just why the house appears to be abandoned and you'll solve rudimentary puzzles by gathering numbers for combinations to open various locks. Nothing too strenuous or difficult..Premise/Story.You are Katie, who has just returned home from a trip abroad. You need to figure out where the hell your family has gone and you do so by looting everything. Cupboards, lockers, secret panels--nothing is safe from your prying. The story of where your little sister, Sam, has gone is cute and features the taboo subject of being a lesbian. Please refrain from rolling your eyes I am aware that this was published in 2013. There are a handful of little subplots, but the game play just isn't interesting enough to even take the time to piece them together..Atmosphere. This was the game's strength. The desolate sound of rain battering the old house, creaking floorboards, and that lightning bolt or too that catches you off-guard just adds to it. For me, who hates horror, it was entirely creepy and I had to play with the lights on..Soundtrack.Unimpressive. The ambient sounds were very good. The music was quiet and just sort of faded into the background. The cassette tapes littered through the game were just plain awful..Bottom line. I can't, with a good conscience, recommend this--especially with a 20USD price tag. If you can get the bundled version, this may be good if you're looking for something short with cards.			"

												I DON’T RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT FULL PRICEBUY ONLY AT 75% OFF. Gone home is a first person exploration game. Well maybe it’s not a game but more of an experience. There are no puzzles, no challenge and nothing to put your game skills to test here. This “game” is all about exploring a house, looking at items and basically learning more about the people who live in the house and their background.  Without spoiling the story because this is the “ meat” of the game I will have to say that it tries to create an emotional connection with the user but the problem here is that THIS connection is hard to be established on all people who play the game and it depends on their own norms/values. That is also the reason that some people like the game and others don't. Furthermore this game is full of Easter eggs. If you were born in the 80’s just like me you will find a lot of references here. Some items will bring back memories from your childhood. The “game” is all about creating nostalgia but nonetheless it covers a very sensitive topic.Personally the story for ME was not very touching and to tell the truth I enjoyed exploring the house in order to find those 80’s and early 90’s easter eggs. The main story was average and predictable to say the least.Pros: beautiful environment that looks and feels like a real house, lots of Easter eggs, 80’s nostalgia is everywhere,  good voice work, the soundtrack is excellent and the music fits with the tone of the gameCons: main story it’s predictable and boring, there is no real gameplay here, no replayability, the game is only 2 hours long and it’s also very expensive for its duration.FINAL SCORE: 6.5/10I give thumps down just because there is no middle ground in the rating system and because I recommend this game only during sales just for the nostalgia.

												Okay, I'll elaborate.I don't care if Gone Home is a ""game"" or not. Whether it's a game, movie, book, or whatever else, it provides a narrative that - despite some flaws - is ultimately worth your time. It suffers from Whedonesque overly-smarmy writing, at the cost of relatability to the characters at times, but it has some very smart ideas about its characters.Gone Home is ultimately ""about"" homophobia, and the kinds of things that may inspire someone to have that kind of mindset. Sam's character arc is a mostly well-done but pretty boilerplate love story - what's interesting is exploring the homophobia of the other people in her life and discussing the events in their lives that cause them to hold this belief despite knowing and being so close to a homosexual person. Sam's father's childhood abuse is handled particularly well - the game doesn't dwell on his uncle because his abuser doesn't deserve the attention. It's much more focused on Sam's father's survival through the events, and how this tragedy affected his views on homosexuality - which is to say, he's too scarred by his past trauma to even come close to thinking about it. He's literally too afraid to consider being more accepting.The ending is tonally unclear, but maybe it doesn't need to be specific - whether or not Sam's choices turn out the best for herself and the people around her are probably best left to interpretation. It's not the herald of a new age of ♥♥♥♥♥eo shames, and it's not even the best-written ""walking simulator"" game (that honor goes to The Stanley Parable) but it's an interesting experience that's ultimately well-written.""But this game promotes a feminist/homosexual agenda!"" ""It has no gameplay!"" ""It's not really a gaaaaaaaaame!""Please remove yourself from my friends list effective immediately.			"

												Alright, so the game is usually $19.99, but for the Winter 2015 sale it is $5.99. I purchased this game a while back at around $4.99 (iirc) and am now just getting to review it.It is certainly not worth $19.99. The fact the developers think that this game is worth $19.99 is baffling. In all honesty though, it's not worth $5.99 either. I have put 1.1 hours into this game and have beaten it twice. You might be thinking, ""Oh, he just sped through the game and tried to beat it as fast as possible so he could dog on it."" No. I literally set the mood for this game, it was night, raining and around midnight. Pretty much the same setting as the game so I had extremely high hopes for this game.Before I was about to beat it I convinced myself I wasn't about to beat it because I mean... a $20 game (bought at $5) couldn't possibly end after ONE HOUR after going through everything. Well it did, and the ending is the biggest cop out of all time. The narrative is what is praised, but its an extremely brief narrative with very shallow and thin character development. I realize this game came out two years ago, but the praise it gets boils my blood.tl;dr - game is boring, very little character development, EXTREMELY short game. Maybe buy at $0.99-1.99 to see what the hype was about, but just be warned... it's boring and just not really a good story.			"

												Gone home, to kill myself. 10/10 would walk again and drop my duck and turn on lights and pick up my duck then drop my duck and turn on lights then pick up my duck and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lights and drop my duck and turn on lightsEdit: Why is this game 21$? My friend bought this for less than 5 and even then I thought it was too much.			"

												Gone home is part of the trend of interactive novellas rather than a game per se.  It revolves entirely around the story and keeping you wanting to know the next part of that story.  I would say in both of these regards gone home works exceptionally well.Its difficult to give too much information without spoiling some elements of the story but there are portions which you will find in the form of notes etc around the house which require reading and others which give you verbal information in the form of 'diary like' snippets.  Taking the time to search for extra bits as you go round is definately worth it as it fleshes out a side story of what is happening with other parts of the familys life. Overall I have to say that the voice acting is excellent, the artwork in the house is excellent, the atmosphere is perfect and the story keeps you wanting more.  I played this on Linux and can attest to excellent performance at least on that platform.Given I took my time to examine as much as I could and it took me approximately 2 hours it may be possible to complete this in less than an hour but if you do that you will undoubtedly miss a lot of the nuance and impact of the story.  This is certainly worth experiencing and if you enjoy interactive storytelling as a medium this is a must buy I would say. "

												This will be a in depth review on Gone Home, instead of the usual one line joke because I believe the negative reviews for this game are unwarranted. This being said I want to give my personal context, and what games I personally enjoy. I do not usually like Indy titles, though have given MANY a chance. Fez, Meat Boy, ect. I understand why they are liked. But I lean towards story based gameplay.That being said I will start this review.Gone Home starts off with a odd feeling to it. You arrive after a small call home and a general backstory to literally just a empty house. After searching around for a few minutes, you begin to realize that this game is a investigation psychological thriller piece that allows you to go through the home and story at your own pace. The dialogue is well voice-acted, and the physics of the game though can be a bit clunky end up feeling completely natural. The story itself keeps you driven to read, and find more clues to the investigation.If you go hearing spoilers about the game, it will ruin the original experience this title could have delievered for you. If you are coming in to this with no spoilers, and a general idea of the investigative piece. Then you will have a AMAZING time with this game.This game is only for people that want a good story, and something that allows you to tie clues together to form a hypothesis on the plot before its final reveal. This is not Borderlands 2, Fall Out, or something that has story equal to gameplay. The gameplay is a aid towards the atmosphere of the story. Not the other way around.All this being said, it is a amazing game that I am beyond happy with. I WOULD NOT pay full price for this game. It simply is not worth 20$. However if this is on sale for even 50% off, it is a must buy. Extremely happy with the purchase.			"

												The people complaining about this being a SJW game are completely overlooking what makes this game bad.Absolutely don't pay full price. It wasn't terrible, wasn't good. I spent a good amount of the game waiting for jump scares, or some resolution to the more occult hints throughout the game, for nearly no resolution. One thing this game does well is create an eerie atmosphere.A friend told me there was a lot of ""OMG LESBIANS"" from fans when it came out. I'm 100% on board with lesbians, but there wasn't much else going for the misleading setup.I had no problem with it being a walking simulator; I enjoyed the exploring and neat layout. I didn't give a damn about the characters. Not a bit. The atmosphre is completely inappropriate for the story its trying to tell.Things this game is:A love storyTelling a love story in an unexpected wayThe love story has lesbians being portrayed in a way that is normal and superfluous, like any heterosexual love story you could findThings this game is NOT:A horror gameInterestingBy the time you realize the setup for the story hasn't been for horror, it's too late. You get the end of the love story, the game still feels creepy, you have a resolution (sort of) without feeling satisfied.It's a time-waster for maybe $5 on sale. Honestly, I wouldn't have paid that much. Maybe like. $0.25.			"

												I received this game recommended from a friend, as a trade. (May he enjoy ROTT!)Walking simulator is accurate description.Overall, took about two hours for me to finish this ""game."" To me the story didn't just touch myself so much. It's slightly interesting, sure, but not to my taste.The regular Steam price is down right insane. Well, to my understanding this game is often bundled. As said, the story, somewhat interesting, voice acting is good, touching even. I think this could had been made more interesting by adding physics, breaking stuff etc..More than just playing a cassette. Music choices I can understand era-vise, but I didn't enjoy a lot of the music choices in the game.So, with this viewpoint, I'd say it's an interesting try if you can get it in a bundle. If I could, I'd give sideways thumb, as in why not, but not worth the regular price asked!  "

It's just a short story basically, nothing mysterious about it. The game pretty much feeds you where to go and what to do, so there's not much brain power used to play it. If you want a not that great bedtime story game, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother. And definitely don't pay more than a couple dollars for it.			"

												I have generally been a fan of non-game interactive stories such as Dear Esther, but Gone Home just doesn't do it for me. I think there is too much of a disconnect between the ""gameplay"" and the story. The interactive portion is akin to a horror adventure game (Amnesia comes to mind). You are coming home after being out of the country for some time. Upon arrival, you find that nobody is home and the house has a slight eeriness to it. Lights flicker, there's rain and thunder, you are all alone... It's a perfect setup for a creepy adventure. But this is highly contrasted by the story. The story is provided as pieces of a journal that you discover as you walk around and explore the empty house. Without giving too many spoilers, the story is about a teenage romance. Right from this moment, you can probably see my confusion with the non-game: Horror-like environment and gameplay, romance story. It just doesn't fit together. In fact, I would go as far to say that Gone Home doesn't quite know what it wants to be. With that being said, I wouldn't exactly shun Gone Home completely. I think it might be worth picking up if you happen to stumble upon it during a sale, but I don't think it's worth the $20 it's asking for. There are much better non-game interactive stories to experience: The Stanley Parable and Dear Esther are just a couple that come to mind.			"

												(SPOILERS AHEAD)I'm not going to critique the narrative in the game, because it's a neat concept, but not neat enough to warrant paying $20 for it (nor neat enough to warrant it being a game). This should have just been a short story instead.When it comes to gameplay (or lack there of), it's just walking and reading. Walking Simulator 2014 basically. This isn't fun in the least. There is NO replayability in the slightest. Not to mention that the game is roughly an hour and a half long. This should have either been a free game, or (like previously mentioned) a short story.Another thing, the game seemed to be playing off of the Survival Horror demographic. Yes, I know it's not Survival Horror, but it's in an empty house with flickering/moody lights. It plays to the demographic, without giving anything close to a game that demographic would enjoy.I can summarize the plot of this game in one sentence:""Your sister is a lesbian, and she left home with her girlfriend.""That's it, the whole entire plot. Now, there's no problem with this story, there is a problem in putting it in a game where you can't do anything but walk. Even the Telltale Games (which are only narrative, little gameplay) give you the ability of choices to choose the outcome of the story. Those choices make you feel like you've actually acomplished something, that's a feeling that you can't get from Gone Home.Gone Home isn't a game. It's a bore.1/10			"

It kinda seemed like two different games to me. Now, im not a hater against same gender love stories, but the story was still bland to me. It built up a story that wasnt even there. The people that made this game had something going with this game, but it falls short. Still, it dragged my curiosity around the entire time.

												I'd imagine this is the most polarizing game of the year. If you're playing for story only and care about 90s feminism and lesbian love stories, you'd like this game. I personally don't care for the story. I felt there were too many loose ends on the subplots of the parents at the end unless I missed some items. The gameplay is more barebones than even the walking dead. The game is also way too short for $20. It's around 2 hours if you get lost. However, I did enjoy searching the house, and the textures/objects were well done. The ambiance with the storm and the creaking house had me expecting a jump scare, but there sadly was no payoff.5/10			"

I did not look up any spoilers, or cheat in anyway I know of. I do not understand how the creators can let a player that is just exploring get to the end in just a few minuets!!! I wanted to get involved with the story and have an experience but now I just feel cheated. I know the ending of the story so there really is no point in going back and ""following the clues"" or try to solve what has going to happen.

												Imagine coming home from the video store with a brand new horror movie. Your excited. You heard the house was so creepy and disturbing. You pop the tape into your VCR and hit play. Everything starts out as you would expect , though the title is  a little flowery the house doesn't disapoint. You keep watching and then suddenly it morphs into a chick flick. At the end the two main characters decide to do something stupid and throw their futures away in order to get some good loving .  You were hoping for a ghost , monster or at the worst case maybe just a dead body. You wont get anything like this. This is the wrong format to tell this story. It should be a low budget after school special about lesbian love . It should take 30 minutes minus comercials to tell . Stay away and if your looking for some cheesy chick flick time spend 10 bucks on netflix and watch  all the poorly written garbage you want and at fraction of the cost.

												Gone Home is a barely a video game and is more like a student project demonstrating a bright new idea rather than an offering that should be up on the Steam Store, let alone up for twenty dollars.At its heart, Gone Home experiments with story telling through simple narration and the placement of items.  The stories focus on the protagonist's sister (Sam), her sweetheart, and their upcoming separation as one prepares for college and the other for Basic Combat Training in the US Army.  Their story is told through notes and letters, through narration from the sister, and through the occasional concert stub or band poster.  The protagonist's parents each have a less-developed narrative arc which is told entirely through the things they own and the correspondance they receive.In a way, I would love to sit down the devs of many modern games, point to Gone Home, and say, ""That is how you tell narrative with setting!  That is how you write a story of attraction and romance!""  These two aspects are well done, and the level of attention and fidelity to minor details show just how much you can show about your characters just by things like the state of their rooms, the books on their desks, and the clothes they own.  You can learn more about Sam in five minutes glancing about her room than in ten hours of awkward dialog.Despite this one striking feature, ultimately the love story is not enough to support this game.  It's a well-told story, but one you will not want to hear a second or maybe third time.  Nor will you want to explore the house again; having seen the contents once, you will have seen them all.  Suddenly, the one-time trip to explore the house becomes the tedium of doing something rote.  The game advertises there's no puzzles and no combat, and while that makes for an interesting experience one time, once you've picked up a few dozen ticket stubs, high school notes, and books, there really is no reason to engage in that experience again, is there?However, the game is smart enough to realize the player can put together a story on their own.  Sam's story is inescapable, but the stories for your parents are ""hidden.""  Their tales come out only for a player who pays attention to the clues in the environment.  It's not a great mystery requiring Poirot-like leaps of logic to solve, but it does showcase a beautiful example of how background details can be left in the background and the player can be trusted to find them.  Nowadays, when most games feel a need to focus the player like a laser on ever aspect, it's a nice touch.  It's also a beautiful example storytelling without dialog and without words.  No one is ever seen in the house, but you can tell the awkward dynamics of your family from just a few glances through their things.  Speaking of those awkward family dynamics, great job putting in realistic family tensions.  Most narratives portray families with such operatic, almost comic bonds, while here, the dynamic is much like a real group of flesh and blood human beings.  There's no supreme dysfynction with patricide and matricide, or screaming, juvenile daddy issues, or any of that nonsense.  And it works.  Listen, writers: having an occasional normal family works.Simply put, a game needs teeth.  This does not necessarily mean every game needs to be an FPS, but with no challenge and no element of change, a game has nothing to draw the player back.  Nothing you as the player do in Gone Home matters - you stumble blindly forward, tripping over the solutions to the game until you've collected the right plot coupons and it ends.  Sam's story will be told and all you have to do with it is just keep clicking on things until the game ends.This isn't The Stanley Parable, with its metanarrative about both gaming and working.  This isn't a throwback to the old-school adventure games.  Gone Home is exactly what it says on the tin - a one hour long experience of bumbling through other people's underwear drawers.  While its cute little story is well-told, there's no commentary or larger discussion to be had.  There's nothing here which has a right to ask for twenty dollars.  There's nothing here which should ask for five dollars.  Such a short, simple, unrepeatable experience would fit in a twenty minute student film without wasting my time  opening every sock drawer in the house in case I missed a plot coupon.  Gone Home wants to charge for admission to the show, then gets up there for one good song and calls it a night.			"

												Gone Home is a game beckoning players to solve its mystery. The moment the player walks into the empty house he or she is drawn in by the stillness of the vacant home. So begins a search to figure out where everyone has gone. The search never leaves the house, but the house is incredibly large and tightly-packed with subtle clues and objects to flesh out the plot. Gone Home doesn't require the player to do any more than explore, so if you're looking for anything more than a story-driven exploration game I'm afraid you may be disappointed. However, Gone Home commits to what it does, and it's that commitment that makes it a wonderful game. On paper the story would seem lackluster, but it's the feeling and voice-acting of the narration of notes littered around the house that help give the game life. You begin to see that all the characters involved are deep and relatable even though you will never lay eyes on them. As you sift through all the belongings of your family you'll become closer with these people that have a lot more going on than you realize. It makes you wonder how much someone could get to know you just by going through your own home. As creepy as it sounds, Gone Home is a game that makes the player think about how these relationships are affecting each other, and ultimately affecting the end portion of the story.Honestly, it's the sound design of Gone Home that heightened the experience for me. The sounds of an empty home during a thunderstorm were oddly chilling even though I knew I had nothing to fear. The crisp dialogue is perfectly cast, and the actors did an amazing job. This is one of those cases where great writing and acting come together to create something truly great. The soundtrack, however, really hit home for me. It's beautifully done comes in at just the perfect time for emphasis to what's happening in the story. I have the soundtrack on my phone as we speak, which is only something I do with the my favorites.I love simple walking simulators that allow you to relax and enjoy a great story. Gone Home is well made, and there's a lot of love in it. If you enjoy a good story with relatable characters and a little exploration, you should pick this one up. However, be warned that Gone Home only lasts a couple hours unless you REALLY dig deep into the environment. As much as I love it, I would suggest getting it at a discount.			"

												A story-based adventure/exploration game with very little story and very little game. You are a teenage girl, coming home after a year abroad, to find the home empty. So what does a girl do in this case? She goes rummaging in the trash for notes about what could have possibly happened. It is this implausability that really detracted from the mood the game was aiming for. All you do is rummage through the house for written notes from various members of the family that conveniently allude to the plot. Interacting with some objects/notes allows the player to hear narration from the sister, a key figure to the storyline. The story is very forgettable, however, I do commend the game for effective use of multiple red herrings (some of the best I've seen in a videogame).			"

												Why are you exploring this large empty house? Mostly to figure out what happened to your sister. But the story is dull and it doesn't tell what happened in the past through the environment like it's supposed to.  It's narrated to you through your sister's voice... when there is no clear way to explain why you are able to hear it (you can turn this off, but the game becomes even more boring because it feels emptier and lifeless). The biggest weakness in this game is that there are no characters to interact with and nothing for you to do with the information you find. This is a step back from other great adventure games like Blade Runner and The Last Express. Those games put you in a role where understanding the perspectives of the other characters was very useful to your end goals and would dramatically affect your actions/decisions. Thus, I actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what happened and went looking through every single piece of the environment to make sure I didn't miss anything.Not impressed at all.			"

												This was one of the most boring burglary simulators I have ever played. There was no sneaking mechanic and the house you rob had almost no jewelry or high end electronics. The worst yet is that the game dangles the sweet carrot of a top of the line laserdisc CD player in cryptic notes which is nowhere to be found! In addition to the aforementioned missing sneak ability, you had almost no way to keep track of all your plunder. I had to pile up all my freshly stolen coffee mugs and toilet paper rolls by the front door! On the positive side, the difficulty is low since the family remains blissfully unaware of your felonious intent throughout the course of the game.I would recommend this game if you want to feel out a possible career in crime, but are afraid of going for a real score the first time.

												I went into this completely blind, only knowing that it had recieved tons of positive press and was devoloped by members of the extremely underated sequel to the original Bioshock.  After completing it I cannot understand why it has garnered the praise that it has.  I can appriciate a Dear Esther style exploration game that is simply ambient story telling, but what we have here is a poorly written, preditcable story that tries its hardest to achieve emotional resonance with the player whilst simultaneously having the (literal) depth of a high school freshman's diary.  All the while the game baits the player with red herrings that are far more interesting than what is actually there.I went in expecting great things, and came out utterly disappointed.  I hope I enjoy their next project more than I did this one.			"

												You know those quiet moments in, say, a Bioshock or a Fallout?  Where you get to take a break from the action and just walk around somebody's abandoned house, collecting audio diaries and figuring out what happened here?  The poingnat, sort of sad story of exctly WHY this house is abandoned and free to be rummaged through by the likes of you?  If I'm being honest, those moments are among my favorite, so one of the Bioshock devs going indie and making a game consisting of literally JUST that scratches a definite itch for me.  People tend to criticize this as a ""non-game,"" and they're not completely incorrect.  If you rummage behind a bookcase, say, you won't find money or ammo, just a half-full bottle as a quiet indicator of how Dad is coping with his failed writing career.  It's short and on rails and there's not really anything you can do to change the outcome, but this game has so much heart and emotion going for it that I've got to recommend it.  The ending made me teary-eyed and, if it's the sort of thing you're into, it is absolutely chock-a-block with 90's nostalgia.  Get it on sale to avoid any buyer's remorse over the brevity, but do get it.			"

												I just finished this so I want to vent.Note: If you want a 'game', don't buy this. It's not a 'game'. I'm not giving this a thumbs down because it's not a 'game', but because it's crap as an...open-story type idea (a shame; I wanted to be pleasantly surprised)The atmosphere is great. The concept is fairly good. Then it all falls down.  You walk around and interact with items which tell you parts of a story. There is supposedly some huge plot twist in this story, but you find it out in the first 15 minutes and it's really not that exciting. There is an inventory system for the maybe 3 items you find in the game. You then walk around and click on things in a house for roughly 50 minutes, then the story ends, just like that.The story is plain boring and you are never given a reason to care. There is no emotional attachment. It's also insultingly short. There's all this stuff you can find about your father, or the supposed 'psycho' house, or ANYTHING...but nope, it's 'your sister falls in love'.Pretentious and a total waste of my £1.70 other than to finally have proof that this is garbage.

												An okay interactive story that is criminally overpriced; I beat it without guides in 57 minutes. This is a complete and absolute ripoff at anything more than $5.Now, the game.This is basically an interactive story that has you wandering around a house finding items to interact with in order to unlock voiced journal entries to read. That's it. Point, click, listen, credits. There's no challenge here nor any real sense of gameplay. This is something you play for the story, plain and simple.I'm not going to say that I dislike this game because it's an interactive story; I enjoyed The 39 Steps even though it was an interactive story, but it was because it was a good story, suspenseful and exciting in some parts and well-written. Gone Home generally has none of this. I can't really say much about the story without spoiling it, but trust that this story seems to be targeted towards teenagers.This is definitely a game that can be skipped, as the asking price is absolutely ridiculous, and you could probably watch someone speedrun the story on Youtube in 15-20 minutes to view the entire experience. No reason to buy this.			"

												To experience a story just by discovery and reading with no violence or other characters actually around can be amazing if done right. Gone Home is one of those experiences. I wasn’t sure what to expect when starting up Gone Home. I didn’t read much on it before getting it just thought it looked cool and said why not.You are Katie Greenbriar who has just arrived home after been abroad for a year. Unfortunately no one is home to greet you but it’s not really a bad thing either. The story is told through exploration and discovery. Letters scattered throughout the house written and narrated by your sister are spoken with such emotion and feeling that just sucks you in. It was wonderful hearing her talk about how she falls in love with a girl who is her best friend and the issues that came along with that and just growing up.You can also discover the stories of you mom, dad, and an uncle who is deceased by things you pick up through the house. Dad getting some success as a writer and losing it. Mom seeming to be lonely and maybe having an affair. Uncle supposedly haunting the house you live in. It really makes you feel like you’re really there doing it in real life.Almost everything in the game is interactive to deepen the immersion. Turn lights on and off, open and close drawers, and listen to music from cassette tapes you find. Find secret passages through the house to expand on the stories. Sound in the game is fantastic with the sound of rain and thunder outside while you wander around the house. I could have sworn I even heard other sounds at times which may have been a ghost. There’s no violence or interaction with other characters, just some wonderful stories to discover all while having a nice relaxing time. Only problem I have is there’s not lots more to discover and keep me sucked into this world. So try it out when you have a few hours to spare and see if you have an experience to remember.Bear Rating: 9.5/10			"

Walking isn’t a GameThe walking simulator, it’s strange genre isn’t it?I mean, it doesn’t sound very appealing,  Just walking around, looking at stuff.There’s nothing to hide behind, no handily positioned crates, no half height walls, in fact there’s nothing to hide from, not a bad guy in sight (or a good guy for that matter).A game devoid of characters where you walk around and look at things....Sounds a bit dull doesn’t it?That was my attitude until I finally sat down and took the time to play, no, to experience Gone Home.It’s an ExperienceGone home isn’t a “game”, it’s an experience.It’s a journey of discovery, of piecing together fragments of a delicately woven story waiting to be told.It’s about atmosphere and contemplation; it’s makes you think.If you’re the sort of player that skips through the text in games, or hits escape to rush past all those boring cut scenes, then I suspect Gone Home isn’t going to be something you’ll enjoy.Which is fine, there’s nothing wrong in knowing what you like, grab your controller and go play another round of Call of Duty, this title isn’t for you.However, if you read through all the books inside the Elder Scrolls games to add flavour to the plot, If you enjoy the law behind the Dragon Age titles, in short, if you enjoy a good story and like to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the tale being told then you’re missing a gem if you haven’t played Gone Home yet.A House is not a HomeThe premise is a simple one, you’ve returned home after a year of travelling only to find the family house empty.Everything is dark and quiet; the expected hustle and bustle of family is eerily absent.Where are your parents and your little sister?Why isn’t someone there to welcome you back?Standing in the hallway, travelling bag at your feet.You’re all alone, the only person in an empty house.This is where you journey starts, is that note on the door...But it is a characterYou might be the only person in the game, but you are not the only character.The house itself is your whole world whilst playing Gone Home and every nook and cranny is crammed full of character.There are notes, diaries, letters and countless other more subtle clues for you to find as you explore, each of which will help you piece together what has been happening whilst you were away.Every element of the house, every detail on the fixtures and fittings has been so lovingly crafted that you can’t help but feel completely immersed as you  journey through the various rooms.The Real WorldThe quality of the writing and voice acting is stellar.The ever present thunderstorm raging outside and the occasional flickering light all add to the eerie feeling of the place.Every inch of this title exudes atmosphere.Nothing feels over the top, or exaggerated, it all just seems so plausible, so intimate and so real.Fading CenturyIt’s also worth noting that this game is set in the mid 90’s, a time when I was a teenager myself.For me this setting carries with it such a huge sense of nostalgia, a feeling of going back to my own teenage years, it makes me want to wrap myself up in the experience like a big comfy duvet and never leave.UnspoiledGone Home is a difficult title to explain in a review, every element of the narrative beyond what I’ve already told you is a discovery to be unearthed, a jigsaw piece of the various family members’ struggles over the last year.The magic, the sense of fulfilment comes from discovering these things for yourself.The interwoven tapestry of the lives you’ll discover in Gone Home are too special to be spoiled here.You Can Go Home Again.If you’re looking for an intimate, nostalgic and engrossing journey to entertain you for a few hours then you’re unlikely to find better than Gone Home.If you like the sound of what you’ve read then why wait?It’s time to go back to ’95, open the front door, drop your travel bag on the floor and take a breath.It’s raining outside and there’s a house full of family secrets to explore.It’s time to Go Home.( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												Lesbians 10/10Seriously though, you can listen to a Talyor Swift song (and pretend shes singing about a girl not a boy) and get most of the story here.New girl moved to a new school and life is so hard and no one gets me! Oh turns out im a lesbian and im totally going to run away with this chick I have known for like 3 months and ♥♥♥♥ my parents they dont get me!The graphics are alright but nothing to WRITE HOME about... Ha. You would think that only having to design 1 house would mean that the devs would put more details in the game and re use less things. It would seem this family loved their dressers and bookshelves so much that they bought them same exact ones and scattered them through the house!They also have the same 'random clutter of letters and papers' that they use over and over. The clothes in the draws are downright laughable. Seriosuly. Google them. They have a few tapes and such you can put in and listen to but seeing as my taste in music isn't♥♥♥♥♥♥ I pulled them out and burned them with fire. (In my mind)There are a large number of letters/notes that are written in what I like to call 'doctor's writing'. Which means that you cant bloody read them. A very important feature is missing from this game that hurts the expirence a great deal. That would be the ability to transfer messages on letters and such to a simple typed format overlayed over the note for people that dont want to take 3 years the break the code of what these people are writting. It also suffers from to many narritives. You have about 5 stories going on at once that you are piecing together and it gets a tad confusing trying to keep names together as the diary entries only track Sam's letters and no one elses. In fact it seems you learn more about everyone else. Almost nothing is learned about the playable character other than we went on a trip to Europe and places and we are 3 years older than our sister.There are very little physics to speak of. You can pick up and throw a few items in the game but the physics are some of the worst I have seen in a while.To top of the insult we have the game bearly clocking in at an hour for someone that hasn't played it before and read most of the notes that werent complete chicken scratch. There isn't any replayability for this either. That means you are paying a Hamilton for an hour. I would say you are better off just buying a Taylor Swift album which will last longer, gets the same message accross, and at least is a nice voice to listen to. (I know that was the second time I mentioned her but this story just made me think of Taylor Swift so damn much.)For what its worth the voice actor for Samantha does a pretty good job and does bring a little emotion to an otherwise cringeworthy story. Thats about the only good I can say though.Also who just walks into their parents house and goes through all their♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wouldn't a normal person just go to bed or wait for someone to come home?...Or Go home rather... Ha....			"

												Gone Home tells the story of a young woman coming home in the nineties. Her sister is supposed to be there as their parents are away but with a home in the dark, with the sister missing.... What happened? Which are the mysteries? Are you ready for the scare of your life?Well, it's just a point and click game, visiting rooms, finding the story of your sister, the music she likes, her rebellion against the society in the nineties, her friends, her hobby....The graphics are correct but the ambiance... I was really on my toes and watching my back, expecting a paranormal entity to get me.... until the end.*cough* Well, I managed to scare myself for nothing anyway *cough*The soundtrack is pretty good too. And discovering the struggling of the young woman is interesting. Because her story is still lived by millions. And that's interesting.I think I wouldn't have enjoyed Gone Home so much if I hadn't set in my mind that something will appear out of the blue and scares me. But in your house, with nobody, with locked rooms, in the dark, what do you expect? Horrible things.True, the game is overpriced: 20$ is perhaps a little much. So wait until there is a good deal, like today (-88%).			"

												This game is terrible.  It is not in the slightest bit challenging, but is instead one long fetch quest comprised of smaller fetch quests.  The story is boring and trite and relies on it's lesbian characters to carry it.  Save yourself a few boring, unfulfulling hours, and look elsewhere.			"

												Gone Home is not your usual ''run-and-gun'' or ''explore, level up, evolve'' game. Many people won't give it a chance, because the gameplay is just too poor.However, I couldn't help myself but finish this game, solely because of the amazing storyline. I felt from the beginning that the story was going to be a good one, and I was right. Now, obviously, not everyone will share my opinion. I see that most voted reviews describe it as a bad game, almost everyone saying the story wasn't thrilling either.As such, I recommend you should buy this game on sale and only if you like being told a story, while you're not doing much, otherwise you might regret your purchase.I don't have much else to say about the game, as it may turn up as potential spoilers. I'll let you figure out, if you are interested.Pros: +the storyline was very interesting and kept me wanting to find out more; it's one of those ''collect all pieces of the journal and then read them in the correct order to understand the story'';+atmosphere was perfect, in my opinion; you hear the storm outside the house and the noises you're making while interacting with objects are accurate (oh dear, pickup the cassettes and put them in the radio whenever you have the chance);+ the secret passages;Cons: -the gameplay is lacking features; you can only walk around and pickup/activate notes and objects;Personal rating: 75/100 - Good			"

												I liked it. It's small, not difficult, peaceful exploration game. I spent 2+ hours to finish it, but I really enjoyed it. It was something special. To feel what the main character feels, what felt story characters. It's too rare to feel like that in a game, at least for me.I recommend it to everyone.			"

												Plot was unengaging and unsurprising, felt like an essay I wrote in high school. Atmosphere was not enough to make up for the severely limited interaction with the environment and the lackluster story. Gone Home felt like a prototype for a new way to tell short stories or present interesting atmospheres, but it still could have been more interactive. If the framework is picked up by someone willing to write a decent story, flesh out interaction with the enviroment and create enough content to engage the player for a couple of hours at least it could be a good game. To me, as it is, Gone Home did not live up to it's hype nor reception. [3/10]			"

												'Gone Home' plays out like an interactive graphic novel, as you return home only to find that your parents and sister are away. As you explore the house, you learn more about your family and what's happened to them. It may give the impression that it's meant to be a horror game, but it's more about exploration and narrative than cheap scares.The game doesn't have a lot of replayability, so I don't know that it's worth USD$20 (I finished it in roughly two and a half hours) but it is definitely worth playing, so pick it up if you see 'Gone Home' on sale. :-)			"

												Gone Home is a subtle, perfectly paced family home mystery that will send chills down your spine. This is one of those beautiful, smartly made games that only come along once a year. What it lacks in difficulty and length it makes up entirely for in grace, beauty and substance. You play the role of Kaitlin, a young adult who has just come home from Europe, only to find her family is missing with no further explanation, no intitial backstory, and no expository dialouge. I can't say much more about it without ruining the main premise, or any of anyone's vast intricate lives revealed through their items, but I will say everyone has a history in this family, and an intresting one at that.The simple yet stunning graphics are to be commended in a company so small, but still pale in comparison to some of it's indie big brothers, such as Dear Esther, but the original artwork and music is beautifully crafted and placed throughout the story. You can see the amount of work Fullbright has jammed into this somewhat small (two hour) game of exploration.The narration given by Sarah Robertson (Sam) is something to be commended, and generally sets the beautiful, yet creepy atmosphere, and lends to the ending being all the better (crazier and more unexpected). After seeing the attic (dark room), I guarantee you will get chills running up and down your spine for a few hours to come. Parentheses.All and all, the is a great game, even if it is a few dollars, euros, pounds, or shillings too expensive. It's simple, it's short, and it's horrifyingly beautiful, Gone Home gets a 8.5 out of 10. Hopefully Fullbright branches out into this genre, creating larger and more chilling settings and tales.			"

												Sort of torn on whether I should recommend this or not, maybe I'm just a stingy person. It's an incredible experience, but I do stress experience, not game. There's very little interactivity beyond clicking and pointing, story line is amazing though. I paid ten euro for it in the sale and I STILL feel a bit sore considering I only got an hour and a half out of it. The lack of gameplay mechanics means I'll probably never play it again. I can only imagine paying full price, it's very expensive for the amount of content.			"

												I'm happy I bought this game on sale because I was completely disappointed when I finished it.  It took me about 3-4 hours (and a few walkthrough tips) and the ending just felt so anticlimatic.  I will explain as best as I can without including any spoilers. Over the years I've played a lot of games with a storyline that requires you to explore, complete puzzles, etc. to solve the mystery and finish the game.  I'm including all the Nancy Drew mystery games I played when I was younger too.  Well...this game kinda sucked compared to those other ones.  At first though, it seems like it's going to be really cool.  The whole atmosphere of the game is this amazingly creepy mansion, in the middle of the night, with a wicked thunderstorm going on outside.  If you wear headphones while you play it really helps immerse you in the game, with all the weird noises and sounds that surround you as you investigate the house.  However, I think it's misleading because the actual storyline itself, wasn't scary or intense, and you realize this pretty early on as you begin to understand more.  It was an interesting storyline but it was predictable in the end. I felt like there was all this buildup and then...well, you know how you watch a movie and it really keeps your attention and you're enjoying it and then it ends and you think, ""Really? That's it??"".  Yeah, that's how I felt when I finished this game.  Who knows though, maybe I missed stuff in the story that would have amped up the creepy part (beyond the actually house itself).  Frankly though, I have no desire to play again and bother trying to find out.			"

												Ok so I'm well aware of the controveries. The LGBT stuff, the fact that it sells itself as a horror game initially and then isn't one, etc.But that's irrevalent in my case, for I am going to rate this solely on what it is: A Walking Simulator and Visual Novel.And it does those well. It describes a story of love in an era when such love would be frowned upon. And yes, it is a political point, but the idea people have with that game that it has a political agenda seems a bit far-fetched in my opinion.The story is compelling, at least in my opinion. Picking up journal pieces and slowly piecing them together leads to a strong narrative.But most people aren't willing to buy a story for $20 when they could buy another game.So do what I did. Buy it via Humble Bundle. Or get it on sale.Cause at those points, the sappy narrative will be worth your while.			"

If anyone questions videogames as art, or as a method of story telling beyond simply 'shoot the enemy' then they should play Gone Home.If you simply want a game that is about shooting or blowing things up then this isn't for you... if you want a great story then buy it and enjoy discovering one piece by piece.I can't express how much I want to discuss this game, but I also don't want to ruin it for anyone, so let me end on the note that this game knows exactly what feelings it is trying to evoke and it delivers.

												A short, enjoyable tale about family, friends, and lovers. You take the place of Katie, the eldest daughter of a family of four who has returned from studying abroad in Europe for the past year. You return home to an empty house your family inherited while you were away. In an FPS discovery/journey style game, you must locate and decode clues around the enormous house to find out what exactly happened to your younger sister, and where your parents are.It is a gem of an indie game, and was enjoyable, heartfelt, and relatable from start to finish. I definitely recommend picking this game up for the unique experience, and don't be surprised if you finish it in a couple hours.			"

My wife and I switched off who was controlling and enjoyed the mystery of what has happened while you were away on vacation. It reminds me of older adventure games where the objective isn't action but looking for clues and enjoying a story. The controls consist of walking around and picking up objects. You will be reading the different notes you find around the house and listening to journal entries.			"

												Between the three-dimensional characters, immaculate pacing, and omnipresent, slightly spooky atmosphere, this game knows what it is doing. I became so invested in the Greenbriar family and their unfolding story that I found myself tossing bottles around in both relief and exasperation at a couple points, to say nothing of the gratuitous headbanging I indulged in with Lonnie's cassettes. Intermittent lightning strikes, groans from an old house settling, and flickering lightbulbs kept me on edge and engaged, just waiting for the other shoe to drop, all the way up to the end.			"

												Alright, so it's time to review this highly critically acclaimed game. First of all I'm gonna say that I would probably neither give the game a thumbs up or a thumbs down but more like something in between. Since I can't do that it's gonna be a thumbs up. Im gonna give the game props for telling a sweet little love story that hits close to home, without the use of cutscenes or dialogue but through interaction with the environment. The kind of metamorphosis between gameplay and narrative that I really would like to see in more games - You can tell the inspiration these guys took from BioShock after they left 2KGames. The detail put into the game; The 90s pop cultural references to famous rock bands, tv shows, movies and books alike did well for the immersion. I'm a big fan of games like Gone Home that encourages exploration in order to provide further exposition to the overarching plot. There are so many items you can interact with in the environment and visually it looks beautiful. This is what I'd like to see in more adventures games, and horror games, alike. Bigger emphasis on exploration and interaction with the environment that made up for the game's rather short length, which ended up being almost 5 hours of game time for me. This is what drags the game down for me. It was incredibly short for an adventure game, but the developing team was small in size, nontheless, and it felt more like an experiment for something greater - Because Gone Home could be so much more! The exploration is pretty much all there is to this game, combined with the short length, it's not worth the high price it originally was set to before it went on sale. I ended up paying only 6 euros, which was fair enough for me. It was 6 euros worth my time. I hope to see more from these guys in the future.			"

May or may not have shed a tear, can't confirm. Would play again.Can't say I'd pay full price but its well worth the movie price for the movie experience.			"

												Gone Home is a subtle, perfectly paced family home mystery that will send chills down your spine. This is one of those beautiful, smartly made games that only come along once a year. What it lacks in difficulty and length it makes up entirely for in grace, beauty and substance. You play the role of Kaitlin, a young adult who has just come home from Europe, only to find her family is missing with no further explanation, no intitial backstory, and no expository dialouge. I can't say much more about it without ruining the main premise, or any of anyone's vast intricate lives revealed through their items, but I will say everyone has a history in this family, and an intresting one at that.The simple yet stunning graphics are to be commended in a company so small, but still pale in comparison to some of it's indie big brothers, such as Dear Esther, but the original artwork and music is beautifully crafted and placed throughout the story. You can see the amount of work Fullbright has jammed into this somewhat small (two hour) game of exploration.The narration given by Sarah Robertson (Sam) is something to be commended, and generally sets the beautiful, yet creepy atmosphere, and lends to the ending being all the better (crazier and more unexpected). After seeing the attic (dark room), I guarantee you will get chills running up and down your spine for a few hours to come. Parentheses.All and all, the is a great game, even if it is a few dollars, euros, pounds, or shillings too expensive. It's simple, it's short, and it's horrifyingly beautiful, Gone Home gets a 8.5 out of 10. Hopefully Fullbright branches out into this genre, creating larger and more chilling settings and tales.			"

												Plot was unengaging and unsurprising, felt like an essay I wrote in high school. Atmosphere was not enough to make up for the severely limited interaction with the environment and the lackluster story. Gone Home felt like a prototype for a new way to tell short stories or present interesting atmospheres, but it still could have been more interactive. If the framework is picked up by someone willing to write a decent story, flesh out interaction with the enviroment and create enough content to engage the player for a couple of hours at least it could be a good game. To me, as it is, Gone Home did not live up to it's hype nor reception. [3/10]			"

												'Gone Home' plays out like an interactive graphic novel, as you return home only to find that your parents and sister are away. As you explore the house, you learn more about your family and what's happened to them. It may give the impression that it's meant to be a horror game, but it's more about exploration and narrative than cheap scares.The game doesn't have a lot of replayability, so I don't know that it's worth USD$20 (I finished it in roughly two and a half hours) but it is definitely worth playing, so pick it up if you see 'Gone Home' on sale. :-)			"

												I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into when a friend let me play Gone Home.  I bought the game shortly afterwards.  If anyone questions videogames as art, or as a method of story telling beyond simply 'shoot the enemy' then they should play Gone Home.If you simply want a game that is about shooting or blowing things up then this isn't for you... if you want a great story then buy it and enjoy discovering one piece by piece.I can't express how much I want to discuss this game, but I also don't want to ruin it for anyone, so let me end on the note that this game knows exactly what feelings it is trying to evoke and it delivers.

												Ok so I'm well aware of the controveries. The LGBT stuff, the fact that it sells itself as a horror game initially and then isn't one, etc.But that's irrevalent in my case, for I am going to rate this solely on what it is: A Walking Simulator and Visual Novel.And it does those well. It describes a story of love in an era when such love would be frowned upon. And yes, it is a political point, but the idea people have with that game that it has a political agenda seems a bit far-fetched in my opinion.The story is compelling, at least in my opinion. Picking up journal pieces and slowly piecing them together leads to a strong narrative.But most people aren't willing to buy a story for $20 when they could buy another game.So do what I did. Buy it via Humble Bundle. Or get it on sale.Cause at those points, the sappy narrative will be worth your while.			"

												A hard-hitting, mysterious, masterful game from this four-person development team. Like the best narrative-driven video games, Gone Home tells its story in a way that only video games can, and does so at a methodical, pitch-perfect pace. It's nostalgic in a way that I've never seen a video game be before; those of you who vividly remember the 1990's will find surprise after surprise here. Gone Home is easily worth all the hype and praise it's been generatating. This is one you won't forget.			"

												This game received a lot of love from critics when it came out, initially resulting in an over 90% metascore. Most critics praised it for being unconventional, experimental, emotional and unique. While some gamers agreed, a large part of the user community didn’t seem quite as excited about Gone Home, calling it “boring”, “not even a game”, “too short and still a waste of time” or simply “too expensive for the content you get”. Gone Home apparently is one of those love-it-or-hate-it games.I’m also having a hard time calling narrative-driven games actual “games”, since there is hardly any gameplay or challenge to be found. All you can do is walk around, click on objects and crouch while you figure out the story. That’s why I also understand people who call it boring, because there is just not much happening on the screen. And yes, it is short; very short. Even searching the whole house and reading every letter and scrap hardly got me two hours of gameplay with a replay value close to zero. So yes, its standard price is way too expensive for the content you get, so I waited until it was on sale. And I didn’t regret the purchase. At first I just really enjoyed that good old 90s nostalgia which made me immediately miss my own good old times. The overall atmosphere is pretty decent, although it might come along as to horror-y for a game that has absolutely no horror in it. Sometimes it gave me the impression to get jumpscared any minute, which just felt a little out of place for a love story. Since I want my review to be free of spoilers, I won’t give you too many details about the story itself. Let’s just say I found the story wasn’t as original or daring (when it comes to the topic of homosexuality) as some people said it would be. It’s just another love story in my opinion and love stories are not my cup of tea by any means. However, I still found it very touching at some moments. The monologues are very well written and the voice actress reading them with a beautiful voice and the fitting amount of emotion does a fantastic job in helping you imagine how things developed for the characters. Creating such an immersion without much actually happening on screen is something not many games can pull off.I enjoyed this game a lot and I’ll probably think about it for quite some time, but I still have to say that 20 € is just too much for two hours of gameplay. Gone Home might probably have prevented a lot of the hate it got if the price wasn’t so high in the first place. So wait until it’s on sale and have a good time if: -	You enjoy exploring an environment and unwrapping a story-	You enjoy (love story related) emotions in a story-	You enjoy reading and listening to monologues in a game-	You don’t mind the lack of actual gameplay or challenges-	You don’t mind a game being short			"

												Alright, so it's time to review this highly critically acclaimed game. First of all I'm gonna say that I would probably neither give the game a thumbs up or a thumbs down but more like something in between. Since I can't do that it's gonna be a thumbs up. Im gonna give the game props for telling a sweet little love story that hits close to home, without the use of cutscenes or dialogue but through interaction with the environment. The kind of metamorphosis between gameplay and narrative that I really would like to see in more games - You can tell the inspiration these guys took from BioShock after they left 2KGames. The detail put into the game; The 90s pop cultural references to famous rock bands, tv shows, movies and books alike did well for the immersion. I'm a big fan of games like Gone Home that encourages exploration in order to provide further exposition to the overarching plot. There are so many items you can interact with in the environment and visually it looks beautiful. This is what I'd like to see in more adventures games, and horror games, alike. Bigger emphasis on exploration and interaction with the environment that made up for the game's rather short length, which ended up being almost 5 hours of game time for me. This is what drags the game down for me. It was incredibly short for an adventure game, but the developing team was small in size, nontheless, and it felt more like an experiment for something greater - Because Gone Home could be so much more! The exploration is pretty much all there is to this game, combined with the short length, it's not worth the high price it originally was set to before it went on sale. I ended up paying only 6 euros, which was fair enough for me. It was 6 euros worth my time. I hope to see more from these guys in the future.			"

												I can't really add to the great deal that has already been written about how important and unique the story line is in this game, but I can say that it was a joy to play through it. The game play mechanics are simple and a lot of the strength comes from the world you're experiencing and the multiple plot threads you follow. (Though there is something perfect about the ""Put back"" mechanic. After examining an object it's easy to replace it where you found it as opposed to flinging it to the floor like every undesired chunk of loot in your Skyrim house. You're not a looter, the house you're exploring is *your* home)My strong suggestion is to have at least one other person playing with you.

The game managed managed to keep me playing the entire way through and the tension did not decline at all. The atmosphere and the story is going to keep you  going to the end.The only downside to the game is the length, but they surprised me how well you can fit story in such a small space. I played for about 1,5 hours and i am sure you can uncover all the secrets of the game in 2-2.5 hours.

												A disclaimer is in order: This is not a game. The only meaningful choice is whether you continue to explore, or stop. There are no opponents, and the only obstacles are a handful of locked doors, the keys to which appear as you progress. Rather this is a work of digital fiction, a set of character studies told through the letters and keepsakes that they have acquired, through the exploration of a virtual world and through connections in the mind of the observer.Without actually including any of them, the story presents us with several multifaceted cast members and the problems they face in life, work, love and family with a respect that feels at odds with an inherently voyeuristic aspect of the situation. The way it manages to touch on sensitive and dark issues tactfully, and with compassion even for those in the wrong, reflects a meaning of ‘mature’ that more mainstream games often overlook.There are some flaws: a bit of railroading and one illogically locked door; an overuse of some props and inconsistent decisions about what is or isn’t interactive; and an occasional disconnect between those props, and sections of the story. None of which should impede anyone who didn’t lose interest in the first paragraph.			"

												I throughly enjoyed this game and felt it was well worth the sale price of ~6.50, It provided me with several hours of entertainment and I think it'd be a reasonable buy at up to 15 dollars. If you like computer games more for their unique capabilities as a story telling vehicle, ALA myst and perhaps the walking dead game, this might be for you.It was like taking a snippet of someones life, dropping you in for a moment, and then you are gone. Short but sweet.If what I've said resonates with you at all definitely pick this title up on the discounted price!			"

												Gone Home felt pretty much like reading a touching little short story but the way it was told could only be done in a game. It's not a suspense or a horror game and doesn't fall into the usual genre fare gaming usually stays in. I could definitely relate to the 1990s nostalgia which helped sell the setting, and I'll recommend it heartily to older gamers such as myself. Don't go looking for twists or mysteries but expect quality writing and great voice acting.			"

												You come into this game (?) with a completely different expectation of what its about and I think thats the idea of it.Its not a game really but like others have said an interactive novel of sorts, I personally don't read very often but this really is a well produced story despite what others may lead you to believe. So some mechanics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right? I agree but that doesnt make a good story. Its a decent looking game albeit not very lengthy, with just over an hour in content not sure if I missed a huge amount (probably) its worth a look.Trying to patch together what happened and where everyone is left me pretty clueless at times but this game really is touching to say the least. Get it on sale.			"

												You kidding me? I'll start by saying this is a neat little interactive exploration story that you can get lost in, briefly. But I thought I was being pranked when I finished the story in 50 minutes... I feel robbed of even the $6 that I paid on sale. Unless they plan to release free dlc later on then this is a real rip off. I'll say it again, the game is actually kind of cool and I enjoyed it while it lasted. Unfortunately nothing can make up for the insanely short play time and simplistic routes it takes. I would value this game at 4 bucks maximum full price, unless they plan on future free dlc (unlikely haha). As of right now, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												This is an amazingly crafted game. Coming home to an empty house, you are looking for clues as to where your parents and you sister is.The game is both tense and horrifying as you slowly uncover the secrets thorugh (voiced)diary entries which is scattered thorugh the house. The game managed managed to keep me playing the entire way through and the tension did not decline at all. The atmosphere and the story is going to keep you  going to the end.The only downside to the game is the length, but they surprised me how well you can fit story in such a small space. I played for about 1,5 hours and i am sure you can uncover all the secrets of the game in 2-2.5 hours. The game might not be for everybody, but if you like story, tension and the urge to explore I strongly recommend this game. To everybody who play this game, go slow and explore.			"

												This game was excellent.   Although a bit short for the price(I recommend waiting for a sale to pick it up like I did).   But that's not why you're reading this.  The storyline is incredible.   You're Katie.  You come home from Europe to find an empty house and a letter pinned to the door from your sister saying ""Don't come find me"".    This starts an immersive investigative journey through the house.   It takes place in the 90s,  so the VHS tapes and cassettes are there!.   A lot of throwbacks to those days as well,  so I would recommend being old enough to ""get"" that time.   The main story focuses on your sister Sam and her whereabouts.   Although side-stories and plotlines involving your mother and father run concurrent to the main story as well.   There are no objectives or waypoints.   Progression in the game relies on human curiousity.   I personally just went exploring in the house and the game subtlely guides you to the next location,  you never quite feel guided but you are.   Being thorough and anal in searching each rooms turns up interesting tid-bits on the occupants of the house,  both past and present so search everything.  Atmospherically the game does well,  it's taking place in the middle of a massive thunderstorm,  so rain, thunder and lightning blanket the house,   there are creaks and eerie sounds throughout,  and some interesting moments with lights.   Playing this at night,  the atmosphere of uncertainty and the fear of basements comes into play(lights!). All in all it was an exciting journey.  I enjoyed it.   It's not for people with low attention spans,  and if you aren't enthralled by gameplay lacking action and gunplay,  this isn't for you.   But the story,  and the very subtle ways you develop bonds with the characters you are trying to find makes for an emotional trip in trying to find them.   You should all play this game at least once.			"

												Gone Home has an engrossing story that's mildly depressing.It's a short game, but worth the extra exploration of observing objects to gather an idea of what is going on with the protagonists' family and their personal lives. The central character that you gather info on is your sister, Sam, whom is supposed to be home, but is gone...home. Get it? She's gone from her home, that's why the game is called Gone Home; that, and the house is completely empty of human life, except for you, Katie, the elder sister/female protagonist.I do commend the writing and narrative that the developers took the time to flesh out. You get a proper character examination through finding documents, how your father is a struggling writer, your mother is a newly named Forest Conservationist, and promiscuous. And your sister shares a revelation that Katie probably knew about, but shares her emotional experience through the narration.The graphics are modest and humble as they're clearly not the centerpiece of the game, it's not drooling in high resolution textures or particles like Metro 2033, but the models and lighting and textures get the job done. The audio is near perfect, from the ambient soundtrack that plays at a minimal volume, to the harrowing narration, and the 90's grunge music played by some local Portland bands. Gameplay is about as simple as it gets, walk around and click on stuff. Really, you can pick up and examine coffee mugs and ask yourself ten seconds later, ""Why did I pick up that coffee mug? Is this a dream? No, this is what my life has become.""8.0/10			"

												A disclaimer is in order: This is not a game. The only meaningful choice is whether you continue to explore, or stop. There are no opponents, and the only obstacles are a handful of locked doors, the keys to which appear as you progress. Rather this is a work of digital fiction, a set of character studies told through the letters and keepsakes that they have acquired, through the exploration of a virtual world and through connections in the mind of the observer.Without actually including any of them, the story presents us with several multifaceted cast members and the problems they face in life, work, love and family with a respect that feels at odds with an inherently voyeuristic aspect of the situation. The way it manages to touch on sensitive and dark issues tactfully, and with compassion even for those in the wrong, reflects a meaning of ‘mature’ that more mainstream games often overlook.There are some flaws: a bit of railroading and one illogically locked door; an overuse of some props and inconsistent decisions about what is or isn’t interactive; and an occasional disconnect between those props, and sections of the story. None of which should impede anyone who didn’t lose interest in the first paragraph.			"

												Don't buy this game for full price, but if you find it on any sale at all it's well worth it.There's an atmosphere here established by yourself. A storm outside rumbles as you search through the house to uncover a mystery for yourself. Excessive detail is what you'll notice immediately, everything just detailed to a fault. Beautiful shadows, notes left lying around you can read without picking up...  You'll enter rooms that are completely dark and fumble around for a light switch, rummage through drawers, all of this without knowing what you're here for.It's an experience you need to sit down with, and by that I mean it's not a ""game"", there's not much replay value discouting meandering around the house itself.Nice house, mind.

She's grown up in a zeitgeist in which she can take for granted that LGBT kids have widespread social support, without realizing that PFLAG exists because this hasn't always been the case, and without realizing that she has the good fortune to live in a part of the country where parents support their gay kids. This game is such an amazing summation of what it was like when I was in grade school and high school, the challenges me and my friends faced. I hope that LGBT kids play this. It's an artifact of our history, beautifully delivered.			"

												I know some people knock this title for being a non-game, but I loved the experience I had with this (along with my next choice, The Stanley Parable).  Some compare Gone Home to Dear Esther, but coming from someone who was incredibly disappointed with DE, I'm happy to say Gone Home gives you enough player agency that you never feel like you're just listening to a tour guide on rails.  As a teenager in the 90's, there was something magically nostalgic and familiar (and creepily voyeuristic) about the exploration of a large house that simulated the period so well.  Sure, some of the story elements are pretty contrived, but overall it was great to organically see the story come alive for me through all of the notes, receipts, diaries, etc in the house.  You could pick up pretty much any object in the house, each lovingly rendered in 3D for you to inspect and rotate, even if most of these were not impactful to the plot.  I actually found the narrative to be pretty disappointing in the end, but Gone Home was more about the journey for me than the destination.			"

												This is a game for GIRLS.......no really, I have two sisters and I know this was made in a female's mindset. Given, if I was a woman, I would have loved this game. It is filled with emotion and tension. A drama, if you will. Unique and rare in the gaming world, the characterization and descriptive aspects are prime. You will frantically search every inch of this amazingly detailed and eerie house. Playing as Kaitlin who soon arrives home from being away, only to find no one there. This game has a driving story that will have you looking in every inch of this house for answers. Given the unique nature of this game, I will recommend it. As I stated before, this was made for girls and many people buying it on Steam will be disappointed, should they not understand the concept of the game. Teenage girls in particular are complicated enough, and when Kaitlin starts to look more into her sister throughout the story, that is when the game really gets dramatic. Overall I would give the game a 6/10 in terms of general presentation. There is only one thing to do the whole game and that is search. Instead, this game aims to tackle the player's emotions directly and really doesnt focus on gameplay. I have no doubt that if my sisters or girlfriend had played it, they would have been brought to tears by its gripping nature. As a manly man, I cant say I have the emotional capacity, to appreciate the message it is trying to project; And for that I can only say ""Try it for yourself.""			"

												Gone Home is about a story of two sisters. Samantha is stuck at home while her sister, Katie, is off traveling the world. So she writes down her every thought to share with her sister when she gets back. However when Kate arrives home the house is empty. There’s a note on the front door stating that Sam left for some unknown reason.This is a touching story. It purely represents how people can’t ever really go home again and expect life to be the exact same as when they left. It slowly, but bluntly, tells you how time changes everything and pushes people forward, or even away from each other. The game is every blatant about this with the many clues it leaves around. However it is the very definition of first world problems and is slightly riddled with stereotypical teen angst groaning you’d find in any American’s 1980s teen movies, but without any actual reason for conflict.At first I was intrigued because it gives a somewhat approving approach to letting me be a completely voyeur into someone’s family. As I wondered around I would get to read into each persons life and their problems. This ability only poked at my curiosity to go further. Even the storm outside the house made the dark hallways seem somber rather then creepy. With a few steps here and there it opens up other parts of the house and even shows you secret entrances and old remnants of the previous owner of the house. This was intriguing to only a limited extent.Then there are other parts of the story that are just completely bland. There’s multiple clues lying around that would have suggested a troubled marriage or the parents having trouble dealing with their more rebellious daughter. However I found myself not caring, because I would only be able to find 1 or 2 notes on what one parent thought about the situation. The other parent (most of the time this was the father) would be completely left out by the fact that there wouldn’t be anything of his to read or analyze.Other times the clues were handwritten notes that were completely illegible. Want to find out about the house and why it’s nicknamed? Well guess what? You probably won’t be able to read what happened since it looks like a small gerbil had a seizure while holding a pen on one of the only notes from the owner. This only left me frustrated and I ended up not caring at all about what happened. So this made it feel like half of the story was incomplete.This was followed by the continued girl-to-woman story of Sam. While this was cute and heart warming to reading about a girl finding herself, it left me wondering if I should have just read a book instead. Whatever item you pick up plays a diary page of Sam’s and it belts out over the soft music in the background and the occasional thunder. None of it was too interesting, and as said before: it is riddled with clichés. The 90’s punk and girl grunge references even come off as cliché due to the same standard writing all over the posters of ‘fighting the man’ and what not. It’s like they rebel against a establishment without any clear reason to do so.It lacks basic game play mechanics and good exploring rewards. Like with most games it might have clues as to what to do next that are clear and help continue the story. Yes, this was partly my fault, but after having such limited interaction with items I started looking less and less for items to fiddle with. It doesn’t interest me to pick up a 3d plate, or 3d tooth brush, and spin it around. The 3d books serve little to no purpose, except for one. Then the story items are so blatantly obvious they aren’t misable or they look so generic that I didn’t bother picking it up considering it was only the 900 th random piece of paper strung about in the house.In the end Gone Home is another video game experiment that doesn’t feel complete. Many gamers, including myself, will be greatly disappointed with this. This is due to the lack of just about everything that makes video games playable. Yes it’s filled with every artistic metaphors and emotional impact that would be in most video games. Although for me the story was lost due to the stereotypical storyline of the subject matter, plot holes, and illegible clues. If it went on for a few more hours and explained everyone else’s view point I would have probably enjoyed it a lot more.Either skip this or get it on the cheap (i.e. below $10). It’s only 2 hours worth of gameplay and has ZERO replay value.5.0/10			"

												Did you like collecting and listening to the tape recorders in Dead Space or Bioshock? Or the environmental cues in Portal?Now Imagine a 2 hour session of that with no puzzles or ""game"" aspects at all, and make the storyline more tv drama than suspense or mystery. Like cleaning up the mess after the Big Brother contestants have left.			"

												This game represents a magnificent achievement. In most games that are advertised as possessing character-depth, I feel as though I'm just learning more details given to me by the writer. In Gone Home, I felt as though I was learning more about a real individual. The house contains so many details that make it feel ""lived in,"" which adds tremendously to the immersion. As a grown man, I often feel dismissive of the seemingly melodramatic lives of teenagers - however, Gone Home made that emotional world feel real for me again. The pain of exclusion, and the desire to be understood - this game deserves to be played.			"

												Not a game, more an interactive experience about the same length as a movie.  You can interact with hundreds of items in this fairly large house which has numerous hidden things to uncover.  All the set pieces are great and the game taking place in the mid 90s plays homage to many things from that time.  Also the story is mainly told besides all the notes, etc that you can read through the voice of your sister Sam's journals.  It's a wonderful emotional tale that pulls you in, although i might be biased as i myself was a teenager in the mid 90's.  It's hard to call it an adventure game as there aren't really puzzles per se that don't rely exploration, still it is an adventure and a game I can whole heartedly recommend.			"

												Over the past few years, the narrative value of video games has been explored and expanded upon. No longer just a medium of just action, scifi, and fantasy, video games have evolved to adapt themselves to any genre for storytelling. Dear Esther, Ana, and countless others have paved the way for a new kind of game.Gone Home takes that endeavor and drives it home. Like a scalpel in the hands of a veteran surgeon, it cuts deep into the player, and leaves a permanent impression. The ambience of the game is magnetic, drawing you in to a world that is not defined by dragons or laser guns, but by the kind of human interaction that defines us as individuals, the kind of interaction that creates a story that does not seek to thrill or shock, but simply to touch the heart.If you can finish this game without crying, you have no soul.

												I had no idea what to think about Gone Home before I played it. Will it be a horror game? I had so many questions about the game. Many critics said the game told a very good story, and they were right. Im not going to spoil anything, but you play as Katie, a girl who just got back from vacation. She goes to her family's new home, but her family is nowhere to be seen. The whole game is about exploring the house, and the story is not told to you directly. To get the full story, you need to explore everything. Gone Home is a game that takes time to complete, and is not rewarding if you decide to rush through. The game is fairly short, but the story it manages to tell is fantastic. You listen to audio logs, read notes, and find clues that piece together the story. Keep in mind, not all of the story is told directly, and there are a few subplots to follow as well. So....do I reccomend Gone Home? Yes I do reccomend it, but not at regular price. $19.99 is too steep of a price to pay for an interactive story like this, so wait until it is on sale for $4.99 and buy it. Remember, take your time when playing the game, and the game will be very rewarding. Gone Home gets a 8/10.			"

												Way too expensive for what it offers. I've played games that are meant to be experiences like Jouney that I thoroughly enjoyed, but this game was boring to me. The narrative does play out in a more interesting way when compared to games with cutscenes, but there is nothing there to break up the monotony. You find out the ""twist"" halfway through the game that doesn't really make the story more interesting. Very overrated game. Those calling it the hipster game of 2013 are correct.			"

 There are very few LGBT+ games at all.  Not only does that make this game a brilliant game, but also what else makes this game a great game is that it can show a story through the exploration of a single house, it can show it through tapes you find and through bits of paper. Of course some can call that style of game play a walking simulator, but I assure you, this game is much more than a walking simulator, it touches upon  LGBT+  issues, it has a really dark atomosphere, and it has a very interesting protagonist switch.This game is about  two lesbians who have fallen in love with each other and their families don't quite understand or approve  , the game perfectly shows you this story with objects found by you, diary pages, tapes, etc. There is a lot of reading to be done when playing this game, so if you can't read or are too lazy to read, you won't like this game. This game has a story that happens a lot, and it perfectly tells it, with all the sadness and misunderstanding that goes along with it.The atmosphere of the game seriously misleads you into thinking that this is a horror game, but it may not be as misleading as you would think. As the whole situation with  people misunderstanding two people's love  is quite a horrible situation in itself, and can be very dangerous. The atmosphere also really fits with the whole empty house, keeping you on your toes as you explore and try and find out what has happened.By protagonist switching, I am refering to the fact that in this game you are not really playing protagonist, this game is not about the character that you are playing, this game is about someone else, the person who left all the diary pages and such. And this can help you to understand that this game is not about you, it's about her, as you are not the important one in this situation. And this protagonist switching really helps to go along with the whole theme of the game.This game is pretty powerful, although the replay value on it is not that high, and though it's not a really 'enjoyable' game, it is a very important game.

												Wasted my money and time on this DEMO..  I saw a review by adam sessler, and this was one of his TOP games of the year, the guy sounds like he knows games pretty well.  So.. I thought there must be something interesting about it as a result and just decided to check it out since it was on sale.  I'll NEVER blindly trust that guy again, let me just say I should have done a bit more review on this.  This was probably the dumbest and most pointless experience I've had to date with games on steam.   I found nothing interesting or even redeeming about the 'experience' at all.  This game has value for a very small group of specific people I think, specifically lesbian feminists stuck in 1995?  I don't even know who it is really for..   Now I just want to be clear, I'm not against games created by and for women as well as transgendered and gays, so a game like this does have a place in the world.  It just didn't do anything for me, and I felt like I wasted my money and time.  The only thing I am happy about in the end is that I didn't pay full price for this DEMO of a game which is not even a game.			"

												Ow, right in my feels.It's rare that a modern video game can evoke a full range of emotions: happiness, sadness, dread, intrigue, confusion, anger.  It's almost unheard of that a game can do all of that without having any on screen characters other than the player character.  Gone Home does that very thing, and is one of the finest examples of how video games can be a form of art.The setup is beautifully simple, giving you a large, empty mansion to explore, encouraging you to examine the contents of the house, then using those items to gradually unravel the details and backstory of the Greenbriar family, and the inherent mystery surrounding their unexpected absence.  The examination of certain items is occasionally accompanied by narration from the family's younger sister, Sam, reading letters she has written to her older sister Kaitlin (the player character).  The minimalistic, at-your-own-pace approach to storytelling combined with the ambiance of being in a creaky old mansion during a strong rainstorm is VERY effective; instead of being told how you should feel before rushing you to the next setpiece, the game simply lets you soak in the information and gives you ample time to process it on your own.  The approach makes the story hit that much harder, and is the underlying reason why Gone Home is such an effective piece of storytelling.From a gameplay standpoint, Gone Home is the modern equivalent of the classic point-and-click adventures of the 90s.  Though it is first person, there is no shooting, nor is there any combat, nor are any particularly fast reflexes required.  The game is designed to be explored completely at your own pace, taking as much or as little time as you want focusing on the mansion and its contents.  What few puzzles the game presents are less logic based and more exploration based, requiring you to find codes or access numbers rather than do complex decryption.  In short, the game is wholly accessible to players of nearly any skill level, but doesn't sacrifice quality in order to be that way.In the end, Gone Home is less of a game and more of an interactive story, but in no way suffers for being such.  About the worst thing I could find with it is that it is short and not highly replayable, yet I still feel I've gotten my money's worth and then some out of it.  It manages to pack a surprisingly touching story into its brief length, along with a potent statement on what one can do with the gaming medium in general.  If you're looking for a gaming experience that tells you an engaging story which doesn't rely on explosions, supernatural elements, or combat in general, Gone Home is something you should take a look at.

COme on not even a video game more like someone's way of trying to tell the world they came out of the closet. Pretty expensive way to do it too. I did how ever finish it but was figuring it would be the girlfriend who killed the whole family in the attic because  she was secretly the daughter of the maid and to the uncle who was dead, Uncle leaves house to other family members, Secret daughter is upset becasue she was recognized as a true blood kin and kills off the family members because she wanted the house and property.

												This is not going to be an in-depth review, as I don't think I can say anything about Gone Home that already hasn't been said over and over. I just wish to put my two cents on the positive side of the review scale.Gone Home is a very good story. It is well written and well presented. It's somewhat rare for me to find a story that really grips me and doesn't let go until it's over. And although I could see the plot coming from a mile away, Gone Home still managed to do just that.My only point of contention would be the price. I think Gone Home deserves all the money you can give it, but if you don't have a lot of money for throwing around, there's just not enough content in the game to justify the full price and you should probably wait for a sale.

												Pros:- Decent atmosphere- Its kind of fun to explore the houseCons:- My current playtime reflects how long it takes to beat this game if you take your sweet time and look at EVERYTHING- Heavy-handed dialogue- No room for nuance in the characterization- I did not think it was possible for a story to have less than 1 dimension- 0 replay value (no multiple endings, new game+, etc.)It is obvious that this game was made with an agenda. Now an agenda is not necessarily a bad thing, but I believe it is when that agenda overpowers ALL other aspects of a game. Gone Home does not offer a powerful story, does not provide a particularly gripping environment, does not foster interesting characters, and sure as hell does not earn its pricetag.Do not pay for this game.

												Gone Home involves walking around and doing simple exploration of an old family house. You uncover a sappy story as you go along a pretty linear route, probably finishing the game in less than two hours. The beginning is certainly interesting and oddly suspenseful, and the house is very well designed, but I found it lacking as I approached the end.It wasn't time wasted, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.

												I really liked this game. I liked the story so much. It only gave you infromation piece by piece, until you could finish putting together the whole story about Sam and Lonnie. It's a love novel actually, 2 lesbian teenagers, but the story and the voice acting is just so good.PRO:+ very good voice acting+ thrilling story+ great atmosphere (storm, flashing lights, empty house)+ pretty good graphics+ lots of papers/diaries/pictures/books to explore in order to assemble the story+ some easy puzzlesCON:- no achievements- no autosaves for diary entries you find (my PC crashed after I played like 2 hours, and my progress was gone, had to start the game again from the very beginning! )- pretty short- no collectibles ( it was nice if you could collect all the postcards, casettes into your inventory and have them in one place)- no replay valueOverall it's a pretty interesting walking simulator bringing you back to the Nintendo games era (mid-90's). Definitely not for everyone. I dare to say I liked this game a lot more than I did 'Dear Esther'. The overall playtime would be somewhere between 2-3 hours for the first playthrough, really my only point in replaying it was that my PC carshed mid-game after I opened the kitchen area, so basically had to quickly replay about 75% of the game.Would I buy it? Definitely if it was on sale. I bought it in a bundle so really no regrets. I can recommend this game mostly beacuse of the story and the easy puzzles which really make it relaxing. "

												I'm usually VERY forgiving and interested in new game experiences. Reviews mention two key points: the interesting story, and the ""freakiness"" of exploring the house.First, the story. Over half of the things you'll find or read are totally extraneous and do nothing to further any sort of interesting plot (or sub-plot). I don't want to spoil anything in case you get this on sale (DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE), but the story is a massive letdown with each plot thread that it opens up.As for the the empty house situation, it could have been extremely freaky. Instead, they throw in some really obtuse references to some of the ""creepy"" things that happened and give you just the SLIGHTEST glimpse of problems in the house. A few diaries from the mom, or perhaps some really depressed letters from the dad would have made the experience A LOT freakier. I'd constantly have been worried that someone had gone nuts and done something horrible around the next corner.I can not believe this game got so many 8s, 9s, and 10s. Had the story of any of these characters been told in a traditional format (movie, book, even someone speaking over a campfire) you would be bored to tears.P.S. The contents of those locked containers were so bland. If I'm hunting for secrets, you better make it worth it.			"

												Pack your bags, we're going on a feels trip.  This is a beautiful game, and not to be missed.  It has echoes of Dear Esther, but with a greater level of interactivity, and a more defined story.  You'll either fall in love with it, or pass it off due to it's brevity (2 hours) and minimal ""gamey"" elements.  I won't spoil anything about the story, but you play as a young woman who comes back from a year overseas to find her home empty.  You explore the house and try to piece together what happened.  This is not a horror game.  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever experienced, and the shortness of the game works in it's favour.  The price tag might seem a little high, but trust me it's worth it.Before you play, two important tips:1) Take your time to explore thoroughly, and pick up everything interesting in case there's a story behind it2) Set aside some time to play, and play it all in one sitting			"

												Without question one of the most touching, industry-changing games of 2013. Gone Home is a lesson in storytelling influencing gameplay, not the other way around. The layers that this game contains are meaningful and human and more real than I could ever describe. If you like games, you should play this one. If you don't like games, I don't know why you're reading this Steam recommendation, but you should still experience what is being presented here.			"

												""You arrive home after a year abroad. You expect your family to greet you, but the house is empty. Something's not right. Where is everyone? And what's happened here? Unravel the mystery for yourself in Gone Home, a story exploration game from The Fullbright Company. "" That is the quote from the summary of the game on steam. I was under the impression there was some deep mystery why your family was missing. Mysteries traditionally have some dark, spooky, or noire-like overtones, which unfourtanately this game has none. Even entering the house, at night with a rainstorm outside, the house dark, quiet and spooky, one could easily determine this game to be a mystery. Did your family get kidnapped? Is there some supernatural event that happened that caused your families disappearance? SPOILER: NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. What I got instead was 4 hours of some girl talking to me about her issues and being confused in her life. I'm not against the subject matter in any way. What I am against is hearing that subject matter as the source of entertainment in a video game. I will admit I do have some bias, because I went into the game expecting some dark mystery and in-depth discovery, instead got treated to a diary of a girl talking about her day. I even took notes of key events for like an hour, in case I needed a reference to help me solve the mystery. That was a waste of time, BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE. What is this game? It is an exploration game where you get to read and hear about a family members drastic life change at a time in the game where the house, by coincidence, happens to be empty. There was no mystery. I predicted the games ending by the second hour. Would you like it? If you like Dear Esther with a narrator talking about how her day went, this game is for you. It, however, is not the game for me. I paid $10 for this game when it was on sale, i feel ripped off.			"

												This game is a hit and miss depending on the style of gaming you are interested in. To tell the truth, its more of a story rather than a game itself. Walking simulator, point and click and exploring is all that is offered for this to be considered a game. How it made PC Game Of The Year is beyond me and the fact that it was awarded PC GOTY, was all the reason for me to purchase this title and see what it had to offer. Comparing this title towards my taste of what I like in video games, all I have to comment is this...Pros:- The Eerie sounds of a thunder storm in the background complemented the gloomy atmosphere of the mansion- The lighting and ""creaking noises"" of the mansion was enough for me to keep playing and wanting to explore more- The zoom feature was quite nice and layout of the mansion was well done- Controls are extremely simple to manage (even a map is provided to find your way)- Walking motion was well done and is well deserved of the title of Walking simulatorCons:- Extremely short (2.8 hours and thats generous due to the fact I walked away from my pc a lot)- The Story was not to my liking but I really can't bash this due to the fact that the main character being female- Way to easy to find all items and to navigate so freely. (Maybe it was luck but I would find the keys before the lock doors)- No puzzles at all however due to the story line I can understand why- I don't understand how this won PC GOTY but I really don't know what the opposition had to contest this			"

It's so hard to explain what makes this work so well without just telling you exactly what happens. You'll just have to experience it for yourself. I honestly could not stop crying and/or smiling through out this. The voice acting is SUPERB. I really mean it. It puts you right into the emotions of the characters and holds you there until long after you've finished the game and gone to sleep. 12/10 easily.Also, if you are a fan of the book, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", than you will most certainly love this as well.

												This game sounded great when I first heard about it, and every review I read from critics and gaming websites made it sound like it was the best thing ever. I should have read the player reviews first. I have never seen a game cause such a split between gamers and critics. Critics love it, and many players hate it. I am part of the latter.This ""game"" is part of that genre that has you walking around, either exploring or being told a story (i.e. Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable, and to some extent Outlast, Amnesia 1 &2, and Slender: The Arrival). The problem here is that all those other games worked for the most part (excluding Slender: The Arrival). Gone Home has you exploring, opening everything in every room of the house, reading everything and trying to piece together why you are the only one in the house. There is a storm outside, so the rain, lightning, and thunder that you see and hear, as well as the fact that the lights flicker on and off repeatedly make you feel uneasy. There are several ominous notes and letters you find that make you think there is something else going on, something that you wouldn't see coming.****SPOILERS****There is simply no pay off in the story. It is predictable to the point that you can figure out at least part of what is going on in the first room if you are paying attention. There are some things that are never explained, and this includes some things that are hinted at and built up throughout the entire game. It felt as if the game was purposely trying to make you think something huge was gonna happen once you finally got into the attic, just to get up there to a huge disappointment. And it just leaves a few things hanging, and that bugged me. The ideas were great but did not work at all. Even worse, to advance the story, you have to open and look at very specific items. If you overlook one, you are forced to figure out where it was. I looked through literally every room, nook, and cranny several times before I realized I had overlooked a folder that looked like a poster. That one item was what I needed to continue on. I don't mind exploring but making the required item so subtle and easy to overlook is just irritating.Overall, this had potential but was just horrible. And it definitely is not worth the price. If people want to play it and say it's great, that's fine, everyone has their own tastes, but I will be staying away from this thing.			"

												This game is a brief casual explorative experience, based around examining the contents of a household in first person. Emotional dialogue lines, expressed as if read from a diary, tell a short narrative about the life and love of a young girl. Initially the game felt very eerie and mysterious, but as the plot is unwoven it becomes heartfelt and compelling; with just a few creepy touches. A casual and minimalistic game that is short and sweet. The Grrrl Punk mixtapes are also excellent.			"

												I'm glad I bought this game when it was on sale on the Humble Store for $5. Wait, no I wish I would have saved the $5 for a good cheeseburger. This was not at all what I was expecting, and I felt it was misleading. First the good points: The voice acting was great, and the graphics and atmosphere were awesome. Now the bad points: The atmosphere that is created gives a kind of ""horror"" theme that is misleading and non-existent. They hint at a possibly scary story with the ""ghost"" of the guy who lived in the house before. That turns out to be a bust too. My main problem with this game was its hidden agenda. There's no mention of the LGBT message that fuels this game until a while into playing it. I feel that the high ratings it is getting are simply because it touches on this politically charged issue and nobody wants to say it stinks. I have nothing against gay people, nothing against a ""game"" that addresses the topic, I just felt misled into buying something that I was not looking for. For those looking to buy this game: Be warned that it is about a homosexual girl and that it is way overpriced. If you really want it, wait for a sale.			"

												""You arrive home after a year abroad. You expect your family to greet you, but the house is empty. Something's not right. Where is everyone? And what's happened here? Unravel the mystery for yourself in Gone Home, a story exploration game from The Fullbright Company. "" That is the quote from the summary of the game on steam. I was under the impression there was some deep mystery why your family was missing. Mysteries traditionally have some dark, spooky, or noire-like overtones, which unfourtanately this game has none. Even entering the house, at night with a rainstorm outside, the house dark, quiet and spooky, one could easily determine this game to be a mystery. Did your family get kidnapped? Is there some supernatural event that happened that caused your families disappearance? SPOILER: NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. What I got instead was 4 hours of some girl talking to me about her issues and being confused in her life. I'm not against the subject matter in any way. What I am against is hearing that subject matter as the source of entertainment in a video game. I will admit I do have some bias, because I went into the game expecting some dark mystery and in-depth discovery, instead got treated to a diary of a girl talking about her day. I even took notes of key events for like an hour, in case I needed a reference to help me solve the mystery. That was a waste of time, BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE. What is this game? It is an exploration game where you get to read and hear about a family members drastic life change at a time in the game where the house, by coincidence, happens to be empty. There was no mystery. I predicted the games ending by the second hour. Would you like it? If you like Dear Esther with a narrator talking about how her day went, this game is for you. It, however, is not the game for me. I paid $10 for this game when it was on sale, i feel ripped off.			"

												This game sounded great when I first heard about it, and every review I read from critics and gaming websites made it sound like it was the best thing ever. I should have read the player reviews first. I have never seen a game cause such a split between gamers and critics. Critics love it, and many players hate it. I am part of the latter.This ""game"" is part of that genre that has you walking around, either exploring or being told a story (i.e. Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable, and to some extent Outlast, Amnesia 1 &2, and Slender: The Arrival). The problem here is that all those other games worked for the most part (excluding Slender: The Arrival). Gone Home has you exploring, opening everything in every room of the house, reading everything and trying to piece together why you are the only one in the house. There is a storm outside, so the rain, lightning, and thunder that you see and hear, as well as the fact that the lights flicker on and off repeatedly make you feel uneasy. There are several ominous notes and letters you find that make you think there is something else going on, something that you wouldn't see coming.****SPOILERS****There is simply no pay off in the story. It is predictable to the point that you can figure out at least part of what is going on in the first room if you are paying attention. There are some things that are never explained, and this includes some things that are hinted at and built up throughout the entire game. It felt as if the game was purposely trying to make you think something huge was gonna happen once you finally got into the attic, just to get up there to a huge disappointment. And it just leaves a few things hanging, and that bugged me. The ideas were great but did not work at all. Even worse, to advance the story, you have to open and look at very specific items. If you overlook one, you are forced to figure out where it was. I looked through literally every room, nook, and cranny several times before I realized I had overlooked a folder that looked like a poster. That one item was what I needed to continue on. I don't mind exploring but making the required item so subtle and easy to overlook is just irritating.Overall, this had potential but was just horrible. And it definitely is not worth the price. If people want to play it and say it's great, that's fine, everyone has their own tastes, but I will be staying away from this thing.			"

												This game is a brief casual explorative experience, based around examining the contents of a household in first person. Emotional dialogue lines, expressed as if read from a diary, tell a short narrative about the life and love of a young girl. Initially the game felt very eerie and mysterious, but as the plot is unwoven it becomes heartfelt and compelling; with just a few creepy touches. A casual and minimalistic game that is short and sweet. The Grrrl Punk mixtapes are also excellent.			"

												I'm writing this review while being torn as whether to recommend this game or not to anyone. I'll first say that this purchase was largely influenced by praise from IGN and a 50% sale. As for Gone Home itself, it's not really a game, so much as an interactive story. While the story is really good (a work of art, really), a single playthrough took me less than 3 hours to finish, and I took my time. Did I enjoy playing it? Yes. But this type of game has by nature no replayability. Do I think the price tag was worth it? No. For these reasons, I can't recommend it. But if you do for some reason buy it, you will want to get it on sale.			"

												Explore an emty lifeless house.The only posititve things i can say for this ""game"" is that it is polished and for short periods of time; interesting or emotional. As a whole, I would recommend to check it out and breeze through it one time if only it were free. I honestly can't decide if it's worth your time even then though. The concept is very interesting, but it just doesn't deliver. It ends up just being a very empty experience. It's hard to not recommend this game because it is very unique, but it's way, way too short, and the story is not good enough to make up for it at any price tag. graphics - 7/10sound - 5/10gameplay - 5/10story - 8/10overall - 6/10The interesting story is not enough, and that's really the only thing here. It's not a story worthy of making a game around either. I did get a few kicks from the 90's era nostalgia. Again, that aspect as well is small and does not add enough to make this anything really special.			"

												**SPOILER FREE REVIEW (Unless you don't want it to be :D)**So, where to begin with Gone Home? In a nutshell, Gone Home is another entry in the ""visual novel"" genre of games comprised by other titles like Dear Esther, The Writer, and so on and so forth. Despite the greatness of other such games, Gone Home is terrible and not worth an ounce of your time. So here's why: Plot Strength Without spoiling anything, the basis of Gone Home's plot is that you are Katie Greenbriar; a girl just returning from a semester abroad in Europe only to find her home in Oregon, which her family recently moved into, ""mysteriously"" empty. Subsequently, it is your job to snoop around the house like Sherlock Homes and uncover clues as to what is happening. Then (still no spoilers) the backstory behind why the house is ""abandoned"" has to do with your sister Sam who is in 11th grade and experiencing her first love interest. I will not delve any further into the story just in case I can't persuade you to not buy this abhorrent piece of trash, but all I can tell you is that within 45 minutes of playing the game (about half way through in my case, and yes i did pick up every item and explore every room) you will know EXACTLY how the game will end. I kid you not; Gone Home's ""surprise ending"" is about as remarkable as watching an episode of Dora the Explorer (that is to say not much at all). Now, moving on, let me adress why this game is so critically aclaimed. As you can see on metacritic, Gone Home has an absurdly high (imo) average critic rating of 86, while the user rating is 5.4. The reasoning behind this is because Gone Home is one of those games that might as well say in the description (and pardon my french) ""DEAR GAME CRITICS, if you do not hail me as one of the greatest games of all time and the most moving game you've every played, you will be pigeon-holed by the rest of the game-critics community and seen as an unsophisticated, uneducated, arrogant f**ktard."" Let me elaborate further: Since Gone Home is protrayed by the Fullbright Company as a ""moving"", ""artistic"", and ""expressive"" story, game critics want to also seem ""sophisticated"" and ""artistic"" in that same respect by waxing lyrical about Gone Home and ""how personally it spoke to them"". Moreover, Gone Home has many (forced and annoying) references to the '90's in it and seeing as  A LOT of game reviewers today were born in the late '80's and early '90's they eat that stuff up. To finish off this section, let's examine why Gone Home is in no way whatsoever ""artistic"", ""moving"", or ""sophisticated"". The story is probably the most pathetic and lame thing I have ever witnesses in any medium. The writing is down right melodramatic (which is about the only thing that matches up with the '90's :-/) and fake; as if they had a 14 year old girl at The Gap pick up the nearest pencil she could find, take a napkin from the foodcourt, and write out the first love story that came to her head. There is nothing unique whatsoever about Sam's lovestory and it fully embraces every ""budding relationship"" cliche known to man. Moreover, despite some people who don't recommend this game saying the voice acting is exceptional, I beg to differ. The voices sound flat and fail to convey little emotion. In short, every journal, story, and note you read that has to do with Sam's love story (pretty much all of them) adds up to a pile of bad writing not even fit for a live action Nickelodeon show.  Game Structure Gone home's gamplay is flat out bad; there's no other word for it, it's just bad. Before I start ranting again, here is THE ONLY thing I will commend Gone Home for, and that is how it manages to make the house feel lived in; it's a very large house, but there's just enough furniture, books, belongings, etc. to make the house feel real and the decorating is quite realistic which probably helped cloud-headed pretentious reviewers feel more ""immersed"" in the game. Now, back to the bad aspects which, you guessed it, is literally everything else! The ONLY interaction you will ever have in Gone Home is picking up miscellaneous objects which sometimes  trigger Sam's ""journal entries/notes for Katie"", opening doors, and entering lock combonations. Believe me you, I've played many adventure games in my time so I'm very used to this type of gameplay; hell, my favorite game of all time is The Walking Dead The Game (which I played on my PS Vita so please do not respond ""You don't have The Walking Dead a**hole :-/""). However, Gone Home is, simply put, boring when you are not progressing the story (that is if you even like the story which, obviously, I do not); all you do is pick up poorly textured objects, and fumble around with '90's memorabailia; rotating them around like a whirlgig (Katie would make a great chemist due to her exceptional rotating skills which you'll be doing every god-damn 10 seconds only to find that you will never find any hidden messages, images, or compartments on these objects in the entire game). In fact, taking out the ability to pick up and examine objects in Gone Home would vastly improve it seeing as the inclusion of it in the first place is a failed attempt at adding ""some"" interaction/gameplay to keep the player interested, but in actuallity, this ability makes the game even more drawn out than my grandpa's undies since almost every player, including myself, will take the time to pick up EVERY....FREAKIN'...OBJECT. Moreover, this would streamline the story and allow the game to do what it truly intends: rip off it's players with a truly terrible story. Other games, like Dear Esther, already realized that literally no interaction whatsoever is better than some so that the player can realize what the true nature of the game is and not be confused by being able to pick up more objects than there are milk containers in Half Life 2. Value Go ahead and look at Gone Home's store page and look for it's price. You will find it is 20 U.S. dollars, thus leading you to believe it must have a significant amount of content. I mean, by that logic, Gone Home should offer as much content as games like CS GO, FTL, Spelunky, The Walking Dead, Rust, Skyrim, Dark Souls 1 and other games that are at very similar price points on steam. Moreover, for literally under a dollar, you could buy a humle bundle with amazing games like Bioshock and Xcom: UFO Defense from the 2k Humble Bundle or Thief Gold and Hitman from the Square Enix Humble Bundle that's on sale at this point in time. Well, jokes on you if you thought anything even close to that was true, because what if I told you that you can beat Gone Home in less than a minute when you know what to do? What's more, what if I told you I've actually read forum posts/stories of people accidently finding the hidden room that holds the key which you need to finish the game within minutes of their first play through, then proceeding to finish the game when they think they're merely doing what they're supposed to, only to find out they already beat the piece of trash? Well, whether you believe these things or not, they (much like Robert Ripley's stories) are horrifyingly true. Gone Home isn't worth $20, or $3, or even $1 since that same amount of money would be better spent on ANYTHING else, hell go buy a chicken burger at McDonald's!In conclusion, Gone Home is a bad game, made by bad writers, for pretentious people, and you should NEVER buy it. Also, for those brave enough, here's the spoiler of THE WHOLE GAME (yes, it's that short),  Sam is a lesbian (which her parents dissaprove of her being) and she falls in love with a girl named Lonnie. Unfortunately, Lonnie entered the military and they must now separate. However, Sam and Lonnie decide they must be together, so Lonnie deserts the military and they run off together. Also, the only reason the parents are gone is because they are on vacation for their anniversary.  "

												I can see that a lot of work went into this game so I do not want to be too disparaging... maybe I just don't like these kinds of games? Either way, I was not invested in the story (despite the fact that the story is really all there is to gameplay). You wander around a house reading different pieces of paper and occasionally being told snippets of the story by way of some voice note from a family member. That's it. I dunno. I just couldn't get into it. I ""beat"" it, if you can call it that, but it just never grabbed me.			"

As usual, the game is botched and too short. If i would of payed 20$ for this game, i would of been completely frustrated. Even to the point that i would largely consider buying or not another indie game. But.... Since i paid this half piece of crap 2.00$, i kinda still feel ripped off but a lot less. This has happened several times on Steam and i am very careful how i spend my money with this kind of cheap developer testing crap funded by poor innocent people who just want to play games (LIKE IN THE 90'S, FOR REAL)			"

												Gone home is a game about love, loss, life, lesbians, 90's kids, Street Fighter, walking, pack rats, and walking. You play as Katie who just came home from her trip to Europe to a home with no family. Why is the home empty you ask? Because there's crap everywhere and even the people living their couldn't handle their hoarding compulsive hide-things-everywhere nature. There is a story here and it is an okay one. The main story revolves around the development of your sister, and the story surrounding her development is interesting. Unfortunetely it isn't interesting enough to be recommended. You walk around a house discovering scraps of paper and putting together the lives of your family members through the interaction and exploration. That is the ""game"" part of this game. All of it. You can get the same experience opening your closet. (By the way I've seen your closet young man and I've told you twice already to clean that up.) The biggest advantage this game has is the length. It does not overstay its welcome and knows it should and ends early. Be warned it is VERY short any possible purchasers of this game. If you are in the mood for a short little story about a girl's teenage years/very small story about a father/even smaller story about a mother then this game is for you. If you don't then go play like. I don't know. Dota 2.			"

												There is no sense of conflict or agency.  You simply pick up the things you need to and the ""game"" ends.  Nothing special here.I got it in a bundle, so I figured I had to play it to see what the strange attraction was with this game.I still don't get it.  Why does a game in which you do practically nothing for about an hour and a half cost $20!?  It seems like to me for that much one could buy a story-driven game where the story appears to matter (and may even have gameplay).   I don't see the exclusion of gameplay as a feature.  If all you have is story, then it needs to be really interesting and immersive.  Allowing you to interact with every random object in the environment alone does not accomplish this task.  The narrative you receive along the way is nothing special I'm afraid.  I guess people praise this for trying something different, which is something I can respect because you won't know if something works till you try it.  However, simply being different isn't enough imo.			"

												Another point-and-click storytelling game. I'm a huge fan of this genre, though it repeatedly seems to be not worth the money. Gone Home creates a truly believable world and realistic characters. However, the manner in which the story is told is frustratingly obvious. The first time you are given clues about certain aspects of a character's personality or problems they are facing, it is interesting to guess the subtleties of their individual situations. But any fun derived from figuring out these mysteries is shortly ruined by being bombarded with obvious hint after obvious hint until finally, you are basically slapped in the face with the all-too-obvious truth. This made me feel like it was further simplifying the story, which was already far too short and simple in my opinion.The game mechanics themselves are also a bit flawed. Almost every cabinet and drawer door is able to be opened, and there are lots of cloned objects that serve no purpose but to get in the way of certain objects that are actually important to the story. It says I have logged 2.5 hours on this game but a good 45 minutes of that was probably wasted on picking up rolls of toilet paper just to see if there was a key hidden underneath them.The graphics and objects were fairly glitchy even when I turned my graphics on maximum settings.In terms of sound, the background noises were too repetitive. The first time certain noises like thunder happened, it took me by surprise, but eventually I wanted more variety. The random cassette tapes you can play are a fun addition, but the sound was not balanced properly and the music plays WAY too loudly, to the point where I had to keep adjusting the volume every time I even saw a cassette player as I entered a room.Overall, I would say this game is worth the $2.99 I spent during the summer sale, but paying more than $5 for this would be unwise. It will last you only about 2 hours even if you take a long time and pore over every detail. I guess it's still a relatively ""indie"" genre and can't be compared to much else, which explains why some critics loved it. While I can't say I completely hated it, the game was too frustrating in too many ways to make it a truly enjoyable experience.			"

												In all, the experiance was awesome, the fear of something jumping in your face, or seeing somebody walk in the corridor as you turn your head would of completely freaked me out. But...... As usual, the game is botched and too short. If i would of payed 20$ for this game, i would of been completely frustrated. Even to the point that i would largely consider buying or not another indie game. But.... Since i paid this half piece of crap 2.00$, i kinda still feel ripped off but a lot less. This has happened several times on Steam and i am very careful how i spend my money with this kind of cheap developer testing crap funded by poor innocent people who just want to play games (LIKE IN THE 90'S, FOR REAL)			"

												One word Review: Overpriced.Without spoiling the plot, I can say that Gone Home is a very unconventional, and unorthodox walking simulator. It's not likely that you've ever played another game like this, and while you might have your own assumptions of what to expect, Gone Home will likely fool you with it’s misdirection. What the Fullbright Company has managed to do with the Unity engine is quite impressive, creating a mansion where virtually everything can be picked up, inspected, read, or examined, even if it's completely irrelevant to the story. The deluge of seemingly insignificant items may fluster you into thinking you've missed something useful, but trust me, you haven't.The game's atmosphere is mostly horror based, although I'm tempted to reuse the word: misdirection. The downpour of rain, accompanied by thunder and flickering lights creates a very tense, suspenseful abience. Played at night, with a headset, and you’ll find yourself jumping at shadows and fearing the dark.When it comes to the story itself, Gone Home is very short, allowing for just over an hour of gameplay, possibly two if you take your time. For this reason, I highly recommend you buy the game on sale, just to avoid being burned.For what the game offers, and the experience as a whole, I enjoyed it. I just don't agree with the twenty dollar price tag.			"

Gone HomeI had completed this game when this review was writtenShort ReviewAn excellent, short, heavily story based mystery adventure where you play in the first person and try to understand why your parents house is empty when you return from a year out.Long ReviewYou arrive back at your parents house after a year away travelling to find a note pinned to the front door and the house empty. The purpose of the adventure is to try and figure out why no one is at home.You do this by wandering around the house, examining objects and slowly piece together the clues. In the process you find out the background of the characters who live in the house and what they have been up to whilst you have been away and indeed before you went away tooYou will not necessarily pick up the clues in sequential order and so must piece the clues together to make sense of the events. This is very enjoyable and the clues offer insights into each of the inhabitants of the house and their lives.The ending is excellent with your discovery of what has happened.I can't see any replay value in this game.ProsShort, it took me around 3 hours to completeIntriguing story line. The main storyline is excellent as well as several of the side story lines.Thought provokingCan be played through at your own paceConsIf I was going to be picky I'd say some of the clues were left in bizarre places that logically made no sense to meI can understand why there are adverse comments about the game, particularly about the price considering the shortness of the game play but I've paid much more for decent games with much longer play times that I've not enjoyed anywhere near as muchThis really was an excellent game which I can thoroughly recommend.

												Waste of time and money. ""Gone Home"" is another attempt (of many) to promote some incredibly boring mainstream academic cultural message by means of atmospheric romaticism. The game begins vague and heavily atmosphereic, one that leaves the player on the edge of their seat and seeking answers for the situation they are subjected to. The curiosity of the average player leaves them on their toes, paying close mind to details, memorizing clues. What's the mystery? What's the revelation?Surprise! It's another boring egalitarianist victim simulator. Snore. It's a general waste of effort; Building up atmosphere to create some sociology-major sob story. Avoid or prepare for painful eyerolling.

This is one of those 'games as art' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with an unpleasantly boring and down to earth story that has this red herring of a plot present itself at the beginning, with things such as noises around the house leading you to believe this plotline might be true, only to open into some teen angsty sexual discovery drama ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Look, I'm all for melodrama and depth in writing but...  So much about this game, from its music to its trailer and the writers attached are SO misleading.  This is an example of a poorly marketed game.  This is not a Game of the Year, this is not 'Games as Art', this is the pinnacle of pretentious hipster 'I'm gonna use this entertainment outlet as my personal canvas' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The Fullbright Company and anyone who praises this as being a 'game' need to get their heads checked.  I really REALLY wanted to like this, but NOTHING has been so dull in such a long time that I have to put my foot down and say 'Stop, don't buy into this, you don't know what you're doing'.I'm all for activism of the downtrodden, I'm all for equality, I'm all for games being taken SOMEWHAT more seriously but please, gaming community, do NOT accept this as our BEST FOOT FORWARD.  This will NOT get us taken seriously, this will just make us look like a bunch of egotistical art snobs.  This game lacks wit, good pacing, clever design and a meaningful message and boils down to the rantings of a mid nineties whining of an angsty teenager whose parents and the world just don't understand.If I wanted to read that, I'd go hit up a livejournal page from the early 2000's, not pay 20 bucks for someone's overglorified piece of garbage.

												Gone Home is a very interesting game that is more like a story than anything. The gameplay is very slow paced, as the whole game revolves around figuring out what happened to your family. The atmosphere of the game itself had me expecting something horrifying to happen every step of the way. It is interesting piecing together what's happened to your sister and parents, finding notes, papers or items that trigger a new entry in Samatha's diary.. You have to use your empathy to connect to the character, or you'll likely just be bored. The story itself may leave you happy, sad or full of twisted emotions from what the story brings up, and from which character you are connecting more with, Kate or Sam. I found it a bit easier connecting to the older sister, and so the story was almost depressing, worrying but sweet at the same time.This game is SHORT, and has basicly zero replayiblity as there is no branching paths, and after the two to four hours has passed, you'll likely just want to uninstall the game to gain back the tiny download space. Overall the game has a very touching story and creepy atmosphere as you travel through the big, empty, mansion like house in search of clues to your families wereabouts. However the miniscule game-time, basicly non-existant replayabilty and $20 price point is a bit to much for a game like this where a majority of your adventure is slowly moving through the house in hopes of triggering maybe thirty second journal entries. I can't recommend this game for it's normal price. If the game drops to $5 or below, I'd recommend it IF and only IF you have interest in stories, like romance and exploration, and don't care about gameplay itself.			"

I wouldn't recommend this to any experienced gamers.I give the soundtrack an A+ rating though =PI feel like Gone Home would have made a better novel (for teenagers) than a game.I would love to see a game that has an in-depth story (like Gone Home) but also asks that the player to do more than walk around mindlessly.

I was expecting a 'boogedy-boogedy haunted scawwwwwy house' game and was instead drawn into a complex world that kept me riveted long after I realized that I wouldn't be fighting any ghosts, leveling up, or rescuing any wayward princesses.  The story development here is top-notch, and the rather simple gameplay works perfectly within this title.  This game is to the 2010s what Myst was to the early days of PC gaming.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who has ever wondered where games can go, or anyone who wants a completely new and different gaming experience.  This title is well-thought out, has an excellent story, and is definitely pushing the boundaries of gaming in general.			"

												So far its a pretty good exploration game, or ""walking simulator"". There is not much else to do than walk around and interact with objects, but this one really isn't about gameplay. It's about story telling, and it does that part really well. It is pretty short but timed well and doesn't need to be longer. The price is too high in my opinion. Get it when its about 5 dollars/euros.			"

												What a giant waste of money.  This is one of those 'games as art' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with an unpleasantly boring and down to earth story that has this red herring of a plot present itself at the beginning, with things such as noises around the house leading you to believe this plotline might be true, only to open into some teen angsty sexual discovery drama ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Look, I'm all for melodrama and depth in writing but...  So much about this game, from its music to its trailer and the writers attached are SO misleading.  This is an example of a poorly marketed game.  This is not a Game of the Year, this is not 'Games as Art', this is the pinnacle of pretentious hipster 'I'm gonna use this entertainment outlet as my personal canvas' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The Fullbright Company and anyone who praises this as being a 'game' need to get their heads checked.  I really REALLY wanted to like this, but NOTHING has been so dull in such a long time that I have to put my foot down and say 'Stop, don't buy into this, you don't know what you're doing'.I'm all for activism of the downtrodden, I'm all for equality, I'm all for games being taken SOMEWHAT more seriously but please, gaming community, do NOT accept this as our BEST FOOT FORWARD.  This will NOT get us taken seriously, this will just make us look like a bunch of egotistical art snobs.  This game lacks wit, good pacing, clever design and a meaningful message and boils down to the rantings of a mid nineties whining of an angsty teenager whose parents and the world just don't understand.If I wanted to read that, I'd go hit up a livejournal page from the early 2000's, not pay 20 bucks for someone's overglorified piece of garbage.

												Warm and funny, sweet and then bittersweet, completely engrossing. There are no puzzles, no monsters, and you don't cut anybody in half with a chainsaw that is also a gun. There is nothing to beat. There is just a story about a girl and her family and it's filled with life and heart and soul and meaning. Gone Home hits you right in the gut.			"

There is a smaller crowd of folks that enjoy this type of interactive experience; being different is appreciated but this title did not stand out to me unforunately.			"

												The creators of ""Gone home"" have gone to great lengths to create a perfect storytelling environment, and as such it is a ten out of ten game. The (juvenile) story itself is - unfortunately - a great disappointment and - to me - almost a deal-breaker. If you're looking for a solid plot and are above the age of fourteen, you might as well skip this one.			"

												This game is a solid proof that modern mass-media is represented by old bunch of casual players who would prefer interactive DVD kind gameplay  over active thinking and actions. The social drama in story adds some bonuses of course but not enough to excuse all this GOTY hype.Back to the game: gameplay is linear and consist from moving between rooms of the house and reading notes of your sister which reveals her story. There are no adventure like  puzzles - just a bit of hidden objects: you lurk around, grab objects and story advanced. The overall experience is close to the move and I expected much much more from storyline and characters due to this but alas - your average Hollywood here. That's the main issue with the game, if you create a game where story is 95% of content it should be good.Bad:1. Game is super shot around 3.5 hours with slow paced and detailed walk-trough.2. Story and characters are not good enough3. No point to replay the game, one fixed ending, no choices etc.Good:1. Overall atmosphere is good and  details in items scattered around make up a bit for a lackluster story.2. Voice acting is on a good level.tl;dr If you like hidden objects games or just want to read the story anyway - could be fine to buy on sale. But if you just curios about teenager lesbians problems I suggest to watch some movies instead (BTW, Blue Is the Warmest Color already released on DVD/Bluray and torrents of course).			"

												I must say for what this game is, the atmosphere is about the only thing that's very off-putting. If at any point it had turned suddenly into a horror game, finding dead bodies or blood splatters, I wouldn't have been surprised. At one point I thought it was doing exactly that, but as it turned out it was red hair dye that had stained a bath tub. The bottle was right next to the tub, even.I kept expecting it to take dark turns, and it never did. Instead it turned into a really good story, one that I shan't go into too much detail about as it would spoil the experience.I see a lot of people commenting about this game and giving it poor reviews. I don't agree. If you go into the experience looking forward to playing a horror game, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if, like me, you go into this game unsure of what to expect, you might just end up liking it.			"

												So I keep seeing this on game of the year lists, and I found myself curious.  When the Christmas Steam sale rolled around it was on there, so I went for it.  I feel like I regret it, but I'm not sure.There is just very little to this experience.  I spent the whole game waiting for something to happen.  That is not to say that I was bored, but rather that it always felt like something interesting was about to happen.  There is this powerful supernatural atmosphere and you find yourself running to the various light switches and pull strings trying to get away from whatever lurks in the dark.  Ultimately, this is no more well founded that it is in real life.  Then the game ended.  I mean, less than 2 hours into it, it was over.I think calling it a game is acceptable and I wouldn't say that playing it was a bad experience. The atmosphere is cool and the flashback stuff was a bit of a nostalgia rush.  I woud say that it is a bad game in that there is no real pay off for the time invested.  It just ends.  Bottom line, if you can find this for 75% off in a sale or at a similar price, it is a pretty solid experience.  At $20, you are wasting your money.			"

												4/10Basically a short story, in a digital format.A short story where the traditional flipping of the pages of a book has been replaced by clicking on objects, thus invoking a paragraph in the short story, but in a familiar setting for gamers, in a first person view in a 3D rendered world, accompanied by a voice-over.And that's it.Hence, the story should be the key. But...If I compare Gone Home with traditional short stories, unfortunately the story itself deals with outdated and uninteresting topics, and the writing is mediocre at best. As a digital experience, or art - the story, and storytelling is nowhere near the quality of, for example - the point-and-click classics, such as The Secret of Monkey Island or Grim Fandango, which Gone Home as a product slightly resembles, and I guess purposefully, in a way, reminisces on. Basically, the lack of puzzles, and feeling of actual interaction within the world of Gone Home, emphasizes the obvious shortcomings of the actual story, and the writing.Hence, I wouldn't go as far as describing Gone Home as an interactive experience, as interacting with objects flipping the pages on a book, cannot really be called interactive per se.The technical aspects of Gone Home are also rather bland an unimaginative, as the gameplay, the graphics, the sound acting and the sound effects lack wow-factors. Obviously they're not there to distract the player from the experience, but in their own, they neither add to nor enhance the experience in a positive way either.But don't get me wrong, the quality of the textures, or the quality of ""level design"" is rather fine, but oddly enough, Gone Home feels like an outdated technology demo, with a short story wrapped on top.Additionally, the length and value for money of Gone Home is rather questionable. It actually took me longer to write this review than ""play through"" Gone Home. As a curiosity, and as a new form of a digital experience, perhaps Gone Home might be worth a few bucks, or an hour or two of your time.However, consider yourself warned. It won't be spectacular.

												Gone Home is an interactive exploration game that is set in 1995. You play as a girl named Kaitlin 'Katie' Greenbriar, who has just returned home from a year-trip to Europe to find her family ""missing,"" and your main objective is to figure out where they've gone. You play by walking around an enormous mansion examing objects by clicking on them, which I did really enjoy. As you click on objects, you'll begin to learn more about your family and where they are. The developers did a fantastic job of recreating a nostalgic 90s era house. There are many pop-culture references throughout the game, including the X-Flies, Super Nintendo, Street Fighter, Pulf Fiction, etc. The main focal point is on your sister, Sam, and as you advance through the house, you'll learn about her rebellious attitude and where she has gone. You learn of her and her lesbian lover/girlfriend, Lonnie. It's a decent story and I was actually really excited to see how things ended with them. I won't spoil it, but I was kind of disappointed in the ending and its abrupt finish. Before giving my review of it, I want to say that this is not a game for everyone.After playing through Gone Home, I can honestly say, I don't see what all the hype is about. Critics praise this game for it's story and many have even gone as far as giving it the title of ""Game of the Year."" Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my playthrough of this game, but I don't believe it comes close to deserving that title. Many people complain about its length. It can be completed in roughly 2-3 hours, if you take your time and look at everything there is to see. I beat it in 1 hour and 10 minutes. I don't really have a problem with that, I did rush myself a bit. The game gives you a very eerie atmosphere. You learn of a story about your ""psycho"" uncle and how his ghost is still living in the house. There's even a hidden room where Sam and Lonnie were performing a seance/exorcism. The entire time, I thought something was going to jump out at me at any moment. I was very wrong. Aside from random light flickers and lightning outside, there are no jump scares. There are no twists. I was a little disappointed by that, honestly. The house is pretty big and fun to explore. There's all kinds of secret passageways hidden behind bookcases/walls. You can definitely tell it's an indie game, just by the graphics. Not that I have a problem with that, I actually thought it looked quite nice. There's all sorts of objects to pick up and look at. One mechanic I really enjoyed was the ability to fully rotate each object to see it from every angle.All-in-all, I did enjoy Gone Home, but I don't think it deserves all the praise it gets. It is a nice game to play and to enjoy an interesting story. Exploring the house itself and viewing all the objects was quite enjoyable. The narration is also done very well. One thing I don't really like about the game is the price tag; $20. It is nowhere near worth that. Thankfully, I was able to play it through Steam Family Sharing, so I didn't have to pay a dime. If you like interactive exlporation games such as Dear Esther or Dream, then this game is for you. If you go in expecting this to be something like Bioshock Infinite, then you're going to be hugely disappointed. It was on sale for about $3 earlier this week. If it goes on sale again, I would recommend picking it up and giving it a chance.7/10			"

												Gone Home is an interesting experience. I say experience because there are no puzzles or action of any kind, it's more an interactive story or a very simple point-and-click adventure. The design and atmosphere are quite nice and the voice acting is also great, but the core of the game - the story - just doesn't hold up once you've reached the end. The entire story is told through what could be called ""audio logs"", or in this case, diary entries. While this does help move the story forward as you explore the house, it ends up being a disservice to the game when it wraps up the main story line. The main story has a very small arc and the other sub-narratives that you discover over time never really get completed. This game feels like chapter 1 to a larger story. The experience can be completed in about 60 - 80 minutes, even when going slowly and trying to discover everything. What you’re left with is a “that’s it”? feeling when the credits begin to roll. The hyperbole from critics about how amazing this game is are a little suspect, I imagine it’s because of the main theme’s subject matter. Overall, it was a fun hour or so - but not something I would want to spend any more that $5 to enjoy.			"

												I came into Gone Home in the wrong state of mind. I was expecting a creepy little indie adventure game. I got way more than I bargained for. There is a somewhat creepy atmosphere due to the vast emptyness of it all but do not buy this game for cheap jump scares. Buy this game for an extremely engaging story that treats you like an adult. It does not spoon feed you the story in any way shape or form. You are given a little background info and then you are thrust into an enourmous empty house with no obvious objectives. This game is not for everyone but I can honestly say this game will stick with me for quite some time in a good way. If you have no expectations other than full emersion, get ready for a truly fantastic experiance.			"

												I liked the environment; would have been perfect for a scary game.  This game is not scary.  It is very short (less than 2 hours of gameplay) and kind of predictable.  There are no puzzles, no surprises, no interactions with other characters.  You do get a nice background of the characters mentioned in the game.  You get to explore a nice house.  I, like a few other reviewers, like that it was set in the 1990s.  However, after about half the game, I kind of wanted to stop, just because I knew it could only end in one of two ways.  It ended the boring way.  I would not recommend this game at $20.  I would not recommend it at $10.  I might recommend it at $5, but that would be pushing it price-wise, as there is only 2hrs worth of gameplay (at most).			"

Posted: January 24, 2014
												The pitch for Gone Home is that you’re a college aged kid coming home from a long study abroad trip. It’s the early 90s, before cell phones or the internet, so your only recent communication with your family has been mainly letters and postcards. When you arrive home, your house is empty and your family is missing, so you have to explore the house for clues as to where they may be. When I heard this pitch, I was super excited to play the game because it sounded narrative focused, which I always like, and it was also interesting to me to design a game purely around the mechanic of searching a house. Unfortunately, I was a bit dissapointed in the execution of this mechanic after playing the game. My main disappointment with this game is that, every time you find a clue as to where your family is, the game starts a voice over clip and spells out to you exactly what the game wants you to know after discovering the clue. I think it would have been way more powerful to let the player examine each object and determine for themselves whether the object is relevant to the story and let the player construct the narrative for themselves. I think it would give a sense of discovery and accomplishment that isn't really present in the game as it stands now. You kind of click through each object in each room until you find one that triggers an audio clip, and then just repeat the process for each room. The developers could have still saved the audio clips for the end of the game for a bigger impact. Right now, when the player reaches the end of the game, it just kind of ends unceremoniously and awkwardly. It’s a bit difficult to talk about this game without spoiling anything, but people who have already played this game should know what I mean. I’m a bit torn on Gone Home because I recognize that it’s a very important and progressive game, but at the same time I feel that there are a lot of execution flaws with this game. Gone Home is starting to get a lot of attention and win some awards, which is all good, but I feel like some of the love this game is getting has to do with the subject matter in the game and not necessarily the game itself. Again, people who have already played this game will know what I mean. The writing in the game is mostly solid for a video game, but that unfortunately doesn't say much. But there were a few gripes I had with the storytelling. It’s probably pretty hard to write solid and well defined characters around the mechanic of discovering objects in a house, but I found that I never got a really good sense of the player’s parent’s characters. They felt flat and undeveloped. Maybe this was on purpose, but I think it would have helped the overall narrative to flesh out these characters a bit more. As negative as I sound about this game, I would still recommend this to people who like narrative focused games. Just be aware that it’s very short; I finished it in one sitting. It’s also a very personal and intimate game from a storytelling point of view, so don’t expect something light or humorous or action packed. Your enjoyment of this game will probably depend on how much this game “works” for you. I don’t think this game really “worked” for me, but I really hope more games like Gone Home get made soon, if that makes any senseFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												So... Gone Home. Heard about probably 20 times over the past six months and finally got a chance to play it through. Now, outside of gameplay --which is just your average, run-of-the-mill narrative-game gameplay-- the story, which is supposedly (it's a Narrative Game... it has to be) the driving force behind this title, it is... lackluster. Without spoiling the ending for anyone, I have to note there are two sub-plots left almost completely unanswered; one of which could have been entirely left ouf of the game without losing any appeal or atmosphere as it had absolutely nothing to do with anything and didn't hold its own very well. I was also confused by the MAIN story and or plot. What exactly was the point behind all of this? Well, no one really knows. I'll tell you one thing, though, you should play this game if for no other reason than how perfectly it captures the 90s. The ""dreary-emptiness,"" grundge, the stereotypes and prejudices, the kind of ""everyone's family has these problems"" issues it handled (or rather, didn't really handle) and the main one; how none of us seemed to have a purpose or know what the hell we were doing with our lives. I don't mean to knock the game entirely, though, it was immersive (especially being set 18 years ago) but its plot was all over the place. A lot of senseless rabbit trails that took you nowhere and did nothing to progress the main plot. I have to say, I was very surprised and a bit disappointed after all of the praise this game got over the course of last year, to find it falling so short of said praise. But alas, what are you gonna do, right? Spend your time -and money- on something else.			"

												I just want to start off by saying, even though it doesn't show record on Steam, I played through the entire game. I got the DRM free version off of the Gone Home Website. I bought this game because I really like the art work and story telling done by Emily Carroll. Her wife, Kate Craig, has also done some pretty amazing stuff. I head she was one of the main graphics artists for the game. I had to give her my support by checking out this game.First the positives. Kate, the artistry in this game was AMAZING. I loved the graphics. I also felt the game engine was exceptional for what you were trying to accomplish. But I can't recommend this game, definitely not for the full $20. Maybe I didn't do my research, but when I bought this game, I thought it was going to have a completely different direction with the story. Emily Carroll's work (and the little I've seen of her wife's) was suspense and horror, but the kind that makes you think. The kind that keeps you thinking up late at night. For the longest time, it seemed like this game was headed in that direction. ""Oh my gosh! What happened to the family?! What horrors will I find in the attic?!!"" The atmosphere, with the thunder, downed cable, darkened rooms, secret passages... I expected something different. I wanted to have the same kind of experience I have when reading one of Emily or Kate's stories. That was a let down.And while the story was very descriptive and well written, and I realize the struggle the LGBT has gone through, seeking to be understood and accepted, it just wasn't... done right. I'm going to add some spoilers to explain myseld, so if you don't want the suprise ruined, I'd skip the rest. But the story is this:You've come back from a study abroad to find your home completely deserted. You have no idea where your parents and sister have gone. And so you scour the house looking for clues. As you piece things together and find ""journal fragments"" you discover your sister's story: Your parents moved into a house. This house is known by the students as the psycho house, as it was formally owned by your deceased, derranged uncle. At her new school, your sister, Sam, feels judged by her classmates, as they come to call her ""That Psycho House Girl"". She is befriended by this other girl named Lonnie, and they go through a teenage, rebellious phase, and fall in love. Events of their love story are recounted. At the same time, your Christian parent's marriage is falling apart, and your mother is toying with a relationship with a guy from work. They don't understand Sam's homosexual relationship, and tell her those stereotypical things that drive the LGBT community nuts. ""It's a phase, you'll grow out of it"", etc, etc. Sam and Lonnie in the end run away, madly in love, and your parents go to a couple's counselling retreat in order to try and fix their marriage.The plot outline, though pretty well written, was pretty awful. It reminded me of a teenage, drama novel. It was about a teenage girl who, like every other teenager, feels like their parents are ""the worst"" controlling freaks out to ruin their life, who goes on a rebellious streak and makes some pretty rash decisions. It's about how those rebellious, dangerous decisions lead to something ""wonderful"" (depending on perspective). It was about how lesbians can have a strong, passionate, romantic loving relationship, while the hypocritical, heterosexual Christian prudes can fail in their holy marriages. It honestly made me feel the same way as when black people get upset at me over racism and the white man oppression. I'm a mid-twenties young man, straight, single, and also a firm Christian to my very core. It upsets me that other Christians would rather place judgement our homosexual brothers and sisters, rather than seeking for understanding. It's a tough road they're on, and I know God has a plan. But the propoganda I found in this game was more frustrating than helpful to their cause. It came across just as whiney and judgemental as I'm sure the LGBT community feels about those who are against them. There are better ways to say what you want to say.			"

												I can't believe I didn't already write this, so I have to get it out of my system.This game is well made but, as many say, highly focused on narrative with very little in terms of traditional gameplay. That's ok, it's still very much more a game than something like 'The 39 Steps' or a visual novel.For a game focused entirely on allowing the player to develop the narrative, I wish the narrative had been a little more developed. Your sister fell in love with another girl classmate and, feeling dejected, they ran away together. That's where the story ends. The details of your sister's process of realizing her feelings and becoming frustrated are fleshed out through diary entries and the like.I wish those log entries - which make up the game's story - had grabbed me a little more. As it is they feel like a rather bubbly and cliched impersonation of high school romance. If these parts had been brilliant instead of just passble, it might have worked a lot better. I don't mean to sound harsh, but when your entire game is moving through a house and reading scraps of paper, then one or both of those parts should be excellent.As it is, those parts feel polished and workable, but there just isn't much there. This feels like chapter one of a ten part story. The romantic plot is sweet, but not exactly literature. Don't play this game unless you're sure you want to pay for an  exploration game formed around basic character development. Even then, it might come across as a little boring. "

												The creators of ""Gone home"" have gone to great lengths to create a perfect storytelling environment, and as such it is a ten out of ten game. The (juvenile) story itself is - unfortunately - a great disappointment and - to me - almost a deal-breaker. If you're looking for a solid plot and are above the age of fourteen, you might as well skip this one.			"

												Gone Home is a very interesting game that is more like a story than anything. The gameplay is very slow paced, as the whole game revolves around figuring out what happened to your family. The atmosphere of the game itself had me expecting something horrifying to happen every step of the way. It is interesting piecing together what's happened to your sister and parents, finding notes, papers or items that trigger a new entry in Samatha's diary.. You have to use your empathy to connect to the character, or you'll likely just be bored. The story itself may leave you happy, sad or full of twisted emotions from what the story brings up, and from which character you are connecting more with, Kate or Sam. I found it a bit easier connecting to the older sister, and so the story was almost depressing, worrying but sweet at the same time.This game is SHORT, and has basicly zero replayiblity as there is no branching paths, and after the two to four hours has passed, you'll likely just want to uninstall the game to gain back the tiny download space. Overall the game has a very touching story and creepy atmosphere as you travel through the big, empty, mansion like house in search of clues to your families wereabouts. However the miniscule game-time, basicly non-existant replayabilty and $20 price point is a bit to much for a game like this where a majority of your adventure is slowly moving through the house in hopes of triggering maybe thirty second journal entries. I can't recommend this game for it's normal price. If the game drops to $5 or below, I'd recommend it IF and only IF you have interest in stories, like romance and exploration, and don't care about gameplay itself.			"

												When I first heard of Gone Home it got my attention very easily. I love exploration/story based games, and the level of detail gave it a definite appeal to me. So a few weeks later I bought it and played it.Almost right from the start the game creates a dark atmosphere and sets the game up to be an interesting horror story. Unfortunately though, this isnt a horror game. The graphics, and audio aspects are great and overall the game runs smoothly. The gameplay is very minimal; only moving and interacting with objects.The real aspect of the game comes from the journal entries you find after interacting with certain objects. Like I said earlier the story at first appears to be horror themed, but about half way through the story becomes very easy to figure out and for me was a very big let down. Maybe they were trying to avoid horror cliches by going in another direction. But in doing so they follwed several other cliches that you would expect to see on a soap opera. Though in the end, despite my opinions of the way they took the story I have to admit it was rather well written.I only have a few remaining comments. There really isn't any replay value and in addition with it's current base price of $20 I would not recommend Gone Home. It was a game that had so much potential that ultimately fell short of being a truly memorable experience.			"

												It's a pretty game with very atmospheric environment. You really get dragged into the world of the game and the 90's nostalgia can make you giggle here and there. The story itself is not that incredible, it's been told so many times already. The exploration is rather fun, since the house you play in is large.If you want to have some fun nostalgia-vibes out of 90's or you're of a younger age-group and want to hear a story from the past then I would recommend this to you. But for me: a short single playthrough with a decent story isn't really worth the money, even with all the exploration and cool environments .			"

												As much as I would like to recommend this game, I simply cannot at this price. While I appreciate an exploring ""game"" like this (I loved Dear Esther) and the game's environment itself is interesting enough with lots of little details, in the end the story just didn't do it for me. Perhaps my expectations were just too high after all the rave reviews on the web. I was expecting to be moved and challenged on a philosophical level. Instead I was served a set of angsty love stories and small suburban drama's. Which have already been done much more satisfying by other media (American Beauty comes to mind).So in the end, Gone Home has it's charming moments, but is not near the masterpiece other (professional) reviewers say this to be. Wait for it when it's 75% off or skip it.			"

Posted: December 19, 2013
												SPOILERSIt's very unfortunate how I cannot recommend this game. First, the good:  It starts off as a promising adventure game, very reminiscent of those made in the past, just with an updated engine.   Objectively, and without considering a large and very important part of the story, the game is a fantastic adventure/exploration experience.  It reminds me a bit of ""Scratches"" and similar titles.  The graphics are nice and the attention to detail is really quite breath-taking.  It was also nice to have a female lead for a change, that wasn't just an eye-candy dress-up to sell more copies.  The game runs well and its pace is just right.  You have an entire mansion to explore.  Think ""the original Resident Evil, but without the zombies"" and you'll get a pretty good idea of what kind of laid-back adventure this game is...  on the surface...The Bad:  They took the great oppertunity they had to make a serious game with a female lead, and threw all of its credibility and likability into the furnace.  Because of the story, this game is nothing more than homosexual, feminist propaganda.  That's seriously it.  You play this game to uncover more story, and that's all the story is, thus, that's all the game is.  Now, I say this as an Agnostic who supports gay rights and has participated in marches and protests for the cause.  There is a love story (actually more than one if you really pay attention, though the additional story(s) show how terrible straight couples are at relationships) and it's a deep and caring one.  I enjoyed the story for what it was, but I also noticed how entirely preachy it was.  Make no mistake; this is a gay/fem struggle/rights message disguised as a video game.  You could tell me this game was created by Pu$$y Riot, and I'd believe you.  My gripe isn't entirely with the game itself, as some of it lies with the views of the development studio representatives.  Their decision to not exhibit at PAX due to a group panel that would be there who pinpointed a real issue in society today (quote from source: ""Any titillation gets called out as sexist or misogynistic, and involve any antagonist race aside from Anglo-Saxon and you’re called a racist. It’s gone too far and when will it all end?"") completely floored me, as it showed their blindness to such an issue.  The developers showed that they only care about their own interests and willfully turned a blind eye to an ever-growing fact of modern society (not just games) in the process.  You can't be liberal while only pushing for your own interests.  The goal is equality across the board (as opposed to punishing white males), and that panel was bringing up a valid point for discussion.  For a company to decide to cut loose and decide to not show up, simply because another viewpoint was being brought into the light, shows exactly how closed-minded they are.  At that point it's not about their principle, it's all about blind, uneducated stubbornness.  This is detrimental to gay rights and feminism as a whole, as it makes them look just as bigoted as those who would oppose them.  They’re essentially closing their eyes, plugging their ears, and yelling “la la la la.”Again, the game is designed well, and really, the love story is quite good to an extent (albeit quite cliche and young-angst at parts).  It’s just far too preachy, and far too obvious, so much so that it gets to a point where you’ll find yourself rolling your eyes at every “journal entry.”  The story unfolds in a really interesting way as there’s actually multiple narratives going on.  For many, there will be a lot of guessing going on to the very end; for the more experienced adventure gamer (who pays very close attention to detail), you’ll have it figured out pretty quickly.Final verdict:  If you’re a hardcore feminist lesbian who believes that your rights are the only ones that matter and every single white male on the planet owes you respect beyond words, this game will be #2 on your “top games of all time” list, just under ""Castrate the White Privilage Patriarchy"" (especially if you like “riot grrrl” music).  If you’re a seasoned adventure gamer with mild to strong supportive views on gay rights, you’ll be able to enjoy this game for what it is, while appreciating the modernist aspects it brings to the genre.  Additionally if you’re level-headed and not a complete libtard, you’ll be able to see its flaws and point them out accordingly.  If you’re an absolute conservative♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you’ll most likely have an adrenaline rush by the end of the game and have an urge to go out and kill every homosexual you can find, especially if you’re Christian (yep they throw that at you too, subtly, so they think).  I liked the game, but I would have liked it more without the preachy aspect.  It is for this reason that I cannot recommend it.  I believe only a small minority of steam users would actually enjoy this game, preachyness included.  I believe the description of the game is left so vague for exactly these reasons, and it's going to catch quite a few gamers off guard.  It's to the point of being quite misleading.  Yes you do what's described in the write-up, but that's more of a mechanism for the game's actual story to vomit all over you.  For some, it will be good to take them out of their comfort zone, but to many (who can look at it, taking a step outside the box), it will appear as nothing more than dressed-up politics, and certainly not the kind of adventure they signed up for.You may find that you like it and if so, please don't view this review as being against you.  Just try to step outside the box and look at this ""game"" with a clear head.  I can't recommend this game because I believe the majority of Steam users would not enjoy it.  While I enjoyed it for its atmosphere and classic adventure gameplay value, only a minority of gamers enjoy those kind of games, and fewer enjoy blatantly forced politics.4/10			"

I wouldn't recommend this to any experienced gamers.I give the soundtrack an A+ rating though =PI feel like Gone Home would have made a better novel (for teenagers) than a game.I would love to see a game that has an in-depth story (like Gone Home) but also asks that the player to do more than walk around mindlessly.

												Let me say that the criticisms against Gone Home are valid: it's too short, and too pricey for what it offers. DO NOT buy it at full price. I'd say half price is good.Having followed it during development, I knew what to expect and so I didn't have the wrong expectations: it's a game based on exploring one intricate space, absorbing the story through the detailed objects you come across. It's a very focused experience.In that regard, Gone Home succeeds. For the two hours (ugh so short) I was in that house, I really was immersed. It felt really lived in, like a real home.You get to know the characters - your player character and her family - through various items strewn around, and while it's all very in your face and void of subtlety, it's still well made, and endearing. Especially the little sister; I want a kid sister like that.I've been looking for a game like this. Ever since Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive, I've been waiting for another game that lets me search premises and detailed rooms in first person, examining objects and looking for clues.So, how does GH fare? It's... a start. Everything's too easily found, the path through the house is pretty linear. The main story is too simple, and boring. It was the side stories that were more interesting, the ones about the secondary characters, the history of the house... all that.I really hope more games come out that are like GH, but more advanced, more complex, more ""game-like"", with more developed stories and a challenging, non-linear experience. But GH is definitely worth experiencing, and for that I give it a thumbs-up.PS. Oh right, there's developer commentary! Always a plus. Gonna have to check that out before I forget.			"

												*SPOILER*This game is about a girl who figures out she's a teenage lesbian feminist that decides to run away with her army deserting girlfrield while her parents are out of town when you (the daughter/big sister) returns home from school. You walk around this big♥♥♥♥♥house that seems like it was haunted/robbed/generally not lived in for a long time and find notes your lesbian feminst run away sister has left all over the house... Overall, the story is horrible and I feel bad for anyone who spent more then the $3 on the flash sale.

												If anyone hates on this game, then I'd assume they are the people that skip cutscenes and just want to shoot everything all the time. The story in this game is absolutely amazing, it is easily in my top 5. You get this very eerie feeling as you walk through the house, and I often found myself doing double takes toward windows and lamps because I was genuinely on my toes at all times. I went into this game knowing nothing about it, and thought that the notes scattered about were nothing more than backstory. I slowly came to realize that they actually were the entire story. It is possible to finish the game without collecting all the notes, but it completely changes the meaning of the game, so keep that in mind. Anyway, this game was f****** amazing, 10/10, if you don't like story then stay away.			"

												“Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told.” No it's not. And it's not worth 20 dollars unless you have excess spending money to blow or really want to support indie developers. There's about 2 hours of game here, plus or minus a few minutes depending on how literate you are. Or if you're an idiot like me and can't read maps.Aside from the 90's kitsch and the fact that the main storyline is based off of teenagers and the adolescent rage that goes with it, the three stories (daughter, father, mother) found here are told well. There are no cutscenes or other video game mechanics to pull you out of the gameplay. Instead, you are free to explore and uncover clues and evidence at your own pace. The game designers did a great job of following the writing goal of ""show, don't tell."" There is no hand holding here and the player is forced to construct their own narrative about their screwed up family. The stories diverge and converge throughout, and the game teases you with classic horror tropes as you creep through this desolate house. The game is deeply personal, and shows the complexities of families and relationships.			"

												It's such a simple idea that works really well. Players love to explore environments, calmer sections in first person games have proven that regularly. So making an entire game based around telling a story not only through the central narration but through environmental details of the house, left for the player to find on their own is just brilliant. The main narrative thread may not be your kind of thing and it's hardly a work of wonder but I really liked it. Emotional but hopeful, it's like a teen novel. I mean that in a good way!			"

												Recommened if you like story heavy exploration and its on sale.There seems to be a lot of bad reviews for Gone Home and while i can see where these people are coming from I still think its a good game. Granted its super short for a game you pay  19.99 for and that might be hard if not impossible to get over   but if you can put that behind you or better still pick it up cheap in a sale, then  maybe you can start to enjoy the game.Its not a challege but nothing about it made me think it would be, its just a simple exploration game with a nice story running through it. Thats what you should expect cause thats what you'll get. So if you got an hour or so to kill and you feel like playing something simple with a nice story running through it, and its on sale go for it! and if you like it and want something that has a similar feel but is way more intese and a game challenge the get ""Life is Strange"" way more bang for your buck and its a much more immersive game.

												This story is beautiful. If you are looking for an action packed combat game, stop here, Gone Home is not for you. It isn't a long game, (4 hours-ish for a VERY in depth play through,) and despite its beginnings as an Amnesia mod, it is not a horror game. It is, however, a gorgeously engrossing story and a refreshing change to the energetic reflex-testers that are in abundance today.You play as Kaitlyn Greenbriar, arriving back to your family home after a long trip abroad, only the house is empty. As you explore the house, you will discover clues about where they have gone, as well as about the nature of their personalities and the struggles every member of the family have been facing. The main plot revolves around your sister, and is told through excerpts of her diary that you uncover by examining particular items around the house.The pacing is spot on, and although you won't be uncovering parts of the main plot every minute, you will always be finding little clues about your family and the people they are. The main plot is somewhat cliched, but that can be forgiven for the sheer stellar way it is told, and the detail of everything you see. You will care about your family pretty quickly into playing, and that is what keeps you hooked early on.For me, this was the best game I have played in a long time. It was short, but incredibly sweet, and the characters will stay with me for a long time.			"

												Gone Home is not a game.  And that isn't why I was highly disappointed by it.  Instead, Gone Home is nothing more then a story of forbidden love, told through a point and click adventure.  The promise of any ""supernatural element"" in this game is squandered early on, instead leaving you with nothing more then the task of opening and unlocking doors and safes to get combinations to more safes and doors just to find out the tragic story's conclusion.  At nearly an hour in length, don't bother with this waste of potential.  Decent story writing, just hindered by being labeled a ""game"".			"

I like the concept of the ""exploration storytelling"", and that part is done well, but I just didn't like the story itself.  Talk about encouraging poor life decisions!  I thought the story would be far more interesting or different or unique.  Rather, it was familiar and tired.  Nothing really new or exciting.As for the nostalgia comments, I guess it's true that some of the music and references do hearken back to the time period in question, but I'm not looking for a game to provide that.

												I know we shouldn't judge a game by play time alone but just as a heads up, this one is over in about 2-3 hours, max. You feel like just when you're getting to the good part, when you think there's some mind blowing twist just up ahead the bend, they end the game and you're pretty much left there with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hand. I think the first thing I said when the credits rolled was, ""Wait, what?"". I get why this game has received so many accolades; it's a good story. When games have a plot that you are able to sink your teeth into, it makes it that much more enjoyable to open every drawer and turn over every paint can in the garage to see if you can find more secrets, clues and storyline. But with ""Gone Home"", there's too much smoke and mirrors and not enough beef.Really wanted to love this game, after all the amazing reviews, but it fell short. If you're like me and ignore people who say negative things about something you know you're going to try no matter what, at least do yourself a favor and wait until it's on sale.			"

												        Gone Home is what one would call an ""Interactive Story"" more so than a game. Gone Home is about a girl by the name of Kaitlin Greenbriar as she arrives home from a trip in Amsterdam only to arrive home and find the house completely empty. It's up to you to find out why.        There isn't much to the gameplay per se, this, like Dear Esther, is a game you ""experience"" rather than play. You go around the house picking up on clues (much like an adventure game) to progress on the story. These ""clues"" are in the form of journals that you encounter through the game that explains the overall story through the eyes of Kaitlin's sister, Samantha. You do, however, have to pay close attention the cues all around the house to find out what was going on with the entire family as well in addition to Sam's story.        The game has a multitude of items that you can pick up and even view up close. The devs for the game went all out on the graphics, a lot of the items you can pick up have very minute details to them which I really enjoyed seeing as well as them looking really authentic - from books you can pick up, to memos, to notices, etc, it's all presented in fine detail bar a few minor inconsistencies here and there with some texture work, but nothing that really detracts from the authenticity of the house. At the beginning, when there's nothing lit up, you have the option of turning on all the lights on every room to track the progress you've made within the house, as well as pick up cassettes and leave em playing music while you go explore or sit and listen to them, it's also very truthful to the times it takes place in aswell, giving nods to old idols like Kurt Cobain and even games like Street Fighter 2 (This includes Mock up SNES cartridges found in the game). I was impressed how much attention to detail the devs paid to the game.         The story itself is a very sad and dreary one that deserves to be experienced atleast once. It's about very realistic issues that take place in real life and are seen pretty commonplace and it's very sad to come home from a trip to what you find out in this game.          Now the game itself, admitedly, is hard to recommend due to the fact that, yes it is, at max a 3 hour game that's honestly not worth a second playthru unless you're looking to see how authentic an experience it really is and to find every speck of detail the developers poured their heart and soul into, very much like Dear Esther. It's not a game in the traditional sense because there's no real way you can fail, and the game itself is fairly linear (you find this to do this to find this and do that, etc) it's an experience. One that I personally am willing to recommend if you enjoy games like Dear Esther, Journey,  The Stanley Parable and so forth.			"

												So I headed into this thinking it would be another artsy-deep indie creation. I'm glad to be mostly wrong.The game puts you in the shoes of Katie, who has just arrived home from Europe. The family's new house is empty, you don't know what's going on, so all you can do is look for clues of the events that lead to this situation.Most of the time you'll be reading notes and listening to journals. It might sound boring, but it is anything but. Even though this  story will last only a few hours, the characters are interesting, the atmosphere is immersive and the whole thing is packaged tight enough not to feel like a drag.As I mentioned, Gone Home is all about exploration and going through the numerous tidbits of information you can find. There are no real puzzles or challenges. If you find yourself stuck, you should probably just check to see if you have missed a few rooms to rummage through. I don't feel like I can call this a game, an interactive experience seems more accurate. Likewise, I don't feel it is worth the current full price (20 usd), but it is totally worth it when on sale.

												I was really interested in buying this game because I thought it would be mysterious and sort of near the horror-genre. I am trying to expand what I play when it comes to video games, so I bought this game basically. However the game is really short and all you do is walk around the house, find notes from your sister, have her narrate the notes, and that sums it up. It was an okay game, but I don't think it's really worth much honestly.			"

												Three hours of my life were dedicated to a lesbian love story that consisted of clicking on toilet paper and soda cans and pop culture references and trying to remind me of being a teenager (or something I guess). I expected with all the critical acclaim that I might actually get something meaningful out of my 75%-off purchase. A creative way of storytelling, marred by a lack of story (and a terrible graphics engine). I find this interactive experience to be shallow and pedantic.			"

												I picked up Gone Home on the Steam sale and had no idea what to expect. While playing I kept waiting for something to happen so I could fit it into one of those mental boxes where you classify games (shooter, rpg, horror, etc.). I kept expecting to turn a corner and encounter something frightening. Or open a door and find a body. An hour later, I was still waiting. When I finished thirty minutes after that, I realized that this was it - nothing really does happen. It's simply a game of exploration, where you learn a story about your slightly eccentric, but largely identifiable, family. I've never played anything like it.So, yes, I guess I would have to say I liked it. But I still would have a hard time recommending it.			"

												Initially this seemed like a cool game. Kind of a mystery exploration game where you would go home to find your entire family gone, and you would have to figure out what happened to them all. Sounded kind of intriguing...but unfortunately, although the beginning of the game felt kind of fun, and finding clues to the fact that you're living in a psycho house, it starts to lead you on to think you're about to discover something crazy and horrifying. Disappointingly, the story just ends up being a teen angsty story about being lesbian and finding your parents just went away on a short holiday. All the mystery it leads you on to believe doesn't really take you anywhere and the ending is very anti-climatic. You could give this a miss.			"

												This story is beautiful. If you are looking for an action packed combat game, stop here, Gone Home is not for you. It isn't a long game, (4 hours-ish for a VERY in depth play through,) and despite its beginnings as an Amnesia mod, it is not a horror game. It is, however, a gorgeously engrossing story and a refreshing change to the energetic reflex-testers that are in abundance today.You play as Kaitlyn Greenbriar, arriving back to your family home after a long trip abroad, only the house is empty. As you explore the house, you will discover clues about where they have gone, as well as about the nature of their personalities and the struggles every member of the family have been facing. The main plot revolves around your sister, and is told through excerpts of her diary that you uncover by examining particular items around the house.The pacing is spot on, and although you won't be uncovering parts of the main plot every minute, you will always be finding little clues about your family and the people they are. The main plot is somewhat cliched, but that can be forgiven for the sheer stellar way it is told, and the detail of everything you see. You will care about your family pretty quickly into playing, and that is what keeps you hooked early on.For me, this was the best game I have played in a long time. It was short, but incredibly sweet, and the characters will stay with me for a long time.			"

												Gone Home is not a game.  And that isn't why I was highly disappointed by it.  Instead, Gone Home is nothing more then a story of forbidden love, told through a point and click adventure.  The promise of any ""supernatural element"" in this game is squandered early on, instead leaving you with nothing more then the task of opening and unlocking doors and safes to get combinations to more safes and doors just to find out the tragic story's conclusion.  At nearly an hour in length, don't bother with this waste of potential.  Decent story writing, just hindered by being labeled a ""game"".			"

I like the concept of the ""exploration storytelling"", and that part is done well, but I just didn't like the story itself.  Talk about encouraging poor life decisions!  I thought the story would be far more interesting or different or unique.  Rather, it was familiar and tired.  Nothing really new or exciting.As for the nostalgia comments, I guess it's true that some of the music and references do hearken back to the time period in question, but I'm not looking for a game to provide that.

												I know we shouldn't judge a game by play time alone but just as a heads up, this one is over in about 2-3 hours, max. You feel like just when you're getting to the good part, when you think there's some mind blowing twist just up ahead the bend, they end the game and you're pretty much left there with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hand. I think the first thing I said when the credits rolled was, ""Wait, what?"". I get why this game has received so many accolades; it's a good story. When games have a plot that you are able to sink your teeth into, it makes it that much more enjoyable to open every drawer and turn over every paint can in the garage to see if you can find more secrets, clues and storyline. But with ""Gone Home"", there's too much smoke and mirrors and not enough beef.Really wanted to love this game, after all the amazing reviews, but it fell short. If you're like me and ignore people who say negative things about something you know you're going to try no matter what, at least do yourself a favor and wait until it's on sale.			"

While interesting, even intriguing at times, the ending is so terrible, so obnoxiously bad that it makes you feel as if the last two hours spent inside that house were a complete waste of time - because it was.Do NOT buy this ""game."" I personally enjoy walking sims, I thought Dear Esther was great, but this is just so...pretentious and boring. Even the elements of horror that are sometimes there are few and far between, and I guessed the ending as soon as the game opened, though held out hope that maybe in the attic there would be something more shocking. Not necessarily a ghost but SPOILER ALERT : I had hoped the girl maybe hung herself in the attic, lending some impact and tragedy to the end of a story that seemed to be going in such a direction, but instead everything turned out fine and I was left with essentially the game version of blue balls. Expectations were minimal, the game delivered even less than I thought it would. Go for Vanishing of Ethan Carter instead if you want a walking sim with minor gameplay elements and a somewhat supernatural story - that game is phenomenal.			"

												Alright, first let me clarify that I do not object to the gameplay of this game. So many people are accusing this game of not being a ""real"" game because it's a narrative that you explore. They're wrong. This game brings to mind the world of Myst, which was a game released in 1993 that single-handedly made the CD-ROM format popular. Anyone who claims that Gone Home isn't a game doesn't know what a game is.Gone Home puts you in the shoes of Kaitlin, a girl who has just returned home from college to find her parents new home completely empty. Her sister, Sam, has left a very spooky note on the door telling Kate that she has left. This early narrative and the overall atmosphere of the game (night setting, thunderstorm and heavy rain, etc.) leads the player to believe that there is a supernatural element at work here. In fact, through various notes and diaries that you find throughout the house, you are further encouraged to foster the idea that Sam and her ""friend"", Lonnie, have been hunting and speaking to the ghost of the former tenant of the home, Oscar. Among items in the house, you find a Ouji board, a safe filled with old pharmacy equipment from the days before Oscar died, and a particularly creepy crucifix that is scripted to shut off the lights when you look at it. Other than these things there is zero horror or suspense in this game. There is an obvious bait and switch tacked onto the surface of this game from the screenshots to the art style and early themes of the game. After the initial mentioning of Oscar, he isn't mentioned again at all until the very end, after you have endured countless audio diaries of Sam moaning on about her girlfriend, Lonnie. It's almost as if the game was created to draw in players wanting a driving suspenseful story only to let them down with a lesbian romance that is mind-numbingly boring. Putting aside the annoying Riot Grrl and Feminist trash littered throughout Sam and Lonnie's hang out spots, there are some interesting items that help you put together the story of the Greenbriar family. This gameplay mechanic was actually pretty fun and reminded me of Myst. Since this was the best part of the game to me, I won't spoil it, but be sure to savor it, for it does not last long.At the end, after it is revealed that Sam and Lonnie have kissed, Kaitlin discovers that her sister has left, not to escape any poltergeists or demons, but to participate in one of the oldest cliches in romantic fiction. She's left to go after Lonnie. And that's it. Sam mentions in one of her audio diaries that she and Lonnie went up to the attic to say goodbye to Oscar, but other than that and the early hints at ghostly activity, there are no other paranormal elements to this game. The game never attempts to explain why there is a ghost, a noticeably unrealistic plot device, in a seemingly normal and mundane game setting. It doesn't explain what Sam and Lonnie did to make peace with the ghost. It's a meaningless story element that seems to exist only as a decorational gimmick to draw in players.The above fact added to the price tag of TWENTY dollars serves to imply that this game was thrown together to make a quick buck. The story is unimaginative and the the playing time is a mere two hours. I played through with the developer's commentary tracks on a second play through, so I spend a little over four hours playing the game. It's probably the shortest game that I've ever bought on Steam. It MIGHT be worth $5 at the most, which is what I paid for it. But honestly, even at that price, the story is lackluster and relies on shady bait and switch tactics to draw you in. It CERTAINLY isn't worth $20. DO NOT pay that kind of money for this game. Wait till it goes on sale or play a friend's copy to test it out first. Don't reward these kind of business tactics with a full $20. I would have felt robbed if I had paid that much money for this game. Steam doesn't give refunds, so you should put your money to better use.			"

Posted: June 23, 2014
												Is this a game? Is it art? What is a game, anyway? Years ago, Greg Costikyan made an early stab at defining ""game"", by distinguishing between games, puzzles, toys, and stories. By way of example, point-and-click adventures are mostly ""puzzles"" (they are solved, rather than ""won""), Sim City is a ""toy"" (it has no inherent goal, beyond what fun you make with it), and something like Civilization is a ""game"" proper (it involves struggling toward a goal, almost certainly in competition with one or more opponents). The categories are somewhat fluid; any given work may have elements of any/all of them. But by those definitions: No, Gone Home is a ""story"", not a ""game"". All of these are forms of ""art"" (whether good or bad art is a separate question).But those categories can all exist in different media: Civilization is a game, but so is, say, Agricola. One is in the medium of ""video games"" and the other in the medium of ""board games"". It is unfortunate that we are saddled with the term ""video games"" for the medium, when in fact the medium is not limited to games, per se. Myst is a puzzle, Sim City is a toy, yet both are within the medium of ""video games"". I think trying to radically re-name the medium is not really possible at this point, so for this reason, I personally have taken to compoundizing the word to ""videogames"", in an attempt to de-emphasize the ""game"" aspect. So what is Gone Home, then? It is not a game; it is not a puzzle; it is not a toy. It is a story, told in the medium of ""videogames"". Is that the best use of the medium? Probably not. Every medium has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. As a narrative medium, videogames' primary strength is probably the audience's empathy with the protagonist. Getting the audience to identify with and care about the protagonist takes effort in most media, while in videogames, because the audience is literally in the protagonist's shoes and controlling their actions, that identification happens virtually for free, and can be much stronger than in most other media. Something like Amnesia: The Dark Descent uses this fact to great effect. Gone Home arguably does not make full use of it, except in a couple of scenes. Personally, overall, I found the story in Gone Home stronger than many of the other reviewers here, but possibly that's down to expectations: I basically knew going in that this was a ""story"", not a ""game"". There are hints at a supernatural occurence that never materializes, but I never found these hints to be distracting, or even particularly emphasized. In the final analysis, Gone Home seems to me to at least be a worthwhile experiment: Can you use the videogame medium to tell a story, with essentially no ""gameplay"" elements whatsoever? Yes, you can. Is that a good idea? Probably not, but it was worth attempting in order to answer those questions. And the story told in this particular videogame is decent enough; I'm glad I played it, didn't feel my time was wasted. As a videogame, it is absolutely worth playing if you are interested in videogames as an art form, if for no other reason than that it does something that has maybe not been done since the 1986 interactive novel ""Portal"".

												(May contain spoilers, nothing specific)First, the pleasantries. The gameplay was fun, each room holding a ""Where's Waldo?"" game for me (Waldo being interactable objects). This may sound odd but my favorite parts of the game were the sounds of rain on the windows and roof and of thunder with its flashes of lightning. Not only were they great in terms of graphics and sound quality, they really fostered a beautiful atmosphere and sounded lovely. The rain blurring the windows was a great idea for obscuring the house's surroundings, so even from the beginning the focus is on the house and its contents.Now, the reason why I can't reccomend the game. The story, and Sam, disappointed me but not for the reason easiest to assume. I have no issues whatsoever with Sam's sexuality, only with the journey she took to discover it. I am Katie's age and I have two younger sisters. If I came home from a year abroad and found evidence all over the house that my sister(s) had felt so alone during the transition period to the new house and school, that she had eventually started smoking, lying to our parents and sneaking out, reading graphic magazines (portraying either gender), and having sex with a kid from her high school? I would have been very, very concerned. Actually, that's an understatement; I'd have been devastated that my sister(s)--whom I love dearly--had gone through so much loneliness and then so much change and I hadn't even been there for it. And the fact that my sister(s) had run away with aforementioned sex partner, without a even a plan or idea of how to support themselves, would worry me to no end. Nevermind any kind of censure for her actions, I'd be worried about her safety and wellbeing!The story is driven entirely on emotion, but in my experience, emotion is only a component of finding happiness. Sometimes emotion is too restrained and opportunities escape, and other times common sense is abandoned because of (even quite genuine) feelings. The story was unbalanced and Sam and Lonnie both were acting almost solely on their emotions throughout the story.The stale parents were a part of the problem. Katie's absence was a part of the problem. Sam's heart doing all of the talking without any input from her head was part of the problem. She grew up on swashbuckling adventures and her story in the game is a pure romance, but nothing in life is purely romantic.			"

												I didn't finish the game, so there might be more complaints I a might rewrite it. But it is simple why I can't recommend this game, the Models are Awful!. Now you think why is that important, the Atmosphere is quite nice and the theme kinda interesting and Indie games aren't known for AAA Graphics but for interestingly Graphics which are more artistic than realistic. But this game is about going back into a home of the 90s, an American home because a European would be much more Techno Music!. And what is Important? To see what it looks like, man I don't want any crazy effects but please make at least the models look realistic, there where telephones, TVs etc. that look like crap, like they where made for the PS1, totally deformed! I own a 90s Mobile! I own allot of old stuff to like Consoles, Radios, Kitchen Utilities, and everything has a specific look and design but if you totally deform those pieces by making plump models you destroy all the nostalgia!. Is it really that hard to want some decent modeled Models? Some of those look even worse than what I do! And I just started some months ago with 3D Modeling! So WTF? It is so unfortunate that this destroys the whole game for me but that is how it is and you shouldn't buy an half♥♥♥♥♥nostalgic walking simulator.			"

												Gone Home is the first video game I've played that tells a very good story, needs to be a game, and does not require mastery of complex controls.The story is not very good for a game. It is very good for a book or film. But Gone Home couldn't be a book or a film. The quality of its story is indebted to its characterization as a game. However, you don't have to know how to play video games to experience this story. You move around with the keyboard and click on things with the mouse.It's a little trite, but it's a teenage love story, it's practically impossible for one not to be. The third act drags a bit, but it sticks the ending perfectly, so that doesn't really matter.Ultimately, Gone Home is a video game that tells a beautiful love story that can be played by anyone that can browse the Internet. It should go down as a watershed moment in the history of video games as an art form and I highly recommend that you play it.			"

												I thought the gameplay was really interesting and made for a unique experience, I'd really like to play another game that does the same kind of thing. My main issue which is a pretty crippling issue all things considered since this is a story based game, is that I absolute despised the story. Just 2+ solid hours of listening to the ramblings of an angsty twerp. If you've ever read Catcher in the Rye and thought it was a revelation, you'll probably end up liking this story. Anyone else, I would recommend taking a pass.			"

												I just finished Gone Home and I can already say it is one of my favourite games. I haven't been so invested in a story or its characters like this in a long time, the gameplay is simple and refreshing and you are free to explore this achingly realistic house at your own pace. I want to say more but I really don't want to ruin this incredibly gaming experience for anyone else. But you should know this going into it:It is not a survival horrorIt is not an action gameIt isn not a long gameJust in case people think they're getting into something they're not, but apart from that I don't want to say anything else. The game may seem overpriced, however seeing as I can't stop thinking about it and already want to play through it again to find anything I may have missed and experience the amazing story again, I personally think it deserves every penny and deserves a place in everyones Steam Library.

												I wouldn't recommend this game for several reasons. One, it is definitly not a game for everyone. There are certain people who like games that allow you to snoop through random things, but apparently I'm not one of them. When I got the game, I was half expecting to just look around the house and see a murdered sibling type deal. But no... You just walk around your house while its raining outside. I did like that the setting is several decades ago and I can actually remember those times, but the graphics weren't as good as they could have been. The storyline was boring and the first hour that I played, I accomplished nothing. There was just too much to go through and I never knew if I was going to miss something because I didn't check an empty hall closet. I was bored to tears, and not to mention that my computer lagged the whole time I was playing it.Overall Rating: 3/10			"

This game could have been made into more if they allowed you to uncover the other stories we see only a little bit of through the items in the house.

												Gone Home, what can I say about this game. It is not at all what I expected it to be and that's not a good thing. Basically the entire game is you unraveling a tiny mystery of where your family is when you get home from abroad. I knew it was a walking simulator, I knew it wasn't going to have any enemies or fighting. But man is this a slow paced game. It's also very short, like 2-3 hours depending how much you explore. There is little to no reason to ever play it again either. The story, like I said, is you coming home from being at college abroad. There is a note on the door from your sister saying not to come find her and don't try to find her. Yeah right, so basically you try to figure out where your family is. It seems more mysterious than it really is. In the end, the game basically tells a long drawn out Lesbian love story. Which I did not care for at all. Sorry, my personal preference. I felt I was duped with this game, thank God I only paid like $4-5 for it on sale. It certainly isn't worth more than that. I will say this, the voice acting is pretty well done and the controls are ok for what they are, I played with a PS4 controller. Beyond that, I didn't care for the story at all. And that's all there really is to this game, a story. So I simply cannot recommend it. If you like a long drawn out lesbian tale of love then by all means, play this game. But if you prefer to have a hetrosexual love story then pass on this one.			"

												This game is a walking simulator that lacks a compelling story. Every attempt at exposition in this game is incidental and disjointed, with many story moments being delivered as voiced narrations and 'clues'. These plot devices are sparsely placed throughout the environment, which contributes to the feeling that the developers lazily threw together a scavenger hunt instead of an interesting story. The only reason game journalists love this game is its niche socio-political agenda (sorry, no spoilers). From a pedestrian perspective, Gone Home is a monstrosity, rife of any immediately relatable story elements. Unless you enjoy preachy games, games that can  be completed in under two hours, or games with no definitive objectives, you should not spend a cent on Gone Home.			"

That statement alone may make you think my review will be a negative one; you would be so wrong. This game was brilliant from the environment, lighting and sound all the way to a very interesting story. I spent most of the game terrified that something was going to jump out and scare the heck out of me. The house feels strange around every corner due to great lighting and sounds that come from all over the place.  I won't go into the story as it's something that you really should experience for yourself blindly. There is no shooting, killing, fast pace movement or timing that takes place in this game; it's a detective type game with some open-endedness. I'm typically not a fan of short games, but this game was well worth my money; but only if you buy it during a sale.+ Amazing sound and lighting+ Atmosphere is very engrossing+ Very enjoyable and spoken story- Short game- Lacking direction at timesScore:  8.5 out of 10			"

												I went into this knowing only that the music in the game was some pretty bad 90s rock. My opinion anyway. Still I heard it was supposed to be a really engaging game.It was tolerable. Any longer and I probably wouldn't agree with that statement. You spend your couple of hours exploring your home, all alone. It's creepy... moody... you're trying to figure out why nobody is home. It's deeper and there's a story to piece together. The main story you learn is kind of interesting. Still I find that calling it a walking-sim is kind of accurate. You walk around, picking up objects, examining them, and... that's it. Your greatest choices will be whether or not to put that can of soda back where you found it or to toss it away like yesterday's garbage. Also, why the hell is every can of soda around there closed?Anyway, again, I liked the story the character kind of pieced together but it was not entertaining enough. Nor was it mysterious enough to be worthwhile. I honestly would have rather someone told me the storyline behind it all. I say this because while I understand the game is trying to do something different... be more like an interactive movie perhaps... I felt it was severly lacking because my character had no actual actions in the game. Yes you pick stuff up and read stuff, but in terms of the plot and what's happening to the other characters (the important stuff), none of it you have any influence on. You play as the daughter/sister of the family, but you could literally be a pizza delivery guy who noticed the door was unlocked and you'll get the same experience. The fact that Sam writes to you means very little in the context.I'm glad I played it because I was able to experience an obvious experiment in video game design and culture... but I would not at all recommend anyone else play it. Your time is more precious than that.			"

												While immersive, coupled with wonderful voice acting and an ominious atmosphere driven to lure the player into questioning as to whether the game will deviate into the survival horror realm, it falls short in providing a satisfying storyline. Throughout the game, the story builds at a good pace but ends prematurely, which left me thinking, ""Wait, that's it?"" The main plot was predictable, but the voice acting compensated for its lack of a surprise element and kept me engaged. I just felt that the developers had ample opportunity to create a more interesting and original storyline on par with the detailed, interactive elements placed around the house; they could have delved further into the sub-plots surrounding the family and their issues, which I found very intriguing, and tied it in better with the main story. However, lots of the items around the house did not contribute to the story line or any puzzle elements (not that the game truly had any at all, anyways) whatsover, and seemed to be there only to keep the player clicking longer (e.g., shot glasses, soda cans, toothpaste). In conclusion, the game is filled with potential but ultimately fails to reach it. For a price of $20, it is not worth the purchase whatsoever. Only consider purchasing on sale, but even the price there seems steep at $6-$10 for only an hour or two of gameplay with a highly cliched storyline with no replay value. However, if you're big on ambience, it is well worth it. Even though description stated that the gameplay is non-violent, there were numerous times where I felt extremely on edge or tense from the thunder, creaks, lighting, and darkness after finding several items in the game that seemed to suggest horror elements.

Life Is Strange's Older SisterYou play an older sister coming home from college but the real showstopper was her sister. The game is very relaxing and gives a sense of serenity at times. Other moments, the somewhat eerie environment kept me on edge, expecting jump scares that never came. Overall, Gone Home is entertaining and the style of narration was intriguing enough to keep me playing in one sitting. It's a brief yet captivating coming-of-age love story that you have to unravel by snooping around the house for clues with some witty reads and throwbacks to the 80's and early 90's. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys interactive point and click games. I also have to thank Gnerma for surprising me with this game gift (thank you! :D)!7/10			"

												I've been going through trying out games I've bought over the years.  This one (Gone Home) had very good reviews at the time, but for me, it simply doesn't work.  All I can do on the start screen is use the arrow keys to navigate between ""New Game"", Options, and Exit.  I can't select them.  Space, return, esc, none of that has any effect.  The mouse does nothing.I googled around a bit and found this is a known problem.  For some reason this basic, fundamental issue has not been fixed in the years since the game came out.  Supposedly if I disconnected all USB devices from my computer, it has a chance of working, but that just isn't an option for me and isn't reasonable to expect.  I have a variety of devices attached, some game controllers, some not, as I use this computer for other things than playing games.  No game gets to modify my hardware configuration.  Not Reasonable.  Not to mention, lame!If I could get my money back, I would.  But I'm sure it's aged in my library too long.  Still, be warned!Bonus lameness - Steam won't let you review a product until you have used it for at least 5 minutes.  But I can't use it.  If you see this review, it means I sat at the non-responsive start screen until Steam decided I had suffered enough.			"

												It's really, really hard for me to say I didn't like this game. The exploration, atmosphere and interaction with the environment were all top notch. But in the end so, so much more could have been done with the story itself. It all seemed to lead up to something interesting, and became the most boring story ever.			"

												Gone Home, what can I say about this game. It is not at all what I expected it to be and that's not a good thing. Basically the entire game is you unraveling a tiny mystery of where your family is when you get home from abroad. I knew it was a walking simulator, I knew it wasn't going to have any enemies or fighting. But man is this a slow paced game. It's also very short, like 2-3 hours depending how much you explore. There is little to no reason to ever play it again either. The story, like I said, is you coming home from being at college abroad. There is a note on the door from your sister saying not to come find her and don't try to find her. Yeah right, so basically you try to figure out where your family is. It seems more mysterious than it really is. In the end, the game basically tells a long drawn out Lesbian love story. Which I did not care for at all. Sorry, my personal preference. I felt I was duped with this game, thank God I only paid like $4-5 for it on sale. It certainly isn't worth more than that. I will say this, the voice acting is pretty well done and the controls are ok for what they are, I played with a PS4 controller. Beyond that, I didn't care for the story at all. And that's all there really is to this game, a story. So I simply cannot recommend it. If you like a long drawn out lesbian tale of love then by all means, play this game. But if you prefer to have a hetrosexual love story then pass on this one.			"

												While immersive, coupled with wonderful voice acting and an ominious atmosphere driven to lure the player into questioning as to whether the game will deviate into the survival horror realm, it falls short in providing a satisfying storyline. Throughout the game, the story builds at a good pace but ends prematurely, which left me thinking, ""Wait, that's it?"" The main plot was predictable, but the voice acting compensated for its lack of a surprise element and kept me engaged. I just felt that the developers had ample opportunity to create a more interesting and original storyline on par with the detailed, interactive elements placed around the house; they could have delved further into the sub-plots surrounding the family and their issues, which I found very intriguing, and tied it in better with the main story. However, lots of the items around the house did not contribute to the story line or any puzzle elements (not that the game truly had any at all, anyways) whatsover, and seemed to be there only to keep the player clicking longer (e.g., shot glasses, soda cans, toothpaste). In conclusion, the game is filled with potential but ultimately fails to reach it. For a price of $20, it is not worth the purchase whatsoever. Only consider purchasing on sale, but even the price there seems steep at $6-$10 for only an hour or two of gameplay with a highly cliched storyline with no replay value. However, if you're big on ambience, it is well worth it. Even though description stated that the gameplay is non-violent, there were numerous times where I felt extremely on edge or tense from the thunder, creaks, lighting, and darkness after finding several items in the game that seemed to suggest horror elements.

Life Is Strange's Older SisterYou play an older sister coming home from college but the real showstopper was her sister. The game is very relaxing and gives a sense of serenity at times. Other moments, the somewhat eerie environment kept me on edge, expecting jump scares that never came. Overall, Gone Home is entertaining and the style of narration was intriguing enough to keep me playing in one sitting. It's a brief yet captivating coming-of-age love story that you have to unravel by snooping around the house for clues with some witty reads and throwbacks to the 80's and early 90's. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys interactive point and click games. I also have to thank Gnerma for surprising me with this game gift (thank you! :D)!7/10			"

												I rarely write reviews, but I had to for this game.I don't even have much to say, other than it was an amazing story. I cried so much throughout it and that has never happened with video games for me. I understand that this story may not be relatable with everyone, but for me personally, it was absolutely hard to get through purely because of how real it hit home.The more the story unfolds, the more it got to me. Reviews are always going to be biased purely because everyone has different tastes when it comes to art in general, but I couldn't not make a review after this experience. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

It's really anti-climatic and boring considering.The story is basically you come home, and you gotta find out why nobodys home and why you're sister has just up and left. Spoiler!  She's lesbian and the game is about learning her romance with this girl. as cool as the game looks, and the fine attention to detail; it really didn't appeal to me with it's story.And certainly not worth $20.

												Go get Life is Strange instead. It deals with the same issues and is an actually complete game, not a tech demo.Gone Home is a tease of a game. It is far shorter than it should be, it has no replay value, and the all of the interesting elements are presented, then ignored, in favor of a banal conclusion.TO be clear, this could have been a good game. The writing is there, and a lot more depth which was presented to the player could have been explored. Instead, only the most trivial element of the story is resolved. At best, it is an introduction to a game, not a game in and of itself.As to how it functions as a short story, it doesn't work well there, either. Maybe, maybe, twenty or thirty years ago the prime storyline would have been sufficient, but the focus is something that should be an element of the background and all of the background elements are much more interesting and actually display more conflict.As a former writing professor, I would give this a C, and only for the quality of the prose.

												Boring Setting, boring Characters, boring exploration and the list goes on. I have read visual novels with more GAMEPLAY than this ""game"".  You just walk through 1 house and look at all the stuff that is littered around like in a point and click adventure but without ANY puzzles. Yepp. This game is as tense and interesting as a point and click adventure without puzzles . Watching paint dry is more worthwhile than this. But, ohhh, the PROGRESSIVE Story! It is so progressive that it is almost nonexistant. Your sister gets bullied and then did something spoilertastic because she got bullied. I have played gameboy color games (Lufia the legend returns) that offer far more and deeper storylines than this.In short: no real gameplay, no real story, no real anything. The only thing that moved me to tears about this game was that i payed actual money for this garbage.			"

												A lot of people get up in arms about whether or not this thing is a ""game"" or ""interactive fiction"" or a ""walking simulator"". The point is: There are plenty of games with equal or less mechanics and objectives than Gone Home. Gome Home is a game that thives on ""environmental storytelling"", which means using the surroundings of the player to give the player narrative information without with dialogue or a cutscene. The developers of the game last worked on DLC to Bioshock 2 (a series known for this stuff), so it's no suprise that they use the same tricks. Notes left around, rooms in various states to give clues to what happened in the past, and voice over narration while you play. The problem is that even if the way the story is presented is okay, the story it's telling has to be good, especially when there are no engaging mechanics or interesting gameplay scenarios. The game is basically a teenage romance novel in interactive form. You run around a house alone uncovering a dysfunctional family's deepest secrets through notes laid out in the open in convienient chronologic order. The primary story (and only narrated one) is of a troubled lonely teenage girl who finds friendship and love through a super special awesome young woman and has to deal with a her dissaproving christian parents. While the subplots with the parents were kind of interesting, I just feel the story is kind of trite and mediocre. It just plays out like a teenage wishfufillment novel. There's nothing wrong with a grounded, realistic story,  but it's so predictable and leaves plenty of headscratching plot holes at the end. And the way the house is set up in such an absurd fashion with the notes and the arbitrary key hunt doesn't aid in the believability. The only other appeal to this game if you aren't into shoddy gay love stories would I guess be nostalgia factor, considering the house is plastered in gratuitous 90's iconography.			"

												My favorite part of this game is the environment. The house is beautiful, filled with nostalgia from ths 90s. Exploring is a delight rather than feeling it's a task. The game is narrated very well through journals that you'll find. However, the plot isn't really that compelling as I prefer it would be.

												I'm not really sure I liked this game.  I am the type of player to take my time and look at every detail.  But the whole set up for the game was misleading.  I really thought this was going to be a horror story.  And if it were, then it would be set up to be a great one.  The on going storm in the background and creaky house noises, along with a blown out light bulb all set me up for a gruesome ending.  But at its core, this is just a narrative about love.  What people enjoy about this is the ability to openly explore and look at nearly every object.  Even the sound track is not bad.  But I was on edge the whole time waiting for a horror storyline to play out, and at the end I kind of felt robbed.  There were just so many elements that were brought up in the story and never realy explored.  Not to mention that this isn't the type of game that is worth replaying.  However, I did get this during a decent sale, and while it holds no significance to me, it was nice to experience this type of game for the first time and be able to critique it like a novel.			"

												A wonderful exploration of what kinds of stories games that games rarely tell, told in a way only games can. The story of the house is a very human one, with subplots for you to investigate or ignore at your leasure. While few the interactive elements are on the ""main quest line"", the precence adds texture and a sense or realness to the world, while the diary entries reveal the story at a relaxed pace to match your exploration. Hopefully, one day this will be viewed as one of the popularizers of a new genre of environmental narative games. The game is very short, only a few hours, so pick it up on sale if this is a concern. The is also no challenge, but expecting such is missing the point. The creators wanted to guide you though the story, not try to trick and frustrate you. Clearly not for everyone, but a must try for fans of story and exploration.			"

												A fantastic exploration-based story game. You play as a young woman named Katie who just arrived home from a year-long tour of Europe. You come home to an empty house that your family had moved to while you were away. As you begin looking around, you slowly uncover what has happened in the lives of your mother, your father, and most importantly your younger sister, Sam, while you were away.While another form of media may have been more appropriate to convey this story, the use of a video game still does the story  justice with its ability to evoke a range of emotions. Since the player unfolds the story at their own pace from the first-person point of view of Katie, the story comes across in a much more personal manner.			"

												This game... well, if we want to call it a game, is a joke. Certainly not worth twenty dollars, and absolutely not worth all the awards it's getting. You are able to interact with the most of the items, though most of them are worthless. It's super short, even when you haven't played it before. And the story itself is nothing more than something you'd find on Lifetime or ABC Family. Everyone talks about the ending being amazing, and how you should play it. Not only was I disappointed by the build up that it couldn't have possibly lived up to, but I felt cheated out of all the time I gave to it. I was gifted this game, and the best thing I got from it was a foil card I could sell for money, so I could say I was paid to play this. And even then, it's not worth it.			"

I did not rush through the story but I had guessed the ending long before the finale (rather shortly after opening sequence). I really like what the devs tried to do here (the atmosphere was great!) and I hope in the future they expand on it but in this case, I'm almost sorry that I bit the hook.Given that this title will give you roughly 2 hours of gameplay at most with little point of replay it hardly earns its pricetag compared to other games in the genre.

												The Fullbright Companies' understanding of what is is like to be a young dumb kid who is considered weird for the dumbest reasons is astounding. In one of the most realistic/accurate narrative games I have ever played Gone Home has you exploring a house you have been away from for quite some time, but your mother,father, and sister Sam have all left plenty of hints of what life has been like while you were away. It's smart, mature, witty, and a time capsule of the mid 90s. While the game's $20 price tag may seem on the high side, it is a priceless experience. Go into the game with an open mind.			"

												I played this game from start to end after hearing people rave about it. Here are the things I wish I knew before I started:* There is absolutely no gameplay* Nothing happens.* It's as lame as it is in the first 20 minutes as the last.* The only thing you do in this game is read letters and hear letters read to you. Don't bother looking at non-letter items. They're not letters. They don't do anything.* Everyone who likes this is wrong and I am the only right person. "

												I am so glad I bought this game for a few bucks in the sale. I'd be going mad if I bought it for 20!! The game is so not worth the hype. It basically is just a point and click adventure. Well, let's leave out the adventure. So it basically is just.. point and click.Because of the hype around it, I expected a mind blowing story while wandering through the (very detailed!) abandoned house. But nothing! You are left alone with actually an open end. You don't get to know what happened with the owners of the house. And the thing is: You don't even care! It's not a cliff hanger! Because the game doesn't make you wanna know what happened. While wandering through the house, listening to the answering machine, finding notes, and looking at the left overs of the owner, you listen to the story of the girl (I don't even remember in which relation she stood) who fell in love with another girl, but her girl left for the army (I think it was like that). And the parents of the girl telling the story are not okay  with it bla bla, heard it all before, average story.But you'e got to hand it to the game that it has a really really great and detailed setting. It makes you feel comfy in the house and makes it so real.But after finding  hidden doors and all of that, I actually expected some kind of ghost story, or something spectacular that happened in that house. But the game gives you no impulsion on investigating further, I felt no urge to get into the story.Nice setting, but more kippers and curtains!!!			"

This is pretty much a romance novel as a computer game. Exploration and puzzles serve for nothing more than revealing sound bites of a story that really didnt interest me. It kept teasing that it might turn into horror but never happened.Also works with xbox 360 controller but will NOT work with PS3 Controller.			"

												Gone Home is one of the worst games I have ever played. Please do not let reviewers trick you into thinking this is new and innovative. It isn't. It is given high reviews because of the subject matter. It has to deal with a young girl coming to grips with her sexuality. Just because a game deals with homosexuality, and the struggle of a girl growing up and discovering herself does not mean it is good. If I could find one thing to say about this game, it is that the way it moves the story forward makes it not feel as linear as it is... it feels natural. However why would that matter if the story is awful?			"

												I know, why you are intrested now (as I was once) -  the advertising of this game is well-done - during all the game I was waiting for something till... it just finished. Mmm... What a disappointment...There was plenty of plots to discover... but all of them were dead-end. Firstly, you have a feeling that a thriller, even a horror story awaits... but it's just a snotty story about two underaged lesbians... pff, is it intresting?!Finally, the feeling I've got was like when you open many boxes to find nothing. Well, no, you find - a bundle of snots. Worthless.Если честно, реклама игры на высоте - всё время ждал, когда же начнётся действо, и вдруг... прошёл игру. Мда... Обидно, блин... Было столько классных завязок сюжета... которые не были использованы. Поначалу кажется - триллер, можно сказать хоррор стори, а оказывается - пошлая в своей банальности история двух малолетних лесбиянок... нашли, чем удивить, нax!

												A fantastic exploration-based story game. You play as a young woman named Katie who just arrived home from a year-long tour of Europe. You come home to an empty house that your family had moved to while you were away. As you begin looking around, you slowly uncover what has happened in the lives of your mother, your father, and most importantly your younger sister, Sam, while you were away.While another form of media may have been more appropriate to convey this story, the use of a video game still does the story  justice with its ability to evoke a range of emotions. Since the player unfolds the story at their own pace from the first-person point of view of Katie, the story comes across in a much more personal manner.			"

												In my opinion, not really a game, rather an interactive story. Pretty short, but insanely good; 2 hours (only) of suspense in manor lost in wood. You get an urge to know what happened there and you reveal, step by step, the whole story (this latter is quite nice by the way, go further for the sub-story). Gone Home is exploration, examination... but no jump scares, no kills, no guns... and all in year 1995. My advice is you should buy it with sale time. Honestly, almost 20€ it's quite expensive. Also, Gone Home isn't suitable for everyone due of its gameplay.A must have for 5€ !			"

												If you're going to buy this, don't buy it for the full price. Otherwise you would have spent 20$ for 30mins of your time if you don't look at 90% of the details (which not only isn't worth your time, but you don't them need to beat the game and understand what happened.)Okay story.

												Not sure what to think of this title. Is it a game or an interactive story? This alone changes the basic nature of how to approach this title. So I'll just split the baby and touch on both.Game -Gone Home is a terrible game.The premise of the game is you explore a large house circa 1995 to uncover a story (this will be part of the story section later) by picking up objects, looking at them and exploring the house. There's not much to love here. The pacing is painful since your avatar walks extremely slowly. The object examination is much like the worst parts of LA Noir where you pick up random cigarette butts. Exciting objects you can pick up and learn more about include:PencilBlank notebookShot glassSoda canEraserVideo game cartridge (console itself missing, but cords mysteriously left, rendering it useless)Empty casette tape casesThe house is littered with random trash that you get to ""interact"" with, for some reason. The rest of the game is set up as a peck-and-hunt title where you seek out keys to inexplicably locked doors. Good thing Kaitlin came home early because Mom and Dad would be angry at Sam not for (spoiler later in the story section below) but for making them take a goofy route of finding a key in a loose wall panel, unlocking the basement, finding a hidden door just to get tot he hallway to open the door to the kitchen. The ice cream would have melted all over the floor by that point if they decided to stop off and get food on the way home.And...that's it. There's literally nothing else to do. You play a couple of bad 90s era grunge songs, pick stuff up, and practically nothing else. The presence of a SNES in the pre-release videos (absent in the release game) could have offered up a cool little side game where you played mock retro titles, but that was a missed opportunity.Interactive Story - The interactive story side doesn't fare much better.***WARNING - BEYOND THIS POINT THERE BE SPOILERS***Throughout the title, there are five storylines that are revealed through looking at the objects that aren't random house junk. The first story is a bit of a slap in the face that centers around the Uncle that died and left the house to your avatar's father. There was discussion of occult events, mysterious deaths, an electrical inspector that couldn't find out why the the electricity randomly failed, and various occult easter eggs hidden around the house, from a creepy crucifix in a hidden room to the sister's, Sam, attempts to contact the ghost. The storyline abruptly ended about 20 minutes in and was never concluded, even if it was a simple ""yup, found the problem with the wiring, squirrel built a nest over some wires"".The second story is about Dad's career as a writer. It talks about his attempt at being a published author and his first publisher dropping him when the first two books of his revisionist conspiracy theory history failed to sell well. It talked about how he reviewed stereo equipment to make some cash in the mean time, almost out of desperation. It is implied that this drove him to alcoholism. A third book was agreed to be picked up by a conspiracy theorist publishing group, but there is conflicting information with notes from the Mom to the Dad about not giving up. Again, there is no resolution. Did he actually publish the work? Did it succeed under a different, more targeted label? Did he give up reviewing stereo equipment? The story line, again, abruptly ended with no resolution. Did he ever kick his alcoholism?The third story centers on Mom and a very brief overview of her life. A Canadian expat, she works for the forestry service. After performing well she was promoted to a supervisory position. This just ends here, no further information, just random background noise.The fourth story centers on the difficulties Mom and Dad are having in their marriage. There is very little information on this presented and all we know is that the reason the parents are gone is that they're at a counciling retreat. As a running theme, the story doesn't go anywhere and there is no resolution.The fifth and main storyline is about Sam and her life since your main character left for her European tour. She went through changing changing schools, dealing with rumors of living in a haunted house, discovering and developing her writing talents to the point she won a partial scholarship to a university literary program, and finding one friend in Lonnie. Over the course of their friendship, Sam begins to come to realize she is a lesbian and, surprise, so is Lonnie. They grow closer, to the dismay of their parents who think its just a phase. It touches on the pain, confusion and abandonment that growing up to discover your sexual preference is different and not seen as positively by others.Then it goes off and turns insulting to the entire LGBT community. Lonnie, being the first LGBT individual Sam ever met, are thus required to immediately fall into deep, true and lasting love. It comes off as ""you're lesbian too? Wow, we have so much in common, let's run off together and get married."" The entire story played out like a classic coming to terms with sexuality and the inexperience of youth, just from a LGBT point of view. Most people end up figuring out that the first ""love"" is anything but youthful inexperience of raging hormones creating an attraction to a different person. Where Gone Home flies off the rails is that Sam and Lonnie abandon promising futures to run off together to, who knows, a major theme of this story is ""give the audience information then leave them hanging"" as it, again, abruptly stops with a casette recording about how Sam decided to run off with Lonnie, Sam abandoning her college future and Lonnie skipping out on the Army that was her dream in life (it's not AWOL or deserting since you can back out any time without penalty before completing Basic). The story never even bothered to mention if that hysterical crying on the answering machine was before or after Sam decided to leave. Is Sam currently in trouble as you ignored the cry for help with a sister in real danger as you slowly padded around the house opening empty underwear drawers? Or did Sam not bother listening to Lonnie on the answering machine when she called Sam after her rather shallow, as the game information presents it, revelation?A much stronger story would likely have either presented WAY more information over a longer time period on the relationship between Sam and Lonnie that left little doubt that this was legitimate and not just a ""first time I'm mutually attracted to someone"" scenario or, even better, this. At the end, you go up into the attic photo development studio and find Sam curled up and crying over the loss of her first love. Your character then comforts her and promises to support her through this difficult time. A denumont would then discuss how, despite the fact that their parents never did approve, the emtional stability Sam was provided by her sister gave her the strength to take advantage of the scholarship and, as an older and more mature person, found her true soul mate in someone else. Kaitlin's support gave Sam the strength to develop a healthy, mature relationship with another woman that was built on common understanding and strength, no the ""you're the only lesbian in town"" presentation we got with the Sam-Lonnie relationship.So, really, even as an interactive story, it's not that good.I got it on a sale for around $2.50 or so. At the current (as of this posting) $20, it's a complete ripoff. Even at $2.50, it's hard to recommend this title given the poor pacing and story crafting. The lack of an actual game here is also tough to stomach.4/10 - good effort, but no follow through.			"

												Absurd!I finished the game in 80 minutes. 80 MINUTES. And they are asking $20 for it. It doesn't even have much in the way of music -- some ambient tracks and rain sound effects, and a few cassette tapes you find with pretty awful off-key indie music. The description states that you enter the house to find the answer to where your family is. You DON'T GET an answer to where your parents are. That makes absolutely no sense. What is the purpose of the game, then? A lot of walking, tipping over random objects for no reason, just to further an extremely cliche lesbian love plot. If the love interest had been a man, it would have been the most basic story ever told in a video game. I guess switching it with a female made the game edgey and inventive and brave instead of just being absolute non-effort rubbish.To be fair I enjoyed walking around and turning all of the lights on in the house. There weren't puzzles so much as simply scouring every room until you find the item that opens the next area, unlocks the door, or contains a code for a lock. The game falls very short of delivering a worthwhile story and manages to give the story it DOES have in such a slow and stilted manner as to hold no emotional value whatsoever. A large majority of the text could simply be skipped as it has no bearing on the story whatsoever.All in all, not worth even near $20. If you can get it on sale for $1.99 or such, it may be worth checking out. I wish it had been better, because a game that actually expanded on this story and had more substance in general would have been a great asset to sexual/gender equality in gaming.			"

												When I started playing I went head first thinking this was going to be some kind of horror/thriller. Not so much. The only thing that made me jump occasionally was the thunder clap in the background. After prowling the house for about two hours I found myself beating the game and feeling every bit disappointed. There were so many things pointing the gamer in the direction of a spooky game (books, notes, letters...etc), but there was nothing. I enjoyed the story and the setting, I thought it was fitting and very immersive. Oh, the things you'd find in this house! I felt like some left-behind entity that picked up on everyone's little secret. But it was so short lived! I would have loved to experience more time in this game, but I can't seem to put my finger on what exactly.			"

The ice cream would have melted all over the floor by that point if they decided to stop off and get food on the way home.And...that's it. There's literally nothing else to do. You play a couple of bad 90s era grunge songs, pick stuff up, and practically nothing else. The presence of a SNES in the pre-release videos (absent in the release game) could have offered up a cool little side game where you played mock retro titles, but that was a missed opportunity.Interactive Story - The interactive story side doesn't fare much better.***WARNING - BEYOND THIS POINT THERE BE SPOILERS***Throughout the title, there are five storylines that are revealed through looking at the objects that aren't random house junk. The first story is a bit of a slap in the face that centers around the Uncle that died and left the house to your avatar's father. There was discussion of occult events, mysterious deaths, an electrical inspector that couldn't find out why the the electricity randomly failed, and various occult easter eggs hidden around the house, from a creepy crucifix in a hidden room to the sister's, Sam, attempts to contact the ghost. The storyline abruptly ended about 20 minutes in and was never concluded, even if it was a simple ""yup, found the problem with the wiring, squirrel built a nest over some wires"".The second story is about Dad's career as a writer. It talks about his attempt at being a published author and his first publisher dropping him when the first two books of his revisionist conspiracy theory history failed to sell well. It talked about how he reviewed stereo equipment to make some cash in the mean time, almost out of desperation. It is implied that this drove him to alcoholism. A third book was agreed to be picked up by a conspiracy theorist publishing group, but there is conflicting information with notes from the Mom to the Dad about not giving up. Again, there is no resolution. Did he actually publish the work? Did it succeed under a different, more targeted label? Did he give up reviewing stereo equipment? The story line, again, abruptly ended with no resolution. Did he ever kick his alcoholism?The third story centers on Mom and a very brief overview of her life. A Canadian expat, she works for the forestry service. After performing well she was promoted to a supervisory position. This just ends here, no further information, just random background noise.The fourth story centers on the difficulties Mom and Dad are having in their marriage. There is very little information on this presented and all we know is that the reason the parents are gone is that they're at a counciling retreat. As a running theme, the story doesn't go anywhere and there is no resolution.The fifth and main storyline is about Sam and her life since your main character left for her European tour. She went through changing changing schools, dealing with rumors of living in a haunted house, discovering and developing her writing talents to the point she won a partial scholarship to a university literary program, and finding one friend in Lonnie. Over the course of their friendship, Sam begins to come to realize she is a lesbian and, surprise, so is Lonnie. They grow closer, to the dismay of their parents who think its just a phase. It touches on the pain, confusion and abandonment that growing up to discover your sexual preference is different and not seen as positively by others.Then it goes off and turns insulting to the entire LGBT community. Lonnie, being the first LGBT individual Sam ever met, are thus required to immediately fall into deep, true and lasting love. It comes off as ""you're lesbian too? Wow, we have so much in common, let's run off together and get married."" The entire story played out like a classic coming to terms with sexuality and the inexperience of youth, just from a LGBT point of view. Most people end up figuring out that the first ""love"" is anything but youthful inexperience of raging hormones creating an attraction to a different person. Where Gone Home flies off the rails is that Sam and Lonnie abandon promising futures to run off together to, who knows, a major theme of this story is ""give the audience information then leave them hanging"" as it, again, abruptly stops with a casette recording about how Sam decided to run off with Lonnie, Sam abandoning her college future and Lonnie skipping out on the Army that was her dream in life (it's not AWOL or deserting since you can back out any time without penalty before completing Basic). The story never even bothered to mention if that hysterical crying on the answering machine was before or after Sam decided to leave. Is Sam currently in trouble as you ignored the cry for help with a sister in real danger as you slowly padded around the house opening empty underwear drawers? Or did Sam not bother listening to Lonnie on the answering machine when she called Sam after her rather shallow, as the game information presents it, revelation?A much stronger story would likely have either presented WAY more information over a longer time period on the relationship between Sam and Lonnie that left little doubt that this was legitimate and not just a ""first time I'm mutually attracted to someone"" scenario or, even better, this. At the end, you go up into the attic photo development studio and find Sam curled up and crying over the loss of her first love. Your character then comforts her and promises to support her through this difficult time. A denumont would then discuss how, despite the fact that their parents never did approve, the emtional stability Sam was provided by her sister gave her the strength to take advantage of the scholarship and, as an older and more mature person, found her true soul mate in someone else. Kaitlin's support gave Sam the strength to develop a healthy, mature relationship with another woman that was built on common understanding and strength, no the ""you're the only lesbian in town"" presentation we got with the Sam-Lonnie relationship.So, really, even as an interactive story, it's not that good.I got it on a sale for around $2.50 or so. At the current (as of this posting) $20, it's a complete ripoff. Even at $2.50, it's hard to recommend this title given the poor pacing and story crafting. The lack of an actual game here is also tough to stomach.4/10 - good effort, but no follow through.			"

												Absurd!I finished the game in 80 minutes. 80 MINUTES. And they are asking $20 for it. It doesn't even have much in the way of music -- some ambient tracks and rain sound effects, and a few cassette tapes you find with pretty awful off-key indie music. The description states that you enter the house to find the answer to where your family is. You DON'T GET an answer to where your parents are. That makes absolutely no sense. What is the purpose of the game, then? A lot of walking, tipping over random objects for no reason, just to further an extremely cliche lesbian love plot. If the love interest had been a man, it would have been the most basic story ever told in a video game. I guess switching it with a female made the game edgey and inventive and brave instead of just being absolute non-effort rubbish.To be fair I enjoyed walking around and turning all of the lights on in the house. There weren't puzzles so much as simply scouring every room until you find the item that opens the next area, unlocks the door, or contains a code for a lock. The game falls very short of delivering a worthwhile story and manages to give the story it DOES have in such a slow and stilted manner as to hold no emotional value whatsoever. A large majority of the text could simply be skipped as it has no bearing on the story whatsoever.All in all, not worth even near $20. If you can get it on sale for $1.99 or such, it may be worth checking out. I wish it had been better, because a game that actually expanded on this story and had more substance in general would have been a great asset to sexual/gender equality in gaming.			"

												So I kinda found it in my library with no memory of ever buying this game. And I was like: well yeah, I might as well play it right now, it looks cool, so I just clicked play. And now: there's an empty house, everything is dark and storm I can hear storm outsite. Honestly, I was expecting some horror like game. Made sense. I did not get a horror hame, this one has nothing to do with horror. What I've got was so so much better - a peaceful, nice story told by the sister's voice. It was just so lovely and heart-warming, all nice and fuzzy inside. It's so worth it, just to go along and slowly discover how the family lives, what is happening. It's about two hours of just a lovely story that you discover slowely, putting all the pieces together. I'm recommending it so so much.			"

												A fantastic exploration-based story game. You play as a young woman named Katie who just arrived home from a year-long tour of Europe. You come home to an empty house that your family had moved to while you were away. As you begin looking around, you slowly uncover what has happened in the lives of your mother, your father, and most importantly your younger sister, Sam, while you were away.While another form of media may have been more appropriate to convey this story, the use of a video game still does the story  justice with its ability to evoke a range of emotions. Since the player unfolds the story at their own pace from the first-person point of view of Katie, the story comes across in a much more personal manner.			"

												IfI could give it a Meh score I would. That being the case I will have to give this a thumbs down. For me this was a good time killer as i interacted in a scenery that told a story. If you are looking for anything but a time killer, this is not the game for you.You play as a Katie, a girl who returns home from a trip. From there you must search your house to uncover the mytery of what is going on. You're pretty much free to waltz around the house and go through all the rooms. Unfortunately, there are no major plot points, or surprises to be found. You  go along searching for answers and well... that's about it. A couple of minor combination puzzles are here and there. You start to develope an understanding for Katie's family. That's about it.The game is what you make of it. I personally enjoyed it and looted the building down with a fine tooth comb. Though there's not a very deep story line you do get a solid sense of Katie's family life. . . Needless to say i was very bored when i decided to play this game and I feel you're going to have to be bored too or else you will be disapointed.I got the game in a bundle and I find the current 20.00 price tag to be a bit ridiculous. I'm sure the makers put in a lot of hard work, but the game is much to simple to warrent the price. I felt this could have made a better animated short story than a game. Maybe even an audio book... In fact, this is pretty much an audio book. There just needs to be MORE if that's the ange the creator would want to spin it.All in all... if you do get your hands on a copy of the game I hope you enjoy it for what it's worth. A simple interactive story.			"

												What a waste! The game's method of storytelling is amazing and top-notch, but the story it chooses to tell falls completely flat. Although the game  advertises itself as being played by the older sister attempting to figure out what happened with her family and thus makes the sister seem important, in actuality the game revolves around the younger sister, with only a few nods made toward the mother and father. The story could be summed up as her coming-of-age and how she finds herself, which is nice enough on the outside, but not all people who ""find themselves"" do so by making good choices. Without spoiling it, I felt as intrigued with the sorry of the younger sister as I would with the story of how a soldier got sent home by shooting himself in the foot.Graphically the home starts out wonderfully realized and seems like a house real people would live in, but by the end of the game the house is so vast and repeats itself so much that it starts to feel very static. And although the house itself feels vast, the game world as a whole feels small. And unfortunately that's all that can really be said about this game.			"

												I really liked this game. It's not a horror game (and doesn't claim to be), but it is scary. Playing this game is like being home alone during a thunderstorm and the electricity goes out and you tell yourself that there's nothing to be afraid of, but you're afraid anyway. And that's a feeling I've never seen captured in a game. What's more, the way the story unfolds, through small details and gradual exposition, is very well-done, and the characters are deep and well-developed (even though you never meet them). I was completely drawn in and am glad I played the game.For a more in-depth analysis of some of the themes, you can read my essay here: https://meganleeprose.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/gone-home-exploring-fear/ "

												Gone Home is a very slow game that forgoes standard gameplay mechanics in place of a strong but subtle story. You discover this story by moving through the environments of an empty house, hoping to meet your family as you return home from a long trip across Europe.The environments are full of little plots and clues, you pick up notes and letters, audio diaries and bits of tat from an everyday life, turning them over and examining them for the stories they might hold. Through exploring the house and examining the wealth of items inside, you piece together the mystery of where your family is.Set in '95, the game is steeped in little period details; VHS tapes, old TV magazines and X-Files posters, cassette tapes and more. The environments themselves suggest some of the stories that are playing out... events are crossed out in planners, dates scratched through or ammended on calendars, notes from family and friends hastily written and left on the side, discarded thoughts on torn paper lie screwed up in a waste paper basket. It's subtle, but it becomes a very powerful way of communicating the pieces of the story. Gradually you begin to understand the situation that has been unfolding in the house in your absence.The game never overplays its message, instead it handles it in a very mature, thoughtful way that really helped to create empathy between me and the characters.It's very slow, it's very short, and it's very powerful.

												Lovely game. I recommend you watch Errant Signal's review of this, I'll pretty much write a similar opinion to his.It's a nice game, and it feels like a refreshing experience because the gaming scene lacks such an experience. It's a breath of fresh air in between shooters and action games that dominate the market right now. It's good BECAUSE it's different. In a world where most games were exploration games with no threat, I don't think this would stand out.That being said, it's a pretty interesting experience. It looks good graphic wise and I can safely say, this is the most scary game without being a scary game. Seriously... it's not a horror game or actively trying to scare you, however the long empty dark halls really messed with my imaginations D:It's a nice game with a lot of subplots and some good exploration. you keep finding new things and the whole experience becomes more and more interesting (also some pretty neat easter eggs)I recommend this game because it feels like a breath of fresh air. If you are used to playing action packed games, you should take a break and try this.			"

												This is less of a game than it is an interactive story, but it is a very compelling and intriguing one and very well constructed. I'm not sure where all of the hate is coming from. Perhaps from gamers that have been conditioned to have a very narrow view of what games are, or can be. Perhaps from religious fundamentalists that can't deal with the context of the story, or perhaps just people that are so unused to character empathy and well constructed story in a video game medium that they simply can't comprehend it.As someone that grew up and reached adulthood in the time period where the story is set (1995), I found all of the references very nostalgic. I went in not knowing what to expect, just that it was highly recommended, and I don't regret spending the money on it.If you are a more mature gamer in your late 20s or 30s, you will likely really enjoy this experience. If you didn't grow up in this time period, or perhaps just have no attention span, imagination, or ability to empathise or be thoughtful and take things in, this will most likely not be the game for you.I really enjoyed it.

												Gone Home is an emotional tour de force everyone should try! It uses a horror construct to tell a different kind of story: a universal, timeless story that will leave a lasting impression on you if you allow it. The game is a labor of love and care of its creators, with simple, poignant and masterful writing, rich atmosphere and good pacing. A special mention goes to the two actresses who delivered an outstanding performance and made playing this game a unique and unforgettable experience. The amazing attention to details has helped in creating an atmosphere filled with mysteries and wonderment, as well as recreating the 90's, a period where this story is taking place, in a believable and breathtaking manner. The house itself is another important character in the story, as it slowly and gradually reveals the secrets and destinies of its inhabitants. The gameplay is minimal and in service of telling the story, and as such, future players should know that this is not Resident Evil, Zelda or Myst-like game. Gone Home is a mood piece which deals with various mature themes. It is a cleverly told story that will move you emotionally and remind you to cherish all the small, important things in life we usually take for granted. This game is an unforgettable experience which I heartily recommend to everyone. Two thumbs up!!			"

												Combat? No. Puzzles? No. Intrigue? Yes. Interesting characters? Yes. Great story? Technically, yes.Gone Home puts you in the shoes of Katie Greenbriar, who has at the beginning of the game freshly arrived home from a long trip across Europe. She finds her family's home empty, inhabited only by the shadows cast by furniture as well as fleeting shadows of the family whose lives have changed greatly since she last saw them. From the moment you, as Katie, step through the front door, the time spent inside the Greenbriar's home is dedicated to learning about your family, usually via picking up various little objects and observing the myriad notes and paper scraps littered about. You learn a lot about the people who live in this house just by observing the things they own, the things they created, and the things that are attached between and among each of them. Gone Home is part adventure title, part visual novel, and probably the purest method by which a video game can achieve in relaying a story to the player, without the need for traditional cutscenes or dialogue. Also very unorthodox is the story this game tells, which attempts to explore certain aspects of the human experience during significant stages of life, represented by each member of the Greenbriar family.Gone Home is a true gem among video game stories, and it's sort of an odd ball, at least in regards to the means by which it tries to tell its story. In regards to gameplay, it all unfolds in a fairly pedestrian pace. You look at stuff, you listen to stuff, you understand stuff. That's all there really is in terms of mechanics. In this sense, Gone Home has less going on than you average point n click adventure title, fps exploration game, or weird non-genre stuff like Ico.It's short as well, at about 2-3 hours long. Pretty much the length of a feature film. Don't come for the gameplay, come home for the ambiance and story. Well worth it.			"

												Gone Home isn't a game. It is a story in game format. And it wouldn't work on any other medium. The story and mysteries presented are nice and they leave some space for interpretation. After the story is over, there really isn't any replay value. It would be like reading a book for a second time.There is little to do besides finding clues and putting pieces of the story together. You wander around the house, take items in your hands, turn them around and put them back or toss them away.Gone Home isn't completely void of positive sides. It excels at creating an atmosphere. This is exactly what it feels like to roam around a strange house. I was constantly waiting for a jumpscare.If you really enjoy stories or if you have ""played"" Dear Esther or Trauma and enjoyed it, Gone Home is a game for you. Otherwise, don't bother.			"

												This is less of a game than it is an interactive story, but it is a very compelling and intriguing one and very well constructed. I'm not sure where all of the hate is coming from. Perhaps from gamers that have been conditioned to have a very narrow view of what games are, or can be. Perhaps from religious fundamentalists that can't deal with the context of the story, or perhaps just people that are so unused to character empathy and well constructed story in a video game medium that they simply can't comprehend it.As someone that grew up and reached adulthood in the time period where the story is set (1995), I found all of the references very nostalgic. I went in not knowing what to expect, just that it was highly recommended, and I don't regret spending the money on it.If you are a more mature gamer in your late 20s or 30s, you will likely really enjoy this experience. If you didn't grow up in this time period, or perhaps just have no attention span, imagination, or ability to empathise or be thoughtful and take things in, this will most likely not be the game for you.I really enjoyed it.

												Gone Home is an emotional tour de force everyone should try! It uses a horror construct to tell a different kind of story: a universal, timeless story that will leave a lasting impression on you if you allow it. The game is a labor of love and care of its creators, with simple, poignant and masterful writing, rich atmosphere and good pacing. A special mention goes to the two actresses who delivered an outstanding performance and made playing this game a unique and unforgettable experience. The amazing attention to details has helped in creating an atmosphere filled with mysteries and wonderment, as well as recreating the 90's, a period where this story is taking place, in a believable and breathtaking manner. The house itself is another important character in the story, as it slowly and gradually reveals the secrets and destinies of its inhabitants. The gameplay is minimal and in service of telling the story, and as such, future players should know that this is not Resident Evil, Zelda or Myst-like game. Gone Home is a mood piece which deals with various mature themes. It is a cleverly told story that will move you emotionally and remind you to cherish all the small, important things in life we usually take for granted. This game is an unforgettable experience which I heartily recommend to everyone. Two thumbs up!!			"

												***SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD***Okay, so, Gone Home was an enjoyable-ish two hours. Emotional story of teen angst which, gods help me, I have a soft spot for. HOWEVER, it wasn't a game. I repeat for extra emphasis: THIS IS NOT A GAME.It is, at best, a short story that takes a lot more effort than the average short story to 'read'. And I don't think I'd even have enjoyed it so much if so many years of fangirling hadn't made me very adept at developing headcanon as I go. A lot of the relationships between Katie and Sam and Sam and Lonnie I think was probably actually stuff I made up in my head as I went along. There is no strategy to this 'game', no challenge, nothing. It's not a game. For a while I got a reasonable amount of suspense from expecting Oscar's ghost or Katie's dismembered parents to appear, but I realised fairly early on that that wasn't going to happen. So, yeah, I liked it but it's certainly not worth the money. 1.6 hours, and that's going slow and opening everything, and basically no replay value.			"

												I just want to add my two cents here. I loved this game. I can see why other people didn't, though, but I'd like to try to defend it.Gone Home is narrative intensive, and it explores new ways to tell a story that are only possible through videogames. There are no guns or enemies, but there are plenty of puzzles. Here's the thing, though, while you do have to collect hints and piece them together, the game won't make a satisfying ""ding"" when you've found one, or give you points when you've reached a conclusion. It won't even ever tell you if the conclusion you've reached is the correct one. For most of the storylines, it won't even tell you what the puzzle was to begin with. It's up to the player to search thoroughly, find out that there is a mystery to be solved, then figure it out on their own, in their own head. A lot of people call this pretentious BS, but this is weird and I'm guessing it's exclusive to gamers, because other narrative mediums have been doing this kind of thing for quite some time. I don't believe anybody would call out a book for not telling you what to do with it, or not giving you an achievement for understanding it correctly.If you can't take a game with no game overs and no hand holding whatsoever, then you will hate this. If you're excited about games that experiment with new narrative techniques, then give this a go.And yes, you can finish it in under 2 minutes, but consider that your ""bad ending"", if you must.

												Gone Home is a pretentious, boring walking simulator that received glowing reviews for its ""groundbreaking and progressive"" story from biased journalists (some of whom were friends with the creators) who somehow didn't realize how boring and predictable this game's cookie-cutter coming-of-age plot is because they haven't read a book since high school. I really wanted to like Gone Home because of its atmosphere and premise alone- girl comes home from abroad to find her house abandoned- but the plot- the one thing that this non-game has to fall back on- quickly became predictable and unfulfilling. It never really goes anywhere, and you can already tell how it's going to play out just from the first couple audio journals. There actually are some interesting subplots involving the protagonist's parents and uncle, and I felt that they could have lent a little more depth to the story, but ultimately, they both take a backseat to the main story of the game, which sucked.This ""game"" did not surprise me in any way, and the fact that gamers are putting it on a pedestal makes me question those people. Is it because of the blatantly shoehorned LGBT themes that this game's fans can use against its detractors by accusing them of being homophobic, privileged♥♥♥♥♥♥lords if they didn't like it? That's certainly what it seemed like to me. Polygon gave this travesty of a game one of the few 10/10 scores in the site's history, and even named it GOTY 2013, putting it above that year's heavy-hitters like GTA V, Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us. The developers were also accused of banning those criticizing the game from their Steam forum. But hey, that's biased SJW gaming for you- about as truthful and honest as a Clinton on their best possible day.The way in which Gone Home conveys its story is certainly interesting- the house manages to tell its story through the papers, books, journals and other items of minutae strewn about, and with very little dialogue- but that's nothing new for the adventure genre. Hell, horror games have implemented readable journals and logs strewn about the game world as storytelling devices since the very inception of the genre. Imagine playing Resident Evil with no zombies and all the files, books and creepy letters were replaced with Lisa Frank folders, ear-grating riot grrl tapes and passive-aggressive Post-It notes. That's Gone Home in a nutshell. There is simply nothing innovative here.One other thing- whoever thought it was a good idea to charge $20 for a game that takes maybe 1-2 hours to beat on a blind playthrough and LESS THAN A MINUTE after that once you realize that all you have to do to beat this game is take out the panel to the right of the staircase that leads to the secret room with the occult stuff, take the key, go to the attic and read the journal should be institutionalized. I've heard about people accidentally discovering that area before the game tells them it's there, and that simply is not good game design. You shouldn't be able to unintentionally speed run a video game. I'd be royally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I bought this game at full price. But I spent $4 on it, and even that felt like a waste. Do not bother with Gone Home.			"

												Saw a recommendation for this game on a website. After looking at the website and Steam pages I thought it might be interesting. I enjoy good adventure/puzzle games and thought this might be worth a shot. When it first started out I thought that it had potential. You come home from a long trip to europe and find your family house empty. It's a cliche setting of a dark and stormy night as you set out to explore and see if you can learn what happened.The game play was mindless. You walked from room to room and were fed bits and pieces of the story line as you went. There were no puzzles/quests in the game. When they did not want you in a certain area or to know a certain part of the story line quite yet  they made you look for a key or combination. Finding these was no big deal, just keep walking around listening to the bits and pieces of the story and reading notes/letters until whatever you need is plopped in front of your face.As a story line... (spoiler alert - do not proceed further if you don't want to know the *meh* ending)... it was mildly interesting at best. it turns out that your parents are off at a couples retreat trying to mend their marriage and your sister has run off to be with her true love, a girl she met in school.This game only cost me $9.99 because it was on sale. I really wish I could get that back. Even more so I would love to get back the 114 minutes it to me to complete this game. I could use that time to do something more fun like clean the leaves out of my gutters.I really wanted this game to be good, I wanted to enjoy it but unfortunatly it just sucked.			"

												Not really a better way of describing Gone Home than a story exploration game.  The game's like if you took the ambient storytelling of Bioshock and removed the enemies and horror elements.  It's a game of exploration, discovery, and rifling through trash cans to learn about the family history.  It's exploratory storytelling in its purest form, and that's not for everyone.If it is your thing, Gone Home delivers.  It's legitimately one of the most touching games I've played.  The story itself is a fairly cliche 90s indie movie-type thing, sure, but it's all about the execution.  The loneliness of the setting brings home the loneliness of the characters, and slowly discovering what's going makes the reveal all the better.  I smiled at points and I got a lump in my throat a points, the game does a very strong job of summoning up involvement and emotions.It's interactive storytelling that actually uses interaction to its advantage, and you should play it if that's up your alley.  Play it now. "

Plain old empty house, nothing special in it. How on Earth could this become so successful? 86 on Metacritic, what a joke... I'm really angry about spending 3 hours on it.P.S.

Just when you think you know where it is heading, it changes. Ultimately it is a story about family, love and bringing things full circle.

												What a moving and original gaming experience.  While you won't find any guns, zombies or the usual gameplay you will however find a game that uses the medium to tell an original story combining aspects of the FPS genre with others to blast wide open what one can achieve with interactive fiction.  Don't buy this game expecting the usual guns and glory.  Buy it if you are tired of playing the same FPS game over and over and have an open mind to new ideas.  Ability to enjoy TV-style dramas will also help.  The story alone won't win awards, but the manner in which it is told would.It's also just the right length at only a few hours.  It's definitely not for everyone and I hope more games like this are made by this developer or anyone.			"

When I walked into the foyer of the house, I immediately thought I was playing a horror game with jumpscares around every corner. Since I'm kinda chickenshit for horrorgames, I played this game slowly and carefully, not knowing that there weren't going to be any scares at all.You can finish this game in 2 minutes, it took me about an hour, to make sure I didn't miss anything story-wise.

It's brilliant.When I started this game, I went into it thinking it was a horror game of some sort due to the creepy atmosphere and I can tell you it's not. There are no jump scares or monsters or anything. What you uncover is a beautiful story of your younger sisters self discovery. It's just fantastic.I've heard a lot of people call this 'Not a game'. I have no idea why, and if you do, how ♥♥♥♥ing dare you. it's got some simple puzzles and a lot of exploration. It's got no failure state, but it's not about that. It's about exploring, reading, uncovering stories, figuring out a mystery. The game also has a ridiculous amount of detail, you can read the barcodes on household products, read the ingredients in a pack of potato chips, examine cassette cases, play cassettes, find little drawings and easter eggs.So, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. But it's not for everyone (Obviously). If a 2-hour long exploration game doesn't interest you then don't buy it, and don't complain if you do. But, if the idea sounds even a bit interesting to you then BUY THIS GAME. it's just brilliant (And in my top 10 games of 2013).			"

												Gone Home has been the subject of much debate in the past months. The main question being wether or not it is actually a game. You don't shoot anyone, you don't have super powers, there are no zombies, and you wont be killing anyone.If you want to feel part of something however, Gone Home is for you. The game will consume you and make you want to find our more.Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, Gone Home is amazing. It imerses you completely in the situation in which you find yourself.  Gone Home takes the normal game conventions and turns them on their head. The game is fun and requiers you to think and find clues. In addition to that, the story of the various family memebers unfolds before your eyes, begging for more investigation.I highly reccomend gone home, probably one of the best games of the year.Ticklepants			"

												If there was one word I would describe Gone Home it would be ""misleading"". This inde title is highly acclaimed and has even won ""Best Independent Game"" for Spike's VGX (which may not carry weight depending on your point of view of the awards). Furthermore, the game sets a tone of dark mystery and eeriness, which would seem appropiate for a girl who returend to a new home after being away for a year. The issue comes that the ""hook"" of the game can grab a large audience but only satisfy a few in the end. Gone Home does a fanatastic job at presenting the culture of the time, as well as ""showing"" the story more than telling it with the help of journal entries, but the main story alone cannot supply the satisfaction from a $20 title that can be finished within 3 hours. There is no replay value; its a shut case the moment you finish the the game. It can be dissapointing, but the experience isn't terrible either. In fact, I admired it. There is a main storyline, but with a keen a eye the player can see that there are other hidden stories with the mansion, almost all entagled within a dark past. The simple textures and sense of exploration are reminiscent of past adventure games I would play as a kid, such as Nancy Drew and Myst. It's good to see something different, but it preys on it's well received reviews to garner the wrong audience, only for them to experince very little at all. This is the reason why you'll see mixed reviews on the store page. Its hard to recommend (or not reccomend) this game because of that issue, but if you're one for the genre, give the game a consideration when its on a BIG sale. If it isn't your type, dont bother. It's as simple as that.			"

												Gone Home is a very unique and compelling experience. If you're into exploration in video games, if searching cabinets in Bioshock or trying all the doors in Deus Ex is a thing you enjoy, then Gone Home has your number. Deeper than that however, Gone Home is an inspection into the little things of our lives. The out of the way stuff, the memories both discarded and kept which tell a story about who we are and what we care about. In so many ways it takes that classic video game exploration mechanic and turns it into an even more compelling storytelling device.It has flaws, sure. Some of the messaging can border on preachy, exploring for three hours straight might seem a bit tiring with nothing to shake things up and some household item placement can feel nonsensical. None of these issues get in the way of how powerful it can feel to explore someone's life in a completely unique way, though.When games like The Walking Dead get honored I wince a bit, because I'm not sure they truly represent how video games can pair both story and interactivity together to create a unique storytelling experience. Gone Home is the opposite, it embraces the ""video game"" medium completely while still focusing on story and emotional impact. As the revelations came, so simple and yet so profound given how deeply involved you become, I couldn't help but tear up and smile in equal measure. Can't say any other video game has had that effect, nor has any movie brought it about in anywhere near the same way as this interactive experience does.Play it.			"

												Critics appraised Gone Home for its incredible story which causes one to reflect on the weight of human lives, these critics were quite incorrect. I won't be spoiling the game rest assured; but the *clears throat* great story I was promised (which is the only thing this game has going for it) was mediocre at best and I've actually read many stories like this. It has been done to death in novels and movies. I like to do a small challenge with myself to see how few words I can sum up the story with. So far I'm at five, immersive rich story eh? Also for the price of the game the length simply isn't justified, one hour and eleven minutes is all it took for me to complete the story with all the diary entries. Now I know some people will be crying out to me saying ""You fool, the story wasn't just about Sam - there's much more to it with the parents and such."" And yeah there was, by the time I'd read four letters it was pretty obvious what was happening. This is a ""realistic story"" and it hits the realism to the point where it's generic, I guarantee you there are many teenagers who could write a better story than this. I know I'm not giving Gone Home any grace but frankly, I don't think it deserves any. As a game all you do is walk around, pop some secrets panels/doorways and enter two combinations for a locker and a safe. As a story, it's drab and doesn't end with a bang or a whimper - it ends with letting off a balloon in your lounge as it produces farting noises and lands in a crumpled heap with a plop. My advice? Buy The Novelist, it incorporates good enough game play and a much more interactive story.			"

												This game starts off pretty exciting.  It seems as if your arrival home is going to be marred with a mystery to solve ala the Mystery Case Files series.  After about an hour of exploring and clicking random objects/reading random notes, it seems as if this mystery could actually be pretty exciting and original.  Then about an hour later you get this creeping realization that you have been duped and you do your best to convince yourself that you are wrong and that there's no way the game developers would take such a shortcut and cheat their customers that way.  Then at about 3 1/2 hours in you realize you have spent the last few hours being a pawn on the LBGT community.  This is a terribly deceptive game and not only isn't worth paying a dime for but should never be played simply because of how it attempts to manipulate the gamer.			"

												I originally bought this game on launch but I must have sent the Steam key to a friend as I only had the direct download to play, so I recently bought it again...and I have to say, I'd buy it AGAIN because of how much I enjoyed it. Now, there are no laughs to be had, really, and there's no edge-of-your-seat excitement either, but what I did find is a story with a just-one-more-room grip on me, to the point where I actually fell asleep at 3am playing it because I couldn't tear myself away.The 3 ring binders, tissue boxes, highlighters and pens got a bit much until I stopped picking up every single thing, but Christmas Duck was fun until he turned out to be a murderer and leaving the skull by the final journal entry just seemed right. This game, from the outset, really did make me feel like I WAS the protagonist and had come home.20/10 would duck again			"

												I want to start off by saying do not pay full price for this.  Get this while its on sale! For five bucks I really enjoyed this ""experience""... It isnt really a game, more like an interactive story.  There are no puzzles (besides some combo's youll need that they pretty much spoon feed the numbers to you), no combat and you never see another ""person"".  However if you enjoy walking simulators, point and clicks and interactive stories, you WILL like this. If you dont  like those, want constant stimulation or if you think this is horror (THIS IS NOT HORROR) you will not like this. Take your time... it took me about 3 hours to finish the game and I took my time, reading everything and interacting with everything I could.  Take your time, read both the interactive elements and the non interactive. The whole point is to piece together what the hell is going on and where everybody is. I thought it was pretty interesting that by the end of the game you have learned so much about what is going on with not just your sister but also your parents.  Dont let the negative reviews deter you, but at the same rate do not pay more than 5$ for this!			"

												I really enjoyed this game, but I disagree that it's a masterpiece.It looks pretty good. The immensely detailed environment is the biggest strength for this game. Small words on stuff like heaters or books are readable, tons of little items scattered about, and the beautiful environment give it an incredible atmosphere. The music was very good. I'd definitely see myself listening to it outside of the game.But that's where my second biggest gripe is with this. It *feels* like there should be more to it. It feels like there is something sinister at play, like it's setting up for discovering the family murdered and their bodies stuffed somewhere or one of the characters committed suicide or something. The storm, the screwed up TVs, the secret compartments, and then the noises all make it pretty creepy. At one point (SPOILER) a light you turn on in a secret passage goes out when you're looking at a map of other secret compartments and that scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. Plus the sounds of footsteps and floorboards creaking are terrifying. If like I said previously this turned out to be a horror story or whatever the potential wouldn't be wasted. But nope. It's a lesbian love story.Now there isn't anything wrong with that, but it's disappointing. It was semi-interesting, but the way letters/narrations were written make it sound ridiculously sappy. And it was very confusing. By the end I only had a vague idea of what happened. I thought I was Sam the entire time because of her narrating certain points, but apparently you're Kaitlin. And who exactly is Oscar? I go to read the Wikipedia page's plot summary and there are a bunch of things I had absolutely no idea of.For example, direct from Wikipedia: (SPOILER) Although not necessary to unfold the main story plot, additional clues may be found which explains the background of Kaitlin's great uncle Oscar Masan, the previous owner of the house. In the way of letters, newspaper clippings, special dates considered important to numerous characters, and evidence hinting at the relationship between Oscar and Kaitlin's father Terrance, it is revealed Oscar committed a serious grievance within the family and was ostracized by Terrance's mother (Oscar's sister) as well as Terrance himself, suggesting that Terrance may have been abused by Oscar as a boy. Newspaper clippings reveal that Oscar had died in the house, and events the player encounters suggest the house may be haunted by Oscar's spirit.And then the main plot point: why the family is gone. It's explained why Sam her sister is not there, but why aren't the parents there? Why is every single cable/dvd player-like device unplugged from every TV?Most, if not all of the story is conveyed through reading pages, journals, notes, etc. but many of them are handwritten making it stupidly hard to figure out some of the words to the point where you're effectively skimming them.Still I enjoyed it overall. Why am I not recommending it then? Mainly because of the price and because of the stupid praise this has gotten. It's a good game, but 10/10 game of the year 2013? Polygon please. That's the year Bioshock Infinite, Don't Starve, Outlast, and Papers Please came out.This suffers from the same thing I hated about Depression Quest: I don't give one flying♥♥♥♥♥♥about the characters. The story is interesting and I was invested in the story, but I couldn't help but laugh at how the character sounded trying to describe the connection and love she had for Lonnie.""Oh you cis lord scum patriarchy you hate feminism and LGBT bad you racist."" No if it were a girl or guy saying the same things about the other it would still be inescapably laughable.Price is the other major issue. $20 for at the most 2 hours. $10 an hour. That's ludicrous. I got it for $4 so i'm okay with that.✔ Graphics✔ Atmosphere✔ Music✘ Story Plot✘ Story Conveyance✘ Story ResolutionOverallGreat setup to a sinister or horror story, wasted on a sappy love story.Disappointing, but enjoyable if you temper your expectations.

												I’ve been pondering on how to review Gone Home for a long time since I played it, because in general I’ve been thinking a lot about it.  And I’ve been thinking so much about it because this game is beautiful and I have never had such a raw emotional reaction to a videogame ever. So there might never be a time when I stop thinking about it…About when I first opened the game to play it in the middle of the night and then I was just so creeped out by the atmosphere and the strange noises that the house was making I just decided to leave it for the next day when the sun was up.  That’s how perfectly this game grasps that feeling about being scared of your own house at night when your own imagination begins to playing tricks on you. I would even say it rivals most horror games out there, despite not being one. Subtlety is something many videogames lack today and the gentle attention to detail in this game refreshing. Every objects has its purpose. Whether it's a large plot point, or a small nail polish bottle with a witty label, they all come together to make this large, almost mansion like building, into a home. About how Sam reminded me of myself, so much so that at the end of the game I was crying. Crying because I was happy that Sam got to do what I was so afraid of doing, and because she was so lucky to even find someone she could be with, and that someone actually made a videogame about my demographic, and not your typical straight white male protagonist with little to no personality.  Yes I am a queer woman who grew up in the 90’s, who’s a big X-files fan (Finally Gillian Anderson!), grew up with Lisa Frank products, and day dreamed about being a pirate. And yes there are other games with female protagonists, but not a single one of them I could relate to like this. They’re all incredible woman with amazing powers, but how many of them are just… normal?  This is a story about two normal girls doing normal freaking things that isn’t a Barbie adventure game, and it’s revolutionary for that alone and that is beautiful, but also a horrible reflection of what is seriously lacking in this industry, and that made me cry. After playing games for as long as I can remember I finally found one that I truly relate to.But you don’t have to be a girl or a lesbian to enjoy this (as some close minded people would like to proclaim). This is a game that exposes a family.  We’re finding their porn stashes, dirty diary entries,  letters of hopeful marital affairs, discovering the wonder and consumption of first love and exposing a dark family secret. This is an awesome point and click adventure and anyone who calls this game a clickateverythingfestwalkinglesbiansimulator has never had the pleasure of truly enjoying the genre. If they can’t enjoy this game I don’t think they could ever have the patience for classics like The Longest Journey and the Monkey Island series. This is a game that creates an amazing living environment. This is a game that creates dynamic unique characters. This a game where the narrative didn’t settle for the mediocre. This is a game that tackled real discriminatory issues. This is a game that dared to be different, and it deserves every bit of praise it’s getting.  And we need more games like this. More games that represent other cultures, races, genders, and people so everyone can have this wonder feeling of inclusion and immersion that’s just… awesome. I WANT TO BELIEVE that we can get more games like this.			"

												Gone Home is 2-3 hours of searching rooms until you have clicked on everything and then get rewarded with audio logs. Thats it. Nothing more. Is the story beautiful? Yes. But a short story does not make a video game amazing. I mean if this story was in book form it would be $8 and feature like 200 other short stories. But here, you pay $20 for 2 hours of gameplay that involves no gaming skills at all. Anybody could beat it. Due to the lack of challenge and actual gameplay, there is literally no replay value. Meaning it is nothing but a short, beautiful story about finding out who you are in the 90s. The fact that people keep listing this as a game of the year candidate is laughable.			"

												After completing this game I initially thought it was someones school project or an indie teams first game.  It is not.  I am not sure how much I actually paid for this game bc it was backlogged for so long but I can assure you however much anyone pays for it is too much.  The only price point this game deserves is free.  I knew the game was going to be short but its seriously 1hr max. The only reason it takes any longer is bc you will spend another hour trying to figure out if you somehow missed the point.  Reviewers are applauding this game for its story. They shouldn't.  When you break it down any short story, short movie, tv show, literally anything has a better story than this game.  It is laughably bad.  Just because your story revolves around young lesbian love does not make your story the ""greatest video game love story ever told"" ♥♥♥♥ you reviewer for the New York Times.  And I can assure you nothing about this story is ""Epic, personal and revelatory” ♥♥♥♥ you reviewer for Giant Bomb.NOTE: Time played reflects mining it for cards, bc I might as well get something out of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												COMBAT: there aren't any enemies to kill in this game so I can't really comment on the combat. you can pick up toilet paper and throw it though, and if you throw it at a photo you can imagine they're an enemy and that you're killing them by throwing the toilet paper at them. REPLAYABILITY: at the end of the game I didn't unlock any new game plus mode and i didn't collect any skulls or intel. i also tried putting in the konami code to see if i could do cheats but it didn't work. so maybe there's a secret mode you unlock in a drawer or something but i couldn't find it in my playthrough. and like i said there's no collectibles since whenever i picked something up i could only look at it. it didn't let me put all the toilet paper in my backpack.A.I.: i already said there's no enemies in the game. i don't know why but i guess it's ok. i was expecting to fight at least one ghost at some point so i guess i was pretty disappointed by lack of ghost AI.DIFFICULTY: this game is very easy. there's no ghosts to kill. you walk around a house and unlock doors and stuff, like in real life. i got stuck for a long time at one point because i thought you had to put the konami code into the locker to make it work but you had to find a piece of paper instead.MULTIPLAYER: my buddy came over and brought his xbox controller but nothing happened when he pressed start. i guessed there might not be competitive multiplayer but i wanted a co-op partner to look in other rooms so we could find all the intel or skulls or whatever since i was having trouble finding them. i did actually find a skull at one point but i think it was one of those mexican skulls and i dont think it would've given me a no shields gameplay optionOVERALL: i like this game, there's no enemies or guns (that i saw) but i thought the house was cool			"

												Have you ever wondered if someone could understand your teenage years if they broke into your house and embarked on a semi-destructive curiosity driven domestic rampage? Play as a girl who has come back from Europe to find her home abandoned during an astonishing storm. Wrestle to find light switches in pitch-black rooms, summon aetherial anecdotes of a life you never lived, rip cassettes of awful music out of cassette players in a search for your sister and discover why most homes have at least one torch in them.Gone Home plays like a Frictional Games title without the horror elements or the monsters. The gameplay is searching through drawers, boxes and hidden compartments to find keys and stories to understand what has happened. It’s a story game, and a rather invariant one at that; as far as I can tell there are no branching paths and no ability to alter any kind of outcome. It seems all story elements are available on the first run.Like many story games, it is hard to explain how I feel about this game succinctly without divulging the plot, but here is what I have to say:You explore a large American house in a storm, you are the only one there. Rifling through furniture helps you understand what has happened. A story is told of the ups and downs of the members of a small family. Your sister, who has disappeared appears to have carefully locked doors of the house to allow you to understand her life in sequence, touring you through the cultural resistances she faced as she grew up and realised where her heart was.It’s indeed a very nice story, told in a nice way. The graphics are wonderfully high-res and I have no qualms about the voicing.However, it’s short, very predictable (the plot is obvious after about 30 minutes of gameplay) and ends pretty predictably when it would be too hard to explain how the plot would continue. Although it has themes that are charming and fairly unexplored, it is still pretty pedestrian in gameplay and fails to really open out beyond what you experience in the foyer.It’s good, but I feel that there are probably indie games providing more and more interesting gameplay for £15. Braid, for example has just as much plot and a lot, lot more challenging gameplay and costs just over one third of the price.It's a good game, so I suppose I recommend it, but it's certainly not breaking new ground.

												It's not too often I go into a game with a certain mindset or assumption of what it is and I end up playing something that unravels in a completely different way... but Gone Home has completely blindsided me in this manner and has left me impressed.On first look, Gone Home seems to be a first person exploring horror title, not unlike titles like Frictional Games' Amnesia or Penumbra series', in which you're left to your own wit to solve puzzles and survive whatever evils are lurking around every corner. I started in on the game with this mindset and with a backdrop of a dark, seemingly empty house, raging thunder storm outside and hints at the house being haunted by it's former owner, it would seem to fit that very build. What unfolds is something far more interesting, touching and real.One takes on the role of Katie, an every-day American girl whom has been away on a trip through Europe, returning to her families newly moved into home to find it seemingly abandoned. Dropping her baggage, I begin to explore the house, picking through cupboards, reading notes, listening to answering machines as I look around for some kind of clue as to why none of Katie's family is around to greet her. The entire house is littered with little clues to the story, items to pick up and examine, some of which work into puzzles strewn throughout. Katie reminisces when she finds things from her life growing up with her family and more specifically her relationship with her younger sister, Sam.It's through Sam that most of the story unfolds, her audio journals speaking directly to Katie as if she was telling you the story. It's in this, that I began to suspect that the haunted house idea is indeed the 'soon to rear it's head' thing to deal with, with the death of the previous owner and the spookiness of the house is mentioned quite often. Later, secret panels, stairways and flickering lights give further suspicion and while it does indeed play a part in the over all story, it's much less than one would think. The real core of the story revolves around Sam and her life growing up in the area.Each of Sam's diary entries bring you closer to the to final point of the entire narrative and I found myself lost in the story that unfolds as I explore the house. Sam and Katie's voice over pieces are very well done and help to add validity to this real feel of the tale. I also found myself excited to recognize items throughout the house as things from my childhood. Things like VHS tapes labeled with movies like 'Ghostbusters', 'BeetleJuice' and 'RoboCop' or the abundance of 'X-Files' references. SNES carts housing fake, but very well done mock ups of games made me smile and Street Fighter II references are made all over the place (the Chun-Li fighting combo list was extra special). All of which kind of brought me back to the past and added yet another layer of realism for me.By the end of the game, I had spent just over 2 hours playing... which might be generous as I did explore quite extensively, making sure to read everything and listen to each audio log with great attention. It's not really the length of the game that matters though, but what feelings it stirs up and the way it gets you to weave your own visualizations of the stories that Sam unravels, which matters more. I found myself forgetting I was playing a game where I was exploring a house, concerned about spirits and other possible plot twists and instead felt as though I was reading a book that jumped around all of these experiences which Sam describes to her confidant, Katie. This, to me, is a lot more special and thus, more memorable than it would of been, had I played a game where I simply tried to survive some evil with my gaming skills.The game's writing, nostalgic embrace and extra care to make the game about the story and the characters, rather than the player's skill to stay alive has made me a fan. I liken it to a beautiful short story, than that of a larger winding narrative and more of an experience than a full blown game in the normal sense of the word, but if you open your mind and play it for what it is, you may just enjoy it. I know I did.			"

												This isn't a game.  It's an ""Interactive Drama.""Why this ""game"" has so many high reviews, I don't know - probably cause of people looking to push certain agendas (looking at you, Polygon).  What I mean by ""agendas,"" is that the drama tackles homosexuality with a girl going through her teenage years...and apparently by this simple component alone, Gone Home has garnered near-ubiquitous praise amongst the game industry's media elite.  I'm only guessing that the story alone is what has given Gone Home its acclaim...cause there's absolutely nothing else of the title to speak of.  I really don't get why a progressive issue in a ""game"" automatically results in it being placed on a pedestal - at least The Last of Us had some decent gameplay  (TLoU dealt with homosexuality in the form of a minor storypoint of one of the side characters in the game).  I would bet that if Gone Home hadn't featured a story  dealing with LGBT issues in it, it wouldn't have surfaced on anyone's radar.  Sure, the story is interesting alright (although personally, I couldn't relate to it and ultimately found it not to my tastes),  but for people to laud this as ""Best Game of the Year"" (hello again, Polygon), is ridiculous.  There isn't any replay value, there's no game mechanics to keep you engaged...it's not a game, it's a story told through the medium of you moving the character around a house until new story points are triggered.  Skyrim is a game. The Last of Us is a game.  Gone Home is not.If you don't have a good book to read, I guess I would grab this...but certainly not for $20 bucks.  Try and find a Steam sale for like two to five bucks, although even that feels a bit expensive for this title - I've been entertained by .99 cent apps on my iPhone for longer.			"

												I don't remember how I got Gone Home. It seems to have just one day appaered in my library, with its soundtrack, and the only thing I can really say looking back and seeing what it costs now is ""I really hope I didn't pay for this.""It's difficult to really describe what's wrong with the game: is it the cliche-driven plot, the bland cast, the completely one dimensional portagonist, the God-awful music, the numerous plot threads woven into the narrative and then apparently ripped out when dragging them through to conclusion became too difficult...there are a lot of problems.Let's start with the good, first, because I refuse to believe no art is without redeeming quality (well, except Inglorious Basterds, but I digress):The game is very nice looking. It's definitely a pretty game.Exploring the gigantic house is definitely interesting. Sound design is honestly very nice. The house and the objects therein (which are lovingly detailed) feel real. They don't look real, but they're plausible.Voice acting for the three characters with lines is solid. Since there's maybe twenty minutes of dialogue in the game, most of it from one character, though, that isn't saying much.Of course, obviously I didn't like the game and I don't recommend it, so here's what sways me solidly into the ""DO NOT BUY"" camp:The game starts off with a lot of very intriguing plot points. Not one of them actually goes anywhere. Early on you learn your character's mother is having an affair with one of her subordinates. This is touched on repeatedly throughout the game essentially any time you encounter notes pertaining to her, but the subplot is never resolved. Likewise, your father is a pulp-novel hack/failing appliance reviewer (which has got to be the most soul-crushing thing to happen to a writer, IMHO) who is slowly coming out of his slump and trying to fix his marriage. Will this work out? We have no idea, because no explanation is given, and both parents' plot lines seem to be in the game purely to explain why you and your sister are going to be home alone.Your sister is the game's real main character, as the entire story revolves around her. This isn't necessarily a good thing since, while she's never exactly unlikable, she's never exactly endearing or particularly interesting either. Her plot revolves around ""discovering"" (this I saw with quotes as it's fairly evident the first time you meet her) she's a lesbian and in love with her best friend. That's...kind of interesting, I guess, except Gone Home commits the greatest of all literary sins and proceeds to tell us all this, rather than actually showing it.Honestly, while the idea of telling a story through notes is interesting, I started to feel as if I was reading someone else's scratched out synopsis of another game rather than playing this one, and that's especially egregious because that plot is actually the only relevant one, and it has the most lackluster pay off of any game I've ever played.There's an entire subplot devoted to the man who originally owned the house you live in (he's vaguely referred to as your uncle, but that's it). He's left his home to your father, although this is never explained as he's either not his brother (which makes no sense) or your great uncle, which is irrelevant but fits the general nature of the game feeling bland and shallow. There are all kinds of references to him doing...something in the house and apparently now being dead because of it, except your sister and her girlfriend claim to have encountered his ghost around the house. What does this all mean? We have no idea, because this, far and away the only interesting plot in the game, is referred to right up until the end game only to be revealed as a giant red herring.Likewise, your character, Kate, has no characterization whatsoever. She has two lines of dialogue and a few internal monologues, but that's it; I have no idea who she really is or what she does because she's just a vehicle for the plot. You could just as easily be a drone flying through the house for all the relevance she actually has to the plot.If you really want to experience the game Gone Home could've been, I suggest trying the first episode of last year's Life is Strange instead. Dont Nod very clearly has played this game (they have similar UIs and basic mechanics), but LiS is all the way around a much more fleshed out experience, and actually worth the money it costs (and it has better music). The first episode is free and will probably take you about as much time to complete as this entire game, but with a lot more depth and character, rather than being artificially prolonged by the main character's irritatingly slow walking speed.That's my unpopular opinion for the day.

												I think it's a testament to this game's developers that I feel like I know this family as well as if I'd been living with them, and yet you never actually see a single one of them. It's also nice to see such a thoughtful portrayal of a young woman grappling with her sexuality without resorting to sexualization or sad queers being tragic.			"

												It sure is fun to play a point-and-click adventure game without any adventure or aspects of gameplay. Regarding story, it's pretty generic. The execution is somewhat novel, but only in the very specific instance of a lesbian teenage love story set in the mid 90's featured in a video game where the most fun you'll have is turning on a light.

But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you take Gone Home back now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.			"

												This is one of those games that lots of people would like to deny inclusion into the “game” medium.  Well I have a very liberal definition of game, so it gets a pass in my book.  “Gone Home” is an interactive storytelling experience.  It’s more interactive than “Dear Esther” but considerably less interactive than “Pac-man”.  Chances are you already know if you’re into that kind of thing, and if you are it would be best that you not investigate this game before playing it. Best played in one sitting in a dark room late at night.  About 2 hours.			"

There's SO MUCH potential, but it falls short everywhere.  It gives you a taste of character development with a lot of personal storyline for Sam, but fails to deliver any real depth while giving hints at a lot of exactly that with the parents, Sam, Lonnie, etc.  It really makes me sad how much more could have been done, and how amazing it could have been.  Maybe that's what the reviewers were referring to when they said it made them cry... wtf.			"

												I'm probably biased being a game maker, but I really enjoyed the subtle nature of Gone Home, the attention to detail, and the solidness of the game and its artwork. It left me guessing as to where everything was going right up until the end. My only two comments, without spoling anything, is that the subject matter felt like it had come out a few years too late and the experience was a little short for $20. Both of those aspect would not stop me from recommending the game and commending the Fullbright Company for holding to a vision that is different than your normal game.			"

												No, I didn't love the game. Yes I'm giving it a positive review. With the ""buy it on a sale"" caveat.Ignore for a moment the intense polarizing views that were created mainly because (perceived) expectations were not being met and let's view this game as what it is. This is an interactive story: video and sound together with some gaming elements (walking, point&click) are exposing a simple story in small increments. The subject matter (teenager-dom and gay love, peripherally touching on friendship, relationships with parents and divorce) is not original, but still underrepresent in commercial games, and for that it deserves praise. I personally found the central story relatively shallow and cliche, but I appreciated the way the game tried to create immersion by tying the storytelling to various types of every day items and types of communication. If you are an American who grew up in the 90s there are also some nostalgia elements you may enjoy. The controls are fluid and intuitive, the graphics are lovingly detailed and the sound effects are well done (though I didn't really get the unnecessary emphasis on creating a haunted house atmosphere with the sound design). Yes, I found the full price slightly high, but catching it on a sale should by now be easy.Interactive storytelling (really interactive, taking full advantage of the medium) is still at its infancy. This game is one more attempt at it. And while it's flawed, it's a stepping stone towards a  new genre of games. It gets a positive review from me, because it is good at what it sets out to do: create a detailed slice of the world of a specific family at a specific point in time. It is also a project of love and that shows in the details, and gets it some extra points as far as I'm concerned. So provided you don't pay full price for it and you understand what this game is, then yes, it can be an enjoyable experience.And here's a tip: I consider Papo & Yo a more succesful attempt at doing mature storytelling in an ineractive way that fits the medium. If you are interested in seeing a different take at interactive storytelling, give that one a go too.			"

												Concept - 5 -I thought this game was going to be some sort of horror story with maybe some puzzles and jump scares. I was expecting some mystery too. This game doesn't deliver on either, really. The idea of a story about two lesbians just seems boring to me.Graphics - 6.5 -The graphics in Gone Home aren't exactly stunning. Pretty average for a game like this, but still.Sound - 8 -Some solid voice acting that plays through the game. Along with some good ambient noises.Gameplay - 7 -What is there to say about the gameplay? You walk around. Pick stuff up. Stash it in your inventory. Average controls.Story - 3.25 -This part REALLY bothers me. The story is about the players sister. She is a lesbian and wants to be with her friend who is in the military. Maybe that'd make a good story if the game didn't just keep going over the same points over and over. Another thing is that through the whole game, you find all this creepy stuff about the previous owner of the house and even find a demonic shrine with his picture there. NOTHING else is said about this. They just completely do away with that part of the story. That gets to me. The advertising makes it out to be a creepy-ish mystery story but it just isn't. Just two lesbians.Overall Score - 5.5 -This game, or should I say interactive story, really didn't meet my expectations at all. I was hoping for mystery and maybe even some horror. I didn't want to be told a story about lesbians. I have trouble even calling this a game. There are no puzzles to solve and no challenge whatsoever. Not to mention the price for this game. I'd say avoid this one unless you're into hearing stories. "

It took me about 3-4 hours of playing time, so it's not a big commitment in that respect. There is no twitch factor. You won't level up. Five out of five stars anyway.			"

												To begin, let's get one thing strait -- this is not a ""game.""  There is no replay value, nor is there any character progression or consequences.  However, this is one of the best story telling adventures I have ever taken the time to enjoy.Like the game Dear Esther, you are basically wondering around and looking for plot points to progress the story.  Unlike Dear Esther, you are not stuck on a massive island.  The mansion you explore, while no small building, keeps the down time to a minimum and the story pacing intact.While this game did not have the visuals that Dear Esther had, the amount of detail that went into the house was stunning.  There was so much 90s nostalgia that I felt like I was swimming in it, and I loved it.  Tons of 3D modeling for you to pick up and examine.  The house felt so real, even though the layout is a bit odd -- obviously to help keep the pacing of the game right.The voice acting for the story telling, even though there was only one person, was spot on.  It was not over done, but it was touching to say the least.  It truly brought back those old feelings from your teen years.This is not the title to buy if you are looking for an exciting new fps adventure; however, if you'd like to see just how sensitive you are to your inner emotions, the kind that bring you back to the feeling of emptiness, loss and hopeful bliss, then you should take the journey that this game offers.On a side note, I took my time during my exploration and completed the story in three hours flat.  Given that I see no reason to replay this game, $20 is a whopper of a price tag: wait for a sale.

												This game is really boring. Don't bother.  It took less than two hours to beat. The whole game is just rummaging around someone's house and hearing snippets of a teenage lesbian's love story. And she only mentions making out once! The whole premise of the game seems a little creepy. There is no confirmation as to the identity of the character the player controls. It's assumed it is that of a family member returing home from college, but still...  and it felt invasive snooping through some stranger's personal business.  In conclusion, game sucks, don't buy.

It's supported solely by its narrative which came off to me like a copy of the dime a dozen young adult ""finding yourself"" novels that populate the halls of your local high school. The major plot twists of the narrative will be so painfully obvious to anyone over the age of 12 thirty minutes in that the experience of the remaining game is akin to sitting on train tracks and waiting for the world's slowest train transporting all the world's elephants to slam in to you.Interesting?

												For me, Gone Home is an easy recommendation. It's a great example of what it is. But, this won't be for everyone. This game does not especially play to the strengths of the medium, but for me it still adds up to a great experience in the end. This is not a horror game. This is not really a game, so much as it is a form of interactive fiction.It's a narrative game, like Dear Esther, or To The Moon (sort of). But, I think Gone Home takes the basic ""you're propelling a story"" mechanic, and delivers a more powerful story in a more engaging way. Gameplay could work, but the choice not to employ it half-heartedly like To The Moon does, is a good one I think.I think you're looking at 1-2 hours of time here, and you don't _do_ much more than interact with objects, open doors, and walk around. One way or another you're going to get the same ending as everyone else.I think for some people, this story will really connect and that will be the biggest indicator of whether or not you end up enjoying yourself. There is a great mood, a great atmosphere to the story, and that for me was enough to really be charmed.I think if you approach this game with the intent of reading a comic book, you'll probably end up getting more out of it than you would have otherwise.

												Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I recommend it? If you can enjoy stories about difficult relationships among parents and children, romance, and a hint of ghost stories, then it can be something for you. But don't expect an action packed horror shooter :)The game is, in fact, very simple. Imagine you come back to your home from a long world trip and everyone is just gone. It appears that you are alone in the house and you try to find out what happens. You walk around, read memos and notes hanging at the fridge, and at some point everthing comes together and the story starts to unfold. I cried in the end.After a while, I was close to just quit the game. But I continued and I didn't regret it. So, buy it if you want experience a great way of story telling and want to spend a day with a game. Don't buy it if you are looking for some big, fast action.			"

												Similar to the game Dear Esther, this game is all about a mediocre story told to you in pieces by walking around and exploring. Even though the 90's nostalgia is kinda nice for someone who grew up at the time, it's not enough to save this game. If you make a game like this with no puzzles, no real gameplay, you really need to deliver on the story and this game does not. As someone who really didn't enjoy Dear Esther don't make the same mistake as I did and think this is something different.			"

It's not a challenging, it's a story. I liked it. and plan on recommending it to more of my casual players. If you're not independent films or picky about stories, then this is probably not for you. If you're swept off your feet or easily moved, then get this without reading any other information or details about this game and expect a short film.			"

												Gone Home is....divisive and contentious, to say the least. At its core, it is a first-person visual novel, albeit with one or two items which are puzzles (needing passcodes for certain barriers) along the way. As you explore the house, a story plays out with a voice actress reading from a journal which fills in your character's family's backstory. The entire house is filled with tons of interactive items which you can pull out and inspect, and any child of the 80s/90s will likely get a ton of nostalgia from looking at them.This game is good. It has excellent voice acting, and the narrative is well done, if in retrospect very obviously crafted with certain ambiguity. However, for good or ill, a large amount of focus has been paid to this game both for the subject matter it deals with - homosexuality in an era slightly prior to today's (general) acceptance (albeit not from a legal standpoint) - and it's become the focalpoint for blowback from a number of those who feel this subgenre of gaming aren't ""real"" games and are somehow encroaching and lessening their hobby. This unfortunately makes a situation where criticism of the game seems to be automatically treated as criticism of the content and/or of the genre as a whole, which has generated a great deal of backlash in BOTH directions.The game is rather short - even taking the time to inspect nigh on every item in the house, you're looking at just under 3 hours, so the base asking price of $20 is too steep. This is worth experiencing, and a far better example of what this genre is capable of than Dear Esther, but it will generally not be what most people look for in a game. I give it a recommend, but on sale, and for my money if you're looking for something which is slightly more involved which also hits key emotional notes when it comes to family, you might want to check out Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons instead.

												I played through it on Friday night. You know what I like about it? It builds its world through all the items and reports you examine, similar to Metroid Prime's scans. There's that .gif of the guy finishing it in just a couple minutes, but he misses all of the story. About the wife's infidelity, the husband's constant struggle with publishing, and about the uncle and the house's storied history. And the thing is that each little story has a beginning, middle, and end. It's all rather nice, and I did enjoy examining every item. I also didn't mind the shortness of the game. Why would one judge a game based on how long it is? Because of how much money I paid for it? Just silly.Where the game loses my interest, however, is the main story. Maybe it's because I'm not gay, maybe it's because I've never been in a relationship, maybe it's because I was supposed to be some weird sister who has no character and examines every last inch of the house, maybe it's because the ending was kinda let down, but I just wasn't affected by it like I thought I would be. I don't understand why its story is getting praised so much. Yeah, it deals with a somewhat heavy issue, but said issue has no relevance today when homosexuals are being allowed to marry in every state. All the 90's references were kinda neat, though, and I did like how there was a new song on each cassette I found.I guess if you like examining things, are a lesbian/sympathize with them, were a 90's kid, and don't mind the short length, this game might resonate with you.

												An excellent 90's themed game with a story told through slow, controlled exploration. It may be criticized for it's lack of ""gameplay"" (whatever that means), but it's another one of those games that sacrifices traditional puzzle gameplay for something much more organic and straight-forward, similiar to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and to a lesser extent, Dear Esther (Dear Esther however does not have much interactivity at all). It simply uses a bit of interactivity to tell a story without unnecessary filler content. I think what's important to consider before playing this game is that: You have to play it in one sitting, and you have to pay attention to everything you encounter and read in order to reconstruct the narrative space, to understand the characters, their background and interests, to nourish empathy with these characters. It's not exactly a game for gamers. It's something that you have to make an effort to play (granted, not much effort at all), it's not a game that will entertain you after work. It's a game that contains a heartwarming message with many underlying themes. A tad of social criticism here, a tad of 90s nostalgia there. It's something that you should play when you have nothing else to do, and are feeling particularly adventurous, There really isn't much to say about the game, objectively. I can tell you that the graphics are just completely utilitarian, it has everything it needs to have and has a great 90's atmosphere that is likely to resonate well with anyone who grew up in the US in the 90s or even early 00's. And the game is just about 2 hours long. Which is ok, considering the price. Definitely recommend it for anyone who is patient and remotely open minded.  "

												Simple review: Recommended at the $5 price I got it for during the sale (and probably would at $10 too).  But, I would have a hard time recommending it at the regular $20 price - glad I waited.  Not to say that it's a bad game or story, because it isn't.  I actually think this is a breath of fresh air in video game storytelling.  But you get about 2-4 hours depending on how thorough you explore and not too much replayability after thatA little more thought/analysis (spoiler-free):  First of all, this house!  What a great atmosphere (even though it seems impossibly huge - this is what I would picture the house in the book House of Leaves being like - anyone?).  Creepy as hell sometimes - even though I knew that nothing was going to jump out at me.  What I think is great about this game is that on your little voyeuristic journey into the lives of the family (the entire story is told through journals, notes, photos, etc.) you will undoubtedly find some part of yourself in one or all of the family members.  Obviously, as an awkward 90s high-schooler myself, the nostalgia level is high and I related to a lot of it.  The struggles of the family members carry you through a wide range of emotions and make you reflect on events and experiences in your own life.  Something I haven't experienced much in video games.  As I approached the ending, my heart was pounding and many different thoughts swirled around my head as to what I was going to experience.  What happened next actually took me by surprise, but maybe it shouldn't have.I can understand the negative reviews.  It's easy to see the perfect scores and immediately expect this to be some earth-shattering epic adventure.  But it's not, it's far more personal, and I think that's something special in today's world of endless sequels and remakes.			"

												This is not a puzzle or creeper game with a story tacked onto it. This is a story told in the form of a game. The pieces of the puzzle are not McGuffins to collected or unlocked, but the personal histories and lives of the people who have lived in your house and of those who live there still. To this end, the game performs marvelously, requiring its players to use a different skillset and understanding than they may usually have the opportunity to apply, while teasing out the story of a house and the complex denizens within.  If you're looking for button-mashing and jump scares, look elsewhere. For those who enjoy mysteries or biographies, for those looking for something to prod their thoughts, or for those who are looking for something different in an approach to gaming, this will stratch your itch.

 Stop pretending that you were fooled by the games media I have some degree of sympathy for the initial backlash around the time of release, because admittedly 20$/€ seems a bit steep for that short a game and I'm saying this as a someone who really enjoyed it. However if someone claims that it's overrated or overhyped in this point in time, she's being highly disengenious, as it's hard to come across any positive feedback about it now and its critics are extremely vocal on the Internet. Same goes for the claims that people were mislead into thinking that it's a horror game or that it was promoted as such. I have no idea where this one even come from, because neither  promotional material for the game nor the game reviews couldn't have been any clearer that it's in fact a love story in a form of an exploration game. The mood was indeed creepy and it is such intentionally, but I think it's pretty clear from the onset that there isn't anything supernatural or truly dangerous going on. The mystery element of it served as a good initial hook, as you have a clear motivation to find out what happened over the last few months as the protagonist was in Europe and sends you an occasional chill down the spine when you feel that you're completely isolated in this alien environment.   Again, my perspective is that of someone who played it long time after the release, so I can't say if this held any water at first. All I'm saying is: if you say that you thought it's a horror game with a long campaign full of plot-twists and action in year 2015, you are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥  "

												Gone Home is a bit of a controversial title. The gameplay is not really what you call ""in depth"". Gone Home is a game about walking. And there have been a lot of those recently. And a lot people don't really like those. Actually, REALLY don't like those. Because of this, I would ask of you to consider: are you willing to play a game that consists only of walking around an empty house, looking at pictures and reading letters? I am. But I don't know if that's for everyone.One particularly interesting thing about Gone Home is the nature of it's content. The reason Gone Home can have little to no ""hard gameplay"" is because the story is not about something which merits it. The story is not going to take you into combat or even many puzzle like situations. (At best, we get exploration.) It's about a family in the Pacific Northwest. It's about a girl and her friend. It's about riot grrrl punk. It's the game equivalent to a sappy indie film. And I'd be lying if I said I don't get swept up in that stuff.My only complaint that I feel strongly about is the price tag. The game is pretty short, only about three hours on a casual play through. This makes a twenty dollar price tag too high, to me. For that you can go to a movie and get some popcorn, or go to two movies and go smell popcorn. I strongly advise you to wait for a sale.So, with that, we have Gone Home. Sincerely endearing and enjoyable, but simply not worth twenty dollars, and simply not for everyone.			"

												Critics praise this game to heaven, ""regular"" players have mixed feelings.I saw a lot of good and bad about this game, so my thoughts kinda tearing me apart, if should i buy this game or not. Flash sale got best of me, and i decided to give this game a try - fair chance to show, what it is this fuss about.Gone Home is point clicking game, you play as Katie who just came to her sister's house, from trip around Europe in mid '90s. Gameplay is simple. You basically walking around, and you revealing ""mystery"" why is no one home, and what leading to this.Thru letters, books, posters you discover engaging story about Sam (sister) and her girlfriend Lonnie. You will learn about their happiness, struggles, love, pain and you will be part of their relationship from beginning till the... i won´t say.Game itself might feel boring for some people. But i really fell for story telling games, where you don´t have to shoot hordes of zombies, sneaking behind enemy lines or racing thru the streets, for games where is script and story what comes from it the greatest thing.Besides story I admire amazing voice acting, and atmosphere  to be honest most of the times i felt really tense, that something jump on me, and I expected much different/darker end.  , visual side is a big pro as well. I went through Gone Home in hour and it was splendidly spent time and right after finishing it i am really hyped and i added this game to my personal TOP10 Game list.Seriously give this game a chance. Grade: AP.S. But ... yes there is a also but, minor for me, major for others ... honestly i feel regular price is bit exaggerated. I know art have some value, but i feel this is too much, and if i buy it for 20 € i can´t tell if my game experience would be the same.			"

												Gone Home proves that a game focused on story and exploration, starring a decidedly non-traditional cast of characters can be utterly thrilling. With excellent writing and environments that made me want to explore every nook and cranny, Gone Home proved the significance of a powerful storyline in a game, providing an in depth experience that doesn't need extensive combat  to make a game succesful effectively drew me in. Gone Home presents us with a game that both embraces that melancholic notion while simultaneously exploring the roots, secrets, and artifacts of a family that feels as real to me as my own. Stepping foot inside of the Greenbriar home and discovering the things they left behind is a powerful experience. Gone Home is a remarkable achievement, and piecing together its poignant story that left me over joyed because it was so relatable to my own experiences and personal life.			"

												Story isn't that bad, is narrated pretty well and the only voice actress is good, but overall it's hard to even consider this as a ""game"". The only thing you do is going around an empty house to collect a dozen of letters and books, and hear what happened to Sam. No puzzles, nothing else, a whole bunch of useless items to pick up since they don't have any purpose, that's it. Discovering the rest of the family side-stories are as interesting as reading logs or notes from a random character you never see in, like, ANY other game.It's 1,5-2 hours long, with no replayability whatsoever, so paying more than $2-3 for this is literally a legalized theft, supported by the press who makes player think this is a.. I can't even say it.. a ""GOTY"".The sole reason this game is praised is because of the politically correct theme it decided to handle, a theme that you can't un-praise, in a clever and somewhat slimy operation to gain easy consensus, thing proved by the fact that the developers tend to ban users and lock/delete threads who dare to move even the slightiest criticism on their ""perfect"" game.

												Remember when Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize?That's a bit like what's going on with the gaming press and Gone Home. This thing came along, and it represented the antithesis of all the other crap going on in gaming— a thoughtful, emotional game designed to pass the Bechdel Test from the word go— and the press treat it like the second coming of Jesus.This isn't a negative review. I liked Gone Home, the story, the heavy, deliberate tactile feel of interaction and exploration, the music tapes, all great. It moved me, I think you should play it. Gone Home sparked some conversations about games that we really need to have. But Citizen Kane it ain't, GOTY it ain't, and $20 is asking a bit much for the experience.So to close my super-tortured metaphor, Gone Home is a lot like Obama. A breath of fresh air, a step in the right direction, but a Nobel? Come on.			"

												This is a very touching story which you can walk through more than it is any kind of game per se. Interactive fiction is a better term, except that wouldn't convey quite how Gone Home can affect you emotionally.If you would like to experience something that feels more personal and immersive and warmly human than the average first-person effort, then give this a go. The voice acting is of such a high standard and the layouts and scene-dressing so well thought out and there's enough visual personality to give everything a lived-in sort of feel, so that if you let it this game can be more like a favourite book or indie movie. Speaking as a six-five thirtysomething Englishman it sounds ridiculous, but everything is put together so thoughtfully and sympathetically that while you're playing you feel quite connected to the teenage, female, lovelorn protagonist. It's got to be really good to do that, right? Especially when her taste in music is so ropey...Having said that it is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ short.			"

												First off, this game will only take you around two hours to complete, and there isn't much reason to touch it again, so keep that in mind. I wouldn't buy it for more than $10. Second, this is one of those love it or hate it affairs. I couldn't tell you which, since I hated Dear Esther, which is a similar title, but really enjoyed this game.Now, without spoiling anything, I will say that this game (some might argue it isn't one, but I won't get into that) offers a very interesting experience that you won't find through any other medium. You experience a story told through notes and audio scattered around, and it is up to you to piece things together. There are several side plots that are more nuanced than the main plot, and I would advise you to really take your time while exploring to make sure you don't miss anything. Some of the story is told through the scenes in various rooms of the house, things that are linked to the notes you find, but might miss if you aren't paying attention. All in all, a great experience in my opinion.			"

												While I do reccomend this game, you need to get it on sale, because it is very short. It has a nice story, well I use the term story loosely. I may have missed a few things, that are important, and there is a lot of boring notes too, I can't say it's perfect but if you can get it really cheap ($3 or less) and feel like spending an interesting hour. Then get Gone Home.			"

												I loved the story of gone home, but it will warn those that dont know that there is very little gaming involed. I think of more as a point & click style adventure game, where you look around, grab some items and go back to the first place to use them. I dont think I would hav got the same investment in the story just watching it, so it is more game than movie but i understand thats theres plenty disagreement out there.Overall it took me 2-3 hours to complete so if you see it on sale for a price youd happliy pay for a dvd, pick it up and give it a go.

Inherit the Earth Quest for the Orb, I have no Mouth and I must Scream have actual puzzles and good writing, this has neither.I was waiting for the game to become intersting, but it kept going into irrelevent conversations that happened to be the main story.

												Gone home is a game where you walk through a house for two hours listening to a girl talk and reading. It is arguably one of the greatest video game love stories and one of the best games I've played. The music is amazing and fits the theme of the game perfectly, the voice work is fantastic and guides the game beautifully, the mystery of the main story and the assorted subplots define Gone Home like few other games have. 10/10			"

												I normally don't mind the ""walking simulator"" types of games, as they can be a genuinely interesting method of storytelling. In the case of Gone Home, however, nothing of interest is said or experienced. The game combines a seemingly foreboding visual and audio design with a terribly mismatched story told via collected notes and household items. Ultimately, Gone Home brings nothing to the table aside from the diary entries of a teenager, which are not worth experiencing.			"

												When I first heard of this game, I was very excited. Kotaku advertised it as a game built around environmental storytelling, the likes of which made games like Bioshock and Fallout very enjoyable. Instead of true environmental storytelling, however, the player is ""treated"" to literally nothing but audiologs. It reaches a point where I might as well have just purchased a movie because all you do is walk around the house, pick up objects, and listen to a teenage monologue. The environments themselves don't even make sense. One location in the house is a TV that is still on with VCR tapes of the X-files lying around. It creates a sense that something happened suddenly to the characters, but you later learn thats impossible so the TV was either on for days and no one shut it off, or it was just placed to set a rather inappropriate mood that fits nowhere in the plot. The whole point of environmental storytelling appears to have been lost on the developers, who seem to beleive notes and audio messages are somehow the same thing as meticulously creating a scene that contains an implied story. Thats the thing about environmental storytelling, you're not supposed to use words.Other than that, the game doesn't have anything that makes it feel special. It has zero replay value, the story is experienced so passivly by the player it might as well have been a movie, and the game itself is barely 2 hours long. I've purchased games for less than a dollar that delivered more content than this. For $20, you can buy multiple romance novels that each deliver a longer, more enjoyable experience than this, so if you're looking for a sweet love story, run like ♥♥♥♥ away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Very few games have ever disappointed me as much a Gone Home did. After reading all the critic reviews of how amazing this game is and the interesting description for the game, I had fairly high expectations. The description for the game leads you to believe there will be an interesting mystery as you arrive at your home and no one is there. I really expected a game where I would be at the edge of my seat trying to figure out the answers to the mysteries of the game all the way up to the very end. This obviously didn't happen. In the first 10 minutes of the game, things are quiet interesting. Trying to figure out where everyone is and why no one is home keeps you in the mystery of the game for a little bit. However, after searching the house and progressing in the story, Gone Home quickly becomes less and less interesting. Not only does it become increasingly annoying to move around the house, because your character is incredibly slow (I swear she is part snail), but not even half way through the game you will figure out the entire mystery.[Spoilers below](Once again, spoilers) Really, the mystery isn't hard at all the figure out and once you do, you will be disappointed. The big GIANT reveal is that your sister is just a rebellious teen that has run off with her lover. After about the half way mark of the game, once I figured it out, I kept thinking this can't be it. This cannot be the amazing mystery critics raved about. I was wrong. It was the entire mystery. Even as a story on it's own, it's nothing unique. Almost every single teenage that has ever lived has gone through a rebellious stage. Many run away just like the main character's sister. It happens, it's nothing new or intriguing and it is especially not something worthy of making a mystery game over. If the story was to realistically progress, I guarantee that the main character's sister would be back home going to school. She may still dream of what could have happened, but it was a stage. She will grow out of it. In the story, she talks like she is special and that she truly has found her true love and what she plans to do for the rest of her life. However, this is exactly how all teens in the rebellious stage feel. This part of her story isn't special or unique. After her hormones balance out, things would change. It's a cycle of life.My expectations were crushed by this uninteresting and easy to figure out mystery game. Gone Home: The Snail Simulator is one of the few games that I am ashamed to have in my steam library.			"

												Gone Home is a unique game released in 2013 for windows and in 2016 for the Xbox One and PlayStation Four. The main character, Kaitlin, has just returned from a year long trip around the world, but when she gets home, no one is there. Then the game begins and the player has to explore the house looking for clues to what had happened, and why no one is home.This whole game revolves around this mystery, leading to some interesting storytelling. In a way the whole game is almost like a detective game. When searching the house the player will find different items, such as books and notes that they can read. Everything in the game world can be picked up and manipulated. I’m not going to give anything away here, but when I figured out what happened in the year that passed, it blew my mind. After learning more, I started to relate more to Sam, Kaitlin’s sister. It enlightened me as to how a  specific group of people become who they are. It is rare for a game to become so understandable, and relatable so quickly. Needless to say the story is really well done, and the main reason for playing this game. Every member of the family has something unique and interesting to learn about, with secrets hidden around every corner.The design of the house is really intriguing. It feels like there are remnants of the past everywhere, that are just waiting to be explored. Although, it does seem a little bit big for it to be a normal house. This is forgivable, because everything that is in the house is really interesting to explore. The game is anything but linear. Since the entire game is based around searching for clues to the past, players will often find some things others did not, or have a relatively similar, but different experience.Despite all of these amazing factors of the game, there are many flaws. For me personally, these flaws do not out way the overall good of the game, but for some they might. To begin, the game is not a traditional game. There are no enemies, monsters, or any real antagonist. As you would expect this leaves the game with very little tension between characters. For the most part, the story is primarily told from Sam’s point of view. Depending on how you view storytelling, this could potentially be great or awful. For me it worked, but I felt that it was very one sided, especially with the audio logs. Everything that is there is really inspiring, informational, and emotional, but to me it would have been interesting to hear more audio logs that were not part of the main story. There are many side stories that could have been fleshed out more.Additionally, there is a great deal of reading. Similar to Phoenix Wright, your experience with this game will greatly depend on whether you enjoy reading a lot of text in games. To me, this game seemed a little too reliant on text. Without much tension I found it hard to engage with the game at times. I would get bored because there was not much to do other than reading. I think more audio logs would improve the quality of this aspect of the game and make it more interesting.Another, major flaw of the game is its lack of time and replay value. The game only lasts about two hours. It took me only an hour and a half to complete, but yet the developers are charging twenty dollars for this experience. This would be fine, if there was some replay value, but there is hardly any. After I finished the game, I had no intention of going back to play it again. It is good, but not worth playing again. Because of that, this game is definitely not worth the price. I got it on sale for five dollars, and that is probably the most that I would pay for it.The game is good for what it is, but very few games justify the price of twenty dollars for only two hours of content.Overall, the narrative and storytelling in this game are great, but all of the problems that come with it may cause the game to not be worth it to some people. For me this game is an interesting and creative spin on traditional methods of storytelling. Additionally, I think that this is an important game for the community as a whole, because of its strives to turn the tables on traditional methods of interaction and storytelling. However, because of its many flaws and oversights, I must give this game a two out of five. That is not to say that it is a bad game, just one that will only appeal to a niche audience. Your experience with this game will ultimately depend upon whether you enjoy new and unique ways of storytelling, a lack of enemies, and being able to piece the story together with little help.If you like this review check out my blog.

												Gone Home isn't perfect, and it's a game you need to be patient with. It's a short experimental game about a house and a family, mainly about picking up the pieces. It's short, and perhaps not perfectly cohesive, but you can see what the Fullbright Company are going for in their first game. If you're willing to engross yourself in this house, you'll find a level of detail and attention to care that most game don't even consider. If you have qualms paying more than $10 for a 2 hour game when you can get 1000+ hours playing a free-to-play game, that's fine. But you are not going to find an experience like this for a while, especially concerning it's subject manner in a medium where violence is a main means of interaction. If you can't get past the premise, then avoid. But if you can open yourself up for a quick, new experience, give it a shot.			"

												I began this game thinking it was a simple mystery game. Perhaps the sister lost her phone or her car died on her way somewhere. It involved so much more than I expected. Rummaging your way through a lovely house in your search for clues on where your sister is or what could have happened to her; finding secret passageways; unraveling the maze of locked doors and hidden truths. Gone Home addresses so many different and relevant topics in society. Great play with a fantastic soundtrack.			"

I recomend it specially if you enjoyed games such as Echo Night or Penumbra (Even, when GH is not a horror game).			"

												This is a beautifully simple game.  I found the narrative to be well-paced and intimate, the characterizations realistic and relatable.  The game is filled with plenty of clever little jokes and tidbits; I was genuinely interested in reading every little scrap of paper I found (heh, look under all of Dad's books).  Without going into spoiler territory, I was actually nervous about what I would find when I finally went to the attic, and needless to say I was not disappointed.The narraration and the score were perfectly done and fit the mood of the game perfectly.  As for the experience of the game, I feel it would have been more accurately placed in the interactive visual novel genre rather than in adventure.  Perhaps then players wouldn't be so miffed by the slower pace and lack of action.  If that isn't a genre you enjoy, then you probably shouldn't buy this title, but if it's something you're open to, then I would highly encourage it.I can understand people's complaints about paying $20 for such a short interactive story.  So, if that's the case, get it when it goes on sale.  But do get it.  It was my older sister (living across the country) who gifted it to me, and I found it a wonderful gift.I look forward to playing through it again with the commentator's mode turned on.			"

												I really enjoyed this story and saw a lot of potential angles throughout it that made me want to explore more and more. I was taken back to my youth playing Earthbound for the first time, reintroduced to the reality behind others, how alien we truly are to one another.The story telling is laid out well and it does not matter how you progress. There is never a lack of information to base a game theory on. If you enjoy exploration and you aren't put off by short games, this is a must buy. There is a lot of story crammed into a little space. My advice: If you buy this game, take your time with it. Read the details, speculate and get engrossed in the story. This is an experience not meant to be washed over on time trials.			"

												This is a conditional recommendation. If you're looking for the latest iteration of Kill Simulator 9000, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you're looking for intricate, heavy puzzles, you're also in the wrong place. If you're looking for a horror experience, you are approximately 98% in the wrong place (I dunno, a big, empty mansion is kinda creepy, plus some of the things revealed about the previous owner's life are a bit unsettling, but there's no jump scares or horror here- just some mild discomfort).First off, don't think of this as a game. It's almost like a self-guided graphic novel, if that makes any sense. Secondly, as someone who was about the same age as the protagonist at the time this game takes place, this was a huge nostalgia trip- some good, some bad, some sad. I remember people being into the bands that are name-checked (and on cassettes) throughout the game. Hell, the ""hanging out with someone because they have an NES"" mention struck a chord with me because I did that to someone (poor lass).Without spoiling anything- you've just returned from a big trip to Europe. Your folks moved to a big new mansion while you were gone. You pick up the spare key, let yourself in, and find the place empty. Your own voice is on the answering machine. You thought your sister would be here to greet you but she's nowhere to be found. You find a scrap of paper, and then the game plays a small piece of narration from your younger sister Sam. Explore the house. Find out what's been going on with Sam, your parents, the eccentric great uncle who owned the house originally, and why the house is empty.This is a story/time capsule, told through the mechanics of a first-person video game. It's quite good at that. It's not a video game in the usual sense, and that will throw a lot of people off. If you were a 90s teen, or like the idea of a game engine being used to tell a story, get this when it goes on sale. As of this writing it's $2.39 US and worth that- I can't think of a comic book that's cheaper than that these days.TL;DR Gone Home is a novella told through the medium of a first person exploration game. The story is the core, not the gameplay, and it's a fantastic snapshot of mid-90s pop culture (they really did their homework in terms of accuracy). If that sounds interesting, pick it up when it's $5 or less (I feel that it's a bit too short to justify the full $19.99 price tag).			"

												This game is a great example of why video games are art. However, it is a very short game, and there's not really any replay value. There are a number of hidden things to find, but nothing amazing. The story is absolutely worth the admission price if you get this on sale.			"

												For an appropriate audience this game would be good though some may say gone home has a shallow story, bad gameplay, not worth your money,etc. For me it was actually a really fun experience, and a change from all the games that constantly demands you to play in their pace. Again, i cant recommend this to everybody because it might not be their liking but to a few people i know this will be enjoyable and worth while.			"

												Veeeery short indie exploration/story based game. Graphics are mediocre as the story wich is the main problem here. You see ,for a game that only selling point is it's story I think it's just weak and not really intresting. It even didn't took me an hour to beat this game!!! That's not good for the price you have to pay for it (20 Euro). If you are intresded in this game i think you should watch a full gameplay or just story explanation. I strongly recommend watching secret theories because these are intresting. But overall it's a let-down.( A note I have played this game to the end but some crash occured that have earesed my full progress on this game.)			"

												This game is NOT worth $20 USD, and I'm glad to say I got it on sale. Its story is unambitious and incredibly straightforward, and even when I tried to take this game slowly and ""savour the story and the edginess and the indieness"" I still finished it in about an hour and a half. If you want an edgy indie game that has few mechanics, play Journey. If you want a game that lets you uncover the story, play Papers, Please. If you want a point and click story, play The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among us. This game is simply a disappointment and does not live up to the hype in my eyes.Maybe if you were born in 1980 and want some nostalgia, and you have money to spare, this could be the game for you. I just don't like it.			"

												Remember when Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize?That's a bit like what's going on with the gaming press and Gone Home. This thing came along, and it represented the antithesis of all the other crap going on in gaming— a thoughtful, emotional game designed to pass the Bechdel Test from the word go— and the press treat it like the second coming of Jesus.This isn't a negative review. I liked Gone Home, the story, the heavy, deliberate tactile feel of interaction and exploration, the music tapes, all great. It moved me, I think you should play it. Gone Home sparked some conversations about games that we really need to have. But Citizen Kane it ain't, GOTY it ain't, and $20 is asking a bit much for the experience.So to close my super-tortured metaphor, Gone Home is a lot like Obama. A breath of fresh air, a step in the right direction, but a Nobel? Come on.			"

												A realistic own home exploration game that only focus on telling you family stories on top of putting nostalgic items from the 90's for display. For myself, the main story are not as interesting. In fact, it gets predictable the further you go so there's not much surprises. Game-wise, it's very casual which could easily bore you. If you care about the game play, and storyline means nothing much to you, I won't suggest this game.I like the game as it is, but I'm not sure I enjoy it enough.			"

												Incredible story telling. The extent to which this title is a ""game"" is certainly debatable. I would describe this as a first person exploration story. Each of those three words describes the three basic elements of the game.The setting is key, and although it's occasionally ""spooky"" or ""eerie,"" it's not really scary, and in fact, all of the mid 90's cultural artifacts are really fun. I even found a copy of what I can safely assume would have been my favorite SNES game had it ever existed.Of course I'm not done yet, but like a good book, I'm already enjoying it immensely and can't wait to get back to it. The story itself unravels as you explore this home, and although it's mostly linear, good stories usually are.Update forthcoming:Just finished. Evidently, I was very close to the end before stopping. Probably best enjoyed in a single playthrough, which isn't too tough to manage. The story was certainly interesting, but not amazing in its message. The experience of ""discovering"" the story was a novelty crucial to the game though, and one I definitely enjoyed. Decent story, but incredible story telling.			"

												Gone Home is a more of an interactive story than a game. Similar to A Stanley Parable and Dear Esther, it is demonstrating that a game can be used as a way to tell a story and nothing more.In this case, the game doesn't deserve a lengthy review, and if anyone is looking for a game in this genre, then the two games mentioned above, would be the best ones to play.The environment is very well done, and you really feel a connection with the characters due to all the little details scattered around, but the entire time you're expecting something big, or you feel like you're getting closer to where the story really starts, or the climax, but instead the story ends before anything really starts.It felt more like a concept/prototype and is definitely not worth the full purchase price. At maybe $5, it may be worth your time, but even then there are 1000s of indie titles that you haven't played yet, I'm sure.2/10			"

												Gone Home is an indie game by The Fullbright Company that may be short, but is a great experience that I feel people should give a try. The story and atmosphere in this game is amazing and will keep you wanting to play and find out more about the story. I can see why Adam Sessler has made this his personal game of the year of 2013.There isn't really music in the game other than the tapes and record you find around the house to play. The sounds that you do hear really help with the atmosphere, especially if you immerse yourself in the game. The graphics of the game are pretty good for being an indie title. The gameplay is pretty basic. You just walk around the house and click on items and explore. While you do this, you find out more and more about the story. The game is pretty short, so I recommend taking it slow. Explore the house fully and try to immerse yourself into the game. It makes the experience better.I didn't really find many issues or bugs in the game, which is great. The only issue I had while playing the game was my anti virus not letting the game display properly. The anti virus I used was Avast and if you use the same anti virus, I recommend deleting it before playing the game. The game is only about two hours long, so you can just re-download Avast after you finish it.Even though I thought the game was great for what it was, I cannot recommend paying full price for it. Twenty dollars is quite a lot of money for a game that is only about two horus long. I got it on sale for less than seven dollars, and I felt that price was more fair. If I had to give this game a rating, I'd give it a 9/10.If you are interested, I recommend watching this interview that Adam Sessler did with Steve Gaynor who was the designer for the game.Interview:

Anyone growing up in the 90's will recognise the references, and more importantly the tone and feel of the era which is faithfully reproduced. Critics playing the ""not really a game"" card are missing the point here - what it lacks in guns, experience points and violence it makes up for with an oozingly atmospheric, horror film-inspired storyline that plays as much with gamers expectations of genre than any piece of entertainment - game or otherwise - in many years.A truly original piece of interactive entertainment.

												Summary: Those who have been numbed by action shoot 'em ups need not apply. It's a pure narrative based game, and if you can't appreciate it, don't bother. Those who can will find a genre defining game.Gone Home is very much a love it or hate it game. It basically boils down into how much work you put into it. If you go straight for the end, ignoring the rich sub-narratives that are littered throughout the game. The game is very short, 2-3 hours depending on your level of exploration, and the voiced narrative can be listened to in in about 15 minutes. BUT. The game is wonderfully detailed, designed to look like a real house. That's an endeavor that takes a lot of time for little details like power cords for lamps. Most items that you could logically pick up, you can pick up. Mostly this is pointless, but it adds to the immersion. You are a real person, given the choice to ransack the place looking for clues or respecting the house. A fair amount of these items reveal sub-plots. Others can be interacted with, like listening to casette tapes. The plot is, of course, 100% railroaded. But if you let it, the wonderful voice acting and heart warming story will bring you to tears.			"

I was taken back to my youth playing Earthbound for the first time, reintroduced to the reality behind others, how alien we truly are to one another.The story telling is laid out well and it does not matter how you progress. There is never a lack of information to base a game theory on. If you enjoy exploration and you aren't put off by short games, this is a must buy. There is a lot of story crammed into a little space. My advice: If you buy this game, take your time with it. Read the details, speculate and get engrossed in the story. This is an experience not meant to be washed over on time trials.			"

In the case of Gone Home, however, nothing of interest is said or experienced. The game combines a seemingly foreboding visual and audio design with a terribly mismatched story told via collected notes and household items. Ultimately, Gone Home brings nothing to the table aside from the diary entries of a teenager, which are not worth experiencing.			"

Kotaku advertised it as a game built around environmental storytelling, the likes of which made games like Bioshock and Fallout very enjoyable. Instead of true environmental storytelling, however, the player is ""treated"" to literally nothing but audiologs. It reaches a point where I might as well have just purchased a movie because all you do is walk around the house, pick up objects, and listen to a teenage monologue. The environments themselves don't even make sense. One location in the house is a TV that is still on with VCR tapes of the X-files lying around. It creates a sense that something happened suddenly to the characters, but you later learn thats impossible so the TV was either on for days and no one shut it off, or it was just placed to set a rather inappropriate mood that fits nowhere in the plot. The whole point of environmental storytelling appears to have been lost on the developers, who seem to beleive notes and audio messages are somehow the same thing as meticulously creating a scene that contains an implied story. Thats the thing about environmental storytelling, you're not supposed to use words.Other than that, the game doesn't have anything that makes it feel special. It has zero replay value, the story is experienced so passivly by the player it might as well have been a movie, and the game itself is barely 2 hours long. I've purchased games for less than a dollar that delivered more content than this. For $20, you can buy multiple romance novels that each deliver a longer, more enjoyable experience than this, so if you're looking for a sweet love story, run like ♥♥♥♥ away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												It's difficult to really tell well a lot of the best reviews for this game are negative, I think it's mainly because the game is short (1.1 Hrs it took me to complete, and I was distracted) and usually sells for an astronomical £14.99. Another reason could be that it seems like a horror game and really isn't, a bait and switch in that regard. I paid £1.79 on sale and was very happy with the game, it put the chills up me and had a enthralling story that I wanted to discover more of and finish as soon as possible. My only wish is that it was longer, since I finished the game before receiving a single card drop.I'm fairly certain I'll replay this game since it's easy to finish in one sitting for a short entertaining experience (Interactive film perhaps?). Grab the game if you catch it on sale, but at £14.99 I'd steer clear.			"

												Amazing Awesome game with fine attention to detail. Give it a hour and half and just explore as the story unfolds, very much like Dear Esther in the mechanics/style of gameplay (slow with little reveals peppering it) but requires more hide and seek with journal entries/papers. You'll have to puzzle out the lives of this family of the main character and the rescent goings on through the paper/homework assignments/letter etc. It tells a simple story but does a great of letting it unfold at a natural pace. I caught it on sale and it was definetly worth it.			"

												A pretty interesting exploration game. While it does not have puzzles, or a deep story, the way it unfolds is enjoyable. The game takes a couple hours to play. It could of been deeper/better.. add some puzzles, and a bit more with some aspects of the story, but worth a couple bucks in a sale if you are into this sort of interactive style of story telling.

												This is a game for people who like going around exploring, taking their time, looking into every closet, drawer and box to see if there's something there to add to the story. It's not for everybody, but I liked Dear Esther and Serena, so this was my kind of game. I liked the story, but the ending falls a bit flat. Also, there were parts in the story that could have been expanded.I got the game from a sale and I recommend you do the same. The full price is too much considering the length of the game.			"

												This game is so amazing. The way all of the elements work together to draw you in is something I haven't seen in any other games. The less you know going in, the better. So much of the fun is being able to explore and draw your own conclusions.It's the sort of game where, after you finish it, you wish you could forget everything so you could play it again for the first time.

												This is a beautifully simple game.  I found the narrative to be well-paced and intimate, the characterizations realistic and relatable.  The game is filled with plenty of clever little jokes and tidbits; I was genuinely interested in reading every little scrap of paper I found (heh, look under all of Dad's books).  Without going into spoiler territory, I was actually nervous about what I would find when I finally went to the attic, and needless to say I was not disappointed.The narraration and the score were perfectly done and fit the mood of the game perfectly.  As for the experience of the game, I feel it would have been more accurately placed in the interactive visual novel genre rather than in adventure.  Perhaps then players wouldn't be so miffed by the slower pace and lack of action.  If that isn't a genre you enjoy, then you probably shouldn't buy this title, but if it's something you're open to, then I would highly encourage it.I can understand people's complaints about paying $20 for such a short interactive story.  So, if that's the case, get it when it goes on sale.  But do get it.  It was my older sister (living across the country) who gifted it to me, and I found it a wonderful gift.I look forward to playing through it again with the commentator's mode turned on.			"

												THE GOOD:Simplistic controlsIncredible storytellingMysterious allureFitting graphicsVoice-actingTHE BAD:ShortReplay value minimalSUMMARY:There's not much I can say about this game without giving everything away and ruining the experience for anyone who reads this. All I can do is attempt to justify what seems to be a highly debatable topic: The price tag. Yes, it's starting out at $20. The game's roughly three hours max if you take your time and explore, and there isn't much for replay value. There's no action, fighting, stages, complex puzzle-solving, multiplayer, experience meters...nothing. You're in a gigantic empty house the entire time. And yet...this is easily the most memorable game I've ever played.Gone Home is an experience, an intriguing adventure that sucks you in from the moment you open the front door to your family's newly acquired, very expensive, house. The exploration, the development, the sheer volume of things you can pick up, observe, and help clue you in on why you've ended up in an empty house...time will surely fly as you investigate your surroundings. The game encourages you to look around with an interesting setting and style. Dark and stormy night in the mid '90s, the previous owner's life ending there; It pulls the player in from the get-go.The Fullbright Company, a team derived from a group of developers who worked on BioShock 2, form a story that is well, Oscar-worthy. Yes, $20 is a lot to ask for considering the length of the game as well as it being a one-time playthrough, essentially. But the investment is far worth it if it means this company can bring out more titles as enthralling as Gone Home is. The work put in to match the setting, to pace the game in such a way that you'll not want to put it down, it's simply magnificent. [I'm aware that I'm going around in circles with my recommendation, but that's because I am afraid of giving things away.]Some wouldn't even consider this to be a game considering there's ""nothing"" going on, but the curious ones, the ones who look past what the general consensus of what a game should and shouldn't have, the petty debates about what makes a game a game, will without a doubt take a liking to Gone Home. A game has many different merits to it, and Gone Home focuses on a mind-blowing story, feeding the player bits and pieces throughout their journey to uncover the truth. The brilliant voice-acting helps keep the game going, chiming in at just the right moments.You're free to wait on a price drop, the game isn't very demanding as far as specs go on PCs, either. But I encourage those that want a different flavor of ice cream for a change, a different sandwich than the usual turkey you get on lunch break, to indulge yourself and play this game. People have been arguing the ""game is/isn't art"" subject for a long time now, and certainly, Gone Home can bring people to believe it is.I'm a male in my mid-20's, and I've been gaming since I was three years old. Why am I mentioning this? Some games have taken storytelling to the next level, making us care and driving our emotions. A select few have come close in leaving me in such an emotional state. But there's a new milestone, a milestone that was reached on August 15th, 2013: The release date of Gone Home. It's managed to make my usual tin-man state into a...slightly not-so-tin-man state. And I'll leave it at that.I gave this game a 'perfect score,' but disclaimer: It obviously doesn't mean this is a flawless, perfect envisioning of a game that everyone will enjoy. But personally, this game has resonated with me upon completing it, and it's a feeling that'll last for a long time. That's the replay value people cry about, the mark it leaves. That's what makes it deserving of a 10/10.New York Times stated that Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told. And that sums up my thoughts on the game better than I could.			"

												I just finished the game. I had to take a minute to let it all sink in. I knew this was a game I wanted to write a review for and give this Steam Review thing for a spin. This game isn't for everyone. I couldn't imagine my younger brothers finding any enjoyment in it with their twitchy two second interval attention span, but for anyone else, this game is fantastic. It's slow, but a relatively short game, clocked in at about 4 hours played when I finished the game and I'm pretty sure I looked at every nook and cranny. The game is a story exploration game. You get home late after a year traveling abroad in Europe and expect your family to be there to greet you, but you come to find no one is there and you spend the entirety of the game looking for your sister. The game has so many wonderful details and the ongoing main story is so well thought-out. There are two other smaller storylines that go on in the story but mostly you're unraveling your sister's story. Through this story though we are painted a very human picture of the family as a whole; how the parents were, how you were and how your sister was. Its just stellar writing and some of the most human writing I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a video game.The game is all about the story and is extremely light on mechanics. There really isn't much going for it here, but that wasn't the point of why they made the game the way they did. The picking up of objects, twirling them around and putting cassettes into tape players all works just fine, but again it's nothing to be excited about. These are all just pushing the narrative forward and I'm totally okay with this.I love the way the game looks. It's not a Crysis or Battlefield game as far as visuals go, but it's perfect for what they were trying to do. The house feels like a real place. It's also creepy as hell when you're walking through the damn thing. Every part of the house is so well done. The floor plans, everything. It really does feel like the ""Psycho House"" in the middle of a forest in 1995. They really nailed the feeling of the mid-90's. The music in the game is also incredible. The original score is ominous and powerful. Every time you hear the journal entries a different song plays from the creepy score that plays normally as you walkthrough the house. The cassettes that you pop into the tape players are also awesome songs, they are very reminiscent of the time period and are from local bands from where the game was made (a basement in Oregon I believe). The voice acting is also stellar in the game. The entries from the journal are so well done, they are filled with emotion and really are conveyed on to the player. It's all very believable.Overall, if you have the attention span for it. Pick up this game, its fantastic. It's a breathe of fresh air in a world filled with Call of Duty's and Battlefields(They have their place). I'd give this game a score of 9/10.			"

												Gone Home is an interesting game to review, largely because as a story driven game revelation of too much plot detail is likely to spoil it. As a game, it's simple enough. It takes the exploration methods of first person games, rpg and shooter, scatteredd notes and audio logs, and builds from them a game reminiscient in play style of a point and click adventure. It's a very nice synthesis and one which works extremely well, but at it's core there's nothing new about picking up notes and piecing together the story for oneself. The elder scrolls has been doing it for ages now. Gone home's real breakthrough is to prove that such a game is possible as a game in it's own right and not as a hidden segment of an elder scrolls or bioshock game only the determined and curious will ever really find or finish.The plot itself is interesting. Video games are so often a bastion of bizarre plots which exist to justify the game that a game which exists as purely an exploration of a drama is still refreshing and surprising. That the drama in question is often extremely mundane, the type of general fiction which games rarely explore, marks a subtle but important expansion of the types of stories games are capable of telling and the types of experiences games are able to share.Overall, I don't think the game is for everyone. At less than two hours long it's certainly not for the type of person who worries about the hardcore and the casual as divisions of gamer, nor will it suit someone who cannot sit through and appreciate the occasional cinematic drama. But I still think it's an interesting game and would recommend it to anyone who feels that games are capable of being more than their stereotypes, and can explore more themes than those of interest specifically to straight male adolescents.

												This game was recommended to me by a friend online, and I was skeptical at first, but this game really grew on me.  It's a short game, without any real replayability - but that's not what kind of game it is.  This game is an immensely personal experience, almost as though you're peeping into a conversation you're not supposed to.  Without actually intereacting with any of the characters, you learn so much about these people and how this family functions - everyone's personal hopes, fears, doubts, and faults.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys well written characters, well written stories, and doesn't mind a game making you think and feel something deeper.  This was a great game to experience.

												This game is not worth your time, or your money.  This was the biggest waste of $20 I have ever spent.  I would hardly pay 99 cents for it.  The story was ok but it is juxtaposed with a strange horror/thriller esthetic.  I bought the game thinking it would be a suspensful mystery game, an idea I gained from the game summery, but soon realized that I was very wrong.  Any hope of playing an intersting, thriller, exploration game quickly dissolved into an hour long grind through an  angsty telling of a young girls transition into a punk rock lesbian  .  Not that there is anything wrong with that but if you are going to tell that story make sure it is an intersting one.  And if you do, don't trick people into thinking they are buying a mystery game when they are realling buying a punk romance novel.			"

Fico pensando se o jogo fez sucesso pelo momento em que foi lançado, em meio à propagação da aceitação da comunidade LGBT.O jogo teve alguns momentos aleatórios onde houve uma redução no framerate, mas poucos.Se ele fosse mais longo, seria ideal, mas foi uma boa experiência.

												(I'm going to attempt to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but that's kind of hard, since some of the reasons I love this game so much are kinda spoiler-y.)     Where do I even start with this? I was pretty skeptical because of all the negative reviews this got, but I picked it up on sale anyways. I was already pretty aware of how part of the story goes, thanks to some spoiler-y things online, so that was a bit of an incentive. What I wasn't aware of, though, was the actual ending. Watching this entire story unfold was great! No, this is definitely not the game for you if you're expecting enemies, combat, bosses, or jumpscares. This isn't a horror game. It's definitely got a spooky feel to it, though, which is really nice.     On the topic of the story, I really saw a lot of my friends and myself in this game. The strong teenage emotions, the parents that just don't understand, the feeling of needing to rebel against how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ society is. You basically get to unfold how the sister, Sam, dealt with all of this. It's hard to be more descriptive without giving away a huge plot point.Okay, I'll just come out and say it, if you're in the LGBT+ community, you'll probably at least somewhat appreciate the story in this game. Even if you're not, there's still a good chance that you'll enjoy the story.     The main reason I see people♥♥♥♥♥♥talking this lovely game is because of how the media handled it. Apparently it was overplayed, oversold, given reviews that were ""too good."" Honestly, if you're just bitter because of politics and/or ""game journalism,"" you need to get that♥♥♥♥♥♥outta here. Let people praise this game if they want to.     Do I think it's worth $20? Ehh, that's debateable, which is why I played it safe and picked it up while it was on sale. If you happen to catch this for like ten dollars or less, I'd say go for it. Give it a try. Just don't go in expecting hardcore action or anything spooky happening or whatever. This is a game about exploration. It's a 3D interactive storybook. If you know that before getting into it, you'll be much more satisfied.TL;DR: Good exploration game with a lovely story that gave me butterflies. Price is meh, so you might wanna grab it on sale.

												I sincerely wish I would have looked at the PLAYER reviews for this game before I bought it.  I'm glad I only wasted a few dollars on this when it was on sale.  As an exploration game, I did like walking through the rooms and looking at everything.  But, I wasted a LOT of time picking everything up and trying to see if it would work with or combine with other objects (like matches with candles).  WTH is the point of being able to pick up hundreds of objects, but (barring lightswitches and cassette tapes) only a couple of them in the entire game actual DO something???  I did not realize this is some teen coming of age storyline.  (UGH - again, I should have read the player reviews...)  I did know it's not a horror game, but I really thought there might be a little more creepy stuff in the game, particularly concerning the uncle that had recently passed. I also don't understand why the VCRs and game consoles were gone, but the TVs and stereos were left there.  Yes, it's so you can play the cassettes, but come on.   Money is money and they would have taken more of that stuff to pawn off...  The only really believable part of the story is the parents saying they went camping, but actually going to a marriage counseling workshop/retreat thing for the weekend...			"

												Gone Home is one of the best examples of the walking simulator genre. It has a single story it wants to tell, and it tells it well. More importantly, however, it sets up an atmosphere and a world that is worth exploring every nook and cranny to get as many details as possible. While there's one overarching story, there are plenty of side stories that all add depth to these characters and their relationships with each other. These character moments cover the whole emotional spectrum: I often found myself laughing one minute at a silly detail that made the characters very real in my mind, only to feel heartbroken minutes later by one of the background stories and the context it brings to the whole venture. I won't bring up any particular story moments since this game is best explored without any knowledge of what to expect, but I will say that every additional detail you find is rewarding. Completionists will find an extra level of depth that makes the experience feel satisfying.When I played this game, I was living abroad in Scotland for University. The story of our protagonist coming home from school only to find the house empty and having to put together the details for herself...yeah, that hit me. I carried myself into the game, and I was rewarded for it with a story I still remember years later. If you enjoy this style of game, do yourself a favor and get it already. It's absolutely worth it.			"

												I've seen some negative reviews for this game, but mine won't be one. Those saying that the walking&touching game is a waste of money are just missing out a new trend in game industry, which is the walking simulator. In ""Dear Esther"" you take in the gorgeous island landscape with its ocean, sunset, hidden caves and waterfalls. In ""Gone Home"" you have a grand old house all for yourself to explore, really creepy and squeaky at times, and at some points you almost expect the old uncle ghost to jump out at you. This is not a puzzle game, nor an action or a scaretale. There's no dialogue. It's all a story, threading from room to room while you're collecting dots and trying to find where your parents and sister have gone. The story is more about the sister, though, who we get to know through her notes, books and schoolbooks, horrid music tapes, tales she wrote, her photos and feminist brochures. It's a game to relax and think, reflect on the characters' fates and the issues they raise, deduct their past and present and accept it. It's like visiting a friend's home when he or she is away and only things can tell stories. So yes, I do recommend this game, and I thank the developers for a beautiful, very 90s, Twin Peaks-ish, Walt Whitman-ish and Life Is Strange-ish ride. I got this game during a promotion, so no regrets here either. We do pay to go watch a movie, don't we? So here's a good one!			"

												*What is Gone Home? - a bread-crumb trail simulator!*Is Gone Home scary? - No....the only thing scary is the atmosphere (empty house, middle of the night, no lights on, & heavy storm outside), suspicious notes, and your own imagination of the unknown...*How long of a game is Gone Home? - short, my personal playthrough clocked in at a little over 2 hours.*What does Gone Home try to accomplish? - tell a story to the player...that's about it!*Do you recommend Gone Home? - Yes....when it's on sale...Gone Home would be best descrided as a vitural installation piece (much like Thirty Flights of Loving or Dear Esther) that tells a story via a trail of notes and pages littered throughout the house you walk through (the bread-crumb trail).  As you follow the trail, searching for notes, pages, photos, etc. you'll discover where and what happened to your family.  From time to time, narration from your sister will play as key notes are found thourghout the house.  The house is full of 90's memorabilia, intended for nostalgia, which I can't deny being a nice touch (since the story takes place in 1995).  The focus of Gone Home is a story through and through.  I found the story to be solid in what The Fullbright Company were trying to accomplish (a bit campy at some parts, but solid).  The voice acting is solid and believable, invoking suspicion early on, and later going down the romantic route (think more the ending/last episode of Friends; 90's referrance, see what I did there? :P).Gone Home is not a game for everyone.  If you take it for what it is, you will find an enjoyable (if short, with very little replayablity) story to be told here.  The story is not placed directly in front of the player's face, but chopped up and scattered in little pieces giving it a unique story-telling method (this being the most-likely cause for Gone Home's critical reviews).I would recommend trying Gone Home... when it goes on sale.  It is a very difficult to recommend this virtual installation at full price, under the basis of the story alone and evaulating the ""consumer's playtime versus game cost.""  I personally enjoyed it, it was short, but I found myself going through it, wanting to know what would come next in the story and continued to the follow the bread-crumb trail.  It has an interesting story-telling mechanic, that does what it attempts to accomplish well.-Try it-Play it-Enjoy			"

												For me, this game was a real indulgence and I enjoyed every second of it. The atmosphere is perfect, and the storytelling is intriguing. The leveI of interaction is quite good for a storytelling genre and I found myself taking notes and trying to unravel the family secrets as I played. This genre may not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy story exploration and mystery type games I highly recommend it. The only downside for me was that it was too short, but I will be playing though again soon. So in my opinion, one super sparkly thumb up :D			"

												Gone Home is a more of an interactive story than a game. Similar to A Stanley Parable and Dear Esther, it is demonstrating that a game can be used as a way to tell a story and nothing more.In this case, the game doesn't deserve a lengthy review, and if anyone is looking for a game in this genre, then the two games mentioned above, would be the best ones to play.The environment is very well done, and you really feel a connection with the characters due to all the little details scattered around, but the entire time you're expecting something big, or you feel like you're getting closer to where the story really starts, or the climax, but instead the story ends before anything really starts.It felt more like a concept/prototype and is definitely not worth the full purchase price. At maybe $5, it may be worth your time, but even then there are 1000s of indie titles that you haven't played yet, I'm sure.2/10			"

												The production values are incredible and the method of storytelling works great for the first 40 minutes of the game, then gets a little tedious near the end which involves a lot of back tracking. I recommend this game assuming you get it on sale for at least 66% off, otherwise the high price will likely leave a bad taste in your mouth. This isn't among the best interactive fiction I've played but it's worth a shot.Oh, and I'm not a fan of the soundtrack being a separate purchase. The music files are already in the product people purchased, they shouldn't need a separate purchase to listen to them conveniently.			"

Throughout the story we get to know them and why they are who they are. The 90's pop culture references add to the atmosphere in the game. The amount of detail is mindblowing. And if you dig deep enough, you'll see how truly heart-breaking some of the stories are. Buy this game if you don't mind doing a little thinking... And walking.			"

Give it a hour and half and just explore as the story unfolds, very much like Dear Esther in the mechanics/style of gameplay (slow with little reveals peppering it) but requires more hide and seek with journal entries/papers. You'll have to puzzle out the lives of this family of the main character and the rescent goings on through the paper/homework assignments/letter etc. It tells a simple story but does a great of letting it unfold at a natural pace.

												    A beautifully crafted single player experience with almost no equal. Gone Home represents a new evolution of gameing as a medium by bringing a wholey unique experience through a level of interactivity that few, if any, before it has. Even this groups previous title (Dear Esther), pales in comparison to the feat that has been pulled off in this thuroughly engrossing first person story.    Complex issues and engaging storyline are delivered with the upmost breadth and engagement through a variety of interesting devices. This game breeds engagement through a number of ways that are only apparent upon completeing the game and really helps a game without any kind of real direct mechanics, to stick with you in surprising ways.     Returning to an empty house and discovering the reality that lies between your expectations and the new reality the character is presented with gives an engrossing contrast and really helps pull you into the mindset of the character. It allows you to identify with someone who would otherwise be filled in by most players by sterotypes and assumptions and really lets you briefly live through that character with an immense sense of gravity of their unique situation.    To say anything more would spoil this games impact, but suffice it to say that this game should easily find itself on many a top 10 list of 2013. The $20 they ask for this game may seem a little high, and indeed it might be considering the brief playing time and limited replayability, but those looking for a unique and fresh look at what games can accomplish as a medium, you need look no further than this excellent example.

												I had no idea this game's focus was a lesbian love story before I bought it... I have nothing against gay's, but I really wish I had known that was the focus of the game before I purchased it. I foolishly thought this game would be more of psychological thriller or mystery. I found the sub-plot of the failed writer dad character far more interesting then the main story. I wish there was more of a abstract as to what this game is about in the description, ""a girl coming home to find her family gone"" is just way to vague. I guess I should've picked up the hint when in the trailer the narrator says something about ""a girl named Lonnie."" Other than that, I loved listening to the punk music and exploring the house, for the most part.			"

												I can't honestly say I'd suggest this game to a friend. I mean, it's a neat enough game and all. It kept me engaged from beginning to end. The stories of the dad, mom, and sister are all known to me even though I never see any of them. Even some of the back story of my own character is revealed. And I remember those parts. I played the game until it was over, which says a lot about the fact that it kept me interested, but it only lasted about 2 hours. I only paid $3 for this game, but still feel a little robbed. I've paid less for games that I've played far more (Binding of Issac).To summarize, the game is a neat change to the common fodder you see out there, but it lacks in content. All in all, its an interactive story about a girl that comes home to an empty house and finds out where they all went.			"

 Gone Home is a very enjoyable experience.   The developers certainly put a great deal of thought and heart into this title.  As you should know by now, it is not so much a game as it is an interactive story.  This story touches on issues very rarely, if ever, brought up in such a format.  Unfortuantely the themes and story arc are less than innovative as they have been addressed countless times in tv, movies, and books.  Overall though, definitely recommend the playthrough, especially at a discounted price.			"

												I may not have much play time, but I wanted to beat the game first for a view of it, I plan to go through and read the rest later. This game is easily one of the best games I have EVER played. With plot twists, amazing voice narration, and pathing that your allowed to and Supposed to stray off of, it's a game that with an overview has an hour of gameplay, but if your willing to delve deeper and really learn the storie/s and take the time to read the articles etc. You will see that this game is fantastic, you literally Unlock the story by your actions, and how much you are willing to do. This game may not have explosions but it kept me and the people I was streaming it to occupied for an hour or so, once I finished the game I quickly realized that there was so much that I hadn't seen yet, with the Uncle's and the Father's story, the narrated story of the sister is just the dust on the ground, that's the story that many will be satisfied with. But there is SO much more than just that to this game's story. Don't get me wrong, I loved the girl's story as much as the other's, but learning how it fits in to the rest of the story makes it all mean so much more.I 100% recommend this game, especially with how cheap it is. For sure worth a try if your sketchy on it now, but if you want to play it I highly recommend not watching or reading anything about the story as that will most likely ruin it for you.			"

It's really good. You kinda feel like a stranger visiting an abandoned house, but instead of 40 years and cobwebs (and probably a serial killer hiding in the fridge) you simply find...life has happened. Gone Home is a simple game with a really nice depth of detail within the environment and a very well done and unique-to-the-industry story. I enjoyed it a lot. There's no replayability here, so if that's a necessity for you to play a game then go to hell, I guess.			"

												A lot of the user reviews bash two things about this game: the story and it's pricetag. While I would agree that $20 is way too much for only about 2 hours of gameplay, I have to very strongly disagree about the story. The story is AMAZING. You play as a girl who has come home after backpacking in Europe to find her house empty, and notes and clues scattered about explaining where your sister has disappeared to. People seem to be in a huff because they were expecting some creepy horror game or something, which is not what this game is meant to be at all. It's a point and click story-heavy game about your sister and her girlfriend. The story was extremely interesting to me and it's one that you rarely hear discussed in video games, which was part of why I loved it (not to mention the awesome 90's riot grrl and pop culture references). My best advice is don't go into this game thinking it's going to be scary or that there's more to the gameplay than just picking things up and reading and looking at stuff. Expect a good, interesting story and leave it at that and you'll walk away satisfied.Especially now with the summer sale going on and this game being up on flash sale pretty frequently, I strongly suggest buying it. But again, the game only lasts about 2 hours on your first run through, so I probably wouldn't suggest paying the full pricetag.			"

												Most of us can recall the experience of stepping foot in a friend’s house for the first time. The first visit is often an overload on the senses but after a few minutes you refocus and start to notice things: smells, furniture, books, movies, hanging pictures (and my God, all the cool stuff they have that you don’t). With all these items you start to piece together a picture that tells the story of the people who live in that house. “Gone Home”, is a first person exploration game created by a small team of developers who formerly worked on the DLC for BioShock 2, and the game replicates the feeling of piecing together the story of a house’s inhabitants through their possessions. In the game you’re put in the shoes of Kaitlin Greenbriar who has returned home from a trip to Europe. On arriving, Kaitlin finds the house empty and it’s up to you to figure out why. Exploring the house at the beginning reminded me of the first time I explored the infamous mansion from the original Resident Evil. But the sprawling house in “Gone Home” only shares the mansion’s spooky and ominous atmosphere (and locked areas). There are no zombie dogs waiting to jump at you through the window, or shambling undead, and you won’t find any weapons or ammo. This minimalist approach however manages to make things slightly creepier and more immersive.  As you explore you’ll feel like you’re on the set of a David Lynch film. From the pouring rain striking the windows, to the sudden flicker of lightning, the house is drenched in atmosphere. The minute attention to detail shows that a great deal of love went into designing the game and examples that show this are scattered throughout the game. From lighting illuminating a postcard in real time, to a record player that lets you listen to a whole album, the attention to detail is striking.Speaking of attention to detail, the game could very much be considered the forerunner of a new genre. The house you explore is much like a time capsule of the early 90s-- hell, you could even call it a virtual museum. Gone Home takes place in the 1994, and the developers put all sorts of things into the game that were popular at the time. Throughout the house you’ll find playable mix tapes featuring real life riot girl bands, magazines, books, posters, even Super Nintendo video game cartridges. In one room I even found a shelf lined up with VHS tape recordings of the X-Files, all which gave a sense of real lived-in house.  As you explore further you’ll also find items that belong to Kaitlin’s younger sister Samantha, a high school senior. Samantha is central to Gone Home’s plot, and finding her objects will trigger short monologues narrated by Samantha, similar to the monologues encountered in the very similar first person exploration game Dear Eshter. But while Dear Esther’s monologues never fully painted a concrete story, and left a great deal open to interpretation, Gone Home delivers a concrete narrative, albeit in pieces you must put together yourself. I don’t want to give too much away but I will say it’s a beautiful and haunting story that left me genuinely moved. The game’s principal design is based on paced exploration. You won’t find a run button to move faster which may annoy impatient gamers, but the game is so immersive and pulls you in with such force that you won’t mind playing by its rules. Clocking in at about 4 hours, Gone Home isn't a long game, and once you've beaten it there really isn't much incentive to go replay it. But what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality, offering an unparalleled level of immersion. Those who play it will be rewarded with a unique and immersive story-driven experience that few games offer.			"

A Gone Home Review: The game ""Gone Home"" is a first-person walking simulator, where you play as a girl named Kaitlin Greenbrair, who arrives home from a holiday trip, only to find out that no-one is home; the house is deserted and you are to solve the mystery to why the house is empty.The game is ""Narrator based"", where you find diary entries that belong to your sister Samantha Greenbrair, as you explore around the house you eventually uncover strange events that eventually lead up to a dramatic ending.I recommend this game to people who enjoy walking simulators that are narrator based, that involves sitting through a lot of dialogue.Gameplay Here for Reference ►

												Very few games have ever disappointed me as much a Gone Home did. After reading all the critic reviews of how amazing this game is and the interesting description for the game, I had fairly high expectations. The description for the game leads you to believe there will be an interesting mystery as you arrive at your home and no one is there. I really expected a game where I would be at the edge of my seat trying to figure out the answers to the mysteries of the game all the way up to the very end. This obviously didn't happen. In the first 10 minutes of the game, things are quiet interesting. Trying to figure out where everyone is and why no one is home keeps you in the mystery of the game for a little bit. However, after searching the house and progressing in the story, Gone Home quickly becomes less and less interesting. Not only does it become increasingly annoying to move around the house, because your character is incredibly slow (I swear she is part snail), but not even half way through the game you will figure out the entire mystery.[Spoilers below](Once again, spoilers) Really, the mystery isn't hard at all the figure out and once you do, you will be disappointed. The big GIANT reveal is that your sister is just a rebellious teen that has run off with her lover. After about the half way mark of the game, once I figured it out, I kept thinking this can't be it. This cannot be the amazing mystery critics raved about. I was wrong. It was the entire mystery. Even as a story on it's own, it's nothing unique. Almost every single teenage that has ever lived has gone through a rebellious stage. Many run away just like the main character's sister. It happens, it's nothing new or intriguing and it is especially not something worthy of making a mystery game over. If the story was to realistically progress, I guarantee that the main character's sister would be back home going to school. She may still dream of what could have happened, but it was a stage. She will grow out of it. In the story, she talks like she is special and that she truly has found her true love and what she plans to do for the rest of her life. However, this is exactly how all teens in the rebellious stage feel. This part of her story isn't special or unique. After her hormones balance out, things would change. It's a cycle of life.My expectations were crushed by this uninteresting and easy to figure out mystery game. Gone Home: The Snail Simulator is one of the few games that I am ashamed to have in my steam library.			"

												Gone Home is a unique game released in 2013 for windows and in 2016 for the Xbox One and PlayStation Four. The main character, Kaitlin, has just returned from a year long trip around the world, but when she gets home, no one is there. Then the game begins and the player has to explore the house looking for clues to what had happened, and why no one is home.This whole game revolves around this mystery, leading to some interesting storytelling. In a way the whole game is almost like a detective game. When searching the house the player will find different items, such as books and notes that they can read. Everything in the game world can be picked up and manipulated. I’m not going to give anything away here, but when I figured out what happened in the year that passed, it blew my mind. After learning more, I started to relate more to Sam, Kaitlin’s sister. It enlightened me as to how a  specific group of people become who they are. It is rare for a game to become so understandable, and relatable so quickly. Needless to say the story is really well done, and the main reason for playing this game. Every member of the family has something unique and interesting to learn about, with secrets hidden around every corner.The design of the house is really intriguing. It feels like there are remnants of the past everywhere, that are just waiting to be explored. Although, it does seem a little bit big for it to be a normal house. This is forgivable, because everything that is in the house is really interesting to explore. The game is anything but linear. Since the entire game is based around searching for clues to the past, players will often find some things others did not, or have a relatively similar, but different experience.Despite all of these amazing factors of the game, there are many flaws. For me personally, these flaws do not out way the overall good of the game, but for some they might. To begin, the game is not a traditional game. There are no enemies, monsters, or any real antagonist. As you would expect this leaves the game with very little tension between characters. For the most part, the story is primarily told from Sam’s point of view. Depending on how you view storytelling, this could potentially be great or awful. For me it worked, but I felt that it was very one sided, especially with the audio logs. Everything that is there is really inspiring, informational, and emotional, but to me it would have been interesting to hear more audio logs that were not part of the main story. There are many side stories that could have been fleshed out more.Additionally, there is a great deal of reading. Similar to Phoenix Wright, your experience with this game will greatly depend on whether you enjoy reading a lot of text in games. To me, this game seemed a little too reliant on text. Without much tension I found it hard to engage with the game at times. I would get bored because there was not much to do other than reading. I think more audio logs would improve the quality of this aspect of the game and make it more interesting.Another, major flaw of the game is its lack of time and replay value. The game only lasts about two hours. It took me only an hour and a half to complete, but yet the developers are charging twenty dollars for this experience. This would be fine, if there was some replay value, but there is hardly any. After I finished the game, I had no intention of going back to play it again. It is good, but not worth playing again. Because of that, this game is definitely not worth the price. I got it on sale for five dollars, and that is probably the most that I would pay for it.The game is good for what it is, but very few games justify the price of twenty dollars for only two hours of content.Overall, the narrative and storytelling in this game are great, but all of the problems that come with it may cause the game to not be worth it to some people. For me this game is an interesting and creative spin on traditional methods of storytelling. Additionally, I think that this is an important game for the community as a whole, because of its strives to turn the tables on traditional methods of interaction and storytelling. However, because of its many flaws and oversights, I must give this game a two out of five. That is not to say that it is a bad game, just one that will only appeal to a niche audience. Your experience with this game will ultimately depend upon whether you enjoy new and unique ways of storytelling, a lack of enemies, and being able to piece the story together with little help.If you like this review check out my blog.

												I began this game thinking it was a simple mystery game. Perhaps the sister lost her phone or her car died on her way somewhere. It involved so much more than I expected. Rummaging your way through a lovely house in your search for clues on where your sister is or what could have happened to her; finding secret passageways; unraveling the maze of locked doors and hidden truths. Gone Home addresses so many different and relevant topics in society. Great play with a fantastic soundtrack.			"

												About me: i am the intended audience for this game ... im a 80s-90s kid and i am very open minded ... i dont mind if there is no action if there is a story that i can connect with...About the game:love between teen girls isn't deep... The 90s environment is fun and well made, but this isn't worth the money... go look at 90s photos on google for free nostalgia...The game is way overpriced, way too overhyped.Unfortunately, I bought it when there was no charge back... after I completed the game, I spent hours to find out how I could get my money back... I couldn't. it still sits in my library and I get always angry when I see it.....			"

												So, this game is an odd beast. It had a pretty darling story to it, the voicework was very convincing, and as a child of the Northwest, I like the subtle nods to the area. It felt very authentic, and careful. People have been saying that it's linear, but I felt more like the layout led that way intentionally, and makes you want to go the path it intends. Hell, it probably made me feel more than it had any right.That being said, I got this game in a Humble Bundle for a severely reduced price. I cannot actually recommend this at all, at its current price. While we're at it, as well, the game is very poorly optimized, often dropping to 15-20 fps for no real, apparent reason. This problem persisted even to the lower graphical settings. So if you can find it for cheap, pick it up. Otherwise, yea... not recommended.			"

												After one year away from her family, Kaitlin Greenbriar arrives from her European trip only to find her home empty with no signs of her sister and parents. It's up to the player, then, to figure out what is going on, by exploring the house, interacting with objects, and unlocking letters from Kaitlin's sister.With so many positive reviews, especially from the big ones, I was expecting a very good game with a decent gameplay at least and an excellent story. The truth is that I was very disappointed as there is no gameplay other than looking things around (without the need of actually think or any challenge) and the story, even though it's a touching and emotional one, doesn't have that much content.I only can recommend to buy this game on a very good steam sale, but you can find better games than this one with challenging puzzles and more complex narratives.

												While I do reccomend this game, you need to get it on sale, because it is very short. It has a nice story, well I use the term story loosely. I may have missed a few things, that are important, and there is a lot of boring notes too, I can't say it's perfect but if you can get it really cheap ($3 or less) and feel like spending an interesting hour. Then get Gone Home.			"

												I had to do this as University Project, Althoug the story is cute and meaningful and you can find some emotional connection with the story the game is weak, everything is boring and all in all the story is forgetful at bestThe Developers use weird tricks to make you angry and frigtened at the game when in reality there is nothing to be afraid of. The game is boring and definitely not worth 5 dollars or 20 dollars, If you can get it for less than it might be cool to burn in an hour with this game but its definitely overrated.			"

												Amazing Awesome game with fine attention to detail. Give it a hour and half and just explore as the story unfolds, very much like Dear Esther in the mechanics/style of gameplay (slow with little reveals peppering it) but requires more hide and seek with journal entries/papers. You'll have to puzzle out the lives of this family of the main character and the rescent goings on through the paper/homework assignments/letter etc. It tells a simple story but does a great of letting it unfold at a natural pace. I caught it on sale and it was definetly worth it.			"

												I loved the story of gone home, but it will warn those that dont know that there is very little gaming involed. I think of more as a point & click style adventure game, where you look around, grab some items and go back to the first place to use them. I dont think I would hav got the same investment in the story just watching it, so it is more game than movie but i understand thats theres plenty disagreement out there.Overall it took me 2-3 hours to complete so if you see it on sale for a price youd happliy pay for a dvd, pick it up and give it a go.

												This game tackles an important und difficult topic in a very subtle kind of way. The gameplay is an slow-paced ""3D First-Person-Exploration-Adventure"" and reminds me of classic Point and Click Adventures. Overall it has a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere, which is being enlightened by the emotional story. It is a must-play for everyone who loves storytelling in games and doesn't mind a little reading now and then.			"

It is arguably one of the greatest video game love stories and one of the best games I've played. The music is amazing and fits the theme of the game perfectly, the voice work is fantastic and guides the game beautifully, the mystery of the main story and the assorted subplots define Gone Home like few other games have. 10/10			"

												I was going to write ""Less a game, more a story that you can play,"" but upon reflection maybe that doesn't make it any 'less a game' at all.  We could talk about what it's not, but I'd rather say what it is - short, spooky, and terribly sweet.Do yourself a favor - find a couple of hours to spare when it's quiet where you are, or you have a good pair of headphones.  Grab a hot drink and a comfy chair.  Shut off your phone, your tablet, your whatever-other-distractions, and settle in to visit the spectres that dwell in this place.

												It's difficult to really tell well a lot of the best reviews for this game are negative, I think it's mainly because the game is short (1.1 Hrs it took me to complete, and I was distracted) and usually sells for an astronomical £14.99. Another reason could be that it seems like a horror game and really isn't, a bait and switch in that regard. I paid £1.79 on sale and was very happy with the game, it put the chills up me and had a enthralling story that I wanted to discover more of and finish as soon as possible. My only wish is that it was longer, since I finished the game before receiving a single card drop.I'm fairly certain I'll replay this game since it's easy to finish in one sitting for a short entertaining experience (Interactive film perhaps?). Grab the game if you catch it on sale, but at £14.99 I'd steer clear.			"

												I normally don't mind the ""walking simulator"" types of games, as they can be a genuinely interesting method of storytelling. In the case of Gone Home, however, nothing of interest is said or experienced. The game combines a seemingly foreboding visual and audio design with a terribly mismatched story told via collected notes and household items. Ultimately, Gone Home brings nothing to the table aside from the diary entries of a teenager, which are not worth experiencing.			"

												I would not describe gone home as a horror game and even a mystery game is pushing it. Although there is initial tension it quickly dissipates. Given the way the game throws you many leads I would have thought there may have been different consequences depending on what you pursued and maybe a different ending. Sadly this isn't the case. I spent most of my game time searching draws in an attempt to get as much out of it as possible. This did prove fruitful as I found things out about the minor plotlines that I would have otherwise missed. After about 15 minutes I was considering the possibility of it being more like Myst and prepared myself for some nice complicated puzzles. Unfortunately there were no puzzles! On a more positive note the game played flawlessly, it had nice graphics and the time era was well researched and presented. The storyline is good and would make an interesting book. However, this is not enough to make it a good game. If you would like a good story-telling experience then Gone Home is probably for you but consider that £15 is a lot of money to pay for what you are getting.			"

God this game sucks.  No controller support, can't rebind your keys.  Somehow i was able to finish it.   It isn't worth playing.  It is like Myst.  With teenage lesbian love.The picture made me think it was some sort of mystery game, possibly a scary game. IT is not, it is a teen drama about a girl who falls in love with another girl and THEY ARE OPRESSED. Jesus christ its the ♥♥♥♥ing 2015s ,  I'm more repressed than Gay People.You can't rebind you controls.The story is told to you by collecting notes, If you support the gay/lesbian thing, GREAT , i do too. Instead of buying this game donate money to your favoirte gay charity.    SERIOUSLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Don't, do not encourage reviewers to give games passes because they don't want to be called a bigot. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												Why is this game so expensive? I like the themes the story touches up on, I really do. But the mood forces me to not rush into rooms and explore with the incentive that something will jump out at me... When there's no one there. This is one of the few times that a game could be a better novel. The interactivity is almost pointless.			"

												This game sucks, do not buy. Do not buy. You have been warned. The story is sad and all, but you know what i didn't play a game to hear about some teen lesbian romance.  God this game sucks.  No controller support, can't rebind your keys.  Somehow i was able to finish it.   It isn't worth playing.  It is like Myst.  With teenage lesbian love.The picture made me think it was some sort of mystery game, possibly a scary game. IT is not, it is a teen drama about a girl who falls in love with another girl and THEY ARE OPRESSED. Jesus christ its the ♥♥♥♥ing 2015s ,  I'm more repressed than Gay People.You can't rebind you controls.The story is told to you by collecting notes, If you support the gay/lesbian thing, GREAT , i do too. Instead of buying this game donate money to your favoirte gay charity.    SERIOUSLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Don't, do not encourage reviewers to give games passes because they don't want to be called a bigot. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I have a bit split feelings about this game. I bought it while it was on sale, and now after playing it, it felt like a good decision. The game had a bit of an aerie feeling to it since you start of as Katie, coming home and finding the family’s house completely empty with you as a player walking through it, interacting with object to try and piece together what has happened. The game itself was very short and kind of left me with a “oh... ok... so that was it?”-feeling, as I expected a bit more from it than I got. The game is basically an interactive story, where you will piece together information, painting images of different family members, however, if picking up the right pieces of information to advance the story, there is no need to investigate everything and after a while it is clear where the story is going. I kept thinking about twists but everything was kept on track and nothing threw me off balance. It was a nice game, if bought on sale, but very short and became predictable. I have mixed feelings about it but do think that if I hadn’t spent moneys on this, I would have been perfectly fine without playing it. It is a forgettable game with a forgettable story that is, if even, only needed to play once.			"

												***RECOMMENDED ON SALE, BUT DEFINITELY NOT AT FULL PRICE (Read to find out why)***So, from what I've seen, there are two widely ""pushed"" stances on this game (and the way I see it, it does qualify as a game, and more so than something like Dear Esther, to use the other commonly contested example... but I'll get to that in a second). The first stance is that the game is a masterpiece, a beautiful work of art or whatnot, etcetera. The second stance is that it's a pile of dung, not worthy of anyone's time, completely overrated, preachy, etcetera. I'll get to why I think both stances are, more or less, valid (although as usual... are exaggeratively spouted with too much ""excitement"" if you know what I mean).I'm not going to spoil much more than the first 5 minutes, as Gone Home is obviously heavily story driven. The game is experienced through the shoes of a college student who has just returned from a trip around Europe, and arrives home expecting to see her parents and little sister... only to find everyone away/missing. So basically you walk through the house, finding out what's been happening over the past year or so that you've been gone. It's sort like looking at a bunch of memories, both via your interaction and exploration (although, yes, exploration is a term I use lightly) and the audio journals that are peppered throughout the game.That's all I'm going to say. While I can't address the reasons for the ""preachy"" complaint without explicitly detailing the tale's central struggle or issue if you will, I will say that I didn't really get too much of that vibe personally. It really WAS just conveying a story, in my eyes. And this is coming from someone who is even admittedly a little zealous when it comes to ""hipster disdain"" and a dislike for these so-called ""arty"" games and that sort of thing. I still didn't find it particularly preachy; take from that what you will. I also don't want this style of game to become ""the norm"" in a million years. But hey, isn't that what it's all about? Variety is what makes this kind of game stand out, even if it's not to one's particular liking.So honestly, both of those aforementioned stances are valid and both are completely subjective. A lot of that is really in the eye of the person playing. Personally, I'm somewhere in between, though leaning somewhat towards the former. I don't think that the game is a masterpiece, but I do think it's heartwarming, and I also think that the manner in which they chose to tell the story is well-suited *to the story which is being told*. On the other hand, yeah, in retrospect on the COMBINATION of short length and actual gameplay depth of the game, I probably would've been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I'd paid full price. That's absolutely NOT to say the game should have been longer OR deeper; I think it is the perfect length for what it is doing and the story it tells. The pacing is good, which brings me to the reason or reasoning for the differences between this and Dear Esther.Dear Esther is literally just Point A to Point B, with a convoluted narrative that, for me at least, DID seem very preachy and kind of dumb. Gone Home is really more of a interactive diorama that kept me focused, intrigued, and occupied during the two hours I spent with it. It feels properly paced, and like it actually has something worthy to say. If you, as the player, want to learn about this family through all the stuff lying around the house, you can. If not, you can just play it like Dear Esther (sort of, although you'd still get a better and less boring tale, I think). But that's the key in and of itself; you have that choice.All in all, if want to sit down for a couple hours and have an interesting, ""quieter"" experience, then I'd say you should give Gone Home a shot, especially for say 5-7 bucks. But again, 20 is really just too much for this. I don't like the price to length argument or pretty much any of it's variations, but 20 bucks just really seems *kinda* crazy. Again though, good experience if you're open-minded and not having an amped-on-caffeine-ready-to-play-twitch-shooters kind of day.			"

												Gone Home is a first-person narrative adventure game about a woman coming home from college and finding out about her sister's exploits (and indeed, many of her family's problems). Set in the 1990s, the game features a fine array of 90s era memorabilia. Anyone who was a kid or a teenager at that time period will identify with at least some of the stuff in the house.GH has received a lot of bad press, mostly because of the most outspoken (and misguided) hardcore/e-sport gamers feel this isn't a game. What is a game? Hard to tell, really. You'll get a lot of different answers, but the crux of their argument is that GH isn't competitive, doesn't feature combat, mostly involves you walking around the house and discovering things (hence the derisive term ""walking simulator""), and the story is about a lesbian (which is why some people have referred to this game as ""Gone Homo""). You'll also hear people say the entire game is pretentious and leftist/feminist or something to that effect. I've seen some people call it ""man-hating."" How it's that is beyond me, and I'm a 35 year-old male. Obviously, GH wasn't made with those particular gamers in mind and that's okay. Not everyone wants to play the same types of games. If you are interested in a story-heavy narrative focused game which doesn't have combat or stressful situations, you might very well like GH. It involves a thought-provoking story that engages your brain instead of your reflexes. It's not perfect by any means, but it's a refreshing change of pace from the constant ""kill everything that moves"" tedium that are the vast majority of games.Don't listen to the obnoxious loudmouthed idiots on Facebook or the trolls who enter into the GH forums simply to cause havoc and attack everyone. For some reason they feel threatened by this game and instead of going off to play something they enjoy, they feel the need to hurt others who like something they don't. In short, they're bullies, and they aren't worth your time, even if you aren't interested in this game.(I bet I'll get voted down because I don't hate this game, and/or get flamed and called an SJW.)

												Gone Home is simply a phenomenal story. I've noticed some reviews saying that they ""saw the twist coming a mile away."" But this isn't a story that hinges on one twist. It's just about people. People who you come to love and care about. People who disappoint you, betray you, make you laugh, and make you care deeply about them. By the end, I felt like I had grown up with this family. Like I was the character. Honestly, Gone Home is a roleplaying game in its own odd way.If you would like a story to make you laugh, cry, and experience the full breadth of human feeling (yes really) then get this.I read a comment on a Let's Play video of GH that said, ""I beat it in 10 minutes, game sux."" You can't ""beat"" Gone Home any more than you can ""beat"" Pride and Prejudice or something. Arguments about whether GH is a game or not are neither here nor there. It doesn't matter what the crap it is, as long as it's good. $20 does seem steep, but on the other hand the writing (in terms of quality and quantity) is pretty amazing. This is definitely at least worth picking up and trying during a sale, though. Also, this game is amazing if you like Riot Grrrl music. I had so much fun headbanging to the cassettes. TLDR: get Gone Home if you have a functioning human soul. I don't care if you play games to blow stuff up. Believe it or not, you're actually allowed to play more than one kind of game! :O			"

Gone Home is a masterpiece.My Score: 9.5/10This is not a game, it is an experience. Confusion, curiosity, sadness, anger, Gone Home covers all bases.When I first heard about the game I didn't know what to expect. Is it a horror game? Is it a puzzle game? It's a narrative at heart, with adventure elements. Your main way of traversing the house is on foot, and you click around to open doors, investigate items, or something as easy as turning on a light.Gone Home kept me intrigued and guessing throught the 2-3 hour story. I always predicted the next plot point wrong, I was constantly suprised and shocked. The story pulls you in and grabs hold of your soul. It crashes into some heavy themes so don't go in here expecting generic storytelling. You, as a player, are constantly hooked up to the very end, with a strong and satisfying conclusion. By the time the story is over, all the plot points are seamlessly connected, as if you flipped a page in a book. Gonne Home is a must buy.			"

The house has a creepy, but also a well lived feeling.I even enjoyed the Stanley Parable reference (but don't quote me on that one).The real story is about a girl discovering herself throughout adolescence and her sister working through memories.9.5/10			"

												I didn't really think the theme of the game was something I would enjoy but the story turned out to be pretty good (It does a great job at creating suspense). I liked the ambience - the amount of detail in the house and the sound direction (probably the backbone of all walking simulators).  But the actual gameplay I think was too monotonous. A lot of reading is involved. They decided to actually scan real life letters and drawings and handwriting in general, so some of the text is actually pretty unreadable. Not that it matters, because most of it is not what you’d call interesting or essential to the story. Also there are a lot of pointless interactive objects in the house. Things that again don't contribute anything to the story or immersion, in my opinion. And whilst the developers made a good job recreating a realistic 90s house in a video game, it’s still just that. One might even describe it as overwhelmingly mundane, but not in a nostalgic, cool kind of way, but just plain boring and predictable. And when you can complete the entire game in under a minute (whilst speedrunning) the 20 euro price tag seems utterly ludicrous. Now, this is the point where I was going to end my review saying ''Don't buy it'', but I went back and played the game once more, but this time with the developer commentary enabled. I mean the creative process of creating a game is very interesting. And building the game from nothing takes huge amount of time and skill, especially if there are only a few people working on it. The developers highlighted some things that I had missed on my first playthrough or rather took for granted. These insights reminded me of the time I made a 10 page newspaper for my english class assignment (smth like 8th grade). It took me roughly 5 months to produce six pages of content I was kind of happy with. It was an enormous chore to think out what was going to be in the newspaper: the attitude of the newspaper, the individual stories, the proportions, the layout, the overall design, the writing style, the pictures, the ads - everything had to be perfect (since it was WAY past the hand in deadline and I wanted to salvage a good grade and of course make the teacher feel bad for ever doubting my abilities). Anyway, after that much effort put into a project, it sure would be nice to be rewarded (*high price tag*). But we still have to look at everything objectively. Yes the teacher was very impressed by my efforts (so much so, that she decided to take it as a keepsake),but I still got an F. And so, while I did enjoy the game, no way should it get away with costing twice the money it’s worth. Snatch it on a sale though.			"

You need to help Katie figure out what exactly happened, and where her sister has gone.This is an amazing story of discovery and hardship. The discovery of the truth flows forth so naturally with the gameplay that I often caught myself getting personally wrapped up in the story's conclusion, which is something I can't say for many games.Gone Home is probably one of the best story games I've ever played. Yeah, it was short, but the story was so well written I didn't care. It was much like playing a truely interactive movie. A unique experience that no one should pass up.			"

You soon run around this haunted house looking for clues until you find out that the Lesbian Satanists where  plotting this massacre for a long time by making secret passage ways in your own home! near the end of the game you will soon confront the demon spawn which will lead to the most badass boss fight in video game history.  I rate this game a 8.5/10			"

												Wow, this game was not what I was expecting - The whole feel of it was very errie and dark, and I was, at first, hoping for some scary story to rise out of somewhere - But it never really does. Instead, there is a fantasticly moving, tearjerking story of a girl that I can relate all to well to - And the ending made me cry like a baby. Dont get this game if you're looking for some scares, but if you're looking for some feels, you've found the right game.			"

												I have a bit split feelings about this game. I bought it while it was on sale, and now after playing it, it felt like a good decision. The game had a bit of an aerie feeling to it since you start of as Katie, coming home and finding the family’s house completely empty with you as a player walking through it, interacting with object to try and piece together what has happened. The game itself was very short and kind of left me with a “oh... ok... so that was it?”-feeling, as I expected a bit more from it than I got. The game is basically an interactive story, where you will piece together information, painting images of different family members, however, if picking up the right pieces of information to advance the story, there is no need to investigate everything and after a while it is clear where the story is going. I kept thinking about twists but everything was kept on track and nothing threw me off balance. It was a nice game, if bought on sale, but very short and became predictable. I have mixed feelings about it but do think that if I hadn’t spent moneys on this, I would have been perfectly fine without playing it. It is a forgettable game with a forgettable story that is, if even, only needed to play once.			"

												Having finished this game, I can now see why the masses are so divided when reviewing it.  It's not a ""game"" in the tradional sense, more of an interactive story.  It's an excellent recreation of what a house may have contained in 1995. Being 31 myself, I had dozens of ""wow, I haven't thought about those things in years!"" moments.  But alot of the games magic is going to be lost on anyone who grew up with a cell phone and high speed internet access.  As far as the ending goes, SPOILERS SPOILER SPOILERS DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS SPOILERS SPOILERSI thought it was beautifully done.  This is the first game I'm aware of where the big plot twist hinges on the sexual preference of a character.  Sam being a lesbian was awesome.  I came into this expecting a kind of ghost story, but I was very satisfied with the path the game chose.  I have played scores of horror games that fit the ghost story bill, but only one game like this. There truly is only one Gone Home.			"

												This makes my most memorable games list. It's a really well executed take on narrative games with the emphasis on exploration and discovery to find all the pieces of the story. The story and pacing is really good and really draws you in and fuels your need to explore more so that you can learn the next part of the story. I was a big fan of the story but won't say anything so that I don't spoil it but it's definitely a game I recommend!			"

												Frist off, I want to say that i think a bit of empathy and williness to be reflective about your personal feelings goes a long way. If you're tryin to be a macho man, this game isn't for you.Secondly, I got this practically for free since i recieved it in a Humble Bundle package with the game i was actually paying for, Prison Archetect. That may cause my review to be a little off center because i'm not considering price. I'd probably never have played it otherwise. Also All i see is people feeling ripped off cause they payed full price. Well Why the hell would you just blindly buy a game with out researching it, ya dingus? If you got money to throw away on impulse buys, check out my wishlist and help a brotha out. I knew nothing about Gone Home other than that GamerGate stuff. I dont know about that, i couldn't care less. I like making up my own mind about things before bashing them; hell, i've read the first Twilight book (and only the first, yuck) because i'm stubborn like that. That said, I had a great time playing this game and it hit me right in the feels.Anyway, there really isn't a whole lot to this game. Explore your home and try to peice together why your family isn't home. I almost didn't play it at first because i'm a wimp and can't make it through scary games. I mean, you start off in a mansion where no one is home on a stormy night; thats pretty much how every ghost story ever starts. But it turns out that it's only scary on the surface. I mean, there are a few sound effects and stuff that are unnesesarily creepy and it's like they used them to intentially create a creepy vibe, even though its not a scary game. Still, we've all been at home alone at night before and that can get creepy sometimes. I know we've probably all turned the televison on as background noise to scare away the ghosts, There are a few red herrings that make it seem like things are about to get scary, but the game explains them away almost instantly. It's actually funny. Once i got over my fear and saw that this wasnt a haunted house, i began digging around. I'm pretty good at this stuff as i'm a nosey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. When i was a child I used to dig around in every drawer and closet i could so it was all very natural. Also like my childhood, it's set in 1995 so there's tons of references both large and small. My favorite in particular was when a young boy's mother called video game cartridges ""tapes"". That one took me wayy back. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:After much digging around, several stories began to unfold. you really begin to feel for these characters you never actually meet. I found myself rooting for the dad, wishing for the mom to cut dat♥♥♥♥♥♥out and for Sam to find true love. As the story unfolds there is kind of a sad sweetness to how sam is discovering who she is and what she really wants. despite sexual orientation, theres a lot of truth to that in all of our days growing up.in the end, this game does something that really makes me love it. It made me feel. Cliche, right? I mean it-- i haven't played a game or watched a movie in a long while that has made me stop and reflect upon my own life and also feel for fictional people.Sure, it was slightly predictible that Sam was leaning toward the homosexual side from the first few letters you find and once you realize lonnie has interest in the military, you'll know where your sister ran off to. That didn't stop the ending from being beautiful and bitter sweet and causing me to  shed a few tears. Only two and a half though because i'm a macho man.Also, that ♥♥♥♥♥ Sam owes me 40 bucks for pizza.			"

And then I ended up glued to my computer and tearing up by the end of this one. Definitely not a game by any means -- but it is an experience. This experience heavily subverts much of what you would have expected if you came into this based on its initial presentation, especially if you haven't spoiled yourself regarding the story.

												There honestly isn't much ""game"" here, and that's just fine. Gone Home is a well-done example of interactive storytelling with a streamlined SCUMM-like feel. The voice acting is decent and never sounds forced. There are no difficult puzzles, traps, or dangers; just take as much time as you like to explore and let the story unfold. The only negative thing I can say is that it is not long enough, and even that can be a plus; I came away from the experience wanting more, so that tells methat the design team did a good job. Besides that, sometimes you want a shorter ""game"" and this bite-sized morsel sots right in the Goldilocks zone.			"

												This game was the most emotional and touching journey I've ever had since I started playing video games about 17 years ago. It has such a great story, which is told very beautifully and that will thrill you from the very beginning.The graphics also look very nice, even though it's no next-gen graphics, but that's not necessary, because the story is the most important piece of a video game followed by the gameplay.You can explore a complete and huge house with dozens of rooms, closets, drawers and hidden secrets, to discover the story behind your family, to find out, what happened, while you were away. You can pick up and examine almost every object in the house and open every door and cabinet, which is also needful to get the story march on.The game is set in 1995 and you will feel, like you traveled back in time (if you are old enough), because there are so many things reminding you of the nineties, like cassettes & cassette-players, VHS-tapes & videorecorders, the music, films and much, much more. Honestly, I expected something totally different, something more horror-like or that you discover a dark story full of scary details, but instead it is an exploration game with a very beautiful story, so I was not disappointed at all. I was thrilled from the first second discovering the story of friendship, love, family-issues, loss and heartbreak. To me, this is the BEST VIDEO GAME LOVE STORY ever told! Also the game featured lots of music from the nineties, especially from riot-grrrl bands like Heavens to Betsy or Bratmobile, whereby the already emotional journey gets even more emotional. If you are an emotional being, you WILL spill some tears, tears of joy as well as tears of sorrow.As mentioned, the game has thrilled me from the first minute and it got more and more moving every minute and when I finished it, I was so emotionally agitated, that I couldn't think straight, I had goosebumps and my heart was beating like hell. It was like a rollercoaster of emotions! And I admit it, even I as a guy had tears in my eyes once in a while, especially at the end, because it was sooo moving.Even though the game cost 20 bucks and is not endless long, it is definately worth buying, if you wanna explore this emotional and moving story behind this awesome masterpiece game.

												Gone Home seems to be a sort of ""love it or hate it"" type of game, yet that being said I personally am indifferent to it. There is very little ""game"" to be had and is more of an interactive short story with very little input needed from you. The main reasons for me giving it a negative review likely stem from the games lack of value and the fact that the story, nor characters really relate to me and so I feel I got much less out of it then others may. As for the game itself I loved the attention to detail and sense of atmosphere. Objects can be picked up and looked at and most everything can be opened or manipulated in some way. The house seems to keep getting bigger as you play and will seem like an architectural disaster or nightmare. Still, there will likely be a few parts of the house or the details that will remind you of something from your own house or childhood.  You will find there are a ton of letters and notes to read, something I am not too fond of, especially with a story I do not feel very invested in. The other damning fact is that the game is absurdly short at maybe an hour with really no replay value at all. The length is about right for the game itself but for me the experience of the game play is not enough to justify the asking price. This may vary depending on your own point of view when price to value is concerned. In conclusion, I don't hate the game but I don't feel it is a ""must play"" nor do I feel a consumer will get much value out of the product. However, the game may speak to certain people on some level more profoundly then it did to me and so they may find the game a more memorable experience. To everyone else I would say play it if you get the chance so as to judge for yourself but otherwise pass as it is relatively, not worth full asking price.			"

												Although the game is short and a bit eerie, I enjoyed my experience simply because it was a story I needed and one that hardly ever gets told. Queer representation in the media is few and far between, and while other forms (television, movies) are becoming more inclusive, it's rarer to see video games give space for these kinds of stories. I do agree that the mood of the game and the story being told don't align perfectly (as someone who hates horror games I despised parts of this game where I had to walk into a dark room) and it is very little gameplay for $20. However, I think this is a very unique game in other regards and that makes it worth playing. Those who claim the story is cliche seem to me to be people who have never lacked representations of themselves in media.			"

												The whole thing felt a bit like a movie. Which i liked. I felt more involved than in any movie since I built the story for myself from the things I found. The story itself is not very deep or twisty, but moved me and I really felt for the people about whose past I had just learned something.Immersion worked really well for me: the whole thing is made with lots of attention to detail that make story work and feels plausible, unlike other exploration games which are sometimes more on the abstract-surreal side.I rushed through it in 85 minutes, but I'm quick at soaking up information and it might be more worthwile to take your time. Still, it won't take more than 2 hours.Compare the price to a movie ticket and consider you probably get more from it than from a movie.			"

												The Devs had good intentions when they made the game, but they forgot to account for the difference between player and character in any way. There's something extremely uncomfortable about the experience of Gone Home, it's not executed well enough to make you feel entitled to search for your family's whereabouts by sifting through their personal items but you have to do it anyway if you want this to be anything but a walking simulator. So you are essentially forced to pry into people's lives and listen to incredibly personal, emotional confessions and thoughts. I did not respond well to this.Another thing thaty killed Gone Home for me was the realization of how absurdly tiny the game is. It takes place in a mediumly sized two-story house with a basement, and when you actually travel from one end of it to the other it's a very depressing realization.The game is short and the only thing that keeps you from flying from one end of the house to the other is constant the reading and listening that the diary entries, scraps of paper, and audio logs you find require. Any sense of interactivity is a total illusion, watching a youtube video for this game is almost the same as playing it.			"

 3/5 Average game !  OVERALL This game is a ripoff if you payed $20, I would recommend it for $5  but not for more, I am really glad I got it on a bundle. BELIEVE THE CRAP! Seriously, the critics kissed this game's virtual♥♥♥♥♥because how it develops a lesbian love  story but in reality it's not a great game, the user scores of this game are around 6/10 and they are right, as a whole the game isn't horrible but it isn't great, it's just an OK game if you are into slow paced exploration and sensitive story telling (the writing and voice acting are the best parts of it). REPLAYABILITY Niet. Zero. NADA. Just play your 3.5h and get done with it, it has no different endings and no achievements.  GAMEPLAY So as the description states, it's a walking simulator, you need to explore trough different rooms to unlock pieces of the story, once you find one of them you hear the narration of the protagonist's sister who will uncover her life since the family moved to the new house and sometimes you will be given some clues to unlock new places of the house and keep with the game's progression. The voice actress is top notch, even if she's the only voice of the whole game you will be engaged by her diary's narration and interesting stories of the life of a teenage girl in the 90s. AESTHETIC The visuals are OK, the edge's are quite jaggy even at max settings but the most enjoyable thing are all the 90s references in the house since the story is set in 1995, so if you had your childhood or teens in the late 80s or the 90s then you will truly enjoy the exploration of the house, if you don't fit with that description then you might not find the value in finding  VHS tapes, grunge and punk cassettes, SNES games (but not the console, this game's trailer is heavily misleading), Pulp Fiction talking and even a colorful binder that most likely somebody you met had . STORY The story is quite interesting, it has a good pace and by the end of the game I was really engaged and generating my own ending theories, some pretty macabre theories I might add, that said I was kind of let down by the end, after getting all that media love I was expecting an ending of epic proportions a la Bioshock Infinite, but no... I was really disappointed. It got the high scores just because it's a lesbian love  story in the middle of the feminazist gaming inquisition, it has nothing truly great or memorable (the ending was a freaking missed opportunity, dat ouija board ). MUSIC So this game's starts pretty silent, near the door you hear a storm outside and gives you a really creepy setting, but as you progress you lose the creepiness since you only hear your own steps, a really annoying clicking sound when you are near an object you can examine (which are almost everywhere) and, finally, you get to find some pretty neat punk cassettes. The soundtrack of the game is pretty solid if you like grunge and punk rock, if it wasn't for them I would have lost my mind in that silence and pretty bland gameplay, heck a few jump scares would have been appreciated to not fall asleep during the exploration but at least you get a songs in 4 or 5 rooms, geez next time just give the protagonist a Walkman. One more thing, the song of the trailer is the worst song in my opinion, so listen to some of the other stuff on YouTube and see if you like them or just play some music on your PC while playing this or else you'll go mad.

												I love exploring in games. I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s. Honestly, the most interesting thing for me about an apocolypse scenario would be exploring people's houses and seeing the things they left behind. Because of all of that, I was sure this would be the game for me.The Positives:Creepy game. The sounds constantly had me turning around to make sure there was nothing behind meRemembering the 90s tech was pretty funGreat musicSimple controlsThe sister's story is interestingThe Negatives:The graphics kinda suck, for a realistic gameThere's a lot of filler. Repetitive items, and very few things matter at allIf you moved fast you could easily complete the game in an hour - hour and a halfOther than the sister's story, nothing else is really going onYou feel like the story is kind of leading up to something, I found the ending was disappointing.All in all I think they had a cool concept, but didn't put nearly enough work into it. They could have expanded on the mom and dad's stories. They could have made more items that matter. It could have been replayable, exploring the history of the house and the people who died in it. They give you tastes of interesting stories but you never get to explore them further. It's too bad, could have been a great game.I honestly wouldn't recommend buying this for more than $2. It's like reading a crappy book, too much filler and the ending isn't worth it. Save your money for something better.			"

												Gone Home is a two to three hour game that has you returning from an overseas trip. As you navigate the late 80's / early 90's scape, you find that something has happened while you were away. Through exploring your suburban home, you find notes left by your sister as she reflects upon her rather typical teenage life. And that is the premise of Gone Home in a nutshell. The reason I do not recommend this game is because I found the story to be rather cliche, the gameplay terribly basic, and not at all challenging. It would be one thing if there was something interesting to discover, but ultimately I cannot take Gone Home seriously, nor will I herald it as a unique and inspiring experience. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is completely predictable, and for me personally, not really that enjoyable. Because the game focuses on a single narrative with little depth, you will only be playing through Gone Home once. Perhaps, eventually you may feel the urge to return to see if you missed something, but chances are you won't bother. As a child of the 90's, I understand the nostalgia of record players, cassette tapes, and life without decent internet. However, that hardly makes Gone Home a more fulfilling experience. No doubt the game is well polished in terms of graphics and design--the home seems real enough, and the detail on the objects is fantastic. But is it worth the price? Absolutely not. I will end this review with a grain of salt. I am somewhat bitter about paying a full $20 for a game I was rather excited for. If this game is on sale, maybe it'll be worth it for you. This game has gotten many rave reviews, and I have read some of them, and disagree entirely with their points. This game may invoke a sense of nostalgia, but maybe you should visit an antique shop, or your attic instead?			"

												Like many games that have been and continue to be released, Gone Home aims to blur the line between what is and is not considered a game, and does so by telling a story that utilizes subject matter still considered by some to be controversial or progressive, depending on the stance of the individual. This is probably my biggest problem with the game, it relies almost entirely on this controversy, and I feel that it has a tendency to hide behind it when criticism is levelled at it. ""Clearly you are a bigot if you didn't like this game about X because that means that you disprove of X."" Gone Home consists of exploring a house and  finding various items and paths through said house, all in order to discover why your family is not inside their domicile. I purchased Gone Home because I believed it would be a horror/suspense game in the vein of Amnesia, but I was quite wrong.I paid close to twenty dollars when this was first released for a ""game"" that clocked in at two hours, contained little to no actual gameplay aside from walking around a house and manipulating various pieces of furniture and objects while listening to cassette tapes found inside said furniture, consisted of a story that, while told in a rather original way, was one of the most pretentious I have ever experienced, and has absolutely no replayability. Gone Home left me in a quandry:  who wants to exist in a perpetual state of mindless button clicking and trigger pulling? Wouldn't it be better to have boundaries pushed? To feel the brain tickle of an experiment every once in a while? I don't have answers to these questions, all I know is that for me this was not entertaining. This is a perfect example of the state of affairs in the industry, when something is placed upon a pedestal and recognized for its achievement in diversity rather than the quality of the product itself. Gone Home certainly took chances, for which it deserves to be applauded, I just wasn't a fan of the result.			"

												i was incredibly disappointed with this piece of crap called a game. I heard so many raving reviews about it and how its story is amazing and the mechanics are so good and it tells a fantastic story and such. It's anything but. I was interested in the story exploration part of it, and I actually felt tense in the atmosphere and learning of certain things form notes and such. That all changed when I started to realize the actual story. Which is just...boring. Generic and boring, nothing unique about it. And I love story. I play games to enjoy great fantastic story, and I was so excited to get it from this game. But I didn't. It wasn't really a unique love story at all, if anything, it almost sort of...stereotyped it? For lack of a better word. It doesn't much help that the length of the game is quite short. It really isn't very long, which is worse considering how much the original price is, $19.99. That's too much for this short, overhyped piece of crap. Not a game worth owning, in my opinion.			"

												I got this one one of the occasional fire sales they have on it, so I just paid a couple of bucks.  This isn't really a game in the usual sense, because your existence at all is irrelevant to the plot, and to the extent there are any challenges they are rapidly self-evident.  You can pick up and handle a whole lot of objects in the game, but for 99% of them there really is no point.  The game keeps you interested through the process by playing a lot of bait-and-switch, telling you that there are stories going on that never actually mean anything.  If you start getting interested in anything occult going on, it's just a distraction.  The actual story (spoilers here) is another fake-out, looking like it's building towards a suicide pact and instead building to the ""happy ending"" of two teenaged girls running off to live with each other.  Without any means of support.  Or money.  If you project this one forward a few months the ending could be pretty dark.  But this isn't the sort of game that's going to think through the implications of this sort of thing.  We're supposed to just celebrate their decision to pursue their teenage romance in favour of social oppression.  Given the lifespan of the average teenage relationship it'd probably have been a far happier ending if they were all just sad for awhile and then moved on and pursued other relationships later.  All in all, expect this game to dangle you around with false plot threads for no more than a couple of hours before it gets to the point, which really could have been done in a single expository sequence.  This feels like a tiny fragment of a much bigger (and theoretically better) game.			"

												Even on a decent system, running the game on Medium gave me massive frame rate drops, which wasn't particularly pleasant, considering that there isn't much going on in this game besides the level design and the narration.The combination of the narrative and level design make for a somewhat interesting experience, giving us, the players, an insight into the direction that games can go when it comes to evolving what narratives can work in games.The game is short, which is completely acceptable given this particular story. It ended when it should have ended, just as the point in time when the playters attention begines to dwindle.Gone Home is interesting. Is it a worthwhile purchase? No. As a game for the sake of entertainment, paying for this game may make users feel sour unless bought in a sale. As a game for the sake of academia, this is a worthwhile piece of game development that can be studied.			"

												I had never heard so many mixed reviews about a game as I did with Gone Home. The game still looked interesting however, and knowing that it could be completed in a couple of hours, I waited for a sale and got the game for around $2. Well I'll get straight to the point. The game markets itself as a great big mystery. You come home, and your parents and sister are not there. Surely there will be some deep reasoning behind this... WRONG. Your parents are  away on their anniversary vacation  and your sister  ran away with her girlfriend  which you can EASILY guess within 30 minutes of playing the game. Other than that the game tries to make you think there is some significance to the former owner of the house,  (which is your father's uncle who went crazy and may or may not have committed suicide)  however there really isn't any. Also, this game has horrible optimization. You can look at screenshots to see this game is by no means winning any awards in the graphics department, yet my PC which can run pretty much any modern AAA game at High to Max Settings at 1080p and 60fps, gets framerate drops to 40 fps!Bottom Line: If you were expecting a dark mystery with puzzles to solve that will lead you to the whereabouts of your family, then prepare to be disappointed. Instead be ready to walk around a house and read notes. If you still want to pick this game up, wait for a big sale.			"

It's set in the 90s so it's got a lot of nostalgia, which was absolutely wonderful. The storyline is a breath of fresh air as I haven't seen it in any game before and this is possibly the best newest game I've played so far. Buy it! Now!			"

There is maybe an hour of gameplay if I'm being really generous with this walking-simulator. I had the misconception that this was a horror game, but it's actually a story game, and the story that it tells didn't appeal to me. By the end I felt really bored, and (spoilers?) even though I thought a twist ending was coming (or a horror ending) it didn't. "

												Gone Home has an amazing premise. You arrive home one rainy night from a trip to find your family missing. The player must then search their humble abode trying to piece together the mystery. As you find things like your sister's secret diaries or your dad's porn collection one thing becomes clear: your family is fairly low on the priority list. Rather the tale of your sister's new-found sexuality is the main focus. This could be a wonderful social commentary if the writing didn't feel more like a 13 year old dreaming up lesbian fantasties than a woman truly finding herself. As the game draws to a close it becomes clearer and clearer that the mystery is a farce and the ending become anti-climatic. I would have loved to see this game with far more story to it rather than invading your sister's privacy			"

												Right at the moment I don't have time to write a full review covering all aspects of the game though I really want to share my experience with it without spoilering anything. So I will have to put some thought into this previously.For now let's just put it that way: I don't regret buying and playing this game and I can totally reccomend anyone to play it. The game is very atmospheric and you just have to let it get to you. It took me and my girlfriend like 7 hours to play through, though I think you could finish it a lot faster. But the game thrives from your will to explore and to look into every corner, read every text or the covers of books in the shelves or the lables on some scattered VHS' that bring back childhood memories...I had a nice time playing the game.

												Rather then a game, it's more of an interactive story, you play as a girl that came back home after a year of traveling and she find that her family's house is empty (sound like the start of a horror game but it's not), then you pretty much walk around the house to unravel the reason behind the empty house and what heppend in the year you weren't there.it's a 100% about story telling while exploring, the story is not epic and unforgettable but the method of geting pieces of the story by exploring the environment has never been executed that well before (atleast i haven't seen it done that well before), i actually felt that the people in the story really live in that house and that i see a part of their life.overall i had fun playing it and i enjoyed the way the story was told, i recommand it for 5$ or less mainly because like i said it's not really a game and also it's very short (2-4 hours for normal gameplay), buy it if you want to experiance story telling from a new perspective.

My bets advice is torrent it, if it goes on sale buy it. I am not sauying it's great nor am I saying it is terrible.

I had the misconception that this was a horror game, but it's actually a story game, and the story that it tells didn't appeal to me.

Also the money that you pay for this game is not enough.In my opinion this game was a very good idea but it was too short, not finished, and not worth its high price.I honestly was expecting a lot from this game, but didnt satisfy me at all.

You will venture into a haunted house only to find out your family was murdered by lesbian satanists. You soon run around this haunted house looking for clues until you find out that the Lesbian Satanists where  plotting this massacre for a long time by making secret passage ways in your own home! near the end of the game you will soon confront the demon spawn which will lead to the most badass boss fight in video game history.

												Loved it. This game does what I would like to see more of in every medium. It tells you lots by showing you a little, and it knows how to wield subtlety, and best of all it examines little interesting bits of the human condition--things that can resonate with all of us.All of this is done without explosions or zombies or something chasing you or a ticking clock or quicktime events or any noise like that. It's just a profound and interesting little short story not unlike any other well-written love story, but it's told in this really innovative way that gives me a lot of faith in the idea that games can be used to present thoughtful and artistic narratives and not just the same gritty hero's journey that we see all the time, and that it can make the story into the primary focus, rather than something that's wedged awkwardly into the gaps between combat arenas and puzzles.Thumbs up.

												The best game I've played in a long time. Gone Home is a perfect example of how gaming can be used as a storytelling medium. It's hard to say much without spoiling the plot, but it's a touching, relatable story that really draws you in. The gameplay is simple enough to not get in the way of the story but interesting enough to keep things interesting. Lastly, the voice acting is far above par, better than I could ever have guessed. I've already personally recommended it to several of my friends and even took time to write a review of it, which should say something. Stop wasting your time reasing this and go buy Gone Home.			"

												10/10 Would feel feels again.Actual Score: 7.5/10Picked this up on sale and did a bit of research by watching some walkthroughs to see how to play it and the best way to do so is to look at every item you can pick up and piece the side story from there. While it's game mechanic is not conventional it still has a distanct objective, interactivity and end state that is relaxing to play. Great main story and interesting side arcs which work well with the sound design and art style to make the game dripping with atmosphere and bring on the feels hard at moments. My gripes with this game are that I feel it is a little too pricy for the gametime but as I got it on sale i'll overlook this a bit and the main lead can come off as a bit superficial but otherwise a great way to tell a story of a 90's family through exploration. Aside from that pick this game up on sale if you're curious about exploration type games but on a small, intimate scale or if you like that already buy when full price.			"

												Pros:+ Very atmospheric+ Good voice acting+ Good graphicsCons:- Playtime is short- Lot of pointless exploration- Weak storyI'm not sure what this game was trying to be. It's not adventure. There are no puzzles. You literally walk around a big house during a storm looking for clues to retrace the steps of Samantha. It is very atmospheric and does a good job of providing a spooky mood. There are a lot of objects you can pick up and examine, but there are so many that don't help you progress that you'll find most of the time you spend in this game is picking up useless objects to examine them. I guess I would categorize this game as an exploration game more than anything. It's definitely not worth more than $5. I wouldn't buy it for anything more. Besides the atmosphere the whole experience felt meh. I'm not going to recommend this game simply as there are many better options out there for a cheaper price. "

												The best way to describe this game is ""missed opportunity.""  While, structurally, the game is sound, narratively it's about as interesting as a Lifetime movie.  There's little in the way of puzzles to solve, or really any challenge at all to distract from the simplicity of the storylines that are delivered through discovery.  And when I say ""discovery,"" I mean by coming across scraps of paper that practically jump out and yell ""READ ME!""  There are parts of the game that hint at a potential foil... a mysterious sub-sub-plot that threatens to sidetrack you in the realm of the supernatural.  You almost begin to anticipate it.  That hidden door that will turn things upside down and shift things into high gear.  But, then the game just ends, and you're left feeling cheated.If you love cheesy made for TV movies about forbidden relationships and daddy issues, and you simultanously enjoy spooky environments or ghost hunting shows, this is your game.  For everyone else... it may not be worth the space in your games library.			"

												Is it just me, or is the music for Gone Home eerily similar, if not identical to the David Fincher movie Gone Girl??Coincidence?? I think not!!Gone Home is a heavily narrative driven walking simulator. The entire game takes place in one evening in one house. The gameplay consists of standard ""walking simulator"" fare (walking, interacting with the environment, looking for clues) and listening to audio diaries.While not exactly heavy on the gameplay side, Gone Home's interactiveness (or what little of it Gone Home has, owing to it's linear narrative progression) transforms what might seem like a cutesy but cliched teenage ""coming of age"" story into something that you ""experience"", as much as you would ""experience"" a scavenger hunt.Short but sweet story with many cute quirks and heartfelt beats. 7/10			"

												Quick cash-grab with dull and cliche-filled story that goes in hand with meaningless 'artsy' walking simulators like Dear Esther. At least the latter has nice graphics that justify its existence as screenshot gallery source while Gone Home has nothing to it except for amateurish retelling of Shakespeare with homosexual flavour added in just to be a story that touches 'taboo' theme.

												A lot of negative reviews come from people not realizing what this game was. It's a short story in an interactive format. You explore a house and uncover information about what you missed while you were abroad. I found this game really relaxed (although at times a little creepy!) and I really found myself caring about what happened to my sister, Sam. While this game is very much a 'walking simulator' it tells a simple story very well. It's a story that many queer gamers can surely appreciate and relate to. It resonated exceptionally well with me and I loved every bit of it. I only wish there was more I could learn abous Sam and Lonnie, I want to know how their adventure goes!  Despite my praise, I do agree that the price tag is too high for the ~1-2 hour playtime. I'm reccommending with the understanding that if you buy it you should definately try to get it on sale!			"

												Due to the nature of the subject of the story, hardly any review will give you a straight answer as to what this 'game' is. It's a mediocre story, told in a poorly programmed, yet slightly interesting way.It sets itself up that you think you'll find most out by the objects you discover, but eventually, 90% of the story is directly told to you by automated voice over events. For a very low price, it's worth it, but be warned, the duration (and you'll see EVERYTHING) is less then an hour.			"

												Firstly, I genuinely do not understand why there is ONLY negative review on the game page that I can see. This game had me welling up.  I found it an immersive, and at times, intensely creepy game - you've never been to this house, but your family have lived here for a year. The creaks and the rain and thunder had me jumping. The story, which *is* the game, is beautiful and something that had me shedding a tear or two. It's fantastic, as a gay man, to play a properly made videogame centred around a gay protagonist. Add to that Riot Grrl, Heavens to Betsy, zines and the 90's and I was hooked. Is it worth 20EUR? Perhaps not, but it's definetly worth buying (i bought it on sale). It is ""short"" for the price, although it has way more story than most other games. I would definetly recommend it - however, dont expect fights, or boss battles, or levels. You explore the house. You go through rooms and piece together the story. That's it. And it's wonderful. Wonderful			"

												I liked this game a lot but I think I liked it because I only got it for $5 on sale and I think I would only recommend it at that price.  I don't enjoy horror games but my brother said he loved this so I gave it a go. At the start it sets it up to be a haunted house type of situation and so the whole time I was playing (total game play is like 1.5 hours if you look at everything) I was cringing and waiting for something to pop out at me. I was cringing all the way to the end. There was only one part where it is actually like a haunted house and that is just an easter egg down a passageway.Despite the lack of actual horror, I did enjoy this game although I'm not sure that I would have enjoyed it so much if I had known that there was no scary parts. Even right at the end I was waiting to see if anything would happen but yeah nothing scary really happens.I liked finding out what happens to your sister and I like learning about this family and caring about where they are and finding a condom in your dad's draw and actually going 'ew' like you would if you really found that at home. So, if you like short games at a pretty g price then you might like this. I like that its set in the 90s.			"

												A lot of people don't get the game. That's because you have to be very open-minded to play it. First of all, you have to see that as an experience, not a game. You cannot expect a big story and lots of scare, because that's not the focus. If you enter the heavy atmosphere you can really feel its objective. Just put yourself in it, without any distractions around. Play it like it's you in that situation. Then you're going to see that this game is unique because, different from other games, it's so close to our reality that it can immerse you and go deeper and deeper inside your feelings. Simply fantastic. 10/10			"

												Loved it. This game does what I would like to see more of in every medium. It tells you lots by showing you a little, and it knows how to wield subtlety, and best of all it examines little interesting bits of the human condition--things that can resonate with all of us.All of this is done without explosions or zombies or something chasing you or a ticking clock or quicktime events or any noise like that. It's just a profound and interesting little short story not unlike any other well-written love story, but it's told in this really innovative way that gives me a lot of faith in the idea that games can be used to present thoughtful and artistic narratives and not just the same gritty hero's journey that we see all the time, and that it can make the story into the primary focus, rather than something that's wedged awkwardly into the gaps between combat arenas and puzzles.Thumbs up.

ContextGone Home is an interesting game, that tries to make a full game out of Bioshock's characteristic environmental story-telling. Made by some of the same people, it simply tells the player the story of a 90s family, with a focus on a tennager's social/emotional life.To achieve that, the game uses everything at its disposal to display the scenery in a way that feels natural, and as if you were back in that era. I'll say that this was very well made, and I believe that they've achieved what they intended, for the most part. The overall experience, however, may not have quite hit the mark, for some people. I'll simply try to break it down to major points, as there is lots of different analysis on this game, due to its 2013 impact.Everyone seems to have taken a very personal stance with Gone Home, and many people have looked deeply into what meaning this game may have had, and claim that is what made it great. They also seem to overlook that many games employ this. They have subtle references and sidestories. However, since those aspects rarely get major attention, and few people look into that, it ends up being novel. Sometimes, it's not about the game itself, but the whole ambient created around them.There's a lot of different perspectives around it, and most were made by people far more intelligent and experienced than I am, and with a lot more research. But hey, this is just a game, and people look too closely into it, at times. I've beaten the game in 3 hours, with virtually everything explored, and spent the rest of the time alt-tabbed, reading reviews, and watching videos. Then, I took a week off of the game, and am now writing this review with a fresh-er mind.Anyway, that was just context! Here are some of my thoughts.General MechanicsGone Home is simply about exploring a house, mechanically. You pick up objects, rotate them looking for clues, read lots of notes, books, receipts, everything you can find, really. The only challenge present in the game is in the form of locked doors, or numbered-locks. You'll usually find the keys fairly close to where the lockpads are, and the doors are simply a way of guiding the player. I don't think it feels very forced. Or maybe that's my suspension of disbelief at work. Regardless, there isn't much to it, in way of mechanics and challenge. It's mostly reading, listening to diaries, and slowly piecing the different stories in your head.Un-realistic game elementsThis is a weird one to write about, since it did not affect me at all. However, since Gone Home is a game that doesn't focus on being a game, but a different way of telling a story, I have the impression that it will affect people who don't normally play video-games. This is simply put because they will not find it natural for these elements to be present.These elements are the locked doors, that seem to be locked arbitrarily, as a way of gating progress, and the most important one, how notes are literally everywhere.Notes are spread around all over the place, some being decades old, hence having no place under a bed, or in a table next to the telephone. Again, I can easily overlook this, but it is certainly a flaw when it tries to transcend video-games.Representing an eraNow, as I said, the game was set in the 90s, and felt like that 90s. And it does it in a very similar way to Bioshock, which I loved. That is, by representing the era with music cassettes, magazines, tv show posters, old VHS with recorded movies, etc. There's a whole lot of that. And the game is also well put together, in the sense that everything seems coherent with the tendencies of the time.It's a very nice way of presenting a setting, and I think they've certainly nailed it. The music cassettes were especially cool, since they were set up for you to find a play them in a room while you explored it.An ordinary story of family and teenage struggleThis is a highlight for many people, but a low point for me, personally. The stories revolve around a single family. It has marital issues, teenage emotional struggles, old parent relationships, the story of the house, etc. I really like the way its told, but I don't care. At all. Maybe I like empathy, but I couldn't care. The notes were very well placed and written, for the player to get the story bit by bit, without it feeling incoherent, or with too many words. However, it was simply not engaging to me. Contrast that with Bioshock's failed Utopias and progressions therein. Or Zeno Clash's strange worlds, Fallout, and I could go on...I like games (and books, series, etc.) that take me to new places, and ask some question that would never come in the real world. That's far more interesting to me. I can't be bothered with these mundane stories (sorry if I sound arrogant haha! It's not the intention), because it's not what I play games for. But this is very subjective, of course.Reliance on nostalgiaThis is a very important point I want to make. It's the 90s. Most of the positive reviews I've read/seen, were from people that were very aware of this era in their lives, and they related with the characters, as a result. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it must be considered. I haven't lived the 90s, meaning that I had very little connection with the game. Sure, I had some very vague memories, but it's not the same. Overall, I think there's a lot of the game that is supported by that familiarity, and that's also why it's often hit or miss. It was well executed, but it's only going to be truly meaning-ful, for the people who are nostalgic about all of the references, and general ambience that Gone Home gives.How the game medium excells in pacingThis is also something I find important, and the game took full advantage of it. In a book, or a movie, there's hardly a time to think, without pausing it, especially in the latter. You're constantly receiving information, and need to process it instantly.Quite a bit that can be lost in this way.If you start thinking about a certain scene, you'll probably lose a few other pieces of dialogue or another scene, etc.With Gone Home, due to it being a game, there's a lot more time to process that information, and also to relate to it, without compromising. It's interactive, in more ways than are obvious. I'm not talking about stopping exploration to think about it. I mean the seconds you would otherwise lose between actions. Even between picking up a note and putting it back down. Perhaps turning on the light, or opening a door.  All of this could be wasted time. However, it's time for you to think about the new notes you've read. What could have happened? Why did the character think that way? How does that relate to you?This is a very nice aspect inherent to the pacing in video-games. You can have the information spread around, and still be able to easily connect everything while you're playing, without making any compromises. And Gone Home uses it neatly.MiscellaniaI think that's all I wanted to add to the discussion. Overall, I think it's an incomplete experience. What it tries to do, it does wonderfuly! However, I think it relies too much on its theme and touchy subjects to make an impression on the player. It's a one-trick poney. All it does, is to apply the concept of environmental story-telling.There's also very little interactivity. You're merely a witness. You never actually do anything. And there were opportunities for that. Some scenes that look like the player could interact with a discover some neat secrets. Nope. None of that, missed opportunity.I was interesting to play, and read around it. For 20$, though, no, unless you want a different take on games, regardless of the 10/10s. If you just want something to play, this is definitely not for you.			"

												I bought Gone Home on its release day after following the Fullbright Company's blog for several weeks. Early 1990s aesthetics with queer themes and a riot grrl soundtrack? Of course I’m in!It's been more than a year since then and I still count Gone Home as one of my favorite games.Backstory:Gone Home came out at the beginning of my Junior year of college. I'd just moved into my own apartment (as opposed to the cramped dorms of the two previous years) and I was reveling in my newfound adulthood with utility bills, cramped bus stops, and a probable case of scurvy.Gone Home also came out in the same period that I did. Blah blah blah. Long story short: It was a challenging time in my life that I’ve navigated through slowly and with much consideration on what’s truly important -- not unlike in Gone Home.(Slight Spoiler Alert) I won’t say my circumstances mirrored Sam’s. I wasn’t a teenager in the 1990s -- Hell, I was still wearing neon stirrup leggings and plastic animal barrettes by the time Y2K was supposed to bring the world to its glorious robot-driven end (or something like that). But in listening to Sam’s audio diaries and sorting through her notes throughout the game I was overcome with this intense nostalgia and sadness that I’m sure all kids who have ever struggled with familial approval will recognize.I’m not quite sure I can put into words what Gone Home did for me on an affective level. Playing it was like coming home early after middle school and sneaking into my parents’ room to search through their bedside drawers for proof of vulnerability. It was humanizing and wonderful and very, very uncomfortable at some points (I’m referring to the game here mostly -- my own explorations were more a lesson in the “better left unknown” category).After the game ended (no spoilers I swear!) I curled up on my couch and cried for a good 20 minutes. Partly for the Greenbriar family. Partly for my own family. Partly because it was 3AM and I had a legal studies power lecture in four hours. Mostly because I found something special in Gone Home that I’d been looking for -- a LITERAL exploration of what it means to make a family out of individuals.Despite what I’ve said about my own personal connection to Gone Home, I truly don't believe you have to identify as LGBTQ and/or female in order to enjoy the game.  I'd actually really encourage people to try and broaden their horizens with narratives that may not be familiar to them. Spice of life, amiright?The narrative itself explores relationships among individuals with secrets and flaws (like in real life!) which is certainly a universal theme and as such can be appreciated by many. (((Though I will admit that having a queer female major character is, imho, awesome and definitely something I'd like to see more of.))) On a purely visual level, the graphics and the continuity of the mid-1990s aesthetic are outstanding. Like, EVERYTHING is so much fun to look at.Gameplay itself is intuitive and smooth with regular WASD movement controls and left/right clicking for further exploration/picking up/putting down objects. ALTHOUGH it should be noted that this game doesn't play particularly well with integrated graphics -- specifically on Windows 8 for reasons?The soundtrack is hands-down one of my all-time favorites as far as video games go (I even put it above Schyman’s Bioshock score) with Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, and The Youngins providing most of the Riot Grrrl ambiance. Even if punk or Riot Grrrl music isn’t your thing it just goes SO WELL with the narrative that you’ll find yourself bouncing along with it.All in all, I honestly believe Gone Home more than deserves its critical and public acclaim.THAT BEING SAID -- it should be noted that Gone Home has suffered majorly from certain segments of the gaming population who have specifically sought to discredit/negatively warp public reviews both on Steam and other public gaming review sites. This is most clearly visible in that while there are an overwhelming number of positive reviews versus negative reviews, the ""most helpful"" review section has been bombarded with massive numbers of thumbs up on the minority negative reviews. People who don't own/haven't played the game come to the Gone Home store page for the single purpose of voting down the positve reviews and voting up the negative. That's just a fact.Why?It's messy.And childish.And ultimately irrelevent to the fact that Gone Home is an excellent experience for those who are open to taking it as such.If the price is a bit steep (the one criticism I can agree with) then I suggest picking it up during a sale or borrowing a friend's library.And have fun for frack's sake.

Horror or camp fire stories?I enjoyed the story telling mechanics of Gone Home and for what its worth was done quite well. But the ending led to just more questions. The development team wasn't sure if they wanted to produce a horror game, point and click or walking simulator. If you can catch it for $5 bucks or less, its still a decent game for the story telling mechanic alone. But the story itself is passable. This somewhat sounds contradictory but trust.3/5			"

												I love these artsy, so-called 'walking simulators' that seemed to start with Dear Esther. Gone Home seperates itself by actually having a concrete cohesive storyline that is quite touching. I also really loved the nostalgic revisit of the 1990's, which is a period where I was actually a teenager.Heres the problem though - the game is totally worth your two or three hours, but is unfortunately not worth twenty bones. I got it on sale, and am not bitter, but would be if I paid full price. This is worth ten bucks, no more, IMO. There really isn't much replayability, which is fine, but two to three hours for twenty bucks is really hard to justify.			"

												I haven't enjoyed many point and click type adventures before - this is something different though.  The graphics are mediocre, not bad, but that's not the point.  The audio, is however good.  The sense of adventure is majestic.The game is a story.  And its not one I even want to talk about.  This game is touching.  At the end I feel like I have grown in my understanding and empathy for people.  I feel like I have a new friend.  Its quite odd.  I don't know how a bunch of nerdy game developers came up with this, but I am impressed.  I highly recommend this game, it is excellent.  I have only one complaint, its short.  Its like a good but short book.  Its over, you feel like you've said goodbye to a good friend forever, and that's that.  Too bad.  So play it, buy it, enjoy it.			"

												Gone Home... I can't even put into words how much I loved this game. I cried, like legitimately cried. You play the game reliving Sam's memories through different items and notes you find throughout the house. I highly recommend this game to anybody who just wants to grab a cozy blacket, a cup of hot tea/choco, and just play a short interactive heart-warming story. I hope you enjoy this game because I definitely did!			"

												I write this review because the many downvotes may keep away some of you who could actually enjoy this game. Playing Gone Home is not a very intense experience, you just explore a story by walking through the mansion. Which sounds boring but actually it is cool. The upside of this kind of storytelling is that you will be much more part of the story than just reading or watching the same thing. At a certain point I got really excited where the story is going.			"

												You arrive home after a year abroad in the middle of the night, only to find that your family is gone. Confused as to what happened, you begin to explore your family's house, hoping to find answers. However, while exploring the house's twisting hallways, you will not find a game that was worth purchasing. Gone Home is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. I read through critic scores and hypothesized that it must be an amazing game. ""An amazing story!"" ""Such superb design!"" ""I loved every moment of it!"" After an hour of wandering halls, reading through papers, finding keys and unlocking doors, I finally finished the game... and that's it. No flash, no bang, just a story that was pieced together through exploring a home. If anything, this game feels like BioShock if all it consisted of was listening to audio logs and exploring Rapture for a 60 minutes. Gone Home is far from boring. Piecing together the story and exploring the large home is quite enjoyable. The stories sprawled throughout the home will probably intrigue you. However, Gone Home is also far from being worth its $19.99 price tag. I finished the game in about an hour and I have absolutely no urge to replay it. I would not recommend this game unless its price tag goes down to under $10. It's just not worth what it's priced at. Not worth it at all.			"

												I'm honestly a little confused about this game. Gone Home got a lot of media attention, so I figured it must be a good game, especially since it is short. The masses let me down in this case.At the start of the game, I actually thought Gone Home was going to be a horror game. It's not, so you can breathe easy. At several points I still expected the story to take a dark turn. That might actually have been better than the ill-fitting ending that is given. It's not that the ending is bad, it is just too far removed from the tone set at the beginning of the game. The gameplay is at best unoriginal, and at worst boring. That'd be fine if the story was amazing, but it's not. The story, like the gameplay, ranges from unoriginal to boring. Yes, technically, if you combine all the game elements, this is a unique adventure game. But unique does not equate to good.If you must play this for yourself to appease your pop culture sensibilities, it is a short enough game to do so. But if you can ignore the bizarre amount of hype around Gone Home, pass on it. You're not missing much.			"

												Frist off, I want to say that i think a bit of empathy and williness to be reflective about your personal feelings goes a long way. If you're tryin to be a macho man, this game isn't for you.Secondly, I got this practically for free since i recieved it in a Humble Bundle package with the game i was actually paying for, Prison Archetect. That may cause my review to be a little off center because i'm not considering price. I'd probably never have played it otherwise. Also All i see is people feeling ripped off cause they payed full price. Well Why the hell would you just blindly buy a game with out researching it, ya dingus? If you got money to throw away on impulse buys, check out my wishlist and help a brotha out. I knew nothing about Gone Home other than that GamerGate stuff. I dont know about that, i couldn't care less. I like making up my own mind about things before bashing them; hell, i've read the first Twilight book (and only the first, yuck) because i'm stubborn like that. That said, I had a great time playing this game and it hit me right in the feels.Anyway, there really isn't a whole lot to this game. Explore your home and try to peice together why your family isn't home. I almost didn't play it at first because i'm a wimp and can't make it through scary games. I mean, you start off in a mansion where no one is home on a stormy night; thats pretty much how every ghost story ever starts. But it turns out that it's only scary on the surface. I mean, there are a few sound effects and stuff that are unnesesarily creepy and it's like they used them to intentially create a creepy vibe, even though its not a scary game. Still, we've all been at home alone at night before and that can get creepy sometimes. I know we've probably all turned the televison on as background noise to scare away the ghosts, There are a few red herrings that make it seem like things are about to get scary, but the game explains them away almost instantly. It's actually funny. Once i got over my fear and saw that this wasnt a haunted house, i began digging around. I'm pretty good at this stuff as i'm a nosey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. When i was a child I used to dig around in every drawer and closet i could so it was all very natural. Also like my childhood, it's set in 1995 so there's tons of references both large and small. My favorite in particular was when a young boy's mother called video game cartridges ""tapes"". That one took me wayy back. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:After much digging around, several stories began to unfold. you really begin to feel for these characters you never actually meet. I found myself rooting for the dad, wishing for the mom to cut dat♥♥♥♥♥♥out and for Sam to find true love. As the story unfolds there is kind of a sad sweetness to how sam is discovering who she is and what she really wants. despite sexual orientation, theres a lot of truth to that in all of our days growing up.in the end, this game does something that really makes me love it. It made me feel. Cliche, right? I mean it-- i haven't played a game or watched a movie in a long while that has made me stop and reflect upon my own life and also feel for fictional people.Sure, it was slightly predictible that Sam was leaning toward the homosexual side from the first few letters you find and once you realize lonnie has interest in the military, you'll know where your sister ran off to. That didn't stop the ending from being beautiful and bitter sweet and causing me to  shed a few tears. Only two and a half though because i'm a macho man.Also, that ♥♥♥♥♥ Sam owes me 40 bucks for pizza.			"

												While I appreciate trying out different game mechanics in this case the experiment failed.The story wasn't particularly interesting or surprising as in you pretty much know how it will end after hearing around a quarter of it. The ""psycho house"" atmosphere makes you hopeful if it will be somehow included in the story but turns out, like most interactions, its pointless.Arguably this isn't even a game since it has no real puzzles or failure modes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but something to be aware of.My recommendation: Instead of spending two hours on this, read a book or a short story.			"

												(I'm going to attempt to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but that's kind of hard, since some of the reasons I love this game so much are kinda spoiler-y.)     Where do I even start with this? I was pretty skeptical because of all the negative reviews this got, but I picked it up on sale anyways. I was already pretty aware of how part of the story goes, thanks to some spoiler-y things online, so that was a bit of an incentive. What I wasn't aware of, though, was the actual ending. Watching this entire story unfold was great! No, this is definitely not the game for you if you're expecting enemies, combat, bosses, or jumpscares. This isn't a horror game. It's definitely got a spooky feel to it, though, which is really nice.     On the topic of the story, I really saw a lot of my friends and myself in this game. The strong teenage emotions, the parents that just don't understand, the feeling of needing to rebel against how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ society is. You basically get to unfold how the sister, Sam, dealt with all of this. It's hard to be more descriptive without giving away a huge plot point.Okay, I'll just come out and say it, if you're in the LGBT+ community, you'll probably at least somewhat appreciate the story in this game. Even if you're not, there's still a good chance that you'll enjoy the story.     The main reason I see people♥♥♥♥♥♥talking this lovely game is because of how the media handled it. Apparently it was overplayed, oversold, given reviews that were ""too good."" Honestly, if you're just bitter because of politics and/or ""game journalism,"" you need to get that♥♥♥♥♥♥outta here. Let people praise this game if they want to.     Do I think it's worth $20? Ehh, that's debateable, which is why I played it safe and picked it up while it was on sale. If you happen to catch this for like ten dollars or less, I'd say go for it. Give it a try. Just don't go in expecting hardcore action or anything spooky happening or whatever. This is a game about exploration. It's a 3D interactive storybook. If you know that before getting into it, you'll be much more satisfied.TL;DR: Good exploration game with a lovely story that gave me butterflies. Price is meh, so you might wanna grab it on sale.

												You know the phrase ""Don't start something unless you intend to finish it""?  Well clearly the makers of this so called ""game"" didn't heed those words.  This ""game"" is not really a game at all.  The entire time you are playing, all you do is walk through a really big house looking for notes your sister left laying around.  Each time you find a note it plays an audio version of the main character's sister's journal.  The gameplay, such as it is, is just fine in and of itself.  I'm fine with walking around clicking on things, looking at them, and putting them back.  I turn on lights, open doors, open cabinets, flush the toilet, turn on a noisy fan, and that's about it. Sure there are a couple of casette tapes you can put into tape players to play some music, but don't expect more than one song to play from them.  That really is the entire game, and like I said I'm fine with that.  Interaction is a good thing.  What I'm not fine with is the story in the game.  And it's not even lame cliched controversial subject matter of the story that irks me.  What irks me is the ending, or lack there of.  Seriously it's like you are reading a book with 10 chapters.  You get to chapter 10 and instead of summing things up for an ending, there is nothing.  Um... did the makers of this game forget something?  Like, I don't know, maybe putting an ending to the story at the end of the story?  And IGN gave this game the PC Game of the Year award?  Wow...			"

												Gone Home is a lot different than what I was expecting, There are many who have, and will, play this game and not find it at all amusing. The story is not telling anything new, the gamplay is lacking for a videogame, and you can complete it in about 2 hours with probably very little incentive to ever go back. It's no wonder why there are a ton of metacritic user reviews who abhor this title.And yet I found myself fascinated with it when I was done. Sure, it is short, and its focus is the story over gameplay, but I was immersed in the experience. I don't want to give too much away about Gone Home and its story. As you may have read from the game's description, it is about a young girl named Katie who has returned from a one year trip in Europe. It's around one in the morning on June 7th, 1995, and no one is home. You'll learn why by exploring your home and figuring out the pieces. Gone Home is not a title for everyone, and you need to understand that it is trying to tell a short story through an interactive experience. If that is something that does not interest you, then you will want to pass on this. The gameplay is very simple; you walk around using either the arrow keys or w,a,s,d, and you pick things up and examine items with your left and right mouse buttons. There are other commands for checking your items, map, and journal entries, but not much of anything else. Overall, by the time I was done playing this game it did leave me with a strong impression. It definitely reminds me of Dear Esther, except the fact that I actually wanted to finish Gone Home. (Nothing against Dear Esther, but it didn't hold my attention for too long). Perhaps my reason behind enjoying this game was due to the fact that, with an industry overwhelmed with a lot of violent and action oriented titles, it's sort of neat to find one that takes several steps back to just being plain, not over the top, and very leveled. It showed me a different type of way to experience a videogame. A lot of players have given this game a very negative response, which is sad because I think that most of that resentment comes from the fact that this game didn't conform to what they define a videogame to normally be. (To be fair, the gameplay is very minimal in its design and execution.)When I was done this game, I wanted to share this title with a few of my other friends to get their perspectives on it, so with that logic I have to say I did, and do recommand Gone Home, but very catiously. First, this game is more of an experience than anything else, and second of all I have to admit that the $20 price tag is a bit steep, especially considering the fact that most people will probably only get 2 hours out of the whole experience. So I recommand it, but only when it's on sale.			"

												Putting aside the fame/infamy of this game and going into it skeptical and with an open mind, with the sneaking suspicion that I probably wouldn't care for it, I actually got engrossed immediately and couldn't put it down once I started. I see that all the reviews on the store page are negative, but yes, I really rather enjoyed this game. I didn't even think I would, but I did. I feel like the press made a bigger deal of this game than it probably deserved, and that the reviews I see here seem to be backlashing against that. People should just take it for what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. And what it is is an enjoyable little game. So with that said, here's why I like it:It's a personal and touching story presented in an interesting way. I myself like to examine every little object in every little room in whatever game I play, so the gameplay happens to tailor to me in that way. I found it appealing to be alone in this empty house examining every little thing and getting some little details into the story, a glimpse into this family's lives and personalities and flaws and desires. It's all pretty intricate, and there's a lot that can be missed. I think it was pretty cool to see the story of this family unfold before my eyes without any of them actually being there. It's a personal experience for you, and the character you play as, since you are the only one there in this empty house, and to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here you just have to poke around and look at all the ordinary little objects in each room. Just about every mudane little thing in the house tells some sort of story, and that's what was so fascinating about this whole game. That, and the lonley atmosphere and realism. Although, the ineraction of the characters via notes may be a little strange.And on that note, I feel like it would have worked more in the game's favor if there weren't voiceover journals. I think you should have just read them; that really would have drove home the whole indirect, subtle storytelling thing. Granted, the voiceover brings you closer to the character, makes her more relatable and adds some dramatic flair. But it would kind of take me out of it when it happened. Like, how am I hearing this right now? And it breaks the silence.But anyway, even though I liked the game and am recommending it, $20 is honestly perhaps asking a little too much for it, considering that it's pretty short. It's worth experiencing though, and I enjoyed what I played. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so I certainly feel like I got my money's worth. And I feel like $20 might actually kind of be worth it anyway, considering a new DVD costs around $20 and typically takes like half the time to complete. In terms of sheer quantity of entertainment by length of time, I think $20 is fair. That is, if you think buying a new DVD is (and this has the added benefit of being interactive, and thus more personal to you). Maybe you don't. Maybe you should wait for a sale. Or maybe you shouldn't buy it at all. As for me, I liked it. Maybe you will too. ♥♥♥♥ all these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, be openminded and judge it for yourself if you really are curious. I mean, $20 isn't even that much money anyway, and I happened to like it. There are worse things you can spend $20 on. I thought this was pretty good. Sue me, ♥♥♥♥♥es. I ain't a part of yo system.

												To begin this short charade of a review on Fullbright's ""Gone Home,"" I mean to state that it will not be long, as the game took me roughly one sitting to complete. I reccomend this game, I merely think that the 7$ I shelled out for it is not worth it. You can basically get the exact same experience by watching a Let's Play, save for the puzzles. Its love story was touching, truly, and I really enjoyed it. I have yet to see another game progress with such a pathos. 9/10- torrent it if you want to try, but please support Fullbright. I believe a sequel to this emotional masterpiece is in perfect order.			"

												Short, sweet, great atmosphere, and nostalgic.  One of my personal favorites of the year.  Recommended for anyone who doesn't mind a fun little interactive story, just don't go into it thinking you'll be doing much as there is no violence, bloodshed etc.  It's just a fun little mystery that takes place in the mid-90's.  Game only takes about 2-3 hours to finish, so it's perfect for anyone who doesn't have alot of time to game.			"

												I love walking simulators, but this ""game"" if you can call it that, isn't mysterious, it isn't beautiful, it isn't thought provoking, its like reading a book when I clearly wanted to play a video game. You spend your hour walking through a house reading bits of paper. The whole, ""where is everybody"" feeling dissolves after ten minutes. Its clear to me that the devs didn't know where they wanted this game to go. Pretty sure they even quote in the game, ""Jack of all trades, master of none"". Well that is just spot on. This game tries to have a mystery, it tries to have a story, it tries to be eerie at times, it tries to make you feel something for this person going through an every day struggle that is so overused in this day and age, and it just fails at all of them.

												Gone Home is not a game for people who rush. It is not a game for people who ignore details and speed past story to get to quest markers. Gone Home is a story told through journal snippets and personal artifacts that pulls you in and makes you care about people, all without actually showing a single one. It's a game that asks you to slow down, to piece together the lives of those who have passed through and left their mark, and to stop and think about the fallout each event has on those involved.No crying until the end.

Posted: January 26, 2014
												Revised and full review.Mentioned several times during 2013’s Game of the Year award, this indie-title tries a different approach to storytelling than most games.In Gone Home, you play a family member that enters the home returning from a longer trip. Things have happened while you were gone. You discover what exactly by exploring the house and picking up various items that are scattered in the rooms. Every time you do, you learn something about your family or yourself, like puzzle pieces slowly coming together.Wandering through the house worked extremely well for me as my curiosity took over. It feels almost like reading a forbidden diary. That being said, this game does not feature a lot of other typical game mechanics: There are no puzzles, no challenges - except searching and picking up stuff - that is practically the only game mechanic. Gone Home’s main focus clearly lies on telling the player a story and using the game environment as a tool to do so - and that works excellent. It is an example that interactive media can offer mature and sensitive entertainment and does not have to feature traditional game mechanics to be an immersive experience.But with the games nature come a few things to take into consideration:I found that I best enjoyed and comprehended the story while finishing the game in one sitting, basically instead of watching a movie.This also tells you that the game is not very long: As there is hardly any challenge you can basically walk through the game, and once you know the story, thats it. As the asking price for the game is around 20,- US$, you feel like you don’t get your moneys worth. If it would cost as much as a movie ticket, it would be fairer in my opinion, as it offers around the same value of entertainment. The overall length, the overall theme and the lack of typical challenge based mechanics also means that Gone Home is a very approachable game for people who usually don’t play games or don’t see their appeal. Taking this into account Gone Home offers an excellent stepping stone into interactive entertainment for people who never thought games could be interesting to them.			"

												Really short? Yes.Not a lot of gameplay? Yes.Graphics are nothing special? Definitely.Worth every minute? Absolutely.Gone Home is the story of Katie Greenbriar, who's just come home to a new house and missing little sister. You need to help Katie figure out what exactly happened, and where her sister has gone.This is an amazing story of discovery and hardship. The discovery of the truth flows forth so naturally with the gameplay that I often caught myself getting personally wrapped up in the story's conclusion, which is something I can't say for many games.Gone Home is probably one of the best story games I've ever played. Yeah, it was short, but the story was so well written I didn't care. It was much like playing a truely interactive movie. A unique experience that no one should pass up.			"

												Gone Home is a beautifully-crafted story that slowly unfolds as you explore this empty house. The voice acting work is superb, and the details you can discover can really start to make you feel like this is your family, and they're gone. What happened?The gameplay may be limited to exploration, but I think it serves as a gentle reminder that we are not always the protagonists, even in our own lives. We have to stop and piece together other people's stories, too. This story is a very strong and moving one. Highly recommended, especially on sale.			"

												Gone Home is a first-person interactive story adventure set in 1995. The premise is that you have 'gone home' on a stormy night to a new house that your family have moved into whilst you have been away travelling. You arrive home to discover that the house is empty, and you must try and find out why no-one is there.This story gives off a bit of a creepy vibe initially, and I have to say that I found it a little off-putting. I played this game through recommendation, and I don't like playing psychological thrillers which is where I thought this game was going to go. Thankfully, that is not what this game is - even though it has its creepy moments, and does hint at something sinister going on around the house, this just isn't the case in terms of the overall story.Ultimately the story is about family, and how you unravel the details about your family from finding 'clues' around the house - audio narrated journals, letters, books, brochures, etc. The audio journals are beautifully voice acted by Sarah Grayson, and really draw you into the story.If the story hadn't have been so engrossing (purely because of the audio journals), I think I would have been a little bored playing this. Objects that you could look at around the house weren't frequent or interesting enough to keep my attention. Certainly the house had a nice nostalgic feel to it, but it would have been better if you could have interacted with far more around the house. After opening drawers and cupboard doors to find the same 'absolutely nothing' over and over, it did often feel like a bit of a chore.This game is available on Steam at a cost of £14.99, and as far as I'm concerned this price is absolutely extortionate. Though I enjoyed the game, I completed it in less than 90 minutes having looked, I feel, quite thoroughly at the objects the game gave me to look at. Having bought games on Steam for £6.99 that I've played for more than 20 times longer, I don't really see how they can justify this price.If there had been more to interact with around the house, even if it was being able to look at clothes in cupboards, or being able to flick through channels on TV, or to play more music in the house, anything at all, maybe then it would have been worth a higher price-tag as it would have kept you involved in the environment for much longer. I understand the house was bare because your family hadn't long since moved in there, but it just felt far too under-developed. I appreciate that the game is about the story, and not the house, but if more time had been invested in making the house more realistic and accessible, it would have made it a much more well-rounded package overall.Ultimately, if you're after a short game to get your teeth into with a very well delivered story-line, this will be one that you want to try out, though I heartily recommend you wait until it's on sale because I think you'll be disappointed at paying full price for such a short experience, however well it delivers that experience.

This is no spoiler as the tags for this game are: exploration, story rich, interactive fiction, narration, romance, realistic and relaxing. It really is a relaxing, romantic and comforting experience that I'd recommend getting at a discount (I bought it during the 2015 summer sale and think the full price is a little high).

												Unique storytelling experience for modern gaming. Admittedly, I didn't feel as impressed as many critics were, Although it was nice to get a single well fleshed out character and a few other characters that have a little bit of story, it would be better if all the characters stories were fully realized instead of realized in periphery. This game is entirely about these characters, so I expect that element to be explored completely and I was disappointed. It also seems to be a game with a political agenda, which will make the game even less fun to play in the future as the issue will be less interesting. Look up this issue if you're considering playing the game. I won't spoil it.			"

The story will develop as you explore the house and interact with items, and the level of depth and immersion associated with these interactions is genuine and thought-provoking. Also, Gone Home is not a horror game, though it is eerie at times.$20.00 is a high price to pay for an experience that will last two or three hours depending on your thoroughness. If you are willing to pay $20.00 for an unforgettable experience, please consider adding Gone Home to your collection.

												(I'm going to attempt to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but that's kind of hard, since some of the reasons I love this game so much are kinda spoiler-y.)     Where do I even start with this? I was pretty skeptical because of all the negative reviews this got, but I picked it up on sale anyways. I was already pretty aware of how part of the story goes, thanks to some spoiler-y things online, so that was a bit of an incentive. What I wasn't aware of, though, was the actual ending. Watching this entire story unfold was great! No, this is definitely not the game for you if you're expecting enemies, combat, bosses, or jumpscares. This isn't a horror game. It's definitely got a spooky feel to it, though, which is really nice.     On the topic of the story, I really saw a lot of my friends and myself in this game. The strong teenage emotions, the parents that just don't understand, the feeling of needing to rebel against how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ society is. You basically get to unfold how the sister, Sam, dealt with all of this. It's hard to be more descriptive without giving away a huge plot point.Okay, I'll just come out and say it, if you're in the LGBT+ community, you'll probably at least somewhat appreciate the story in this game. Even if you're not, there's still a good chance that you'll enjoy the story.     The main reason I see people♥♥♥♥♥♥talking this lovely game is because of how the media handled it. Apparently it was overplayed, oversold, given reviews that were ""too good."" Honestly, if you're just bitter because of politics and/or ""game journalism,"" you need to get that♥♥♥♥♥♥outta here. Let people praise this game if they want to.     Do I think it's worth $20? Ehh, that's debateable, which is why I played it safe and picked it up while it was on sale. If you happen to catch this for like ten dollars or less, I'd say go for it. Give it a try. Just don't go in expecting hardcore action or anything spooky happening or whatever. This is a game about exploration. It's a 3D interactive storybook. If you know that before getting into it, you'll be much more satisfied.TL;DR: Good exploration game with a lovely story that gave me butterflies. Price is meh, so you might wanna grab it on sale.

												Gone Home is one of the best examples of the walking simulator genre. It has a single story it wants to tell, and it tells it well. More importantly, however, it sets up an atmosphere and a world that is worth exploring every nook and cranny to get as many details as possible. While there's one overarching story, there are plenty of side stories that all add depth to these characters and their relationships with each other. These character moments cover the whole emotional spectrum: I often found myself laughing one minute at a silly detail that made the characters very real in my mind, only to feel heartbroken minutes later by one of the background stories and the context it brings to the whole venture. I won't bring up any particular story moments since this game is best explored without any knowledge of what to expect, but I will say that every additional detail you find is rewarding. Completionists will find an extra level of depth that makes the experience feel satisfying.When I played this game, I was living abroad in Scotland for University. The story of our protagonist coming home from school only to find the house empty and having to put together the details for herself...yeah, that hit me. I carried myself into the game, and I was rewarded for it with a story I still remember years later. If you enjoy this style of game, do yourself a favor and get it already. It's absolutely worth it.			"

												*What is Gone Home? - a bread-crumb trail simulator!*Is Gone Home scary? - No....the only thing scary is the atmosphere (empty house, middle of the night, no lights on, & heavy storm outside), suspicious notes, and your own imagination of the unknown...*How long of a game is Gone Home? - short, my personal playthrough clocked in at a little over 2 hours.*What does Gone Home try to accomplish? - tell a story to the player...that's about it!*Do you recommend Gone Home? - Yes....when it's on sale...Gone Home would be best descrided as a vitural installation piece (much like Thirty Flights of Loving or Dear Esther) that tells a story via a trail of notes and pages littered throughout the house you walk through (the bread-crumb trail).  As you follow the trail, searching for notes, pages, photos, etc. you'll discover where and what happened to your family.  From time to time, narration from your sister will play as key notes are found thourghout the house.  The house is full of 90's memorabilia, intended for nostalgia, which I can't deny being a nice touch (since the story takes place in 1995).  The focus of Gone Home is a story through and through.  I found the story to be solid in what The Fullbright Company were trying to accomplish (a bit campy at some parts, but solid).  The voice acting is solid and believable, invoking suspicion early on, and later going down the romantic route (think more the ending/last episode of Friends; 90's referrance, see what I did there? :P).Gone Home is not a game for everyone.  If you take it for what it is, you will find an enjoyable (if short, with very little replayablity) story to be told here.  The story is not placed directly in front of the player's face, but chopped up and scattered in little pieces giving it a unique story-telling method (this being the most-likely cause for Gone Home's critical reviews).I would recommend trying Gone Home... when it goes on sale.  It is a very difficult to recommend this virtual installation at full price, under the basis of the story alone and evaulating the ""consumer's playtime versus game cost.""  I personally enjoyed it, it was short, but I found myself going through it, wanting to know what would come next in the story and continued to the follow the bread-crumb trail.  It has an interesting story-telling mechanic, that does what it attempts to accomplish well.-Try it-Play it-Enjoy			"

												I've seen some negative reviews for this game, but mine won't be one. Those saying that the walking&touching game is a waste of money are just missing out a new trend in game industry, which is the walking simulator. In ""Dear Esther"" you take in the gorgeous island landscape with its ocean, sunset, hidden caves and waterfalls. In ""Gone Home"" you have a grand old house all for yourself to explore, really creepy and squeaky at times, and at some points you almost expect the old uncle ghost to jump out at you. This is not a puzzle game, nor an action or a scaretale. There's no dialogue. It's all a story, threading from room to room while you're collecting dots and trying to find where your parents and sister have gone. The story is more about the sister, though, who we get to know through her notes, books and schoolbooks, horrid music tapes, tales she wrote, her photos and feminist brochures. It's a game to relax and think, reflect on the characters' fates and the issues they raise, deduct their past and present and accept it. It's like visiting a friend's home when he or she is away and only things can tell stories. So yes, I do recommend this game, and I thank the developers for a beautiful, very 90s, Twin Peaks-ish, Walt Whitman-ish and Life Is Strange-ish ride. I got this game during a promotion, so no regrets here either. We do pay to go watch a movie, don't we? So here's a good one!			"

												Its an interactive audiobook, too much time was spent building up the atmosphere and not enough time spent building the story. I don't really care who Oscar is, he is pretty much irrelevant, but for some reason half the documents around the place are about him, and the other half are about the character's dad's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fiction books.Along with a few strategically placed The Holy Bibles, so you know for sure that the parents hate gays, in case ""my parents hate gays"" wasn't enough of a hint. by the way, the parents hate gays. Just in case that wasn't obvious.There isn't any pay off, no interesting ending, which is fine, but it was still lamely executed. Firewatch gave strong reasons for the player's actions, but Gone Home felt more along the lines of ""well the game hasn't rolled its credits yet, so I guess it isn't finished, so more walking to do""			"

												Actually I bought this game on summer sale 2016, ofc not full price and in my opinion you have to do the same if you think it's not worth to waste the money on walking simulator and few hours game and if you are here for collecting badges or game.But I think if you buy this game in full price, it worth for each well-designed room, story (maybe if you like this kind of genre―you know what), and to give a thank to company for all your tears. If there was a neutral option between yes or no, I pick it! I recommend this game because of the house and permission for messing around there.me :   *I am not here for the story*  I just messing around, believe me   *5sec smile*   "

												Gone Home is much less of what I would call a ""game"" but more of an example of completely immersive interactive storytelling.   Wandering though an empty house, Rumaging through drawers for scraps of paper and consequencely discovering information about Katie's absent family feels very ""just so"". From the little bits of information and the occasional voiced journal from Katie's sister Sam, you get taken on an emotional journey of struggle, love, adolescences, and at the same time an emotional journey of your very own. I don't think this game is for everyone. There are very few puzzles to be solved, no monsters to fight and no achievements to be won. The whole game depends on your personal curiosity to find out about the family, and if you don't have the patience or will to spend hours picking up every darn tissuebox in the house then this game is not for you. But if you do manage to go through it like I did. You find the good in one or two hours spent looking around in the nostalgic 1995 setting the spookyness of walking alone in a dark hallway, some very real characters (especially Katie's sister Sam), and a great love story.

												It's basically a young adult short story translated into a game-like medium, something a little like Dear Esther. There is one core narrative that drives exploration in the game, but there are a couple of other side stories inferred by documents and objects that can be found here and there, and some non-interactive objects offer mute testimony that would be heavy-handed in a written story.Don't go into it expecting a horror story, unless you're a parent. There are elements there, but ultimately they're the same kind you could find in your own darkened, empty home.Gone Home isn't without flaws, however. Even ignoring the voiceovers that interrupt now and then, the main story is about as subtle as a tack-hammer to the head, and there's no real closure on any of the satellite stories. The 'search everywhere' approach that the game encourages and an odd design choice makes it possible to short-circuit the whole thing by examining the front hall too thoroughly.I enjoyed it. It does funny things with the interface on occasion, the stories were engaging, and I have a -thing- for exploring. It -is- short though: roughly two hours, if you're digging through every cupboard, so if you're a stickler for some kind of time:money ratio, wait for a sale.			"

												I want to give a concise, effective, and interesting review of Gone Home, but I'm not sure I can do it.Do I like it? Yes. Why? Well, that's not so simple.Technically, this game is fairly unremarkable. The graphics are fine, the controls are so simple that it would have been a feat to screw them up, the music does its job properly but doesn't amaze. To be honest, that's by and large how it goes - every component of the game is perfectly sufficient to do its job but fails to go above and beyond what is expected.The sole exception to that, from a technical standpoint, is the level design. While it all takes place in one ""level,"" the house that is the setting is masterfully designed to direct the player towards the next step of the journey while never feeling too restrictive. It directs the player in a linear experience while feeling like it is the player themself who is deciding where to go next (with a few notable, but natural exceptions).Of course, this is a story-driven game, so the technical aspects might be considered secondary for its appeal, but even there I am not as completely and utterly amazed as some reviewers have been. The story itself is good, and the way its told is interesting and novel. It is this narrative delivery (something that is inextricably tied to the aforementioend level design) that deserves the most praise. Unfortunately, a narrative delivery mechanism alone is not enough to carry a game, and while the narrative it delivers is good, it left me wanting. I got the sense that when I reached the end of the game, what I had really reached was the end of the first act of a bigger story. I appreciate the attempt for an open-ended narrative, but I felt that much of the most interesting content in the story was what happened next. This disappointed me.Of course, when the biggest quibble is that there isn't enough of something, obviously whatever is happening, it's doing something right. So, overall, yes, I would recommend this game. Specifically, I recommend it to people who enjoy exploration narratives with a heavy character focus, clever design, and impressive atmosphere. If you're looking for engaging gameplay, epic story, massive worlds, or anything besides an interesting, small story, do not look here, because you will be left wanting. If however, you come to this seeking a small piece of beautiful, understandable, relatable humanity, give Gone Home a try.			"

												In Gone Home, you play as an older sibling returning home after a year abroad. During your absence, your family has inherited and moved into an old manor.The entire game consists of exploring the house and discovering the story at your own pace. Gone Home lets you enter one family's personal space and uncover their lives. This may sound boring, and that would be true if this were your average video game house, but the environment is so damn detailed and, well, real. Each corner contains stuff to examine. You'll find notes, drawings, or various objects in drawers, underneath beds, everywhere.This unprecedented realism is also present in the story. Things that would seem boring in your typical bro game, like childhood friendship, coming of age, or marital problems, are abundant in Gone Home. This game has some top notch character development despite the fact that all you do is rummage around a house. You can’t help but be interested in the lives of this family. It’s so much more real than any other game.This game is one of the best in terms of environmental storytelling. It delivers a bold, expertly executed experience unlike anything else. The fact that each player pieces the plot together in his or her own way encourages discussion. I've easily spent more time discussing the game than playing it.			"

												Gone Home creates a great atmosphere that encourages you to explore and uncover a story, all without worrying about combat.  I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing its story.It is a short game (~2hrs), but I actually didn't mind that.  It’s a concise story and I feel that prolonging it or making it any more complex would have taken from the experience.  With that said, I enjoyed the simple, relaxed gameplay and would have happily spent another 2hrs exploring if the story could have supported it.I'll be keeping an eye on the developer/publisher for similar games.

Having lived in Portland and Seattle as well, many of the posters and venues described were more than familiar to me and kept me wanting to know more about Sam's life.Yeah, it's a short game, but hell, I spend more than its full price when I go to see a movie which lasts about the same amount of time and which I garner the same amount of entertainment out of.Look, if you're a homphobic neckbeard who haunts chan boards, or a teenage Call of Duty player, this game isn't for you. But for some of us, it's a wonderful piece of art and nostalgia. For fans of games like Dear Esther or The Longest Journey, that wrap you up in the story of the inhabitants of their worlds and leave you wanting more when they're over , its a must buy.			"

												Not going to lie, this game is pretty average.The way the story unfolds is more of a detective looking for clues rather than a big sister worried about her missing little sis. The story itself is not bad but a bit pretensious and overly done.For the full price of £14.99 this game is a rip off, it took me 1.4 hours to complete and that was looking in every nook and cranny picking up everything I could find (The ""Puzzles"" are super simple and I kept expecting to find hidden things) and even at sale price (£4.49) its still pretty expensive for less than two hours of relative boredom.I dont mean to sound harsh but it leaves a lot to be desired.

												If you love over dramatized teen angst mixed with the classic my parents hate me, and I am a closeted lesbian..then you will love this game it's the whole package. However if you prefer a more true to life representation of being a teenager, what it's like to really be a member of the LGBTQ community seek your experience elsewhere, because this is a story that doesn't even land in the ballpark nevermind the mark. I found the story and game beginning to end to be flat, predictable, and frankly overpriced, pretenious dribble. Minutes and money that I can never get back.			"

												I haven't enjoyed many point and click type adventures before - this is something different though.  The graphics are mediocre, not bad, but that's not the point.  The audio, is however good.  The sense of adventure is majestic.The game is a story.  And its not one I even want to talk about.  This game is touching.  At the end I feel like I have grown in my understanding and empathy for people.  I feel like I have a new friend.  Its quite odd.  I don't know how a bunch of nerdy game developers came up with this, but I am impressed.  I highly recommend this game, it is excellent.  I have only one complaint, its short.  Its like a good but short book.  Its over, you feel like you've said goodbye to a good friend forever, and that's that.  Too bad.  So play it, buy it, enjoy it.			"

												What an utter dissapointment, I bought this game hoping for a good story, but not only was the story cliche but the entire plot is revealed almost immediately. It seems like the creators tried to be coy with setting up the ""grand reveal"" but it ended up being painfully obvious what the story would revolve around. The entire time I couldn't help but be annoyed at how likely it was that the creators picked the plot purely based on being ""edgy"" and ""progressive"" only to have their sentiments fall flat on their face by coming up with such an unoriginal soap opera esque plot line. Seriously, for the money I paid, I want some better written than an episode of some trash show on the CW. If you are going to play that card, at least come up with something better.Forget this game, get Firewatch instead.			"

												I write this review because the many downvotes may keep away some of you who could actually enjoy this game. Playing Gone Home is not a very intense experience, you just explore a story by walking through the mansion. Which sounds boring but actually it is cool. The upside of this kind of storytelling is that you will be much more part of the story than just reading or watching the same thing. At a certain point I got really excited where the story is going.			"

												If you're looking for a game where all you do is mindlessly hack or shoot things, then Gone Home is not the game for you.  If you're looking to be immersed in a rich story, while trying to solve the mystery of where your family has gone, then Gone Home is definitely worth a try.I played this on a beautiful day, with sunlight streaming through the window, and I found myself nervous walking into some of the rooms because I was so immersed in the story and the storm outside the house I was exploring.

												I accidently got to the end of the story without having all the bits filled in for me so I ended up quite confused and sort of felt a bit like I'd been told the ending, so there is no point in me going through it again. I wasn't entirely sure what was going to happen, the atmosphere made it feel like something would jump out at me but it never does. It was a bit disappointing that I was allowed to get to the end without hearing all the information, I would have preferred the game to have had exploration goals that triggered another part of the story to be revealed. Oh well.			"

												SPOILERS AHEAD!SPOILERS AHEAD!SPOILERS AHEAD!Now with that out of the way I can start with the review so you can't tell me I didn't say there'll be spoilers here. Thank God I didn't pay full price and got this game as a part of some bundle for a few dollars.So here are the spoilers and ""shocking twists"" that will save you spending 20$ on this trash:1) You find out that your sister is some angsty teen lesbian who ran away with her feminazi girlfriend.2) Your mom is cheating your dad.3) Your dad has been sexually abused when he was a child by your uncle. The writing and story in this game are so lame, shallow and unoriginal that the quality of it can be compared with twilight movies. Cringeworthy angsty teen trash. Voice acting is pretty decent though. Gameplay is lame and boring, you just interact with various notes, tapes and objects around the empty house, that’s literally all you do. The tag ""Psychological Horror"" in the tag section of this game is insulting to the genre and it's false advertising. The only reason why this game gets all those positive reviews from critics is because it's a love story about lesbians and nobody wants to be labeled as ""homophobe"" (whatever that means) if they didn't like the game. That's it, no other reason. Also 20$ for this 2-3 hour long walking BS with lame story and writing is just beyond absurd. There are way better and longer games for that kind of money on Steam.I also laughed when I saw this on the store page of this game:“Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told.” The New York Times No, the greatest video game love story ever told is To the Moon as far as I'm concerned and it's way more cheaper than this overhyped and pretentious hipster bulls.hit gay propaganda. Stay away from it.			"

Posted: December 24, 2016
												Even more than most games, whether or not I'd recommend Gone Home depends upon your taste and preferences.Mostly that's because of the kind of game this is.  Gone Home reminds me of some of the adventure games of my youth.  (Yes, I'm old.)  You're dropped into a situation that is quite unexpected for your character and left to explore your environment (the titular home) while slowly uncovering the story of what happened to lead to the current situation.There are no enemies or combat.  The puzzles you encounter, if they can even be called puzzles, revolve entirely around gaining access to more areas of the house.  They're ""solved"" through simple exploration and really serve as a device to keep the story discovery in order rather than as any kind of challenge.  And that story, as you'll quickly realize, is mainly a coming of age story.  Whether any or all of that is good, bad, or indifferent is completely in the eye of the beholder.Which leads to the other part of why I would or wouldn't recommend Gone Home.  In the interest of avoiding spoilers I'll simply say that the main story involves a topic that has been one of the primary fronts for the past decade or two in the ongoing culture war in the US.  If you strongly identify as either progressive or conservative on social issues you may be either elated or disgusted, respectively, by that aspect of the story.  On the other hand, if you're somewhere between those two extremes your enjoyment of the game probably won't hinge on the matter.Personally I enjoyed Gone Home.  The environment is just a little bit creepy, which befits the situation perfectly and helped highlight the inflection points in the story where I genuinely feared what I was going to find next.  And I don't mean feared in the horror movie sense.  I mean the story drew me in enough that I was concerned about the fate of the characters.  To call the game a ""walking simulator"" sells it short.  While there may be exploration involved in taking a walk, there usually isn't much of a story to be revealed, at least in my experience.  I suppose your milage may vary if you commonly take walks in your friends' or family's homes when you arrive and unexpectely find them gone, with a cryptic note addressed to you tacked on the front door.If you choose to play Gone Home I would recommend doing so at a time when you have several hours available, so you can play through in a single session.  I would also recommend taking your time and exploring the house throughly rather than trying to rush through.  Much of Gone Home is in the details and I imagine it would be something of a thin experience if you bypass most of that in favor of pushing to reach the story's conclusion as swiftly as possible.  Case in point, in reading through some of the discussion threads here on Steam after playing the game through, I saw reference to some things I didn't find even though I thought I had explored completely.  So I'm looking forward to playing through again at some point with an eye toward figuring out where I missed those bits.Finally, to address a point that is commonly mentioned in reviews, I have to agree that the regular price feels a bit steep for the amount of content Gone Home offers and its fairly limited replayability, especially this long after release.  But it goes on sale fairly often and is a decent to very good value at the common sale prices.So, can you enjoy a game that's about exploration and story, without any guns, explosions, platforming, crafting, or zombies involved?  If you are socially/religously conservative, can you still enjoy a story even though it casts a generally positive light on a topic with which you may personally disagree?  Then yes, I do indeed recommend Gone Home.			"

You don't get a pass on a cliched story of young forbidden love just because it involved an ""untraditional"" pairing.			"

												This game is a definitely a departure from most of the titles out there. As has been said before, there are no guns, no monsters, no jump scares or twisted secrets, no puzzles or deadly rooms that fill with gas unless things are done just so. It's a game where a girl goes home and explores the empty house that should have been full of welcoming family.It's a mystery, set on a dark rainy night in the mid-nineties with lots of atmosphere and loads of character. You learn about the people involved and, in the end, probably something about yourself. It's worth the play to anyone who likes a story and has an open mind.That all being said, it's short. Taking my sweet time it ran me about 3 hours, I played it start to finish in a sitting and may ruin through it one more time. It's more like a short book than a game really in terms or replay. If you like the story you read it again to see if you missed anything the first go 'round. There's a couple journals that are tricky to find and an easter egg buried in there but it's a game without set achievements and the only goal is simply to listen.The controls are basic but solid, I did find it frustrating at first when I found there were things I could interact with and things that couldn't, things I could read and things I can't For example you can pick up bibles but not most other books and you can't open the books. Feels like a little more time could have been spend allowing you to open things, even if it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay per-se it would add to the feeling and the mood of the game (which is all the game actually is). You'll also encounter a lot of drawers that are filled with papers and junk but you can't actually pick all of it up or read all of it and even more oddly you can't take most things with you in your backpack. All of that is really beside the point. It's not about collecting loot, or picking up items that might be useful later it's about exploring and learning and not just the house and the characters but yourself as well.Lastly, as much as I enjoyed it it's not worth full price, catch it on half or more off sale and you won't be disappointed but for $20 it's not worth the price of admission.

												This game is about as indie as it gets: it fills all of your wat jar and overflows enough to make your shoes wet. My disdain for this sad existence of an 'experience' makes me cry at night.I was never a fan of the artsy hipster better-than-mainstream feeling that early indie titles had (mainly Braid and Limbo) but those games were at least fun, challenging enough to keep playing, and worth their price tag. Gone Home is only one of these things, and it's definitely not fun or challenging or worth the price in any sense of the terms.I guess if you were a huge fan of Fez then you won't mind searching every inch of this mansion to unlock the secrets, small, bland, short, and boring though they are. I will admit my favorite thing about this game was how you could zoom in on papers and posters and see visibly clear text with an actual message instead of a low resolution scribble to give the impression of writing (mainly like in Mass Effect 2). That's the only thing I appreciated, everything else made me want to uninstall. But how could I? I already spent $20, I had to see it through.The atmosphere was also good. In fact some parts were creepier than Amnesia.If you don't like romances, don't buy this game. I hate romances. If there's a grand story with lots of characters in an epic setting, then a romance between two characters is fine. That's natural. A story, movie, or book that is only and foremost a romance is not what I like in my media. Had I know this game was just a romance, I wouldn't have bought it, but unfortunately you don't realize this until the end of the game and by then it's too late. Did I mention the end comes within two hours? I beat this game in less than the time it takes me to watch a good movie, and I could have rented one for a lot less than I paid for this. Video games are not movies, the experience has to be directly related to the cost of the game, and $20 is way too much.Would I recommend it for $5? No, I wouldn't, but if you want to see what all the craze is about then I guess the only time I would say you should buy it is for 99 cents. Better yet make your brother buy it and play it off Steam Family Sharing, at least then you won't have to stare at it in your own library.			"

												A charming love story with very compelling, relatable characters and an astonishing atmosphere! You can practically pick up everything, which really paints a bigger picture and solidifies the characters and makes them feel more real.The storytelling was my favorite! I love literature and two characters in the story are authors so reading is a big part of this game. It's a shame I couldn't read any excerpts from the ""accidental"" series because it sounds really interesting. I got this game on sale for $10 which I think is fair, the story is short but sweet. I recommend that if you can get it while it's on sale, definitely do so!			"

												A fantastic game/story... it kept me right on the edge of my seat. Completely brilliant.Some people complain that it isn't a game - there's a degree of truth in that (although on a philosophical level many of today's most popular ""games"" have more in common with a hamster-wheel than a game).I thought the voice acting was very good, maybe excellent. There was enough extraneous stuff to rummage through that there was some (albeit small) sense of effort on progressing the story. There were one or two surprises - at least in that the story could have gone in a couple very different directions, and a small number of somewhat-developed sub-plots.In the end, I thought it was a really lovely way to tell a story.(I cracked through it in about an hour and a half. It felt like much longer in that I was completely immersed for that period).			"

I was then greeted by silky smooth 10 FPS gameplay with nothing on the screen. I was able to improve to 15FPS by turning off bloom and motion blur. I enter the front door and explore and a ? pops up so I use the action button and a door opens. I get a key, go to the attic, and I won. I have no idea what just happened.			"

It successfully put me in the place of an older sister who is learning and empathizing about her teenage sister's personal life.The mechanics rely entirely on exploration, so that the pace never feels rushed by adversity to react to, or slowed down by puzzle-solving. In that regard, I felt like my experience with this game was truly my own, progressing in a way that felt free of constraint.If you like being immersed in a very personal story and enjoy exploring virtual environments in great detail, this is definitely a great game for you.

Suitable for those wanting to explore a mansion and uncover the mystery of the family inside it, and open-minded enough to tolerate what they'll find. In addition, the game successfully conveys the socio cultural (as well as decorational) atmosphere of 90s. Those bothered by different-than-ordinary human emotions and wanting a lenghty puzzle or horror game should stay away from this.Only downside the game has is its frustrating shortness leaving you wanting more...In short, the game is strongly recommended.

This isn't a horror game, as the trailer and atmosphere initially lead me to believe - but it emerses you as if it is a horror game and it certainly plays into the creep factor.  I've played it over multiple times and I'm still finding new bits to the story that I didn't catch before. "

												Gone Home is a warm coming-of-age story told in a point-and-click adventure style. Full of rich characterization and honest heart, it's a compelling story to play through, and one which I'm sure other LGBTQ+ gamers will find just as touching as I did. Absolutely recommend it to any player, but especially young LGBTQ+ people looking for drama that, for once, doesn't linger on suffering.			"

												This game is a definitely a departure from most of the titles out there. As has been said before, there are no guns, no monsters, no jump scares or twisted secrets, no puzzles or deadly rooms that fill with gas unless things are done just so. It's a game where a girl goes home and explores the empty house that should have been full of welcoming family.It's a mystery, set on a dark rainy night in the mid-nineties with lots of atmosphere and loads of character. You learn about the people involved and, in the end, probably something about yourself. It's worth the play to anyone who likes a story and has an open mind.That all being said, it's short. Taking my sweet time it ran me about 3 hours, I played it start to finish in a sitting and may ruin through it one more time. It's more like a short book than a game really in terms or replay. If you like the story you read it again to see if you missed anything the first go 'round. There's a couple journals that are tricky to find and an easter egg buried in there but it's a game without set achievements and the only goal is simply to listen.The controls are basic but solid, I did find it frustrating at first when I found there were things I could interact with and things that couldn't, things I could read and things I can't For example you can pick up bibles but not most other books and you can't open the books. Feels like a little more time could have been spend allowing you to open things, even if it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay per-se it would add to the feeling and the mood of the game (which is all the game actually is). You'll also encounter a lot of drawers that are filled with papers and junk but you can't actually pick all of it up or read all of it and even more oddly you can't take most things with you in your backpack. All of that is really beside the point. It's not about collecting loot, or picking up items that might be useful later it's about exploring and learning and not just the house and the characters but yourself as well.Lastly, as much as I enjoyed it it's not worth full price, catch it on half or more off sale and you won't be disappointed but for $20 it's not worth the price of admission.

												Picked this game up for 75 or 80% off on sale. Good music (Chris Remo is a good composer), and good atmosphere. That's about it. The story is extremely cliched and even despite this, it will manage to hold your interest for a while until you realize it doesn't go anywhere. The ending that they build up to the whole game (it's heavily implied that something very bad happens to Sam, your sister in the game) does not even come to fruition, the side story with the father and mother is interesting for a while as well until that also turns out that it doesn't go anywhere. The journey is somewhat engaging for a little while, but there is no conclusion whatsoever. I suppose it's somewhat like real life in this sense, that the events just sort of happen and keep happening, and keep happening, but eventually you look back on the whole game and ask yourself: what the hell is the point? If the story went in an interesting direction and had a meaningful conclusion, I would have enjoyed this game so much more, as then the several hours you spend playing would actually lead to something. In terms of gameplay, there's nothing here. It's very much like Dear Esther in the sense that you sort of just walk around and the story is revealed to you. Yes you have to look for clues and hints to move the story along, but this mostly just consists of opening up drawers to find letters and diaries and such. There is nothing challenging whatsoever about this game, and the gameplay does not change or evolve one iota during the entire playthrough. TL;DR - Bad game, meh story that goes nowhere, good soundtrack (the score, not the in game music). Very short and unrewarding. Even if you enjoy coming of age stories about homosexuality (the game's main theme), don't spend money on this, just watch a playthrough on youtube. You will get the exact same level of enjoyment out of just watching.			"

												I didn't really think the theme of the game was something I would enjoy but the story turned out to be pretty good (It does a great job at creating suspense). I liked the ambience - the amount of detail in the house and the sound direction (probably the backbone of all walking simulators).  But the actual gameplay I think was too monotonous. A lot of reading is involved. They decided to actually scan real life letters and drawings and handwriting in general, so some of the text is actually pretty unreadable. Not that it matters, because most of it is not what you’d call interesting or essential to the story. Also there are a lot of pointless interactive objects in the house. Things that again don't contribute anything to the story or immersion, in my opinion. And whilst the developers made a good job recreating a realistic 90s house in a video game, it’s still just that. One might even describe it as overwhelmingly mundane, but not in a nostalgic, cool kind of way, but just plain boring and predictable. And when you can complete the entire game in under a minute (whilst speedrunning) the 20 euro price tag seems utterly ludicrous. Now, this is the point where I was going to end my review saying ''Don't buy it'', but I went back and played the game once more, but this time with the developer commentary enabled. I mean the creative process of creating a game is very interesting. And building the game from nothing takes huge amount of time and skill, especially if there are only a few people working on it. The developers highlighted some things that I had missed on my first playthrough or rather took for granted. These insights reminded me of the time I made a 10 page newspaper for my english class assignment (smth like 8th grade). It took me roughly 5 months to produce six pages of content I was kind of happy with. It was an enormous chore to think out what was going to be in the newspaper: the attitude of the newspaper, the individual stories, the proportions, the layout, the overall design, the writing style, the pictures, the ads - everything had to be perfect (since it was WAY past the hand in deadline and I wanted to salvage a good grade and of course make the teacher feel bad for ever doubting my abilities). Anyway, after that much effort put into a project, it sure would be nice to be rewarded (*high price tag*). But we still have to look at everything objectively. Yes the teacher was very impressed by my efforts (so much so, that she decided to take it as a keepsake),but I still got an F. And so, while I did enjoy the game, no way should it get away with costing twice the money it’s worth. Snatch it on a sale though.			"

												This game is not worth your time, or your money.  This was the biggest waste of $20 I have ever spent.  I would hardly pay 99 cents for it.  The story was ok but it is juxtaposed with a strange horror/thriller esthetic.  I bought the game thinking it would be a suspensful mystery game, an idea I gained from the game summery, but soon realized that I was very wrong.  Any hope of playing an intersting, thriller, exploration game quickly dissolved into an hour long grind through an  angsty telling of a young girls transition into a punk rock lesbian  .  Not that there is anything wrong with that but if you are going to tell that story make sure it is an intersting one.  And if you do, don't trick people into thinking they are buying a mystery game when they are realling buying a punk romance novel.			"

												Jogo curto demais para o preço, mesmo eu tendo comprado em alguma promoção por 5 reais. Levei 2h para chegar nos créditos, mesmo explorando todo o ambiente com calma.Sobre a história, ela tem um plot interessante, mas, creio que pelo jogo ser curto, ela acabou sendo mal desenvolvida e com um final previsível. Fico pensando se o jogo fez sucesso pelo momento em que foi lançado, em meio à propagação da aceitação da comunidade LGBT.O jogo teve alguns momentos aleatórios onde houve uma redução no framerate, mas poucos.Se ele fosse mais longo, seria ideal, mas foi uma boa experiência. Não recomendo comprar o jogo, pois há jogos de exploração melhores no mercado. Mesmo se houver desconto em promoção.			"

Buy this game just for the story and atmosphere!However, there isn't much replayability, and the price is pretty steep. Since I suck at this game, it took me a little more time to beat it. Wait for a sale, then get it. It's a must-buy! Definitely one of the best stories in any medium I've experienced!			"

												I sincerely wish I would have looked at the PLAYER reviews for this game before I bought it.  I'm glad I only wasted a few dollars on this when it was on sale.  As an exploration game, I did like walking through the rooms and looking at everything.  But, I wasted a LOT of time picking everything up and trying to see if it would work with or combine with other objects (like matches with candles).  WTH is the point of being able to pick up hundreds of objects, but (barring lightswitches and cassette tapes) only a couple of them in the entire game actual DO something???  I did not realize this is some teen coming of age storyline.  (UGH - again, I should have read the player reviews...)  I did know it's not a horror game, but I really thought there might be a little more creepy stuff in the game, particularly concerning the uncle that had recently passed. I also don't understand why the VCRs and game consoles were gone, but the TVs and stereos were left there.  Yes, it's so you can play the cassettes, but come on.   Money is money and they would have taken more of that stuff to pawn off...  The only really believable part of the story is the parents saying they went camping, but actually going to a marriage counseling workshop/retreat thing for the weekend...			"

												While I appreciate trying out different game mechanics in this case the experiment failed.The story wasn't particularly interesting or surprising as in you pretty much know how it will end after hearing around a quarter of it. The ""psycho house"" atmosphere makes you hopeful if it will be somehow included in the story but turns out, like most interactions, its pointless.Arguably this isn't even a game since it has no real puzzles or failure modes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but something to be aware of.My recommendation: Instead of spending two hours on this, read a book or a short story.			"

Posted: December 24, 2016
												Even more than most games, whether or not I'd recommend Gone Home depends upon your taste and preferences.Mostly that's because of the kind of game this is.  Gone Home reminds me of some of the adventure games of my youth.  (Yes, I'm old.)  You're dropped into a situation that is quite unexpected for your character and left to explore your environment (the titular home) while slowly uncovering the story of what happened to lead to the current situation.There are no enemies or combat.  The puzzles you encounter, if they can even be called puzzles, revolve entirely around gaining access to more areas of the house.  They're ""solved"" through simple exploration and really serve as a device to keep the story discovery in order rather than as any kind of challenge.  And that story, as you'll quickly realize, is mainly a coming of age story.  Whether any or all of that is good, bad, or indifferent is completely in the eye of the beholder.Which leads to the other part of why I would or wouldn't recommend Gone Home.  In the interest of avoiding spoilers I'll simply say that the main story involves a topic that has been one of the primary fronts for the past decade or two in the ongoing culture war in the US.  If you strongly identify as either progressive or conservative on social issues you may be either elated or disgusted, respectively, by that aspect of the story.  On the other hand, if you're somewhere between those two extremes your enjoyment of the game probably won't hinge on the matter.Personally I enjoyed Gone Home.  The environment is just a little bit creepy, which befits the situation perfectly and helped highlight the inflection points in the story where I genuinely feared what I was going to find next.  And I don't mean feared in the horror movie sense.  I mean the story drew me in enough that I was concerned about the fate of the characters.  To call the game a ""walking simulator"" sells it short.  While there may be exploration involved in taking a walk, there usually isn't much of a story to be revealed, at least in my experience.  I suppose your milage may vary if you commonly take walks in your friends' or family's homes when you arrive and unexpectely find them gone, with a cryptic note addressed to you tacked on the front door.If you choose to play Gone Home I would recommend doing so at a time when you have several hours available, so you can play through in a single session.  I would also recommend taking your time and exploring the house throughly rather than trying to rush through.  Much of Gone Home is in the details and I imagine it would be something of a thin experience if you bypass most of that in favor of pushing to reach the story's conclusion as swiftly as possible.  Case in point, in reading through some of the discussion threads here on Steam after playing the game through, I saw reference to some things I didn't find even though I thought I had explored completely.  So I'm looking forward to playing through again at some point with an eye toward figuring out where I missed those bits.Finally, to address a point that is commonly mentioned in reviews, I have to agree that the regular price feels a bit steep for the amount of content Gone Home offers and its fairly limited replayability, especially this long after release.  But it goes on sale fairly often and is a decent to very good value at the common sale prices.So, can you enjoy a game that's about exploration and story, without any guns, explosions, platforming, crafting, or zombies involved?  If you are socially/religously conservative, can you still enjoy a story even though it casts a generally positive light on a topic with which you may personally disagree?  Then yes, I do indeed recommend Gone Home.			"

												It's a ""walking simulator"", and contrary to many gamers I have nothing against them, I actually enjoy the occasional walking simulator. I enjoy being able to walk all relaxed through a gaming environment, not having to worry about monsters, getting stuck at puzzles, or annoying platform sections, and just explore. But even I found this one underwhelming. It's a  lesbian  (I don't really think it's a spoiler, just the theme of the game, something you should know if you're going to waste money and an hour of two of your life on this, but hid it anyway as it doesn't seem to be in the official store page description) teenage love story, which you unravel while exploring the house. Unlike some walking simulators this one has about the depth of a pop song, there is no great mystery, no plot twist, no deeper meaning, just two  female  kids falling in love. WHO THE F*CK CARES??! Maybe I'm just not the target audience, but whatever :p let's not judge, except that little bit when writing the Steam review that is. I do like the nostalgic 1995 setting, nice to be reminded of cassette tapes and stuff.Gone Home, my first impression video, and as it happens also a full walkthrough, so yeah obvious spoiler alert:

												An absolutely stunning experience that uses every facet of games as a medium to its fullest extent, Gone Home is, with all brevity, a game that games as a medium need. Hidden Object games have long since been underestimated for their simplicity and lack of apparent engagement, and while I would praise them before for presenting an advanced storytelling platform, this genre-defining work of art has pushed the boundaries of its own kind, and created an experience with emotional charge, plot and character development and atmosphere (among other things) that blows many others completely out of the water.Gone Home, without a doubt, has yielded for myself the most intensive physical, mental and emotional response I've ever experienced when playing a game. Even if other games do not manage to match the caliber of this one, the impact is lasting and unforgettable, and if the question 'What is a game?' is ever raised,I will be in utter shock if such works as this are ever barred from our medium.The entirety of games as an artistic medium wears Gone Home proudly as one of its most radiant and semantically endowed gems, I feel.Oh but the price is a little high, honestly--20 USD is a bit steep, and I would the artist behind this would realise the importance of making art as available to others as it can be ...

												This game was gifted to me a long while ago. The person who gave it to me kept encouraging me to give it a shot, so today I played it. I'm glad I did. It was worth it. The eeriness of coming home to an empty but lived in house was unsettling, but in a clever way. It felt like home but with something slightly off. It felt right but wrong at the same time. The developers/programmers did an excellent job of creating an immersive environment. The story telling is wonderfully eloquant. The plot devices used to move it forward are creative and encourage you to explore your surroundings. Of course, it also means you can move random items into the bathrooms and leave the facuets running while the serious plot unfolds around you.I appreciate that the developers leave you a lovely bread crumb trail for you to follow that encourages you to determine what happened. It's brilliant.			"

												""Walking simulator"" is pretty correct when it comes to this games' genre, but it is so much more. When you're engrossed in the story about Sam, ""your"" younger sister, and what happened to her after they moved to this ""mansion"" in the forest... you'll forget about the walking.There's a lot of stuff to pick up and take a look at, including letters and notes written by the mother, the father and the younger sister... also some postcards from the player character as well. And the story is absolutely amazing.If you can get this cheaply, I mean... it's not worth nearly the asking price of €19.99, more like €2-3 AT MOST. But if you can get it for that price, do buy it, enjoy the story. After all, it's no longer than two hours.			"

												A few months ago i played Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes. Now, the game was great, albeit not very long, but the thing i want to emphasize on are the Paz tapes (supposedly from Peace Walker).

That was quite an emotional story, and it hits you even harder once you finish Ground Zeroes.This is pretty much what Gone Home is - they created about 20 min long set of tapes and decided to use the walking simulator genre, as a way to tell their story.The story did get me. Though, after finishing it, i went on youtube and looked for the audio logs, and turns out they make quite a cohesive story by themselves. I don't know, but i think that it would have been much better as a movie. The gameplay is shallow - cut the audio logs and you can forget about all those 9/10's and 10/10's. Yes, it's all about the audio in all honesty, which is quite a shame. Even the soundtrack composed for the game - all of it can only be heard during the audio logs themselves.Beware though - there is no horror and mystery. It's simply a teenage love story, and i myself personally finished the game in 106 minutes.Overall, i just want you to know what you are getting into before buying it. Sure - it short, the gameplay is shallow, but saying that i didn't enjoy the game would be lying. It may not be worth 20$, but it's certainly not a bad game.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Gone Home. A Short Exploration Game That's Not For Everyone.Genre: First Person Exploration Game With Environmental Storytelling.Developed and Published by: The FullBright CompanyPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself PreambleI’ve talked about Gone Home before and I’ll admit that I came down on it pretty hard at the time. Especially in retrospect, as I’ve given other similar games in the genre positive recommendations. As I try to think back on why and reading what I had said at the time, it's not hard to figure out what went wrong. Gone Home had been hyped up to such a ridiculous degree for me that it was destined to fail my expectations. This is something I rarely deal with because I often review games (especially now) long after most reviewers have said their piece. With Gone Home though, I hadn’t returned to reviewing and mostly wrote that review out of frustration. Additionally, I tried to compare this to other games that weren’t even in the same genre and I should know better. I do know better, now. Even after reviewing games for over five years, I still make some silly mistakes. I could just blame this one on that not being an actual official review (which it technically wasn’t) but I still said those words and still made that comparison. That’s why I’m here now, to correct that mistake. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsGone Home is a game entirely about exploring the environment of an old two story mansion in Portland OR and finding pieces to the stories of the people that lived there. You’ve arrived at this mansion in the middle of a storm and are completely alone. There’s an audio log that plays that identifies you as Kaitlyn, returning home from a trip abroad. Outside of that, what you do is up to you. It will, however, subtly encourage you to explore the house. The story is about a typical American middle-class family, that’s slightly dysfunctional, trying to deal with the average pressures of everyday life: highschool, relationships and work obligations. It’s not a setting that we often see in games outside of simulators. While there’s a hint of something supernatural going on (which IS typical of games), it seems to be the wild imagination of teenagers. The story is largely told through environmental objects, written notes and audio logs that play when you find an important item in the house. I’m not going to talk about the story and plot but I will say that while it seems to be a rather stereotypical American story, it’s still a very well told story and there are some interesting quirks. It handles the relationships and people very well, to the point that they sound like regular yet flawed human beings. Even though most of it is done through audio logs. Inside this house, you can choose to go anywhere in the house that you like and either explore every nook and cranny or try to blitz it. There are some locked doors that will block your progress and require you to find the keys for them, but outside of that? You’re free to do whatever you want: open all the doors, pick up pens, notebooks and cassettes and turn on all the lights as it's all fair game. Short of destroying anything that is. A journal and map will record what you find and remind you of what you can do next. Additionally, there are certain key items that will stay with you in your inventory but the rest of the items in the house can only be picked up and looked at in full 360 degrees of glory. The exploration is pretty good and well paced so long as you don’t completely miss important clues. While this wasn’t a horror game, I did find myself tensing up a little bit as I explored the house. Gone Home’s audio quality is superb enough to give that creepy feeling of being alone, no doubt assisted with the storm going on. PC Settings and Rather Demanding PerformanceOptions are a bit more sparse with Gone Home. There’s a good selection of resolution options (though it’ll show the resolutions it detects will work best), fullscreen on/off and a graphics quality selection. The advanced options include antialiasing, V-sync, anisotropic filtering, ambient occlusion, bloom and motion blur that can either be turned on or off. Which doesn’t allow for a lot of flexibility. There’s an adjustable field of slider that has presets every five between 60 and 90. Shadow distance can also be set from none to “max”. There’s five different audio sliders for main, voice, music and sound effects volumes. If you don’t like headbob, that can be disabled as well as training messages, reticle and interaction highlights and text. Controls can be changed for keyboard and mouse (not the controller). The bigger issue with Gone Home is just how much resources it demands. Running it on my system was difficult to get it run at a smooth 60FPS even with many of the graphics options turned off. It wasn’t until I set the graphics quality to low that I got a stable framerate. At that point, the game really doesn't look good so suffering through varying framerates of 30-50fps is probably better than looking at an ugly house. I don’t know why it’s such a resource hog either but it suggests that optimization isn’t as good as it could have been. Gone Home goes for a realistic look into a modern American mansion that’s done a bit of aging but has clearly been well maintained. Most of the items you’ll find range from as old as the 50s to more modern times though it always seems to fit. The soundtrack has an electronic and slightly orchestral sound to it that’s very calm. Almost like elevator music but without the annoying repetitiveness to it. The soundtrack will only play during audio logs, otherwise you’ll be listening to the rain and creaking house instead. Final ThoughtsGone Home has gotten better with age since the rather overhyped release and the deluge of similar titles onto the market. That being said, this isn’t a game for everyone. As with all games in this genre, you have to approach it from a different expectation. It’s purely an exploration game with no failure state and no real tension except for what you make. It’s also really short, especially if you attempt to blitz through it as fast as you can. Understandably, those two things will turn most people away from it and I don’t blame them. I am hesitant to recommend this but if a purely environmental exploration game is something you’re looking for, Gone Home is definitely a title to check out.

												Game is fun at first...kidna spooky theme where you explore and figure out puzzles...then the story just gets annoying and everything seems like a chore. Could have been a great game...but they didn't bother to polish some of the finer things, and you end up realizing all the time you spent was basically for nothing.			"

												I stayed away from all spoilers before playing and this game was pretty interesting. It definitely set in a really creepy guide and many times I was expecting a ghost or something to pop out. As the story progressed, I started to get an idea of what was going on and also expected something horrible to be revealed. The build up was great and the ending was totally satisfying. Definitely gives you something to think about.			"
