AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Lucius Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags:  3D; Third-Person; Adventure; Puzzle; Sandbox; Horror; Stealth My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWLucius is a fun little game that puts you in control of a 6 year old spawn of Satan.  The story is in the same vein of the classic horror movie, The Omen.  The game itself mixes together a number of elements from different genres and the outcome is a pretty novel and entertaining experience. This game is frequently called a ""sandbox"" game, and it certainly is.  The whole game takes place in a rather small little ""sandbox"" that takes the form of a wealthy senator's manor.  But I feel the game is more accurately described as an adventure game that handles like a 3rd person stealth-action game in a tiny sandbox world.The game is quite short, (maybe 4-6 hours*), broken up into 18 levels.  In each you solve an adventure-game-style puzzle to murder someone for your father, the Devil.  The story itself is mediocre, but it is told well.  And there is admittedly very, very little content to the game.  Altogether, however, the flow of the story and the length of the levels mesh well into a game that creates a good atmosphere and paces itself perfectly to keep you entertained; so it ultimately feels pleasantly short-and-sweet.The graphics and sound neither take away nor add any value to the game.  I experienced no crashes or glitching whatsoever in my playtime.  The controls and interaction are intuitive and work properly.  Everything makes sense as you solve puzzles to beat each level, and there are various in game methods to get hints/help.  The game is short and entertaining, and worth a playthrough if you would be into what it offers.*I have a high playtime because I idled to earn an achievement.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only ""redeeming"" characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character. This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate.The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself. To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion. The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developers—there is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion.At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes. While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enough—in fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to do—there are other aspects of the game that are downright rough.Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are.Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights. There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them. The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart.While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience.			"

												First off, I really wanted to like this game. The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing.Unfortunately, the product that the trailers, the game descriptions and even other reviews prepared me for was not the product I got. I expected a demonic sandbox chock full of whimsically creative murder. Instead, I got a mediocre Hitman clone with exactly one (absurdly specific) solution for each murder.The game teases you with all of these awesome powers straight out of The Omen: telekinesis, mind control, pyromancy. But you can really only use them when the game feels like it.I would be fine with the restrictions on your mayhem if the game provided some semblance of direction. Instead, you're left to aimlessly wander the game's massive mansion, searching for the tiny, sometimes pixel-perfect item you need to proceed.The best example of my frustration was a mission where you had to off your family's beloved butler. (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)(SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)(SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)The in-game prompt informs you that it's winter, and it would be a terrible shame if the ancient old goof slipped and fell. Alright, fair enough -- I probably have to create some ice, huh, Lucius? Let me just grab one of the dozens of interactive cups dotting the mansion, and we'll be off. Wait, what's that? I can't use any of the cups on the sink? Well, then... how am I supposed to get water, bro? Oh, you mean I need a water bottle, because that's ""less suspicious?"" Okay, fine... Are you gonna maybe give me a hint about which of the mansion's 20+ rooms would be a good place to start? No? Great...So, the kitchen then? Nope! The servants' quarters? As if! My bedroom, you say? Oh, you've gotta be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me, Lucius. It's in my bedroom? The very start of the level, which you purposely led me away from via the in-game objective marker? The furthest possible point from where you gave me my mission objective? Fine, Lucius. Fine. I'll go get the ♥♥♥♥ing water bottle.Now I've probably got to just dump it on the ground by the doorway the butler's sure to walk through while attending to the Christmas lights, right? Oh, that's not right? Of course it isn't, Lucius. Of course it isn't. Instead, I've got to find the one incredibly tiny spot in the middle of the courtyard (the mansion's biggest room) where you want me to put it, don't I? Whatever, Lucius. I don't care enough anymore.Oh, now the butler's taking his sweet time coming outside, huh? Not like he's supposed to be attending to the family during Christmas dinner or anything. Can I just wait for him to have a stroke, Lucius? No, that would be too easy. I'm guessing from your minimal exposition that I'm supposed to tamper with the Christmas lights to get his attention, huh? Fine, let's get to tampering.Naturally, I assume you won't let me use my telekinesis to pull down the lights. That would be too easy. And also fun. Too much fun for your liking, Lucius. So, what then? Do I need to find some misplaced tool in the farthest wing, only to backtrack to the fuse-box in the next room and fry the circuit breaker? That seems like something you would do, Lucius. Don't argue with me -- it absolutely does sound like you, Lucius. Okay, fine then -- what do I have to do, buddy?Ahh.... I have to turn off the Christmas Lights via a barely visible light-switch? In fairness, that's also just so you Lucius. So completely you. There. I turned off the light-switch and now the butler's coming out. Oh, good! He slipped and fell! But, wait... he's still alive! So, I've got to finish him off... Oh, now you let me use my telekinesis, Lucius? Finally, when it's too late to matter?You truly are a generous god, Lucius... "

												Remember that horror flick titled The Omen? I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it.Lucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen. You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil. Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives. This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections. So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue.And that is the point here. We cause accidents. Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person. I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason. Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting. A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family.Anyway, I do not want to spoil it. The game has very nice graphics and memorable music. I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season. This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring. Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role.Later on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control. To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game. I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit. In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution.The game has some flaws, though. For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do. Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful. Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?I am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best. I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen. "

												Once upon a time there was a little boy called Lucius. He loved his bicycle, his cute teddy bear notebook and bizarre murders, you know like beheading a guy with a grass cutter. Do you really wanna know what's next? Did he make his father proud? Did anyone survive being under one roof with him? How many photos does it take to get a perfect picture of a naked uncle? Just play and you will find out.			"

												Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.""Lucius"" is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there.I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it. Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first ""Lucius"" to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.""Lucius"" has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing ""good boy"" status by doing mundane chores around the house.My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though.			"

												Quite possibly the most evil game ever created.Bravo for another Indie developer.This game is something else even though it's a familiar genre. As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others. Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you.Anyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here. This could easily be made into a movie. You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents. You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff.You play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters).The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did).This game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing. You have to read between the lines. You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target. It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom. After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on.You also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents.As far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome. The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak).One thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself.......There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls. These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell). So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks.The story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the ""freak accidents"" get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission. Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game. This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least.The last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking. In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish.---------------------------------------------------------------------------This is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio. If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment. That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales. So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all.			"

												Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie “The omen.” The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan. As far as the story goes, Lucius, the devil's son, murders members of his household, making them look like accidents. The Devil approaches you once in awhile, to congratulate you, as well as provide useful abilities or to demand better sacrifices. Over time, the means to kill your target, become harder and more arbitrary. After killing most of the live-ins, you will progress to start killing family members, leading up to the final chapter. The gameplay revolves around checking notes, listening to people, doing chores on occasion, and finding a way to kill your target. The player will always be in the same house, and never leave it, becoming boring over time. The house, overall, has a creepy feel to it, fitting properly into the story, however becoming dull rather quickly. The player will spend time in three main areas of the house, with a lot of unexplored areas. The art style, although aged at the time of this review, is still present; dark, creepy and mysterious. The sound and music in Lucius come across perfectly, trying to add to the creepy atmosphere. The Voice Acting is well done, by most of the cast. Some characters are more convincing than others but no character really stands out as a “Bad sounding character”.The game can be confusing at times, with the ingame hints being extremely arbitrary. The game isn't overly linear, making the game a tad harder to progress, and may be frustrating. With hundreds of hints and walkthroughs online, makes completing the game very easy, however if you are the type of gamer that refuses to look things up online it may take a long while before you complete all the chapters. I Myself only looked online when it came to the final “Boss fight”.Lucius did a lot of things right:The sound and voices in game is solidThe cutscenes are gruesome and fantasticThe achievements are rather easy, if you plan aheadLucius is an enjoyable characterLucifer is the best sounding, and most interesting characterThe kills are satisfying Lucius does a few things wrongMassive map with spread out objectivesCan be very glitchyCan be boring if lost or confusedMay be frustrating to some players can be to easy or to hard depending on skill levelOverall, lucius is a good game, it has its bugs and problems but can be very enjoyable. I killed almost 10 hours alone just playing the story, and i still got over 70% of the achievements by accident. Is it worth the $10.99CAD pricetag? That depends on if you enjoy either hunting achievements or are a fan of the genre. Although different from “The Omen” it's still very similar and fans of the movie will most likely enjoy it. Pick it up on sale sometime and give it a play.  "

												Lucius is a game for those who enjoy (somewhat) brutally murdering members of their household in the form of a 6-year-old son of Satan. The graphics are fairly well done (in my opinion) and you have the option to customise the controls to suit you. As for the voice acting, there's not much to say. They did a good job and they worked well in the games setting. My only real issue (though it isn't much of one) would be the lack of an option to save. If you got caught, you had to start the level (next murder, they appear to save after each one) from the beginning which can be a hassle if your PC dies on you or you need to attend urgent business. Overall, I'd say it's a decent and well-done game by Shiver that I suggest buying if you like bloodshed as there can be some pretty surprising and nasty deaths along the line, all organised by one little boy. Lucius.			"

												Really wanted to like this game.  Thought the setup was great. Pros- Decent story- Interesting conceptCons- Bugs that cause you to restart whole chapters- Memory wipe power was worthless- Sometimes obscure pieces to the puzzle- Very linear- Chore concept could have been better - lose suspicion allowing more flexibility for being a ""good boy""- House design is a little poor - takes some time to figure out where everything is- Would have preferred using powers to make others do terrible things on their own instead of just killing them outright- Some controls like Telekinesis and the tricycle are clunky.  Same with final encounter mechanicsKept waiting for the game to shine and it just never did.  Can't recommend.			"

												I really can't recommend this game much (maybe with exception of buying it for a very very low price). There is so much of unused potential it is sad. The basic idea is great but the execution is sadly lacking in almost every way.You could think that in Lucius you will be placed in an open playground that lets you experiment with using environment for your intentions while there will be dynamic reaction of other people on your actions. But that is completely wrong. Instead of that you are forced to kill your victims in one and only exact fashion. No place for creativity or multiple ways to do that.And the game is so unpolished. There is a load of bugs and glitches from the smaller (items in characters hands tend to move awkwardly during cutscenes) to really problematic (that can force you to repeat the whole mission). I can overlook some problems but there are just to many of them to be such benevolent with Lucius.Also the core gameplay mechanics are poorly designed. For example you have paranormal abilities which you can use to manipulate others. To use them you have to switch to them...but then you can't use anything (open doors, search through drawers etc.) as that is also a separate ability. Or later in game you get a chance to conjure fireballs but when you begin to cast them the effect will cover your sight and you will not see what's ahead of you. There are also some ""stealth"" missions where you are forced to do them over and over again (and there are really long loadings) until you learn how to go through them step by step.Well, Lucius is not a good game. But it is not so horrible as it can sound from my words either. The story is actually ok, the slowly deteriorating mental state of your family is for the most parts well done and the voice acting is nice. But the game has so many gameplay issues, bugs and other things. Also the replayability is almost none.			"

Lucius 
A Screenshot of Lucius
By: Falem




Lucius is a third person puzzle/adventure game at heart while being about an antichrist who doesn’t talk, and tries to kill off his family to sell their souls for power. Gameplay+ Main area is accessible at all times+ Constantly unlock more areas that increase your freedom+ Item combinations make sense Unlike most adventure games the exploration was always available from the start though more areas do unlock as you progress the game. This allowed you to explore the various rooms and grab objects ahead of time. The item combinations made practical sense in how they were used together to accomplish objectives.  Put batteries into flashlight check. Put clip into gun. Check. Use poison on food. Check.The real challenge is finding items themselves, since you have the entire place open to you from the start. The map is useful since it identifies the locations with silly drawings. It helps you navigate a bit more to places you think the items are even if its not always obvious. Note: If you do chores you can unlock items that give you hints and show locations of items also making the game much easier to get through.CharactersThe  progression of character development occurs only to the dad of the antichrist, grandfather, mother and the detective. The characters could have been fleshed out better and maybe have some leave its only natural to flee when death occurs that frequently at any place you live/work at.Progression of PowerAt first hes just a kid who has to hide his powers from the adults since they are great threats to him. As the antichrist grows stronger throughout the game adults cease to be the threats they once were. At this point he notices he doesn't have to hide his powers anymore from the family because hes grown strong enough to fight them even when exposed. This gives the game a great sense of progression. Linear But Complex+ Non-linear level design- Linear Deaths (Not much replay value)While clearly the level design is not linear, the way and place you kill them is always the same. The variety of ways you have to kill your family/servants makes up for the fact you can’t kill a particular person in many ways. The story would require a lot of alternative branches to address it if it was done the other way around. For example in the start when you kill off the lady by using a fridge to change her temperature and give her a attack, they mention it in the story. This is done a lot of the family members and really contributes to the frustration of the detective you really feel this guy is always two steps behind you and always trying to catch up.Keep in mind that means there isn’t much replay value to be had here. In a sense you will probably replay maybe 1-2 times, or max 3 if the story interests you enough. Though that is different from person to person of course.Chores missed the pointDoing all the chores does not contribute to how the characters think of you. Having you do chores to look innocent while also getting bonus items to help you progress the game would have made a great combination of both character progression and reflection.Quiet is SubstanceHonestly I am not a big fan of quiet characters especially when they are the main characters. In this case though given the premise of the game it actually works in its favor. When you see this kid never talk to his family or the servants it really comes off as creepy, and this is also noticed by the in game characters also. Later in the game they will reference that you don’t talk at all etc. Overall, I think it was actually a good choice.ConclusionOverall, I would say this game is pretty good in executing the progression and idea of the antichrist. It seemed the developers picked progression of characters over variety of ways you could kill off a character.			"

												I totally owe this game a nice review. No, I really do not approve of lil kids being possessed murderers,but this game is somehow compelling! I wasn`t searching for guides or walktroughs, so it stroke me slowly in time - I will take care of everysingle one of them, one by one.  Even my ... oh my!! So in this emotional state, you somehow need to loose your humanity and try to focus on the FUN parts /there are plenty, like the TRICYCLE, changing weather, some achievements, the way you need to listen, watch and follow clues, the automatic innocent status, because you are supposedto be a little ANGEL not a little devil.. they will find out too late.. The atmosphere can satisfy your darker tastes, actually the whole game does it. Give it a try :) Just don`t try any of it at home!! :D			"

												As a fan of  The Omen movies, I immediately bought this game desipite the so-so reviews.  Yes, as a quality game it fails in some ways.  The graphics are pretty bad and I thought I was looking at a Halflife 2-era game because it looked like something off the Source engine. There also isn't a lot of freedom to trap setting because once you find the solution that's it.  It's basically an adventure game.  Now that the bad is out of the way, the concept is so awesome and the deaths are so unbelievably cruel and gruesome that it's a memorable experience.  I would wait until it goes on sale, however.  "

tl;drI really wanted to like this game.PROS+ GREAT concept (akin to the Omen)+ Well-crafted map layoutCONS- This game WILL crash on you. - Limited storyline that starts strong and then disappears- Poor voice acting and sound design- Linear, point-and-click puzzle game masquerading as a 3rd-person adventure game- No variability in mission-completion pathways (there is only one way to complete each mission)- Unstable and buggy AI interaction that breaks immersion completely- Limited mission-guidance results in aimless walking around and clicking on everything around until the path becomes obvious- Limited to no player agency -- point and click your way to the next goofy cut-scene.I cannot recommend this game. Once the novelty wears off, this game quickly becomes not fun.  I played through the first six missions and decided that my time was worth more to me than to spend any more of it on a game which I kept hoping would be better. If you found this review helpful, please vote it up, many thanks! :D			"

												Game name: LuciusGame score: 8/10Reviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Lucius is a third-person adventure game that follows a boy's murder spree after his 6th birthday in 1972. Roughly based off the movie The Omen, Lucius gains satanic abilities after he is visited by Lucifer, who reveals that he is in fact, his real father. After this information is revealed, Lucius prepares to do his bidding, which is kill everyone inside his huge home, Dante Manor. After murders begin to unfold, residents become wary of what's happening around the estate, knowing they're going to be next. With a memorable hook and interesting story filled with satanic powers, murder, lore and more, Lucius delivers the same experience as The Omen gives off. Controls:WASD - MovementMouse - LookLeft click - InteractQ - Notebook (chore list as well as mission hints)1-5 keys - Switch abilityGameplay:Although linear, Lucius is entailed to only work toward killing a certain character which only allows him to explore certain areas of the estate. Yet, by level 15, you've freely unlocked the whole place with no restrictions. It seems far off, but you should mainly focus on the story rather than wandering off to explore areas that come before needed. (There is an achievement for finding the secret area before chapter 7, which is very easy to do during the night scene). Lucius is equipped with 4 powers by the end of the game: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase, and combustion. With these, you will be able to find was to harm your enemies as well as do various other tasks (like chores). Cliche to the story, Lucius also becomes weak and cannot perform when a cross is present, so he must flip it over (super chiche). The game does get buggy at times which is why I only gave this an 8/10. The models sometimes clip into each other and also stretch out when the conditions are right (example: clipping into an object being closed while you're still moving). There's also a neat-o bug present when using the tricicle, which allows you to glitch out of the building and explore the area outside the map. It's kind of neat to see what's out there. Graphics:Graphics are limited to 1080p in-menu, but can be adjusted to your native if you wish by editing the config file found in your documents folder under Lucius. There's also settings to set all the way up to very high (ultra) which makes everything better contrasted and increases motion blur as compared to the high setting. I've never recommended anything lower than medium if you're playing this game, as low setting makes your game way too bright and severely dulls it out. If anything, lower end systems should play this at 720p medium settings (just be sure you at least meet the minimum recommended specs or you'll have a very bad time. In game, I was able to maintain a constant 60fps at 1080p Ultra settings, with occational dips at possible area loading points (the map is fairly big, yet not like Battlefield map size, just big) down to around 45-50fps. Scenes is where it gets bad, since at times when high rendered assets are splashed onto the screen, making the game drop down to 20fps at times. The issues are still being fixed, even after the dev team has released another game even, they still continue to update this game. Game Balance:The only intruding aspect about this game is when you're supposed to be asleep but you're wondering around the area at night. If you're caught you will have a game over (until you gain memory erase). OtherThe game is still being actively updated and fixed (even just recently they fixed the achievement ""I'm addicted"" to where previously you had to be in-game and not alt-tabbed out and play 40 hours. Now it's based off Steam time. Final Rating:8/10In Conclusion:I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed The Omen or enjoys stories such as this. It's truely a unique game, and has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest indie games (in my book). The game is often on sale for very cheap (original is $10, sales make it under $2, and various sites have done giveaways (which is how I got 20+ keys) so it's very easy to get). Please feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations. Thanks for reading!			"

												Just finished Lucius, took me around 5 hours, and got 41 of 58 achievements.Overall it's a pretty interesting game, you play a Lucius a 7 year old boy who lives in a mansion with his family and many maids, butlers and handymen who are under your fathers employ, except he's not your actually father, Satan is, you are the spawn of Satan who has been tasked with gather souls for your real father to acquire various powers like telekinesis, mind control and combustion. The games premise is just that, kill everyone for Satan, expect the ways you have to go about doing so are quite different and unique, the main gameplay mechanics feel like a mix between classic Hitman trial and error with it's environmental deaths. Where combining found items with environmental hazards usually result in a entertaining death cutscene and no suspicioun cast upon Lucius.Now the story isn't great, the voice acting is hammy and weirdly paced making it sound like sentences are being stitched together from totally different actors and the animations aren't detailed either. Some of the characters are interesting enough, for example Lucius' grandfather is a hard man who has something to hide and his motives are shown throughout the game and give an interesting look on the family's rise to power and occult ties. The mother slowly losing her mind lead to some interesting ambient dialogue like her asking Lucius to brush his teeth in a loving tone then immediately telling him to bug off because he's creeping her out, it's more than likely a bug but humorous none the less. As far as visuals are concerned, they're entirely fine for the most part, there are moment's when the game can be quite beautiful and others when it looks like a scene from a cut Deadly Premonition level. The flow they achieve between making the game challenging but not making it frustrating looking for obscure items and solutions to problems are troubling, far too often I had to look up a FAQ on what obscure non related item I needed to complete a task that could have been simply completed another, far simpler way. That also brings out how the limited the game actually is in it's structure and openness to the player, Dante's Mansion, the games only location, is large and sprawling with countless rooms and corridors but most aren't used frequently or at all.As a closing thought, I did really enjoy the game, the absurdity of the kills and the way the narrative tries to justify 20 deaths in one house as accidents so the detective working the cases doesn't have to call the FBI, is dumb fun, and entertaining. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of the older Hitman games and likes using the environment to kill hapless victims to try this game out, you mind fun for a good weekend of kill all for the glory of old pop Satan.+ Environmental kills are fun and interesting+ Graphics are nice in spots and the location is mostly well designed+ Interesting idea and premise+ Powers can lead to interesting gameplay mechanics- Story is a little dumb, and stretches the players disbelief far- Voice action and animations are lackluster- Puzzles/Kills can be far too obtuse and can lead to frustration- Limited in it's scope and options to the player7.5 out of 10			"

												If Hitman had a son that son was the Anti-Christ, that son whould be Lucius.Luicius is a strange yet original game: it mix the old point and click with a small 3D open world. Your quest is to kill everyone in the house, 'cause you need human sacriface for your daddy, some guy who work in the ""underground"". If you want to be a hero, and not a villian, this is not the game for you.The story isn't bad at all, its actually pretty nice. Sure, it takes some forced ways into the story, and you clearly see them, but they won't bother you much. At least, it didn't bother me, it actually made the game much more interesting. The ending isn't also bad, but it left me with a feel of uncompletionist. Probably was too fast.The gameplay works fine: you have to collect items around the house to complete goals to kill people and make the homicides looks like accidents. Sadly the difficulty goes to insanely hard that ""I don't even know what to do"" to ""this is so easy that even a 6 years old kid whould do that"". Did I mention you're a 6 years old kid?The music it's pretty fitting, but it gets repetive real soon. And expecially sometimes it bugs out, like it disappear or change theme out of nowhere and you don't know what's goin on, even tho' nothing is goin on.The graphic its ""meh"": there ain't no good facial expression, and the lip sinc its all broken, but for some reason, the ambiance looks awesome, and the gore works fine. It seems the creator couldn't put in some good face flexes.I've encounter some bugs and glitch along the game, and sometimes they made me restart the mission. For exemple, I opened the journal during a cutscene, and the game freeze. Couldn't move. Or in a cutscene, I was riding the tricicle before that happened, and Lucius was flying around. (this picture might contain SPOILERS) http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/579027346723227969/8889A751021635A9C4A9E9FBBE99D46D33B78408/Final Score: 6.5/10Overall, the game its fun, not too long (around 6-7 hours of gameplay) but it's a nice title. Maybe 20€ can be a little too much for it, I suggest to get it around 5€ like I did.			"

												A great idea, executed in a not-so-great way. That is Lucius, a horror-focused action adventure.So, the idea is great; a free roam game where you get to kill people like in those famous horror movies we've all seen. You'll be using items and powers to kill off these people. It's not all that straightforward though. You have to solve little puzzles to complete objectives. And every time you complete one of these objectives you're one step closer to killing a certain someone.But it's all executed in a mediocre way; the inventory is cumbersome to use, but manageable. The 'stealth' missions are terrible; there's no way to see where a certain character is so you'll bump into someone frequently. And sometimes the hints you get just aren't clear enough, which results in you doing the wrong thing. And when it's Game Over you have to start the mission all over again (including sidequests).It's an interesting idea though. And I would love to see a(n improved) sequel someday.[Rating: 65/100]			"

Wandering around the mansion with no clue what to do next gets old very fast. "

												Nice game with a good story. Killing all those people in all those different ways was a lot of fun, but it's a bit too limited in that area: each person can only be killed in a single specific way, so there's no room for creativity, although that kind of makes each death a bit more meaningful. There are 2 messed up achievements though: you have to play the game for 20 and 40 hours. It has zero replayability and can be beaten in less than 10 hours, but sure, I'll definitely play it for 40 hours.			"

												Lucius is a third-person adventure/puzzle game, in which you play as Lucifer's son and murder everyone in the manor you live in. The concept is interesting, since it's kinda like reverse horror, but unfortunately the execution is poor. The gameplay is pretty much just murdering the people in the house in a certain order and in a pre-determined way and watching a cutscene showing the murder. After the murder cutscene you get a new cutscene, which usually involves a detective, who is put on the case after your first murder. The game could have easily been a point-and-click game, because you just look for items and after using the right items you watch the murder commence.The game let's you free roam around the fairly big manor between the murders, but there isn't much to do aside from some ""fetch quests"" called chores and looking for items needed in future murders. After doing enough chores you get some items, of which 2 just give hints for the murder puzzles and the last one is a tricycle. The tricycle let's you move around the manor a bit faster and also let's you use a glitched staircase to get out of the house. After each murder you get a new superpower or upgrades to the ones you already have. The game has 4 superpowers: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase and combustion. You will need all those superpowers for the murder puzzles and while you can use some of them for other purposes, they're not really fun. The combustion power is also used in the boss battles the game has and also in some extra mini-game, which seemed to involve priests chasing you (a child) with crosses in a dark forest. I didn't like the boss battles or that mini-game at all, because the combustion power isn't fun and felt a bit clunky to use.Graphics-wise the game looks pretty good for an indie game, but the devs decided to occasionally use some post-processing effects, which actually made the game look a bit uglier. The lip-syncing seemed to be a bit off, but it didn't really bother me. The voice acting ranged from pretty good to quite awful. The game also has a pretty badly done sex, which looks quite funny as a result and there's some frontal 3D nudity as well. The story and dialogue is pretty bad and the ending was probably one of the worst endings ever.It's a pretty bad game, which could have been so much more. I wouldn't really recommend playing it unless you want to experience some pretty funny glitches. The game is pretty short (took me 5 and a half hours to complete), so it's not like you'd waste a lot of time.			"

Posted: October 3, 2016
												So I acutally bought this game last year, perhaps around October (2015) time, and I haven't played it until now. This game is one that I would recommend for numerous reasons. Upon initially loading up the game and killing my first person, I was completely hooked. I'm not too sure what that says about me, but who cares. I think perhaps it was the fact that I've never played a game where I am basically the spawn of Satan. Also, post purchase of the game, I was surprised that the game had an actual, well-written (arguable) storyline. It was nice to have to follow a pattern of scripted killings, instead of just walking round murdering at will (not the mechanic xD). I especially enjoyed the fact that every death was different and unpredictable. This was very pleasing. Another reason why I enjoyed this game was because each character was different and had a different purpose. There was one particular character I had a problem ""ending""...and that was Alastair. I thougt he was cool, and he reminded me of Alfred Pennyworth, who's a pretty awesome Batman character. However, having said that I would recommend this game THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD IMPROVE. First of all, I began to feel that the constant murdering towards the end (even though I did enjoy the story and each character's death scene) was getting a little teadous. It just felt like it was going on-and-on, chapter-after-chapter. Although it was still fun.Second of all, I had a real big problem with some of the achievements. As of writing this, I have all but three achievements left to collect:  Playing for 20 hours.  Playing for 40 hours.  Riding on the bike things for 10 miles. At the moment, the 10 mile one isn't a problem because I know I'm just going to have to ride around, however, the other two are completely ridiculous. First of all, I don't see how there is 40 hours of content here, and after looking at the global achievement statistics, only 2.9% (or something like that) of people have got this achievement. This is a game that I will come back to and replay in the future but, there is no way that I am getting a 40 hour achievement that is worthwhile to get. So I will be missing these achievements out. Having to do this really annoys me, because I am (and sorry for the colloquialism here) an 'achievement ♥♥♥♥♥'. I really like achievement hunting. Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I've never really given a proper review before on here, but I felt like I should for this game. Thanks for reading and please be respectful of my opinions, as I would be to yours.Thanks again. "

												Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator.  You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one.  It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay.  In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus.  Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal.  Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters.  The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there.  You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them.  Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play.  The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say ""delightfully twisted.""  It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.			"

												Lucius - This game is good, its not the best though. I'd only buy it if it was on sale.This game is very entertaining to play, the different death's throughout the game are quite good, however I think this game would be better if you could decide how to kill each person yourself. Like if you had several choices of how to kill each person.I think the different powers you get when playing are okay, but I think they might have been a bit pointless for some parts since you barely use one or two of them. But that's my opinion I guess. I do recommend this game, its a real time killer if your waiting for a better game to download or something, haha!Just buy it when its on sale, £14.99 is a bit much for a game that is only about 4-5 hours of gameplay.

												This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours, where I also got 54 achievements along the way. You play as the devil's child and you have to kill all persons in your father's mansion without leaving any traces, while a detective investigates every death as they happen.The game is a bit of adventure, point and click, stealth and puzzles in general.A special note to a chapter where you have to take the power down, then everyone in the house is walking around with a flashlight and you have to avoid them at all costs while doing some tasks - a really fun stealth experience.LUCIUS IS REALLY BADASS.

												Despite its ups and downs, I think overall it’s a good game. If you just remember that it is a game and it would have been really difficult to give it the kind of freedom you might have been expecting, that is. (I tried to keep this one fairly short but alas, that just didn’t happen. Prepare your attention span!)I meant the above in the sense that this game tries to give you an “open” feeling to it, as if it’s not linear and you are wreaking havoc at your own expense. But when you get down to it, it is linear. It’s quite closed and it’s more of an organised chaos then just plain ol’ chaos. Given that, it’s still a very enjoyable game. I would consider this game still quite indie, so that makes me think even more that for what resources they had or what they were capable of with a small team, they pulled off a really decent game. Because of how the gameplay is laid out, each chapter you’re given a new target and in ways it kind of felt like more of a puzzle to figure out what you had to do with them rather then you plotting your own devilish plan. Which I still found quite fun. There was a few times I really had no idea what I was supposed to do. Especially at the beginning when you get past the early stages of the game where parts of the house are blocked off and you can’t roam around as much. When the game stopped leading me to where and what I was supposed to do and I was finally able to access the whole house, I wasn’t sure on how it was supposed to work. Can I pick them off in any order, do I have to do them in an order and if so, what is the order, or what? Well, after wondering around for a long time completing chores of which I wasn’t sure of why I was doing either, I finally figured it all out. So, if you get something similar I’d just say stick with it, it all becomes clear as you go. My state of confusion didn’t last too long and in all honesty I can be dumb as hell sometimes. In terms of story it was interesting. I wasn’t really sure of where they were going with it or how the whole thing was going to conclude but I was eager to find out. It’s nothing too profound or life changing but it was definitely not predictable or disappointing. The English voice acting in this game is a little cringe worthy at times. It’s not horrifically bad but you can tell there is no Academy Award winners amongst the lot. The worst in my opinion being the stereotypically drunk Irish janitor. With that said, I don’t think this game is primarily English. So I can see how the English voice acting might be a little lacked if they were focused mainly on another language. Moving onto graphics. The graphics are pretty decent and I think I would say that “scenery and general surroundings”-wise is where its strengths are at. The AI and character models however are not the best. I got a very “Garry’s Mod videos before Valve Source Filmmaker” feeling off of it at times. I might be over exaggerating a bit there. I think it’s just the expressions and slight glitches to the models that gave me that feeling. The AI is very robotic, the characters wonder around the house replaying a laid out routine (which I guess they have to on some level, seeing as certain characters need to be “lured” to a certain place and you can only do that by waiting for them to lap back around to where you need them). They also shout the same sets of dialog at you whenever you get within a certain radius of them (doesn’t even matter if there’s a wall between you, you WILL get yelled at through walls).Just to moan about the characters that tad bit more and bore you all to death when it’s not really necessary because I actually like the game, I am going to mention the lack of… well… character… that I felt from our little man Lucius. This isn’t something that bothered me all that much but I thought it worth mentioning. I love the concept of playing as a slightly younger character. “Among the Sleep” Is what I’m going to be comparing to. Among the Sleep was a game where you played as a toddler and the child like mannerisms and little gestures and what not in that game really impressed me. You walk, talk and generally act like a toddler. You run too fast? You’re poor little baby self will fall over. Maybe this wasn’t the best comparison to use seeing as the obvious age difference with the two characters in the two games. A 2 year old Vs. a 6 year old is hardly the same. But I kind of felt that the fact Lucius is so young and therefore it being so disturbing him being so sadistic, wasn’t emphasised enough. I kind of felt like I was just playing as a midget adult. Which, I guess you could argue he isn’t like a child at all and maybe that is the point? But, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Lucius had more “demon child” like characteristics. Especially given that your character doesn’t speak, mute characters usually need something to show their character in others ways then just talking. Or maybe I am just over analysing!In terms of achievements this one is very doable. I played through the whole game and ended up going back for some achievements (which is easy to do seeing as there is a chapter select included). I’m currently at 97% and in honesty the last two I need are baffling as too why they’d even add them in.The last two are for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours. Now, I’d say I must have played through the game one and a half times. With that I’m at 9 hours at the moment. Now, with some simple maths you can obviously see that you’d need to play the game a nonsensically amount of times to actually get the 40 hour achievement. I know it’s titled “I’m addicted” but I think I’d actually feel genuinely worried for anyone that played a game about a demon child murdering people that many times. I think I’ll just idle for these last two! Other than that though, it’s an easy 100%.EDIT: I have found that with the two last achievements, you cannot idle the game on the menu screen! You actually have to be in the game for it to work! (Hence why I have 72 hours on record, not just the 40 I need. Took me a while to notice it wasn’t working) I thought this was worth mentioning for any achievement hunters out there.All in all, despite me moaning and droning on about certain things, I would say this game is great and well worth a try. It’s something a bit different and unique. It also has a sequel of which I think I’m definitely going to be trying out. If you’re looking for something fun and mischievous to play then this one is a good place to start. Overall I got a very positive feeling off of this one.TL;DR: Quite linear, interesting story, kind of cringe English voice acting, decent graphics, alright characters, an easy 100% and generally a lot of fun. Definitely try it if you’re looking for a bit of mischievous fun.			"

												While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience, and any hardcore fans of the genre owe it to themselves to give it a look, provided they have strong stomachs.

												definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard. I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only ""redeeming"" characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.			"

												This game was a birthday gift from a great Steam friend, always wanted the game and always wanted to try it but I was always unsure about the game if it would be good.Well im glad I got to play this game because it is truly an amazing game yes it's from 2012 but the story is pretty cool, It does revolve around one house and one family but the developers have made this work in a good way, you play the game as a child coached by the devil into doing some pretty evil things.The gameplay was great and I will play this game again to get the last achievements, the graphics are great and it worked well on my 5760x1080 resolution which I really liked.controls are pretty basic but for this game and it is okTo me the Steam write-up does not help sell this game and the metacritic score I don't really understand people's low ratings I guess we all see games from different prospective.I will finish this off by saying if your thinking about buying the game buy it you wont regret it if your into horror.

												The game has quite a bit of cool aspects that I listed in pros.  Ultimately I got bored and was not as entertained enough by the aesthetics to continue running around the mansion in search of items to use.  I do not play this type of game frequently.  I lost interest after a few hours of playing.  I may pick it up again in the future.  Pros:-The story is interesting-The graphics are decent-The gameplay is fine-Neat secret rooms-Worth the price i paid ($ 5-10?) for the time it held my attention.-A good story unfolds as you advance and you get neat abilitiesCons:-Conitnuously walking around the house to find items that aren't explicitly/implicitly obvious or close by.  This may cause you to walk around aimlessly for a while getting absolutely nowhere.. (or I am just not good at it.)-The time it takes to find items caused me to lose interest "

												Lucius is a reversed horror-based detective story, where it's you who has to apparently outwit the detective and not the other way round (as is usually the case).As the son of Lucifer, it's your task to rid the entire household of Mr Wagner, a US senator while being discreet as possible. In order to achieve this you're given some powers that will aid you along the way that include memory wipe and mind control.It's fun while it lasts but because it's within a mansion and you have no control over how to go about killing these people (it's written in stone), it quickly becomes boring.6/10.My Youtube review:

												Game is incedibly unstable. It will slowdown and then crash if you break too many bottles. Did I mention there's an achievement for breaking bottles?There's no manual save, so when the game crashes, you'll lose a lot of progress.It controls poorly and perhaps worst of all, simply isn't all that fun. I can't recomend it.EDIT: I've since finished the game and have softened a bit on it. The executions are creative if not necesaryily logical and the plot is coherent if unimaginative. Between the instability and less than stellar gameplay, I still can't recommend it. It's the poster child of good idea, poor execution.But if you get the game for free, and you're a fan of the Hitman series or hidden object games, it's worth a playthrough if you can get past the bugs.Edit 2: And for you achievment hunters out there, Lucius has 2 time based acheivements. Play for 20 and for 40 hours. However, this game only takes about 10 hours to complete and that's if you're really taking your time. Each mission only has one way to solve it so the game has no replayability and the achievements force idling, but here's the kicker. Lucius can't even idle properly. If you alt+tab the window it doesn't count. Being at the menu doesn't count. You have to be in-game with the window in the foreground.Yea.			"

												Would love to, but i just can't recommend this game.I like the idea, love the genre... but Lucius simply doesn't meet my expectations.Hope they do better next time tho.Cons:- No plot at all (you are basically a paranormal serial killer)- No logic involved in many puzzles.- Huge mansion, small essential objects to collect not easy to spot quite often.- No AI. Just bots walking up un down predefined paths + some triggers.- Extremely linear game:   * Puzzles have 1 and only 1 solution, if you miss a tiny object in the corner of a room you are simply stuck till you spot it. Overall:- Dull, repetitive, frustrating paranormal serial killer simulator.""Avoid this game as hell, the power of the Christ compels you!""			"

												Gore 10/10Story 8/10 Gameplay 6/10Replayable 8/10Achievement 100% 7/10Lucius is like the film Omen, but let's not talk about the film 'cause I can only remember bits.'Bought this game when it was on sale and I would buy the game if it wasn't. The Story and Gameplay kept me playing alone. If you enjoy playing a dark twisted 6 year old demon child, that go around killing residents of the Mansion you call home in the sometimes sick and gorey ways a demon child can kill you. Story isn't majorly long about 6 hours, well thats how long it took me. On each of the chapters of the game you kill someone but you have to go on a hunt to find certain items or objects to set them up to look like a accident and not a young speachless boy.And for more creepy is unlocking the bicycle and go riding around from room to room like its a scene out of a Stanley Kubrick horror movie.

												Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds.The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing.Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.

												Lucius is a game where it puts you in control of a 6 year old boy whos grandfather has a deal with Satan. Where he and his family well gain everything they could want, in return his first Grandson, Lucius. Satan comes to claim what is his on your 6th birthday, where he proceeds to instruct you on your new fait. You must kill every one living with in the house hold (maid, cooks, mechanic, family members, and your teacher) with out being caught by the investigator that is trying to piece the hole mystery together. The killing is a little linear when it comes to who and how you kill them but it still makes it interesting trying to figure out how to do it. The story is good and the graphics are not to great but over all its still one of my fav games. If it goes on sale for $10 its a must grab if you enjoy Horror Adventure games from the killers point of view!8/10			"

												I was actaully pretty excited about this game so maybe I went into it with higher expectations than what I should have had.All in all, it was a good buy for the summer sale; I got it really cheap (like $5 or something like that?). It's a fun concept and the progression with the powers seem nifty, but it's mostly the side quests that put me off. If they had a better tracking system for side quests, it would be a bit more fun, but they expect you to navigate a house you have no idea how to navigate. The only help you get is a map that only shows the direction of the main quest, but if you want to do any of the additional quests (which I did), you have to look up guides on how to find things, otherwise your'e scouring an enormous mansion without any direction or hint on where to look.I don't have a problem doing the chores, but they need to give you a hint on where to find things - even if it's just a little one. You're either spending too much time trudging around the house looking for things, or you're looking it up online.The voice acting and facial animations are poorly done. That's not TOO important for me, but it was a bit distracting from the cut scene.			"

Product received for free
Non-flexibility at killing gets annoying after a whileI like the animation. And the sounds are good too.The game does have a good suspense - horror atmosphere.The story is simple. You're the son of the devil and you've to kill everyone in the mansion.You do that by wandering in the mansion, picking up stuff into your inventory and then using it and your powers (which you get after killing a certain number of people) to figure out the correct way to kill the person.Which is difficult since the person can be killed in a particular way only and you have to guess that exact way. I didn't find the hints that helpful.Once, I had to break a lawn-mower and I spent more than an hour trying to hide at different places to use Telekinesis to break it and each time I would get caught. Finally I gave up and learned from a guide that I had to place a fricking stone (that I had picked up a long while back) in the specified position so that the mower run's over it and breaks!Basically, there is no flexibility in the way you kill people and it's difficult to guess the correct way and that can make it a bit annoying at times.Also, the mansion is huge! Going around from one place to another takes time and feels annoying and you may have to interact with a lot of items to find those that you can put in inventory.			"

tl;dr -> In Lucius you play as an anti-social devil child who must kill different people in graphicto satisfy your father, Satan. Think Hitman, but if you were a satan-spawn and had much more restricted, linear gameplay.First off, I want to make clear the fact that I really enjoyed the game and played it to completion, however, I have a very specific reason why I have given a ""do not recommend"" rating - which will be explained below. Suffice it to say that I do not support certain types of developer behavior/gameplay mechanics when playing games.I had the pleasure of having this game gifted to me by one of my very generous friends, and he wanted me to review it once I had a chance to play. Thanks again! If you enjoy devil/demonic themes, graphic violence and death scenes, and being the son of Satan, than you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good - the detail in the character models and background (ex: rooms of the mansion) are well-done. The music and sounds are good, and the BGM really matches the gameplay and themes - adding to the atmosphere set by the game. The story is okay, but nothing too fancy - you are a demonic child and must kill people to satisfy your father, the devil. The controls are simple and easy to learn - the tutorials are always quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the most difficult aspect of the game is probably figuring out the specific ways to kill your targets. To remedy this, you can unlock the music box, which is infused by Satan and will show you ""hints"" whenever you activate it. In order to unlock this useful item, you must complete almost all (you can miss/ignore one) available chores in the game. Examples include throwing out the garbage, cleaning your room, and finding your mom's missing earings.Overall, the gameplay is decent - each chapter requires you to kill someone in your mansion. Admittedly, the regular mansion setting may become boring, however, the game compensates for this by progressively unlocking more parts of the house to be accessible. When you begin a chapter, both your map and journal will help direct you to your target. Usually, you will be given good hints in your journal regarding the next steps to kill your targets. Again, if you find yourself having trouble, work to finish off your chores so you can unlock the music box. As a devil child, crosses weaken your powers, so you must turn any crosses upside down to negate their effects. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new powers, like telekinesis, mind-erase, and combustion. Tutorials are provided by Satan whenever you receive new abilities. You can fail chapters by revealing yourself - which occurs if you use your powers (primarily telekinesis) within sight of others. Something I liked about the game is how you can do things that make subsequent missions much easier - usually by reducing time. For example, if you like exploring and picking up all available items, you will probably pick up an item that will allow you to progress through a future mission without having to double-back into the house. The house is fairly large, and the map helps a lot in orienting yourself with the landscape.At the end of the game, you  have one of two routes to select, which changes the type of boss battles you face - I don't believe this changes the ending . The ending is a bit anti-climatic, but the overall journey and cutscenes are pretty good. A number of the death scenes are fairly graphic, so that is something to be aware of if you are particularly squeamish. There are 20 chapters, allowing for a variety of death types and related puzzles. There is also a  peeping tom segment where you watch a maid taking a bath (you see breasts and some bush) .For achievement hunters, achieving 100% is not that difficult, however, there are two extremely ridiculous achievements - one requiring 20 and the other 40 hours of playtime. Note that this DOES NOT mean idling time, but actual game playtime. From what I've read and experienced, you cannot leave the game running with the menu on, or even stand straight. Some people like to have the W (forward) key held down so the character is always walking. Another silly achievement is cycling (unlocked by doing chores) for x miles because the achievement for sprinting x miles can be completed within one or two playthroughs. I have a big problem with this style of achievements because it is essentially gametime mining - and I absolutely HATE artificial-game-lengtheners. If you take your time with the game and do two playthroughs to  try both ending routes, when you could just as easily load the chapter and select the other option , you could PROBABLY stretch the gameplay to ~10 hours. The two achievements require 20 and 40 NON-IDLING hours. I find that absolutely ridiculous, given the amount of time it takes to complete the game. As an avid game reviewer, I just cannot accept or support this type of behavior. If these achievements were removed, or reduced to reasonable hours, then I would immediately switch my ""do not recommend"" to ""recommend."" Even if you are not an achievement junkie, I cannot encourage this type of gametime farming - because I know there are always people willing to 100% complete a game. If you like role-playing as the son of Satan, wrecking havoc on your family household in the name of evil, then give this game a try. Recommend, but DO NOT support stupid game design practices as seen in the achievements.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

Lucius is a very simplistic point and click game that offers very little immersion, gameplay or anything else. The puzzles are mundane, if you can call them puzzles. You can complete the story in maybe 2 or 3 hours, if you can stand it for that long. The game offers no replayability and there are quite a lot of bugs around.Avoid.			"

The Devil is in the detailsLucius is certainly not a title for fans of horror. Or adventure games. Neither the well-drawn story. But it has some positive qualities. The creators have tried to spice up the game giving players a little, but at least some variety in missions. I appreciate it, because there is nothing better in the game. However, if you have a few hours, unnecessary money in your wallet and you feel that you have an appetite for adventure, which actually goes by itself, I can't under any circumstances stop you from buying this game. But let no one say you have not been warned.#PIMP MY TRICYCLE/THEY SEE ME ROLLIN "

												There are too many 6's involved! The baby was born in June, the 6th month, on the 6th day, in 1966. That's four 6's! Now if the baby was born on 6-06-06 and the game was set back in the day just a bit further than what it is now (60 years lol), it would be freakier.It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. There is no reset to default in the keybinds, so be sure you want to rebind keys before procceding. Some of the quests can be quite confusing. ""What do I do?"" is the most used question I have asked myself throughout this game. You are not really given hints on what to do or where to go until you do them and your notebook is updated. Thanks notebook, where were you before I did this or that?! Satans notebook bites.Man, I am one evil, little 6 year old murderous brat, it's great. Another creepy thing is, when writing this review my text was spazzing out all over the place. This game is haunted! One of the best game I have got for free through Indiegala.			"

												It ain't easy being the Antichrist. In adventure/puzzle game Lucius, you experience the trials and tribulations of being the firstborn son of the big red guy with the horns. As you might expect given the young lad's pedigree, when he suffers growing pains, they involve a sizable body count. Lucifer is a demanding daddy, who wants souls in exchange for building the tyke up with telekinetic powers. All this contributes to a grim but promising setting where your only goal is to figure out how to murder the folks on the devil's hit list. Unfortunately, this darkly innovative premise is not implemented well, due to a reliance on pixel hunts, and you're dropped onto the scene with just pop's orders to start killing.The entire game has been liberally borrowed from the Omen series of horror films (so liberally that you wonder if lawyers are being put on retainer at this very moment). You take on the role of the title character, Lucius, who gets a visit from his infernal real father on the occasion of his sixth birthday on June 6, 1972 (which, of course, means that he was born on the auspicious date of 6/6/66). Daddy stops in to give the pale-faced, lank-haired little ghoul both gifts and marching orders. He has big plans for Lucius, and these can best be realized by the murder of, well, pretty much everybody who lives and works in the huge family home called Dante Manor.You start off by simply locking a maid in the walk-in kitchen freezer, and then graduate to inventive slaughters such as cutting a butcher's head in half. If you're familiar at all with the decapitations and vivisections that made the first two Omen movies so striking back in the '70s, you'll know exactly what sort of Grand Guignol atmosphere that developer Shiver Games is going for here. Most of the game is creepy and understated, with Lucius haunting the halls of the old mansion, sometimes with just a flashlight to guide his way. A barely there B-movie script and mechanical voice acting make it tough to take the story seriously, but the kills make a real impression as they splash onto the screen with showers of blood and body parts. The game strikes a good balance between chills and gore that any fan of horror movies will appreciate.It's not as if Lucius is just an average, everyday six-year-old serial killer, either. He possesses a range of supernatural powers courtesy of dear old dad. These get more powerful with every murder, so while you start with the basic telekinetic ability to toss around objects and turn on machinery (bad luck for that butcher mentioned above), you are soon enough launching fireballs. At the same time, Lucius is just a kid to his parents and the household staff. You might be plotting gruesome murders, but you still have to brush your teeth and clean up your room so mommy and daddy can see that you're a good boy (the one bit of effective black comedy in a game that is otherwise gloomy). Rewards for being so well behaved include such treats as a Ouija board that dispenses hints, though it's not clear how mom and dad got their hands on such trinkets.Aspects of the gameplay are more off-kilter in reality than they seem when laid out on paper. The biggest problem is a lack of information. You're essentially greeted with the devil's instructions to start killing people right when the game begins, and are left to suss out how to go about doing this on your own. Tips are given about various special skills, like telekinesis, but the core aspects of the game are not explained well. And they really should be, because this is a unique experience that blends the murder-sim attitude of games like Hitman and Manhunt with point-and-click adventure tropes. Lucius can't just creep up on his kills. Instead, he needs to explore the mansion to load up his inventory with various items necessary to set victims up and finish them off. Lucius also has to sneak around. Getting spotted doing something odd by mom or any of the other characters that patrol the mansion results in instantly failing your assignment. This process makes sense when clearly laid out, but unfortunately, the developers didn't include tutorial killings to help you get a clear picture of your task.As the old saying goes, the devil is in the details, and details abound in Lucius. Dante Mansion is a massive old place loaded with exhaustively detailed dens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, game rooms, bars, gardens, cellars, kitchens, and more. The sheer amount of care that went into the mansion's design is impressive. Pretty much everything is functional. You can pull open drawers in every desk, nightstand, and wardrobe in the place, and a lot of rooms come equipped with crucifixes that need to be flipped upside down before they drain Lucius of his Hades-spawned powers.It all looks good, even though the visual quality is more functional than cutting-edge and the repetitive music can add a grating tone to the entire scene. Alas, there are some high costs to this visual appeal. First of all, loading the mansion takes am exhaustingly long time. Second, the cavernous nature of the home makes for tedious exploration and pixel hunting when looking for items required to pull off a kill. Feedback is often lacking. Certain puzzles lack proper clues pointing you towards the proper solution, such as overheard lines of dialogue that could nudge you in the right direction. Formidable leaps in logic have to be made all through your killing spree, making you wonder if the devil might have been better off giving Lucius a .38 and an alibi.Also, though the mansion is enormous and absolutely loaded with all manner of furniture and people, there seems to be only one road to every murder. There is no way to freewheel through killings, or to concoct various nefarious plots. The sprawling setting is mostly wasted, because you can't make use of it to pull off inventive murders. Instead, you're stuck with a paint-by-numbers approach where you follow a set path of collecting items and triggering events that then kick off a brief cutscene of someone dying in a macabre fashion. This limits the game, especially if you come to it as a veteran of something like Manhunt, where you could murder victims in all sorts of creative ways.Lucius blends frustration with aha moments where everything briefly comes together. While you take some morbid pleasure in walking around in the cloven hooves of a chip off the old Beelzebub, it is hard to fully enjoy figuring out how to send your victims on their merry way to hell. Playing a gaming adaptation of The Omen from the perspective of the creepy little kid is certainly an original concept that will carry you along for a while, but the underdeveloped and limited mechanics make it tough to see this horror story through to its conclusion.

												TL;DR: If you want a buggy satanic open-world-ish puzzle game,this might be the one for you,if it was cheaper.This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell ""Combustion"" is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.

												Lucius reminds me and I'm sure of a lot of people of The Omen. The gameplay is simple yet the manor is a big place to explore and the chores for side missions were fun to do for gifts and rewards that help you around. The voice acting is pretty bad and the graphics are fair but despite this, it's the idea of controlling a six year old to kill that gives me, and people that actually understand this game, a very deep guilty pleasure.

												Lucius is a game where you play as the son of the devil. The goal is really simple: In each chapter (there are 18), you have to kill someone in a SPECIFIC way. Even better, you're all isolated in a big manor in which you can explore in every chapter as you wish (mostly). There's not much to do in this manor except the goal of each chapter and some optional chores (to be a good boy ;) ) but it's still fun to explore every corner of this giant place every time.The main problem with this game for most people is that you don't get to choose how to kill this person. You have to find some items, put them (or interact with them) at specific places to achieve your goal. For me, it's not a problem. As long as you're okay with that, you'll like this game very much !Each murders are not extremely hard but I wouldn't say that they are easy. You'll have to think about everything and listen to different conversations to know the locations of different items that might be useful for this muder. You also have access to a notebook in which there will be clues as you progress in the murder. The clues are sometimes very specific and sometimes hard to understand but it makes the charm of Lucius. Take your time and think about it.Also, as the son of the devil, you'll have supernatural powers to help you kill people without being detected by the other members of the manor. These powers aren't use enough in my opinion and it would have been usefull to work more on that to have more ways to kill people.Finally, if you like horror games that doesn't always take you by the hand, you'll like that. Just know that there is only one way to kill each person so see this game as a puzzle in each chapter and you'll have a lot of fun ! "

												I got this game as a gift, and oh boy I'm so happy about it. The game's concept is simply amazing. You are pretty much the antichrist as a child and you kill people to please Lucifer and get stronger whilst not letting people find out about your real identity. The game is set up on a huge victorian-style mansion, with a lot of rooms to explore and designed in a way that it doesn't feel repetitive or confusing at all.The gameplay kind of mixes a sleath-ish style with an old-school game where you have to really search the rooms, collect objects and use them intelligently to complete each chapter. In fact, this game reminds me a lot of older games in the sense that it looks rather rough but presents an amazing gameplay experience.The soundtrack and voice acting were rather bad. The voice acting seems to be rather desynced with the model's mouth movements. It really seems as if the game was poorly dubbed from another language other than english. The soundtrack is rather repetitive and very uninspiring.The achievements are the best part of this game. They are rather easy to get but can be missed if the player doesn't pay attention. The only bad achievements are the ""I like this game"" and ""I am addicted"" ones, that the devs added to try to stretch the gameplay time. Fortunately there is a guide that teaches a method to work around them.Overall this is an amazing game that is very underrated. You should probably buy it.			"

												Lucius was a cheesy horror B movie style game. It follows somewhat in line with the story of the movie Omen. You’re a child who’s been possessed by the devil and given powers to murder people. It’s a pretty straight forward game with not much difficulty to it.It was a decent game to play which had some funny and cool death scenes. It does have a slight challenge of trying to figure out what you need and how to kill your target. It’s all based in and around the house you live in.Controls were a little wonky but do their job. I even setup my own configuration with the steam controller which worked out pretty good. Only issues I had with it were movement on the bike you can get for Lucius to ride around on. Graphics weren’t bad just looked like something from years back. They get the job done and that’s all that really matters when playing a game. The look on Lucius’s face was a little disturbing.Overall it wasn’t a bad game to play. It’s pretty straightforward and not very hard to complete. You can get most of the achievements from pretty much just playing the game. Give it a try sometime as it should be easy to find a cheap copy floating around as it’s been bundled before and I think even given away for free.			"

												Good concept for a game, although it is a bit short I completed the whole thing in just over 4 hours. However I have to continue to play or leave the game running for 40 hours for the final two acheivements. Whilst it is a decent game I can't see myself playing it for that length of time. I re did quite a few chapters when I was acheivement hunting so I think I'm done with it now. The house can be quite difficult to navigate and the game feels a little clunky and buggy at points (It crashed twice and my new PC hasn't crashed with any game). Would have been nicer if you had a little more freedom in the game, as it is you have to stick rigidly to the storyline. But I did enjoy the story and some of the kills were just pure twisted and evil. I got this in the Steam sale and am happy with it for the price I paid, but I don't see myself paying full price for it. 6/10			"

Posted: May 8, 2016
												In this adventure game you are Lucius, a son of the devil. Daddy likes souls so he asks Lucius to go kill people for him. He rewards Lucius with special powers that make him an even better killer. Lucius shouldn't get caught, of course, so he makes murders look like an accident or frames someone for them. This means that each murder is a mini puzzle for which Lucius uses items he collects throughout the mansion and his special powers to 'solve the puzzle' and kill the target without getting caught.Meanwhile, the story in the game is about the adults in the house: a bit of background for each target, how they react to the murders, the police detective investigating the deaths, etc.For me, the puzzles were neither too hard nor too easy, so I found the difficulty perfect. At the start of each chapter, you are pointed to your target either via your note book or via the in-game map. Sometimes you may feel a bit stuck because you don't know what is expected, but when you look at the clues (you can get a cryptic clue from Daddy in your room, but you should especially look at the items you collected and at your notebook) the solution always comes to you because it makes sense. Lucius' special powers like telekinesis and mind control are explained very well by Mr. Lucifer and they make the puzzle solving a lot more fun than your average 'point and click' adventure slash puzzle game. The options in the game menu are:- adjust resolution, adjust graphics details (low, medium, high or ultra high), toggle full screen, toggle Vsync and adjust gamma- adjust sounds and music volume  - toggle 'invert mouse' and adjust mouse speed- re-bind keyboard keys or controller buttonsYou should expect to get about 5 hours gameplay. About 7 hours if you don't rush and hunt most of the Steam Achievements. On that note, I should add that two achievements are absurd i.e. 'play the game for 20 hours' and 'play the game for 40 hours'. This means running the game as your active window, so running it in the background doesn't count. This is such an obvious and cheap way for the devs to try to get higher numbers of playtime for their game in Steam. Moreover, these two achievements appear to be bugged for me because the counter for both is still at zero.All in all, I had fun playing this game and would recommend it but only when it's on sale at -50% or better.

It also has some really gruesome death scenes. Characters act like people, they slowly grow more and more tense as their world gets worse.Recommended for fans of horror and adventure alike.			"

												An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.The good:- Generally speaking, it's a really fun game.- Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it.- The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad).- Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night).- Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards)- General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs)- Key mapping is great and easy to useThe bad:- A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck.- Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all.- Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..Definately recommended. "

												This game isn't an awful game by any means, but it does have some issues in my opinion. The whole ""kill everyone, hail satan"" aspect is pretty fun and the murder puzzles are logical but complicated. For each puzzle there is only one solution, you have no room for creativity. Also many of the puzzles require certain objects that aren't very obvious. If you can't remember where something is or you don't know what you need to find, you're screwed until you read or watch a walkthrough. So i wouldn't recommend this game to someone who rages or gets frustrated easily because it will probably be annoying for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy murdering the people who fed and raised you for 6 years of your life (virtualy of course) then you should definitely buy this game. Graphics are nice, fun concept and Satan is involved soooo buy it			"

												A fairly mediocre adventure game with an even worse story. Got bored really quickly of the mechanics of the game and the story never really interested me. It is a surprisingly violent game but I personally think it doesnt really add much to the experience.It also has two really poorly designed achievements that require you to play a total of 20 hours and 40 hours of the game. Why is this poor design? Considering the game can easily be beaten in 7-9 hours the high time requirement just doesnt make much sense. Sure, the 20 hour one could be conisdered a ""beat the game twice"" kind of achievement but as the game really lacks reasons to play it more then once not even that one feels justified. The 40 hour achievement just feel like they want people to keep the game running longer as free advertising.Time to 100%: 40 hours			"

												It's an okay game with some fairly hilarious murders along the way. The main issue with the game is that the kills you must perform along the way can be so abstract that you find yourself wandering around the mansion without any clue as to what you need to do. This isn't the case with every mission, but there are a lot of times that if it were not for various walkthroughs online you would not be able to solve the puzzle. Even when you wakeup each day, not every mission marks a target in your journal initially. Generally the mission title gives you a clue as to who it might be, but if you miss that - you'll have to look in every single room of the mansion until someone is marked as your target. Despite having said that, I'd recommend this game on the grounds that you don't mind using a walkthrough. The story is like a b-movie horror plot, and the voice acting is laughable - but for the short duration of the game (8-12 hours) and the fact it is inexpensive; it's quite entertaining. Some of the murders are quite gruesome and there is some nudity; so just be aware of that before you purchase the game.			"

												At first when I played this game I thought it was going to be some fun little satan goes on a rampage sandbox.Sadly, it's not.This game is really just a lot of searching for objects and occasionally doing some optional side quests. The cutscenes are alright but it's not as fun as I thought it would be. However, I will admit that Lucius has a great walk. Would I recommend it? Not at the full price. If you get a good sale on it, knock yourself out then, but don't expect too much out of it.			"

												While the premise for Lucius is full of promise and a refreshing take on horror, Lucius spends more time aggravating than rewarding you with some truly nagging nuisances, questionable execution, and general inconsistencies.You play Lucius, a formidable six year-old child.  Born on the 6th of June, 1966 (you can do the conversion), Lucius has the honor of being the anti-Christ and all the light-hearted responsibilities that come with it.  Visited by his dad on Birthday number six, Lucius is tasked with carrying out the whims of his father:  murdering all the inhabitants of Dante Manor.The game is comprised of nine separate chapters.  Each begins with a voice-over and a notebook entry on who your next target is, and concludes with a grisly homicide and a follow-up visit from Satan to grant Lucius new powers and to bolster old ones, such as telekinesis, combustion, and mind-control.  While many of the kills are creative, entertaining, and sometimes morbidly funny, what the game often requires of you to reach that moment of satisfaction often results in frustration.As an anti-hero six-year-old Satan spawn, you’re quite the amalgam of bad♥♥♥♥♥and unsuspected hitman – but without much motive or directive.  Each kill requires you to piece together sporadic clues to determine what items or tools are necessary to manipulate your target or lure them into places they might not otherwise go (such as face-first into a stove top element to light a cigarette).For those who enjoy all aspects of the discovery process, clicking around in different environments and ultimately finding what you’re looking for can be rewarding – although the emotion I frequently experienced was exasperation.  With little feedback that you’re on the right course, the game can quickly stop being fun. Because of each mission’s strict requirements, the intended payoffs act more as a relief to pent-up frustration for finally getting it right.  There was nothing more disappointing than going into the kitchen and being unable to pick up the butcher knife.  The mission requirements are often unclear, as almost the entire mansion is free to roam from murder one.  Further, there is no initial tutorial on the sequential nature of your murderous imperatives, so you’ll need to start clicking early, often, and indiscriminately.Where the frustration often comes in is when you’re desperately trying to find the next required item to trigger the next scripted sequence or dialogue, so you can in turn use that clue to get down to business.  The Manor is highly-detailed, huge and pretty much unrestricted in accessibility from the beginning.  This gives you room to explore, but sometimes finding the necessary tools necessitates a click-fest of drawers, cabinets, and items lying around, until you find what you need.  The game is plagued with some annoying glitches, clipping problems and hit detection, breaking the flow of the narrative (like characters getting stuck, objects flying around mysteriously and unpredictably after manipulating them, or the camera auto-moving to a 1st-person perspective when near a wall, which is quite jarring).Graphically, the game isn’t ugly, but a lot of the colors are washed out, the lighting is unrealistic and interferes with other sources (like the outside light interacting with ambient light), and the animations are jerky.  The cutscenes are entertaining but suffer from poor camera placement and direction.  Subtracting from the presentation are the unacceptably long load times.  This compounds frustration when occasionally you’ll fail a mission because someone may have seen you wielding a screwdriver that you had no business wielding, or overtly using your telekinesis, drawing attention from those around.  There are no waypoints, so if you fail, you’re back at the beginning, but first you’ll be staring at a load screen.The in-game music features some fun, weird, bugle-filled atmospheric tracks, sometimes employing the cellos, violin crescendos, and orchestral choirs that are common of the horror genre.  Sadly, the music is often on short loops, and can get annoying or simply feel out of place during parts of the chapters.  Speaking about out of place, the game’s voice acting is B-rate at best, suffering at times from a poorly-translated script and inadequate direction.  This was especially disappointing due to the game being heavily story-driven and reliant on verbal or conversational cues that felt detached.Despite the game’s ambitious premise, its many shortfalls overshadow the things it actually does well.  The murders are always a treat.  Coupled with Lucius’ deadpan death-stare and the ludicrously lavish and ridiculous ways in which targets reach their bloody ends, there is often a sick, dark humor that pervades the game. This is also apparent among the surviving residents and workers as they’re picked off one by one, slowly slipping into depression or insanity, and little Lucius just stands there, taking in all the madness, while still conducting his everyday business of putting away his toys and brushing his teeth (these are sadly further nuisances – chores – that break up the narrative but add to the hilarity).The entire game takes place at Dante Manor, an enormous, sprawling estate with dozens of rooms to explore, drawers to rifle through, and objects to steal for your nefarious ends.  While the ultimate demise of each target is often original and unpredictable, reaching that moment typically mimics a “Take object A to manipulate object B to get target C to do task D”.  As such, there is little freedom in getting to the end result.  This is not a sandbox game and does not follow the open-ended format of, for example, the Hitman and Manhunt series – but that difference isn’t necessarily a flaw, as it serves a purpose by bolstering the narrative.Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives. If you enjoyed The Omen series (which this game generously borrows from), then you might find something to like in Lucius. Its unsatisfying ending, that despite leaving many questions unanswered, at least leaves the option open for a sequel that is perhaps more refined, tighter, and better-executed.6/10			"

Game is somewhat limited, you kill everyone the way game wants you to. You can roam in the map pretty free, and it has some stealth elements to it. Little bit clunky, but after a while you get used to it. If you can get through the rough edges of this game, it can be really fun. Or at least entertaining, as I don't think killing everyone one in your family should be considered fun.Pick it up on a sale, or in a bundle			"

												This is a brutally dark and amazing game. If you really believe you are Lucius, the 6yr old spawn of satan, than you really understand how twisted and psychologically messed up this game truly is and you can really admire its beauty.Pros:~You are the 6yr old spawn of satan called Lucius. The story is quite intriguing because of this.~It is challenging because there are unique (though linear) ways to complete objectives.~The magical abilities are a nice added touch because the player does not feel like a normal 6yr child.~Great narrative during cutscenes. Its very interesting to hear a different perspective on the events taking place.~Relatively short game. 15-20hrs one walkthrough. But if you REALLY like the story/game you want MOAR!~Realistc. In the sense that, the people in the home, act like theyre just living in a home and do random house things.Cons: ~ number one con. The game is too short. Simple 15-20hrs to complete (maybe shorter) but youre left wanting more.~Sometimes the objectives are confusing. You have to complete objectives in a specific way which might not be obvious.~You end up running into walls ..... A lot..... (ps. Hold shift to run. I didnt know this and spent at least half of the game walking at slow human child speed)~The character models aren't top notch. They dont look realistic. This doesnt bother me but it might bother others.~Controls are bothersome when first learning how to use abilities. ~Telekinises needs work, levaiting and placing objects is just messy but can be overlooked because its not used often.~ Cutscenes. A lot of cutscenes. You dont like cutscenes? you might not like this. You like cutscenes? ignore this con.PS:Don't Agree with me if you have played the game? THATS FINE!! EVERY GAMER experiences one game differently regardless if your a twin, a quadruplet, a lover of all games etc etc.Agree to Disagree. I listed what might be noticeable cons to the game but THAT DOES NOT MEAN that the game is horrifically bad, EVERY game has AT LEAST one good aspect to it, even if its not obvious.			"

												I can really only recommend this game if you get real cheap (right now it's 90% off and thus $2 making it worth it), but since the normal price is $20 I can't recommend this game. The reason I was interested in this game is because of the obvious: you're the son of the devil and you kill people. However the story doesn't really go beyond this (just the brief musings of the detective at the end of a chapter). You barely, if at all, get to know any of the people before you kill them. When there's no personality or character development with the characters then there's nothing felt when you kill them. I could forgive this if the ways that you setup the deaths of people weren't the very definition of linear. This too could be forgiven except the steps you take to setup the deaths are also very unintuitive. They aren't even puzzles; it's just a process of figuring out what weird way the developers want you to setup the next person's death. There's almost no thought or intelligence involved on your part.Another thing I was interested in, like most people I'm sure, are the deaths themselves. Considering this game was supposed to have earned an AO for Adults Only rating from the ESRB (refused to avoid complications with release) I was a little disappointed. A couple of them are gruesome sure, but they've got nothing on some of the fatalities in the Mortal Kombat games (which are rated M for Mature). There is a kill that Lucius himself gets to personally make, but I was highly disappointed when we don't actually get to see Lucius do it. One minute he's standing there, and we know what he's about to do, but the next he's done it and we saw nothing. Boo!You are slowly given 5 different powers to make these deaths happen. They can also level up in power when you make a new kill. Only problem is the concept of leveling them up is absolutely pointless because there's only 1 way to setup the death of a person and you are always at the right power level to do it. You don't get to use certain powers when you think you could either, because again there's only 1 way to make the deaths happen.Pros:+Voice acting was decent or better, especially Lucifer's.+The basic concept.Neutral:+-A couple of the deaths are cool. Most are forgettable.+-It's pretty easy to get lost; a minimap would've been nice. At least there is a map and a marker telling you where your kill target is located.Cons:-The story lacks any depth beyond the obvious, and the characters themselves are given no time to develop or have much of a personality so that when they do die we the players don't care one way or the other.-Figuring out what to do next is part luck and part tedious searching of rooms and objects to find the right thing to interact with.-Completely linear death setups that don't allow creativity of your mind powers or anything else.-Mind powers have no depth despite being able to level up.-The graphics are pretty poor. Could be forgiven but the animations are also lacking which doesn't help the already lifeless characters.Despite all this I am interested in the sequel and the promise that it corrects some of the issues here like linear deaths.

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash""PROS:-Playing as a villian is great fun, especially the spawn of satan.-Killing people in various ways has never been as enjoyable as it is in Lucius, almost hitman like.-This game is funny, mainy due to its faults but Lucius does not take itself seriously at all.-You have to use your innotive, the game does not tell you where to go, instead you must listen carefully and pay attention to your notes. Getting used to the map is also crucial as the house is big!- Although the story is corny and a little far fetched it worked and it was just like a tacky horror movie.- Fun achievements, the type that make you want to go back and play certain missions again.CONS:- Its unpolished for sure, I dont really mind it as it played into the games enjoyable charm but animations are poor and controls are clunky.- Grapically the game is not brilliantVERDICT? An entirely daft premise and not exactly good delivery but the game is somehow one the most enjoyable ive played, which is worrying cause you play as a serial killer.			"

												An interesting concept, though poorly done. Doesn't worth to be picked up, unless on a very big sale.Lucius has a very good story, decent graphics and amazing voice acting, though the bugs, glitches and the limited gameplay ruins the chances for an entertaining experience.Being the son of Lucifer, he does have quite a few paranormal abilities, still, making his tricycle drive for a few seconds after he gets off it and eventualy crush half of it into the floor - is definetly not one of them. Same with Lucius walking through  closed doors and getting into places where he is not supposed to be. Noticed this once in the middle of the game, and once again at the very end, when you're supposed to kill your father in the burning house, somehow i walked through the front door (which was locked) and could't manage to get back inside after trying for a half hour, ultimately being forced to restart the game. Yet, this is all pice of cake. The most annoying glitch in this game are the hints. It's not enough that they are kind of unclear, but sometimes they appear after you already completed the task, leaving you in the most complicated missions without no clue what to do. As for example there is a mission where you must kill one of your maids and the only hint is ""she is doing laundry"". After i spent about 2 hours trying everything that came into my mind, i finally gave up and decided to watch a walkthrough where i found out that i'm supposed to use telekinesis to pick up an iron from a top shelf and drop it into the washing machine, then start it. By doing this you'll brake the washing machine and leave the maid without an occupation, then she'll decide to take a bath giving you the opportunity to kill her. How the hell was i supposed to know this ? And guess what ? After i broke the washing machine i got the hint that i should do so...What i hated the most was the limited gameplay. The history was already written for you. You can run around in a huge house, interact with the people you find, but you can't choose which one to kill, or at least how to kill him. Each crime is to be commited in order, and by the specific methods, even the special powers that you have can be used just on specific missions, specific people or objects...I would recommend to skip this one, unless you get the occasion to pick it up on a very big sale (at least 80%) just for the heck of it.

												I will admit it can become repetitive at some points but if you want a game that's good to waste time and play when you're bored this is the game for you. It's fairly cheap and at a good price for what it is. It has about four to five hours of gameplay if you know what you're doing and how to do it, A.K.A if you watched a YouTube series beforehand. If you don't know exactly what you're doing it's a fairly good puzzle game and you could mess around figuring it out for hours. I do recommend this game, but before you do get it be aware that it is only ten dollars it will not be perfect. DO NOT I repeat DO NOT expect it to be amazing gameplay. The voice acting is bad along with the characters but it is good for a ten dollar game and what it's based around, as I said it is a ten dollar game do not expect it to be perfect and it's a good game for what it is.

The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 8 hours of fun.			"

												Completely brilliant, if somewhat linear. Once you get the hang of figuring out creative ways to kill people, and how to navigate the map, it becomes less tedious.Who needs clean underwear if you've already got your toys?			"

												Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds.The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing.Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.

												Lucius is a gem of its own kind.The story, very original, compliments and works perfectly with the very original and unique gameplay. Even though the basic concept remains the same throughout the game, it never fails to feel new and more innovative each time, by asking you to really sit and think about how to proceed in your tasks. It's also very challenging ! You may get stuck on a few of the murders as they will really push you to be creative in your process of thoughts. It just was fun. Very fun.Now of course it's not perfect : there are a few minor bugs scattered around, and the gory/satanic side of the game may give people some trouble, but then again that's what to expect with such a game.

												Even though I got this at a 90% discount ($1.99), I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and wouldn't recommend it even at that price.There's so much potential here, but the whole experience was messed up by frequent bugs and poor design choices. I'm normally very forgiving of bugs in games, but so many of these seemed like easy fixes that I felt like the product was rushed or lazily made.The theme and enviornments are fun, as are the sidequests, but there are odd floating objects, crashes to desktop, and puzzle/action sequences that are extremely unguided and frustrating. Some puzzles are so counter-intuitive that you will either need to look up a guide or try to brute-force through a puzzle by ""pixelhunting"" for the item you need to interact with. Probably half my playtime was spent being stuck, and when I finally found the answer it wasn't one of those ""DUH"" moments, but rather ""that wasn't clear at all!"". The end sequence is so frustrating that I had absolutely no satisfaction from beating it, and was glad it was over.A little more bugfixing and polish would have gone a LONG way here.Can I get my $2 back?Also, the acheivements are terrible! 40 hours playing this? Yeah right!			"

												An interesting game by a studio that dared to try something different. The final result is a rather linear, buggy experience that mostly has you running around a huge mansion hunting for clues or interactable objects that have to do with your current target. You'll mostly end up finding items you will need in later chapters, but you get to keep the items for later anyway. This makes the later killings much easier than the earlier ones, since you almost always already have a clue as to how you can use items A or B that your found 2 hours earlier for this.Not all solutions are particularly straightforward. Sometimes the clue you need is dropped in a single line at the start of a cutscene and is then never repeated again. (""Fetch us some [X] and turn on the [Z]!"") Other times characters will not shut up and will give you one hint after the other. (""There's a CRUCIFIX in our BATHROOM!"" *wink wink*)The game is strongest about halfway through, when you've gotten used to the controls and the layout of the manor, and you're starting to experiment with your new powers. The later kills and especially the finale involve some sort of time pressure element, which was very unwelcome. The finale itself is a buggy mess. The game crashed twice and bugged out three other times during the final 5 minutes of gameplay, all at seperate unrelated moments. It's nice that you got to choose from two different finales, though (action or puzzle), but in the end neither was much of an enjoyment.Get this game on sale only if you think you'd enjoy playing the antichrist riding around a giant manor on your tricycle, mostly hunting for clues and objects. Otherwise, don't bother.			"

												If you enjoyed the movie The Omen you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear story game with objectives and side objectives to complete. The Side objectives are completely optional unless you wanna nab all those achievos. The collision with objects  can be a little wonky (your telekenesis tends to make items flail at lightspeed which is bad when you need to move items to a specific area) and the collection of items required for missions is cryptic. My biggest complaint would be for one mission where you have to place an object in a VERY specific spot to trigger the event. I won't say which one specifically but I was running around the yard for like 15 minutes trying to find this damn spot. Other than that (and getting stuck in a coffee table)  it's a pretty fun game!			"

												Let's be as clear as we can about a few things up front: Lucius is not the best designed game. Its puzzles are often meant to be solved by sending you on a linear path from clue to clue, but that path can be broken by the fact that it's a fairly open world. An NPC might send you to a specific room and the game might expect that you pick up a certain item from it and infer from context that it's to be used in this chapter. But if you picked that item up 5 chapters ago, you might be struggling to make that connection, and instead scour the room for ways to use any of its other set pieces. Some mechanics are clumsy, there's a bit of pixel hunting, and the logic stringing puzzles together can be weird and opaque. You should play the game with another person or a guide to help hammer through it.All that said, Lucius is pretty fun. For all its kludginess and opacity, it still lets you murder everyone in the house in exchange for rad powers from Satan, and there's a simple joy in running throughout the mansion inverting all the crosses so you can live like a tr00 kvlt six-year-old of the bitter frozen necrofrost. If only you could wear corpse-paint like the band Immortal to let the normals know where you stand.			"

												Lucius is an action,adventure game developed by an indie game studio in which you play as Lucius,son of the devild, who tries to kill every single human being in his house including maids,handy men and even his own parents just to satisfy his real father's(=devil) needs which is: souls.Playing as the bad guy that tries to find ways in order to kill the good ones you are not going to get scared at all, so just drop the ""Horror"" tag.Overall, it is  a good game with really nice concept, achievements and many challenging puzzles aka deaths that you have to look the environment and the items you pick up carefully in order to combine them so you can commit a crime without getting noticed.CONS:- a lot of bugs and glitches that will make you ragequit sometimes (take a look at my screenshot:

												The criticisms are unfounded.I didn't buy this for a while because many reviews spoke of mainly 2 reasons that made the game frustrating: 1) A lack of autosave means you have to do the WHOLE level again if you get caught. 2) It isn't clear what you have to do, and you spend forever wandering around trying to find or use the right item.What they don't mention is 1) a level lasts 2 minutes when you figure what to do and, bar 1-and-a-third levels, you can move freely around your mansion. 2) You're given many clues, but there's always Google for when you derp. I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but this never happened.Another common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point. (Lucius 2 would go on to prove this point according to all those reviews.)It falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, and it's not bad anyway. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people would like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better).Be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways. It's a right laugh.			"

												EDIT REVIEW: Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want? Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!! ORIGINAL REVIEW:As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.			"

												Without a doubt the worst game I have ever played. Controls are wonky, character facial animations are stiff, and the voice acting is uninspired. I also experienced a few game breaking glitches that caused my character to fall off the map and even other characters I had to kill to progress the story, which forced me to restart the level from the beginning.The gameplay is about killing people in ways that look like freak accidents (some you just kill directly) but setting up these kills is tedious as you have to gather items from around a mansion with hints that are extremely vague to decipher. The only reason I could recommend this game is if you are a fan of the Omen movie from the 70s or the Hitman series, as it is basically a Hitman game repackaged to suit Damien (or in this case Lucius).

It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Players take control of Lucius as he murders members of his household, using powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that lead to the deaths of multiple residents of Dante Manor. Players use their wits and follow hints to ensure they do not leave any evidence that would lead to a mission failing.			"

												Lucius is one of those games that has a very interesting idea, but executes it horribly. This game sounded like it was going to be waaay more fun then it turned out to be. I can't say much about Lucius, because as you can see I only have about an hour of playtime on record. I didn't choose to only play an hour, the game is just so buggy that I couldn't manage to get any farther. Half of the time I can't play because it glitches so much. On top of all that, the whole game is very linear. The entire gameplay consist of finding the item you are supposed to find and then using it on the objective. (ex: find screwdriver click stove, wait. Find lock, click freezer, wait.) There are no paths to branch onto, and no choices the come with the game. You have to do what the game wants you to do, and you have no free will to decide yourself. The most side missions you can do is to do your chores for money.That usually involves picking up blocks and putting them in a chest.Even the powers in Lucius cannot be used freely. Towards the beginning of the game you are granted different powers. Sounds cool right? Not really... You are told when to use that power and you can't use it any other time then when you are prompted to. With how buggy the game is too, the powers can be a hassle to use. Another problem with Lucius is the voice acting. It's... pretty bad. Also Lucius himself lacks character. He doesn't show emotion, change his facial expression, say anything, or do anything to show that he is a character. Sure, he is possessed, but that's no excuse. I'd rather him do a cheesy evil grin then be a walking cardboard that is there to do one objective to the next. I may have only stated negative things about Lucius this whole review, but I will say that it could be worth it if hugely discounted or in a cheap bundle. The story can be somewhat interesting and the deaths are great to watch for the sadistic side that we all have. It's not a horrible game, but it's definitely not worth the $10 price tag. Especially with how buggy it can be. I say pick Lucius up on sale ONLY if you like very linear storytelling. Oh, and also pull up a walkthrough because the game is almost impossible to figure out without one.			"

												Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have ""Stealth missions"" that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.Pros:+ Great Idea of the game+ Barely funny+ Free movement+ Open world (Mansion in this case)+ Nice skillsCons:- A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible)- Bad face factions- Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime)- Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun)- 6 Hour duration average- 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours- You cannot do anything but the quests- When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again- WTF finalMy score is 6/10			"

												It's entertaining, short, adventure, puzzle quest game with many gruesome deaths, little bit of nudity and few plot twists. Game is straight forward - there is only one way to kill each person and you must find all items to do it. Even with all quest items, it may take some time to understand what and where is required to do, but luckily there are guides for that. Don't expect open world here - mansion and garden is all you can explore.Graphics even on Ultra High left me unsatisfied. You may encounter some bugs, restarting chapter will fix that.There are 2 endings. First is easy, 2nd takes some time to do it right, but will reward you with more satisfying ending, a la horror movies. Don't expect too much, this is no AAA title, but good for indie developers.Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.P.S. Don't let your kids play this.			"

												Lucius lets you play as the titular 7 years old Antichrist, you'll be killing a whole mansion just to appease Satan: while as fun as it sounds sadly the experience is marred by quite a few problems.PROS:-great soundtrack sets the tone for the game-gory kills-you'll develop some fairly interesting powers-an expansive mansion for you to explore-being a 7yo murdering spawn of Satan is surely funNEUTRAL:-the game is VERY bleak, you're murdering/framing innocents and there's no sense of humour whatsoever to balance things: so I guess such a dreary game isn't for everyoneCONS:-sadly there's only one way to kill your inteded victims, this makes the game experience quite restrictive-some of the objects needed are small and/or stuck in hard to find places, keep a guide handy if you get frustrated-stealth sections can get annoying-clunky inventory-no controller support-repetitive npc speech-last boss battle feels pretty silly

By: stranger1982




While Lucius might look like an Hitman clone the restrictions put on who/how to kill and the object hunts required to find the items you need makes it game more of a puzzle game than anything else: it's quite hard to shake the feeling that the whole gaming experience is fairly limited and that it'd have been so much more.Still, if you can deal with the limits the game puts on you and do not get too frustrated by the pixel hunts it can provide a few pleasant hours as you try to figure out what to do and enjoy the bloody results of your labor: just get it on sale when it drops under the 2$ mark.

												Lucius is a nice idea. You'll be a demonic kid which mission is to kill innocent people. You can free roam around the house and do whatever you want, while you have an objective to complete.I suggest it 4/5			"

												:::: Bringing the Devil Out :::::What to expect from this game?It is a game wrapped around the life of a boy who is not ordinary. In fact he is driven from the human number of the Beast, ""666"", and it is your goal to carry on some devilish fun. The game has very detailed graphical visuals that surround the setting of a Mansion where the boy does his evil deeds. If you are into some puzzle solving killing fun, this may be the game to enjoy those fantasies and desires. What are the positive things about this game?While playing this game, you will immerse yourself into a house full of family, staff and house guests who will live throughout their last days while you prey upon them. There are plenty of rooms to expllore and things to move or take for your goal needs. Once you play for an hour or so, you will feel like part of the family. There will be different missions/goals to achieve during the day or night, while others are awake or asleep. Rain, snow or sunshine will not keep you from killing. Just, do not get caught. What is the negative things about this game?This game is linear oriented to the variety of ways to kill your target. There is only one solution for each goal, which can be very fustrating. (For example: You can easily squash a bug, spray it with poison, or catch and release it. In this game, you can only spray the bug with poison.) This game would be better if their were alternative ways of reaching your goals. Also while playing this game I have encounter some game glitches, bugs and crashes. The game have crashed while loading the next part of the game. I also encounter a glitch while traveling down or upstairs, the NPC characters would either push your character off the stairs or get you stuck between them.Would you recommend this game?Yes, solely becuase of the orginality of this game's design. Although this is a very linear game, I find it ammusing to try to leave clues about you being the killer throughout the game. (Such as leaving toys or other objects to appear in the cutscenes when not needed. I had many laughs with it)  **There is no playback value to this game, except to have fun and cause mischieve. BE A VERY BAD BOY !!!!!			"

												I recommend this game if it is on sale like when I got it.A short puzzle game that is not really for everyone but some players will like it.You play the son of the devil (or demon) and you end up going around your home using your environment to kill people.When you start your murder rampage, police detectives will get involved making the game more interesting by making you be more careful of witnesses and evidence.There are a few weapons to make and use.Just think of it like this, your an evil little sith with powers like mind control and telekenises which allows you to sacrifice your family to satan :)It is played on a large map with hidden areas and quite a few puzzles to figure out.The game looks okay but can be a little dark and while not glitchy sometimes I felt trying to click on certain items took to much effort and the inventory felt a little annoying.I never encounted a glitch or crashed.The achievements were fun to get at first but this is one of thoes games where a time requirement is needed for some achievements like the 20 hours and then the 40 hours achievements when to be honest you can complete the game in around 5-7 hours, I ended up playing the game a couple of times but then just idleing the time away on it.Again I would say get this game if it is on sale not at full price even if you end up not liking the game I think it makes a nice Tricycle simulator.

												This title quickly rocketed up to one of my favorite games of the last decade; it’s not flawless, it’s not a blockbuster or a triple A spectacle, but Lucius is exceptionally different, well executed and darkly captivating.I feel that it’s fair to assume that revealing your character to be an evil, twisted little demon child does not merit a spoiler warning. Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player.The core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that you’re the “bad guy” and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters you’ll quickly get a hang of how it’s all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear.Lucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.			"

												Free the demon inside you and fulfill your destiny as the Devil's champion in this bloodchilling thriller game. Taking a part in a series of murders, player controls Lucius - a child... that kills.The game's concept itself could be considered as something we have not yet seen (at least, at this large scale) in games generally. You play as a little boy who is not what he seems to be. Gameplay basically is similar to Hitman franchise, but it's not the same thing as you do all these bloody deeds with the child's hands (and his devil mind).I give this game a high mark as it was a great experience and I have completed the game in a single day (evening and night, to be precise) because I couldn't have stopped once I've started....Oh, one more important thing. it's not a game for kids!!! Even while main character is a kid, the game is violent and intense in some manner, so keep your kids off the screen! I'm serious!			"

												Always wanted to be the little♥♥♥♥♥♥that you know you were, but didn't want the♥♥♥♥♥whooping if your parents found out? Well this game is for you; going around offing people you don't like or just anyone in general. As the spawn of Lucifer you go around murdering people to send their souls to him. That's basically it; however the game doesn't hold your hand, even if your stuck on a certain part and have no idea what to do, the game will not give a hint even after 10 minutes. This is where my frustrations lie; I don't want to be going around looking at every little thing that I might be able to use. Even though I game a lot I still consider myself to be a casual gamer, as I don't want to tediously do things such as look around for things to contaminate for example: I knew I had to poison someone and went into the kitchen and couldn't find anything resembling a platter to contaminate. I went onto Youtube and found that it was a basket I had to infect. Keep in mind that this is a rich family and the maid who took the food to the person always had a platter for her! If you have patience and can get into these kind of games I would recommend it.			"

												The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic ""Omen,"" and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents.  The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!			"

												I love the concept and story. But sadly the painfully linear game play and cut-scenes (seemingly every time I take a few steps) make it utterly impossible to immerse myself. There is literally only one way to kill each target, and the game makes it perfectly unclear on what you're supposed to do. This ultimately leads you to Google the solution, at which point any amount of enjoyment flies out the window.Here is my playthrough of the first hour of the game via my Youtube Channel:

												A personal guilty pleasure. Fans of tacky horror movies will find enjoyment in Lucius.The mansion where the game takes place is  very interesting and is a excellent environment to explore. The graphics fail to impress and the controls feel very clumsy. Chapters also feel very short and fails to give players the chance to be creative as the way you kill people has already been pre-determined by the game.  Overall the game is enjoyable but could have used a bit more polishing.			"

												I went into this hearing all positive reviews on gamesites, raving videos about it & thought it would be good. It started off & was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles & murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.After the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc. Graphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed & uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.Although I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox & single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it. Cons: -Limited interactivity with game world-Poor controls-Poor story-Bland gameplay-Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices & options in a game like this)-Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate-Bad ending-No replay value at all, unless you want achievements-Nudity used  50% through to try & entice the player-Everything else in the game-The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it & be numbed for 5 hoursPros-Graphics ok for indie game-Powers were cool, not enough to do with them-Good conceptSo the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.			"

 Become the son of the devil and be his deadly weapon in this interesting graphic adventure that reminds us of classic horror movies such as The Prophecy or Rosemary's Baby. Innocent, formal, introvert... but also cruel, machiavellian and very powerful. Lucius has proposed himself to satisfy his father's needs by offering him a true blood bath.LONG VERSIONLucifer has a lot of ways to make presence, and one of them, the deadliest one, is to incarnate all of his evilness in the body of an innocent child. Who would suspect that this innocent 6-year-old is guilty of a series of violent murderers? Nobody. We'll know about that since we're going to control this evil child ourselves, this evil child called Lucius.This graphic adventure proposes something as interesting as being the son of Satan and having as an only objective to eliminate the people that's in your house. Stealth, exploration and some minor puzzle are the basics of this interesting yet kind of irregular adventure.Not everyday you get to be Satan's child and neither you get to become in a lethal killing machine under the perspective of a graphic adventure, that's why Lucius turns out to be a really attractive game. However, Lucius is a excessively linear adventure that doesn't allow you to go out of the current task made by the developers.At the beggining of every chapter, in which we'll have to get rid of some tenant in particular, the game gives you freedom to explore your parent's mansion (not your actual parents of course) and find out the best way to kill the innocent -sometimes not that innocent- person that the devil wants. What happens? It doesn't matter how much we run around the mansion, there's only one way to kill every person so at the end you'll just end up doing what the devs want you to do at their own way.I don't criticize this decision for being limited, because being honest you have to follow a really strict script to murder the way Lucius does. However, I think that this is wrongly executed because we're talking about a graphic adventure way too simple, we can't talk to anyone and there aren't challenging puzzles, the only thing you're going to need is to figure which materials you need to kill a person... without knowing how you're gonna kill him/her.Sometimes Lucius will play his cards in the best way possible, barely guiding you to the victim through NPC's conversations or with subtle clues added to his notebook where he also writes his thoughts. But in other times we'll also walk from room to room trying to realize what we have to do to kill our objective. And as you can imagine, that almost spoils the game experience.There are great ideas behind this, the need to always act normally so nobody will get suspicious of you, or the ability to use demonic powers -mind control, telekinesis, etc.- and these will not work if you have crucifixes or priests nearby, without a doubt this game has potential. But like how I told you the action is really limited and not even this powers help to break that monotony.About the story, this part is also not as good as it could have been, it shows some details that I really liked, for example, the execution of most deaths it's incredibly brutal and gory and other details not as good such as the simplicity of it's narrative or how hollow the characters are.Lucius recreates with great precision the home of a powerful american senator in the 70's including themes such as corruption, sexual scandals, satanic cults, etc. I also liked how the murder of the tenants make everyone else feels, getting more scared and paranoid every month, almost at the point of madness. The design of the house is really well made and after some hours you'll feel like in your own house, even if you don't you'll have a useful map with the location of every room.Unfortunately, the graphics in this game are also not that good. The design and the 70's style of the house are the most important thing to stand out. But if we talk about character models, the result is quite discreet. You can say the same about the robotic animations or the almost null expression on their faces.Now talking about sound the game makes an amazing work, The OST is really good and it reminds us of classic horror movies as the ones mentioned in the beginning, also helped by some choir melodies.SHORT VERSIONA great idea not so well executed. That's how you can see Lucius, a graphic adventure that's not at the level of some others. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the game concept but far away from being devilishly fun to kill innocent people it turns out to be a really not inspired and very limited task, It's not a bad game and of course not a bad graphic adventure but it could've been a lot more.PROS-The great atmosphere -The possibility to play as the bad guy for instance-It's like playing a classic horror movieCONS-Way too limited-The characters don't show any expression on their facesGAMEPLAY: 7GRAPHICS: 6SOUND: 8INNOVATION: 7FINAL SCORE: 7			"

												As you control a six-year-old boy named Lucius, the son of the devil, the antichrist, with supernatural powers, your mission is to murder everyone you can to offer their mortal soul to Lucifer and make him proud then become a master, as the devil shows your true powers as you're gathering them and teach you new ways to accomplish your objectives, your murders are built step by step, making it look like a accident or a simple suicide, no one is going to realize that they're about to die as you prey on them, you keep creating caos,fear,insanity. The game has a satisfing gameplay, an amazing plot reminds of ""The Omen"" an old classic horror movie, this game is remarkable and it worths every cent, a quote from Fabius - ""We're all just pawns in the larger scheme of things.""

												Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow			"

												This is a suprisingly nice game. Wasn't expecting nearly as much from it. Basically you're a devilish child doing devilish things, cursing your manor and driving the family insane.Pros:Different sort of game you don't see around much.Fun and diverse missions. Quite relaxing and engaging. It's not a hard game at all.A lot of attention to detail on the manor's furnishing. You can tell who lives where and learn a lot about everyone from their rooms.Extra chores are worth doing and make sense.Interesting character dialogueYou can walk around the manor with your mum's panties in hand, no questions asked.Magic dad gives cool gifts.Cons:No replay value, coupled with this being a short game. I wish we had something extra to do other than the ridiculous achievements.Preformance issues. Now I know the house is cramped with objects which makes it heavier but that's no excuse for large frame drops and crashes whenever I break a cup. The ending turns into a slideshow unless I had the graphics on low. Srsly this game isn't all that cutting edge and my laptop isn't bad. What the hell is with these issues?  Magic dad doesn't care for friend or foe; even the nicest people have to go :( Best satanic murder simulator. Really worth getting.			"

												Lucius is one of those games where so much could have been done, but nothing was. It is very linear, you cannot decide who you want to kill and when, but the game tells you who, and exactly how to do it. It introduces new skills when they are to be used. The characters have no character, except for the father and the detective. Either the mansion is too big, or there is too little in it. I did enjoy the story-telling element of the detectives puzzlement.I got Lucius on sale for 90% off, and that is a more fair price at which I would recommend it.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a third person action ""demonic"" game.Interface/Menu/SettingsGame has many different resolution sizes.You can have multiple different profile slots.You can play with the xbox controller.You play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a brightness volume level.You are able to toggle the music/sound.There is a sound/music volume slidebar available.There are some different languages available.There is mouse sensitivity available.You are able to change your controls on the keyboard.There is chapter selection.About the game.You play as a kid and you will follow orders from the devil to kill people in the mansion. You will have to kill them 1 by 1 in an ""innocent"" way. You have the ability to use some magic spells against the victims. All victims will die in an unique way and you are the one that is causing these accidents. You could do some chores to unlock some new things but this is completely situational. The game is pretty easy to understand but some chapters does require some brain cells or timing.There are puzzles.Animations can sometimes be funky.Okay Music.Okay Graphics.You can skip the cutscenes.You have an inventory.Other things.Has some nudity parts.The game is based of from the movie ""Omen""Let's Try Video:

												This is the plot of the first Omen movie, but thenalso taking place at a same location as in the secondmovie, a mansion that is. Even the birthday party isincluded right at the beginning. So this is simply''Omen - The game'' (for those who are familiar with it).Good stuff:*Assuming it has been well tested or been worked onby great programmers, seeing how I've never experienceda single bug in it myself. *The atmosphere is probably what holds it up.Like a weak and sole supporting beam. It makes thegame enjoyable enough to go on and see what thenext death is gonna be like.Built up with the characters in the mansion gettingmore and more tensed after every accident.But other than that...Bad stuff experienced (as feedback):*Graphics are too dark in some areas to make out details.*Music does not hold enough variety.*The controls, or specifically in this case, thecamera perspective, is working against you when youwish to highlight and interact with objects.*The Gameplay offers very little to do other thanjust progressing the story. Apart from being ableto acquire three more or less helpful items, afterdoing minor tasks, there are no side quests at allor alternative paths in the game. This makes it muchtoo linear and thereby cuts it down rather short.*There is no challenge. The toughest part in thegame, is to control the telekinesis with your mousemovement, in order to swing objects at people.That's about it.Conclusion:I don't recommend purchasing this for more than10 Euro/12 Dollar			"

												Haven't even finished it yet, and I'm in love. Pretty f***** up game and the story is decent. You play a six year old who murders everyone in his house because the Devil wants their souls. How much better can it get? Ran into two bugs. A few lighting issues where it looks like the light from a flashlight is coming out of an NPC's face (happened on two separate occasions), and a bug with Will in the garage. (Spoiler Alert?) DO NOT MAKE HIM INTERACT WITH THE RAG. He will start walking in place, and then you need to start the chapter over. It's unique and genuinely entertaining, and the gameplay and environment make you WANT to explore. Meaning you don't get really annoyed when you need to figure out what to do next. I'd give it an honest 10/10.			"

												I was drawn in by the idea to experience a bit of ""The Omen"" perhaps, but the execution is poor. Very clucky controls what frustrate at times making it had to naviagate the world or select objects to interact with.  The worst is during what was a firey confrontation, I fell through the world as I attempted to turn a cross upside down, only to do it again when I respawned. The third time I passed through a locked door and could not reenter to finish the fight.Overall, it is very sloppy. The story line was what I expected but after the 11th ""chapter"" the initial novelity had worn out.			"

												This is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you like context dependent ""find the magic pixel"" games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is. You play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds. The characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named ""McGuffin"" (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this:""I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves.""""Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home.""""I know. It's so WEIRD though.""Now repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters.This game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play. Don't buy it, don't play it.			"

												You are Lucius, you are the anti christ, you are death.Play as a small quiet child named Lucius, born to a rich senator and a loving mother. You live in a large mansion, with maids and butlers that make your life easier.. in different ways than intended.Normally maids and people of service are there to clean or fix, or even get you things when you are too lazy to grab them yourself. Not for Lucius, these servants are souls waiting to be reaped for the hellfire home you call hell.But of course you are just a child with weak powers, you can not just reveal yourself, that would mean certain death and prolong the rebirth. No, you will do this silently and as if accidents have befallen your estate. What better way to absorb the poor souls of innocent men and woman then by ""accidently"" killing them?The gameplay isnt very linear sometimes, so that can be frustrating for some people, me included. I found myself looking at guides to find certain items or to find out where I need to go next. The mansion you are living in is also massive and complicated at first, really confusing you more than needed. The deaths are fun, giving a sense of accomplishment when you kill someone. You can break stuff, mind control people, erase their minds, use your mind to move objects and burn people alive. About 5 hours of gameplay if you play it to finish, not including achievements or general exploration. I'd say give it a shot, and if it gets too complicated or annoying just pull up a guide from the steam overlay or on your phone for ease of access.Personal Rating: 3.5/5			"

												Lucius is a funny little game with a great concept. Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn't perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it! It will be an interesting experience no matter what !!!			"

All the time to achieve the game is a rascal......A lot of points to think of the game to add......

Guilt is really strong, because each person's death and are extremely cruel killerThe servant family for me being faced with these difficult under the handIn the last chapter of the climax of the story, the father has found the source of my nightmareMy mother chose to trust me and decided to wait for her father to negotiate in the gardenWhen the mother again in a chair singing ""we are all dead dead,"" and again when looking back at the mansion I cannot do this chapterSafe password is my birthday gift props are met every house in the mother's nagging praised me is good child smile game a lot of detailsAt the end of the story is I borrowed his father's hand to kill her.

												If you ever dreamed of being the son of evil, this is your chance. Lucius is a game with strong links to ""The Omen"". The player takes the role of Lucius, the son of the devil, who has to clear the mansion of it’s residents. To do this he must orcastrate “accidents” without anyone suspecting him of any foul play. Sounds great but sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.

Check Out my Full Review for Lucius Here![uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]This game is just riddled with problems. It styles itself as a sort of logic puzzle game but the problem is, you don't have half the pieces to the puzzles. You have to find the pieces by trial and error to eventually solve the puzzles and murder your entire household.Look at my avatar, it's holding an axe. When I successfully use puzzles to murder someone I should be clapping gleefully in a way that makes the FBI agents attached to monitor me feel very uncomfortable. I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers. A walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time. If you can get it on sale for under $5 there are some fun missions that you'll enjoy playing. I don't recommend it for any more than that unless the developers release a major overhaul.			"

												At least as bad as some of the worst games I've played, Lucius is a cheaply-made game at not such a cheap price ($19.99, at least $25 over what it's worth, meaning the developers should pay you to play the game).Everything from its looks, to its cutscene and gameplay style might make you think this is from another era (and not a good game from that era), yet it's a 2012 game, only one year old at the time of writing.The game is incredibly frustrating, with no pointer as to what to do, yet it wants you to perform in a way that is 100% how the developers intend you to play a mission.In fact, there is a hint as to what to do, the mission title, but even if you get it, which if you're like me you will usually, you don't get how to do it because the game just won't let you use your powers in a meaningful way unless you're at the right place, at the right time, under the right circumstances.Lucius is a very poorly designed game.

Графика там не особо, поэтому испуга от убийств вряд ли получите, зато их суть, задумка и процесс - это что - то! В общем, засела я ""на часик"" поиграть и проиграла целых 5. Рекомендую. Лайк.			"

												Unfortunately this game is linear and uncreative. A promising game held back with poor execution including bad voice acting, lame writing and boring gameplay. In order to solve the way to kill someone it'll take you a matter of minutes because there are only a few areas to even access. No multiple ways to kill someone either. Got it for $2 and I feel like I over payed.			"

												Lucius is a nice game with beautiful graphics where you play as a villain (the son of the devil) and your mission(s) is to find a way to kill people. It doesn't have replayability, i think that the game is not exctacly a horror game but more like a exploring/puzzle game.I personally  enjoy it, took me aroun 8hrs to finish it and i  recommend it

												I rather enjoyed this game. Playing a precocious child by the name of Damien Dante, you have to kill people. Why? For the glory of Satan of course. This game is pretty much just The Omen: The Videogame. You have to figure out how to kill people without getting caught. The only problem is there is just one person per level that you kill, and there is only one way to kill that person. So it does not play like a sandbox murder simulator, it plays like an adventure game. That means it is boring. Even rudimentary skills at rpgs or adventure games will make this one far too easy. But still, it was fun. With the exception of the 20 hr and 40 hr acheivements, that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when I can, without cheating, complete the game in 6 hrs. The style of game also makes it not replayable. Buy it if you can get it on sale for super cheap.			"

												i liked the game enough to play it through, but it was a very rough cut out of what could have been a great game. the npc's constantly repeat the same things over and over which gets quit irritating. there aren't many clues to go off of so switching between abilities to see what may work as an option is quit frequent and often i needed to resort to youtube for help. the story is pretty bad in script and logic. however i will still give it a thumbs up because it was everything that i expected to be which was a low budget b film video game take on the movie ""the omen"". my final words on it is ""to get it on discount"".

												This game is good, if you like games where you can walk around and just cause havok. I like to play this game from time to time, when I am bored of my bigger games. This game is great, the story is a little corny, but i enjoy this game. I like the different ways you set up each person for the ""fall"" they encounter and the different maze like ways in the mansion, you can get to different places. Also the story following the seasons and years also. The only thing I hate is some of the difficulties in the game are a little hard to get past, and the build up to the end of the story and having a crappy climax. Other than that an ok game to play on A rainy day. Thanks Pew Die Pie , for bringing this game to my attention. =0)			"

												Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)			"

												Quite enjoyed this game, twas a good Saturday distraction. I managed to get 55 of the 58 achievements in under 10 hours, while also finishing the game with both endings. The remaining achievements were the running one, which I did while getting the laundry chore done (got lost enough! hehe) which I managed the following day within a half hour, and the other two were the time-based achievements (play for 20 hours and play for 40) which I'm still on my way to getting.All in all, a very enjoyable game, though don't expect open-world, it's very scripted. This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.Top story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).

												Lucius makes an erstwhile attempt to play upon the ""son of the devil"" trope, but in the end, makes the idea of being born with demonic powers seem... pretty boring, to be honest. It also seems rather trite that your father merely wants you to kill pretty much everyone in the house where you're being raised, rather than doing anything interesting with said powers. Worst Satan ever.It's a shame Lucius fell short, really. There are some great death sequences in there, and some interesting storylines sprinkled in for a few characters, but most of those fail to deliver or are left dangling in the long run. A glorified puzzle game, Lucius mostly just has you running around the house to collect item combinations to finish setting up a death, like a series of vaguely evil Rube Goldberg machines. You're given a handful of powers, but they don't come into play particularly often, leaving one wondering why they're even there in the first place. As for your victims, it seemed kind of odd that some of the characters seemed to deserve their fates while others were complete innocents, which was confusing. I mean, if you're the devil's son, wouldn't it make more sense for almost all of your victims to be innocents? Or for them all to have filthy souls just begging for harvest? The blend of the two felt like a case of indecision more than anything else.The chore completion aspect adds another layer of tedium as well. By completing different tasks given to you by the manor's various adult inhabitants, you can pass yourself off as a ""good"" boy and obtain a series of gifts to make your life easier. Of the three, I felt the Tricycle was the most useful in how it increased your movement speed (and looked kind of ridiculous, animation-wise), but it was the last of three I obtained, leaving only a few chapters in which I could even use it. I feel the ""good boy"" status could have been better used as a way of lowering suspicion rather than just a method of procuring handouts.Between the tedium of each chapter and what feels like a lot of wasted potential, I can't really recommend Lucius. I finished it, but it was more a matter of just headbutting my way through more than anything else. Meh.			"

												I'm very hesitant to recommend this game for anyone else- be warned before buying it.I, however, did enjoy the game (so far). I have not completed it but the story is interesting, i lvoe the mechanics of killing people and telekinesis, and the graphics are pretty decent.That being said, playing the game can be a chore. The movement system is awkward at best, requiring many tries to get through door ways and other tight spaces. I have twice now gotten stuck in a wall and thus have had to restart the level. Combined with the game's subpar checkpoint system, and it can get frustrating really fast.In addition to this, the game will make you look around aimlessly for many minutes to find hidden items. They are not immediately obvious, and combined with the very fact that moving around is a chore, it's very hard to enjoy the search and it quickly becomes tedious. The house layout is also confusing and it is hard to quickly travel around it, due to movement issues.That being said, I do enjoy the plot and will continue playing it to completion. But make sure you knoe what you're dealing with before you buy this game.			"

												Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.""Lucius"" is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there.I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it. Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first ""Lucius"" to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.""Lucius"" has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing ""good boy"" status by doing mundane chores around the house.My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though. "

												At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid ""Lucius"". Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.			"

												An amazing concept, a unique idea, greatly executed.Despite some minor bugs and some aspects that may be updated (such as some collision bugs), Lucius properly mixes and blends together various genre in one product: stealth, point and click, puzzle, crafting, open world in one game.You play as the six year old Lucius, a kid who literally works for the Devil as his personal cook as your task will be to bring him souls to feed him. In the vast Dante Manor there are many individuals to choose from while keeping the good-boy attitude not to raise suspects.While murdering members of your family and their servants, you will be asked to perform chores like brushing your teeth, tidy up your room, finding objects etc. These chores will slowly award you special objects.As you kill people, you will strengthen your evil skills and gain new ones.I will not spoil much of the game itsel as it's a continuous surprise.My advice is to purchase this genre-defining game!

This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.Top story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).

												Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)			"

It gives very little tips to more complicated things, so I ended up spending more time just trying to figure out how to kill everyone in the game. To sum up the game its like ""The Omen"" simulator. So if thats your thing you'll enjoy it for the most part. You have no freedom of who you want to kill, its all scripted.			"

												The game is kinda like Hitman, but you are a little boy with supernatural powers, the Antichrist in fact, like Damian in The Omen movies. Somewhat too linear, however that should less so in Lucius 2.This is approx my first hour, it starts off rather slow, so sit back and watch the cut-scenes, or just skip ahead to the active scenes with my time links.

												I suspect that the early plans for Lucius involved dropping the son of Lucifer into a small open world filled with people who need killing and offering multiple ways to perform said kills.  After the first couple of more scripted kills would offer a tutorial on how the game's mechanics functioned, Lucius would then be unleashed to study, stalk and ultimately execute each member of the household in whichever order the player wished.  Sadly, this isn't the game we get.  Instead, the game feels like it was massively scaled back and forced into a different, more linear mold about halfway through production.  Instead of building traps, staging ""accidents"" or setting people against each other, the player is instead forced to trigger scripted deaths using inventory items and a suite of flimsy magic powers that felt very tacked-on.  You kill your targets in the order that is scripted for you and the game will sometimes set everything up so that basically all you need to do is pull the trigger.  Yawn.  I give Lucius an A- for concept but unfortunately, the execution of concept is equally (or more so) important and that's where Lucius fails.  There's still some entertainment to be had during its 5-6 hour campaign and it floods you with achievements for almost no effort, but in the end it falls a little too short for a recommendation.			"

												I've not completed this game yet and whether or not I finish it depends entirely on my level of frustration. The gameplay is awful, with clunky movement and action scenes slowing down significantly making it very difficult to play. There's not any adaptablity to how you carry out the murders, which makes the game rather dull and most of the time I checked a walkthrough guide because it wasn't always obvious how the murder was carried out (or who you were supposed to kill). The cutscenes are badly voice acted (but I suppose when you are evil and have a name like Fabius, over-acting might be acceptable).My game also crashes repeatedly - most notibly when you drop something. At first I thought this was only happening at specific points in the house but then it started happening in other places.			"

The game mechanics are simple enough, just find the right combination of objects in the correct steps and watch things unfold.  The puzzles start out fairly simple, but then start to get to the point of being illogical.  There are also numerous graphical glitches (bike doesn't steer, objects floating slightly above shelves, etc.) and the VO is sub-par.  Overall though, the game ends up being mischevious fun and looks decent.  I would still  recommend it.6.5/10			"

I would recommend buying the game on sale unless you don't mind paying full price for a 5-8 hour game.			"

												As Lucius, you're tasked with systematically slaughtering a mansion full of family and staff without getting caught. That also means you cannot attack your target directly by conventional standards. Because of this limitation, Lucifer himself had endowed you with various abilities and powers to assist in your work. Naturally, the more souls sent to your father, the stronger your powers become. These powers involve telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and combustion. You'll mostly be using telekinesis throughout the game, while others are used in specific areas or chapters. The only ability I thought had any growth was telekinesis. From lifting cups for a few seconds to starting cars and killing power to the entire mansion was the only time you felt like you were getting stronger. When it came to the murders, I was a little let down. I had expected more freedom when planning each kill. Something closer to the Hitman games than what we got. You're presented a scenario in each chapter and you have to figure out what is expected of you to meet the criteria and proceed forward. Each scenario is interesting and satisfying in their own ways and involve homicide, suicide and accidents. Yeah, it's some pretty gruesome stuff, too. One example is using water on snow to ice over and having a character slip on it, then using telekinesis on an icicle to finish the job. Almost all of the murders involve an extreme element of puzzle solving instead of force to accomplish your goal. If you're into that style of game, it's pretty damn fun. I wasn't complaining too much after I got the hang of things.OH yeah, you have to appear as a good boy to the house hold, too. You're actually given chores like cleaning your room and brushing your teeth to complete. Upon completion, you're given good behavior points and will receive gifts that may make your work easier. And it's kinda fun. It works and so does this game even if it's not the game I had expected. It's pretty damn close. And I cant think of another game that's really like this. It's far from perfect and can be very frustrating, but it's a neat experience and an interesting perspective to take on. It's a slow horror game about plotting your attack, without any threat of being attacked or having to hide in a closet. It's a liberating horror game in that sense, having so much power with nobody suspecting a damn thing.			"

												At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid ""Lucius"". Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.			"

												Ok, so I usually play console games and have just recently turned to the ""Pc master race"" and this is one of the first games I have had to play with keyboard and mouse. The reason I start by saying this is that all I've been seeing, here on steam, is people complaining about the controls. So, how does the game feel is a good question. The answer, to a non-traditional keyboard and mouse player, is pretty well, there are a few moments later in game where I needed to use my right hand to hit number keys as I used my left hand to control movement, but other than that no probs.Another thing is I see people saying that the game is a buggy piece of bleep, and though that is subjective most people take that as a warning sign. I'm not going to say this game is the most polished thing ever but it sure isn't what people are making it out to be, and I did encounter a few bugs such as my journal not updating halting progress, and I got stuck on some clutter behind the bar. Sure that sounds bad but a simple restart of a checkpoint and you should be good. Then on to how it looks, and I'm fully aware this is personal opinion but I think this game is stunning, the animations in cinamatics aren't the best but they're on par with some AAA games I've played. So to story then, I suppose if you couldn't gather this from everything to do with the game you play Lucius a spawn of Lucifer (the Devil) and you're killing everyone, in a Hitman-esq playstyle mixed with evil powers. It's like a mix of the Shining and the Omen, and thats a really good thing. And the game offers alternate endings which all wrap the story up well. Heads up if you are Catholic or Christian and are easily offended you may want to pass on this one. As my first real pc game I thought this was a very good start, and for the price of 20 bucks I feel (pardon this horrible phrase) that I really got my moneys worth. So check this out guys, ya just might like it!			"

												Lucius makes an erstwhile attempt to play upon the ""son of the devil"" trope, but in the end, makes the idea of being born with demonic powers seem... pretty boring, to be honest. It also seems rather trite that your father merely wants you to kill pretty much everyone in the house where you're being raised, rather than doing anything interesting with said powers. Worst Satan ever.It's a shame Lucius fell short, really. There are some great death sequences in there, and some interesting storylines sprinkled in for a few characters, but most of those fail to deliver or are left dangling in the long run. A glorified puzzle game, Lucius mostly just has you running around the house to collect item combinations to finish setting up a death, like a series of vaguely evil Rube Goldberg machines. You're given a handful of powers, but they don't come into play particularly often, leaving one wondering why they're even there in the first place. As for your victims, it seemed kind of odd that some of the characters seemed to deserve their fates while others were complete innocents, which was confusing. I mean, if you're the devil's son, wouldn't it make more sense for almost all of your victims to be innocents? Or for them all to have filthy souls just begging for harvest? The blend of the two felt like a case of indecision more than anything else.The chore completion aspect adds another layer of tedium as well. By completing different tasks given to you by the manor's various adult inhabitants, you can pass yourself off as a ""good"" boy and obtain a series of gifts to make your life easier. Of the three, I felt the Tricycle was the most useful in how it increased your movement speed (and looked kind of ridiculous, animation-wise), but it was the last of three I obtained, leaving only a few chapters in which I could even use it. I feel the ""good boy"" status could have been better used as a way of lowering suspicion rather than just a method of procuring handouts.Between the tedium of each chapter and what feels like a lot of wasted potential, I can't really recommend Lucius. I finished it, but it was more a matter of just headbutting my way through more than anything else. Meh.			"

												I really enjoyed this amazing game. 8/10.+ interesting storyline+ not too easy+ puzzle game+ few side quests+ the house is big and enjoyable+ the powers are simple to learn+ deaths were entertaining and creative+ peli on suomalaisten tekemä ja sisältää hiukan suomalaista insideläppää joten se on mainitsemisen arvoinen plussa :)- felt like the game wasn't long enough- the graphics are not most appealing but it makes the game look more scary- characters (doesn't include lucius or lucifer) were kinda impersonal- voice acting wasn't that good- if you fail a quest you need to start the whole chapter all over againI maybe wouldn't buy this at full price but when it is on sale it is a must have.

												Great story. It is fun to be evil. During the game you have to figure out how to kill all your targets. You also getting a few special powers. You can also use your tricycle in your house and break a few pots (and no ruppies inside, I am not link)In the last level I do have a irritating bug/Crash, this make it very hard to finish that level.

												Lucius is a devilish game that follows a little boy hellbent on murdering everyone in his house to please his father; Lucifer.The game is broken into chapters, and in each chapter you must kill an assigned target. There is no time limit to this, which gives you plenty of time to explore the game and interact with your fantastic surroundings, and talk to the characters which have unique dialogue that change as the story progresses. The game has some very difficult parts that take quite a bit of thinking, and a couple of easier parts. Sadly, each death is scripted and you have no choice in the way they die, which means if you replay the game, you don't get a different experience.Having said this, it is a wonderful little game, with some very interesting cutscenes. The premise is a little cliche, but the execution is fantastic, as it keeps you interested until the very end.			"

I have never played a game this bad before. I actually believe I have discovered something. I really learned something. But that's me. I recommend you buy this game. It's absolutely horrible, boring. It's not fun at all.I'll admit it looks like it could've been interesting and fun to play but it really didn't... uh.. do it.Ugh, running around trying to figure out what to do around characters that keep repeating THE SAME DAMN LINE over and over again at you....  It mystifies me how can someone make something that so utterly completely garbage. You must buy this just to see. Seriously, you can't possibly pass this up.I definitely recommend this. It's on sale for $2 and it's worth it just to see something so horrible that sells for $20.I know that doesn't make any sense yet, but it will once you've played through it; once you've suffered through this torment, you'll really learn something.

												I'm going to recommend this game, but just barely. This game, at it's core, is basically a puzzle game with a superficial veneer of third-person ""open-world"" adventure gameplay. Unfortunately, the puzzles are so linear yet obtuse as to be neither fun nor rewarding. There is only one acceptable solution for every puzzle, and there are hardly any hints to be found. When I actually solve one of the puzzles on my own, it's usually by falling♥♥♥♥♥backwards into the solution. Often times, it's so frustrating to try figure out what the game wants me to do, I have to resort to walkthroughs for help. It is a very rare occurence when I get a ""lightbulb"" moment where I can actually clearly see A leading to B leading to C leading to the kill. It's enjoyable when those moments do happen, but they're few and far between. The reason why I'm recommending this game at all is due to its great story, unique premise, and high production values. At times it's an interesting experience, but it's not very fun to endlessly look around for tiny inventory items amidst a sea of things that can't be picked up.			"

												Great game. Kinda tough to figure some puzzles out, but very enjoyable when you're able to figure them out (or check the walkthrough and see what the game wants us to do, that doesn't seem to follow any logic, or any hint given us - most of the time there is no hint at all, just look around and try stuff). Recommend one playthrough but i think one playthrough won't be enough, it's kinda of enjoyable to walka round as Lucius. And the deaths are both over the top gory and entertaining to watch.			"

												The game is good as in the gameplay and story.-Achievements are quite easy to obtain except the ""Time"" achievements, ""I like this game"" and ""I'm addicted"" which I get to later.-It's quite linear to say the least.-There's a side quest to do where you do these chores and you obtain an item when you, I believe, do two or three chores everytime.The most fun in the game was the item that you would get third time, the tricycle.You could literally cycle up the stairs and go faster than walking by pressing ""Shrift"" to speed up.The price to me honestly isn't worth it (18,99€), but I can't complain as I got it in a giveaway.-That being said, the week long deal offers 95% off as of typing this review (30/08/2015) which is a good deal.Now onto the ""Time"" achievements.It's one of the most dubious and stupid achievements I've seen yet.You basically play 20 hours to earn the first one and then 40 hours to earn the second one.-Though the storyline is like 8 hours (For me it was 6 hours including all the achievements except the Time achievements) and if you want to complete all the achievements, an extra 1-2 hours would be the assumption.

												Very fun game. sometimes challenging, sometimes gruesome, always entertaining, NEVER dull and maintains a good balance between logic and imagination.The creators have done a great job of creating different scenarios for you to follow and figure out. Inside or out, the ambiance and graphics are very nice including the use of HDR. Dynamic weather keeps things looking pretty all year round and there are lots of nice finishing touches to keep your eyes busy. The textures are amazing.The sound is nice and uniform throughout and along with the soundtrack adds good depth and atmosphere.Both graphics and sound come together to create a memorable environment where even just standing around is pleasant.The plot is also good; although sometimes predictable there are always a few unexpected twists that are good for a laugh or two. One of the best things about the game-play is that you can explore at your own pace without being rushed (unless there is a specific reason).All this creates a fun, immersive and laid back approach to 3rd person adventure gaming.There are walkthroughs online to help you out if you get really stuck, but if you use them you will get no since of satisfaction and inevitably feel like you've cheated yourself rather than won the game.Game bugs are so few and minimal they are hardly worth mentioning. i.e. while carrying socks or underwear they might get stuck on a door (but they will release if you keep walking). The trike might (very rarely) rise a foot or two in the air if you run over an object (but will fall down again as you carry on). Once, the security guy walked right through me.These are very minor, infrequent things that detract nothing from the game or gameplay! Especially if you have the imagination to immerse yourself into task at hand.If you don't like something about the way this game is made (bugs or realism) i suggest you learn programming and try making your own game first Before going on a ""i'm a bug snob"" crusade.If you are religiously sensitive then this is not the right game for you. If you are religiously sensitive i can't imagine why you would even want to play.Understanding that this is a game and not real life will go a long way to allow you to appreciate the experience  that the creators are sharing. Just enjoy the ride and you'll have fun!Review score666 out of 10Do your chores! "

												Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by ""The Omen"" movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&click- and ""Hitman"" -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)			"

												The son of an unholy marriage; the game Hitman and the movie Omen. You get to play the 6 year old antichrist as he murders family and staff members in a variety of creative ways. If you're a fan of classic horror movies like the Omen and the Exorcist you will probably love the various references to them.			"

												Honestly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game. It does have amazing visuals and a great story line although I must point out this game isn't for the faint of heart or people of the Christian religion. It has a lot to do with the Devil and Dark Magic. I as a gamer don't take offense to simple video games however I am aware that many people or their family members may not entirely agree with this this game and I respect that, therefore should you be Christian or have family members who are either Christian or believe heavyly into the Bible, this isn't a game for you.

												Lucius is a bold attempt to put you in the shoes of an evil 6 year old with supernatural powers and a good standing with the devil in order to murder and cause mayhem amongst all other people in your home without being detected.While the developers characterize the game as an open world experience, it only takes place in the very confined place of the house and does not allow for creative approaches when it comes to murdering the inhabitants. Unfortunately, this is also my major issue with the game that has to be lauded for trying something different, but fails upon the execution - quite literally. In addition to that, controls are a detrimental to the experience and become your real enemy in the few, but frustrating fighting sequences.One can argue that a certain amount of dark humor is present, but again the execution feels forced and especially the sexual scenes add nothing except for their own sake being there. In short: Interesting concept - no buy			"

												You are Lucius Wagner, a 6 going on 7 year old demonic boy. Your goal is to kill your family and everyone inside your mansion. Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the ""Play 20 Hours"" and the ""Play 40 Hours"" achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10. "

												The game has a really neat idea, I like it although I do have some complaints:-There isn't very much direction, I understand it is meant to make you think, but some things are just completely random, I did find a guide for a little help though.-There are a few glitches, mostly just entertaing. (Mom walking in place at a door when the door is locked)-It is very linear in most aspects, ie: you can't do certain things unless you check your journal first, even if the update in the journal is a conversation you are in the middle of having. -And a minute problem, I think the ""Devil"" could have looked better.Although it's many issues, I do still like the game. I'm wondering what else may be coming out from the developers.			"

Riding around your house on a tricycle on your way to kill somebody is freaky. Lucius is a pretty decent game if you like creepy games. The controls feel incredibly smooth and the graphics look nice. My only complaint was that the ending felt unfinished, like they just ran out of money (being an indie game this is probable) and/or forgot to add the last five minutes.			"

												Unlike some of the other reviews I read, I found this game to be a very linear 3rd person puzzle adventure. I would not call it an open world or sand box game. So as long as you are OK with that, then I would really recommend this game. The art style and atmosphere are really good and so it is just like playing and re-creating the old Omen films. It is a really good original experience. Each chapter is a puzzle, who to kill and how. You get more and more powers but you can't use them any way you want. Each murder has to be done in a specific way using a specific object or specific power. It can be frustrating wandering around trying to find a specific victim or a specific object. As there are little or no checkpoints, if you make a mistake it is game over and back to the start. So some chapters are just really repetitive trial and error. But on the good side,  as there is a different solution for each murder, the game is always varied and the final cut scenes are so silly and gruesome that they always make you laugh.			"

Once you have played it once (you can get all achievments on a single playthrough) there isn't any benefit to playing it again, since you know how to kill each and every one of them. The mansion's floorplan could have been better. It is very awkward to move around in and it is difficult to learn. Even after completing the entire game, I still don't have a good idea of what's where in the mansion.7/10			"

												First of all I can't really understand why this game has mostly positive reviews. Death ideas are clichéd. The plot is non-existent. Shooting someone with a pistol, or using a fireball results in a hit-and-run like effect on the victim. Hitman 2 required a full clip to be emptied on a victim to get this effect. Lucius' cannon would flabbergast even Dirty Harry. The fire extinguisher scene from the end of the game should occur in the game studio during the production phase. The 20h and 40h achievements are an offence in their own right. Especially that the playthrough takes 10 hours if you take a nap in the meantime. It's good that you can sleep through their completion.    - 'Unique 3D horror adventure gaming experience'  - depends on one's definition of 'unique';   - '3D Open World' - to some extent;   - 'Cinematic Cut-scenes' - but surely not climatic;   - 'Breathtaking Atmosphere and Stunning Visuals' - breathtaking like a cockroach on a kitchen table;   - 'Harness Supernatural Powers, including Telekinesis and Mind Control' - if you can harness the game physics to move items;  - 'Experience the terror of a classic tale from the horror movie genre' - terror indeed.Shiver Games breaks the fourth wall by making the player scared with how the game is made, not by the game itself. Cheers on that!			"

												Very fun horror game. There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. But it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner. The game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.			"

												A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain.Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.)You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder.As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter.Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.			"

												A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen.  First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it.  The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target.  In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place.  These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight.  You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol.  I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending.  The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea.  The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun.  Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it.  If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle.  Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.			"

												A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain.Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.)You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder.As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter.Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.			"

												Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say ""delightfully twisted."" It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.			"

												This is an amusing game, but a very limited game.  Obviously the graphics aren't the main draw, though they're serviceable. The main issue with this game is it's simplicity. I was hoping for a bit more openness, but it's a rigid storyline with rigid goals and only one way to do things. And it's not always clear what you should do.Add to that an ending which is lackluster due to poor aiming controls and a cramped little arena, capped with an obscure final moment and it falls flat.That's not to say the game isn't worth a little time and a little money. I picked it up for $2 during a sale and I don't feel I wasted my money. It is entertaining. Just not worth dropping too much green on it in my opinion.			"

												I loved the concept - playing as a ""Damian"" evil child while hiding your murders is a fun idea, but the game hides puzzle pieces too well while giving you the solutions to the puzzles too easily. I knew exactly what to do, but had no idea where to find the tools to let me do it. That's not fun. Also, this horror genre usually has beautiful children be evil - because the contrast of innocence and beauty with the vile and evil actions is chilling, but the artists for this game made Lucius a dough-faced plumpkin. That and other minor issues like cut-scenes that aren't cut as tightly as they should be hurt this game, but they could easily be overlooked if the puzzle pieces had been easy to find. I like figuring out how to do things, but I became bored immediately when I discovered that the game wants me to search all over for whatever items may be required to pull off a murder.			"

I mean you can mind control someone into killing themself by jamming a cross into their face over and over... It is a VERY Linear story, so you must do at least 90% of the things only one way(with no direction from the game as to how to do these things, IE: wiki will help a lot), but for the other 10% its more or less do you want them to kill themselves violently, or very violently...

												This game is terrible. The idea is quite interesting, but the game is so poor in writing and programming that it is ruined from the start. The kills are probably ok for the most part (although there are some VERY silly ones), but sometimes you have to get items you wouldn't have even remotely considered getting for this kill, it gets ridiculous. The animations are just god awful, they are pretty basic and ruin most of the kills. Finally, the game is poorly optimized so even with a good rig you will get some fps drops, not to mention that on some parts I got stuck (usually in the garden ladders).  "

												4.9/10 the devil is in the detail.Hmmm. This game really shows the good and bad of indie game production. On the one hand it's a unique and interesting game concept, the sort of thing which the big guys would shy away from. On the other hand, it's not very well executed, and there are a number of bugs and glitches. On the one hand, the story is pretty well put together, and not just dashing off another sequel, on the other hand, the game does become a little linear, with very few actual choices (you have to play for the kill in the cutscene, even when your twisted mind can see something better.) It is fun and engaging, and easy to get the hang of, but when you open a drawer and it passes through a chair, people talk to you through walls, or you pass somebody on the stairs and end up riding on their head and looking through the ceiling, it breaks your immersion. Give it a go by all means, but don't expect too much.			"

												You command Lucius a child who seems to be under the influence of Lucifer. Lucifer tells you to kill people without getting caught to collect souls for him which in-turn makes you more powerful and you unlock more abilities which Lucifer teaches you.Sound awesome right? No...The biggest flaw is this is NOT a horror game like you may think. It's more of a ""mystery game"" where you go around trying to find clues on how you are supposed to create each murder. The game is VERY vague with hints, and more often then not, you'll have no idea what you are supposed to be doing causing you to mindlessly search this house until something crosses your mind. If mystery crime case games are not your thing, I'd suggest staying away from this game...Although....with a guide it is ""somewhat"" enjoyable causing drama, and watching people die as a child. Many games don't include children, and being a child-murderer has a slight charm to it.			"

												A perfect example of why a lack of quality assurance can turn a mediocre game into a bad one. The concept behind Lucius is a good one - you are a demonic child whose purpose is to sacrifice souls to Lucifer in exchange for power - but the execution is lacking. Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.Worse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free ""horror"" tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious ""chase scene"" music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.Lucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.			"

												I highly recommend this game for any horror fans out there. Gameplay-wise it's more of an adventure/stealth-game but the story is very similar to the movie ""The Omen"". You play as Lucius, son of the devil, and you do his evil deeds for him, mainly killing everyone in the mansion where you live, I had great fun with this one! And it sometimes is quite a challange to figure out what steps to take in order to complete the killings!			"

												This game presents an alternative gameplay of what I'm personnaly used to, and I got to say I like it.. a lot. Okay, it's repetitive, the maniability is a bit strange, graphics are barely just okay, but I enjoy this game a lot ! :) It's really fun to play, almost hilarious, chapter after chapter ! I recommend it, but only for a price that wouldn't be more than 15€.			"

												An amusing demonchild themed 3D adventure game in a single location of a beautiful mansion. This is one of those games where you could experience this game by watching someone else play it on youtube. i.e. There is only one straightforward solutuion/path for each chapter/kill.

												If 'Hitman 2' had taken place in the early 1970s with a charming 6 year old boy you would have LUCIUS. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the early 'Hitman' series in which you pull off murders (making them appear as accidents) in order to reap souls for Satan. There is so much more to this game and a lot more forward-thinking than anything in the 'Hitman' series. Planning is key along with some ""just the right time"" scenerios to allow you to fly under the radar for some time. Pull daily chores like cleaning your room, which you can do via telekinesis as you gain unholy powers as you progress; help out the mechanic or gardener or kill some charming employees, friends, and family members. This game is definately worth the $3 I got it for and it will be remembered and replayed for ages to come.			"

												Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high).I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a ""good boy"" or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final partthat has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise.Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.

												I'd say the movie ""The Omen"" was an inspiration for this game.  You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Killing staff members in your giant mansion while ""Daddy Lucifer"" occasionally visits to give you new gifts.  Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in.  So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed.  The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level.  But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.			"

												Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games.  The ""Story"" portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear.  But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim.  The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.			"

												""Lucius"" Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970’s and is a horror adventure game.Gameplay 6/10I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didn’t have any expectations. It’s in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you don’t have much choice in what happens. But, it’s got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also don’t talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.Music/sound 5/10The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. I’m not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much.Creativity 6/10This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that it’s a normal adventure game.Graphics 8/10The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics they’re a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting they’re fine.Replay Value 5/10The replay value of this game isn’t much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.Enjoyment 8/10Maybe I’m a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun.  I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.Overall 6.5/10This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just don’t expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.References.R1 = http://shivergames.com/R2 = http://www.lace-mamba.com/Please comment, I'm always looking to improve!			"

												Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top “accidents” (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if you’re expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably won’t get what you want out of it. It’s of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Myst…just…with more murder. Yes that’s right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.This wasn’t a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of you’ll be disappointed. In fact, it’s quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas they’re allowed you’ll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else you’ll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. There’s some leniency there and it’s not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas you’re meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.It does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since you’re supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isn’t much use for this ability outside of two places where it’s shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.  The secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to “hide in plain sight” by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guards’ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of “memory erase” which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but it’s more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.There are some sidequests in the form of “chores” such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I don’t know if they figure you out if you don’t do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting “gifts” for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use. Aesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point it’s an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly. Most of the games bugs are graphics based so I’ll stick them here. The game doesn’t have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and “stretching” across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if that’s enough to turn you away from buying it. Story-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well that’s what you’re going to get. Though at times it seems like the game can’t decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part it’s played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a “Ha ha” laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.Overall I enjoyed Lucius and I think there’s a lot to come here for. But the game isn’t without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil you’ll probably be entertained by what you get, but if you’re expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game you’ll likely not find what you wanted.

												This game is heavy on the satanic stuff/brutal killings orchestrated by a creepy kid! Not my fav game by any means but for under 2 dollars it has merit. If you get to the end o game, theres two ending to pick from; an action ending where you can blast people with your best moves, or a puzzle ending that makes you have to do VERY specific things in order.. Was quite hard doing the puzzle ending, especially since I'm terrible at puzzles lol. But yea just a heads up that the action ending is likely more fun than the puzzle ending I did. Overall pretty fun game, pretty nasty at times though !!			"

												 Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.			"

												 Overall this is a very hit and miss adventure game.It starts off well enough. Slowly introducing you to the game mechanics and drip feeding new abilities, but then the game never really goes anywhere.A few levels in and the mansion opens up, but then most of it is pointless space with the occasional hunt for an object in one of the rooms. I feel it would have been better to restrict each chapter to a certain area, but admittedly this would feel constrained.The solutions themselves range from pretty straightforward to bordering on the illogical. Additionally there is only one way to solve each murder and sometimes feels like guesswork to deduce the intended method (clues can be obtained using an unlockable item).One for adventure fans to pickup on sale, otherwise avoid.

												There will be some spoilers in this review. Read at your own risk.Lucius is a murder centric puzzle game where you play as the titular Lucius Wagner, a child of Lucifer. The premise of the game is rather interesting. Lucifer visits Lucius in a dream and bestows him the unholy mission of garnering the souls of people around Dante Manor. This is done through rather unintuitive and lacking puzzles. The story takes place in the painfully large Dante Manor. From nearly the very beginning of the game, most of all of the manor is open to you. With the mechanics that exist in the game, this is NOT a good thing. It does not reward exploration (save for the aptly named ""Explorer"" achievement). Furthermore, the puzzle solutions are extremely unintuitive and, quite frankly, boring. At several points, there shows potential for many possible ways to kill the chapter's target, but as the game requires deaths to be the ones laid out for you, it does not help at all (for example, one kill requires you to set someone on fire, but simply setting them on fire does not work. You have to douse him in gasoline and then setting him on fire will allow the kill.). More than that, the way some of these events transpire, it will severely test your suspension of disbelief (if you were to light a ciagrette at a stove, would YOU stick your face into the stove fire?) and the game simply can't be taken seriously. Even worse still, this game at one (potentially two) point(s) tries to hopscotch between puzzle and action game. The controls and camera for this game are already pretty clunky as is and making it into a third person action game with a terrible camera does not help the game's case in the slightest. Lucius also suffers from having quite a few bugs (several things can go wrong during some chapters and will force you to restart the chapter) and collision issues (getting caught on nothing comes to mind).Other bugs that come to mind are broken achievements. Some achievements do not work at times and can cause potential frustration.All in all, this game is NOT worth your time or money. I got it on sale for 75% off ($4.99 instead of $19.99) and I still feel like I got ripped off.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played...

												Τα όμορφα γραφικά του τίτλου, τα προσεγμένα cut scenes, η επιτυχημένη αναπαράσταση της δεκαετίας του ’70 (μέσω του τρόπου ενδυμασίας των χαρακτήρων και των αντικειμένων που εντοπίζονται εντός σπιτιού), το ικανοποιητικό speech αλλά και η ατμοσφαιρική -δίχως όμως να αποφεύγει τη συχνή επανάληψη- μουσική, αδυνατούν να δώσουν πίσω στο Lucius όσα οι άστοχες επιλογές και τα σχεδιαστικά λάθη από μεριάς των σχεδιαστών του στέρησαν.Η ανάλωσή μας στην πραγματοποίηση των 18 συνεχόμενων φόνων που λαμβάνουν χώρα, στα ανάλογα κεφάλαια που χωρίζεται το παιχνίδι και η απουσία ικανοποιητικού αριθμού παράπλευρων γρίφων, που θα τόνωναν ακόμη περισσότερο τη δράση και θα επιμήκυναν τη διάρκειά του, θα μπορούσε να πει κανείς ότι το μετατρέπουν, κατά μία έννοια, σε «κάτι-σαν-adventure». Δε ξέρω αν τελικά είναι κάτι σαν adventure, σίγουρα όμως δεν είναι κάτι σαν μεγάλη χαμένη ευκαιρία, αλλά μία πραγματικά μεγάλη χαμένη ευκαιρία για έναν πολύ δυνατό τίτλο, που θα μπορούσαμε να θυμόμαστε για καιρό μετά την κυκλοφορία του…http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/lucius "

												Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games.  The ""Story"" portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear.  But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim.  The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.			"

												i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.

												""Lucius"" Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970’s and is a horror adventure game.Gameplay 6/10I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didn’t have any expectations. It’s in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you don’t have much choice in what happens. But, it’s got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also don’t talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.Music/sound 5/10The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. I’m not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much.Creativity 6/10This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that it’s a normal adventure game.Graphics 8/10The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics they’re a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting they’re fine.Replay Value 5/10The replay value of this game isn’t much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.Enjoyment 8/10Maybe I’m a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun.  I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.Overall 6.5/10This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just don’t expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.References.R1 = http://shivergames.com/R2 = http://www.lace-mamba.com/Please comment, I'm always looking to improve!			"

Great game, has a fun storyline to it, wouldn't say it's scary in a way that things jump out at you etc. but it's scary because of the fact that this child has the ability to kill off all these people around him in the most twisted ways possible. Well worth getting in my opinion! 8/10			"

												The game's pretty brutal and has a good story. The mechanics are not so great though. You'll have to come to everything by yourself cuz there just arent enough hints to what has to be done exactly, except: ""this dude must die"", ""that chick must die"". It's like they expect us to think as a little homocidal antichrist. Well I couldn't do that and had to look for a walkthrough.Still I recommend this game to those who want to have some good Omen-style experience. Just get a walkthrough with it and keep it close by. Oh, and get this game on sale for like half the price. This way you won't regret it.Have a nice bloody adventure :)			"

""YOUR DAD IS VERY UPSET ABOUT YOU, LUCIUS""I still remember in the early 2012 when I saw first pictures of the game and then trailer, I was like oh damn, we gonna make some rampage with this little evil son of devil right? But then again, let's be honest. You was able to do more rampage in GOAT SIMULATOR than in this game.Anyway, I was still pretty excited about it and I still was in first levels of the game but that has changed when you realized that there is one certain way how to perform the kill and you need to find it. Well, yes I do understand that most of them needs to be done like that, to prevent being suspicious but if Shiver Games put in the work, and make various ways like that, that'd be brilliant. But level-design was not bad, I'm just saying if there was more to do that would be very good.Also I saw somebody said that we should get 'beautiful Lucius but instead we got some fat plumpkin because evil goes within beauty' I do agree with that. Soundtrack is average, no tracks you will truly remember. Whole story was pretty stupid, and it was not even progressing like I wish it would. Those 18 episodes were pretty down except few ones e.g. the one behind wine cellar. The powers that Lucius possess was really nice and various and that is good point. Steam Achievements was pretty easy but devs crossed line with some of those, when they tell you to be on 7 hours long game for over 40 hours. Currently it is changed so it tracks you time by Steam Library, but back in the days the tracker worked only when you was inside game, no menu, no alt+tab, no Steam Overlay and that was pretty pathetic. Big and I mean trully mega big point goes to Dante Manor because that place is exceptional, truly beautiful and awesome. One of the best gaming spots I have ever been in. I did not even mind to walk around that big place from point A to B because it was joy.I really want to put up THUMBS DOWN, but then again I start to think that it was not that bad journey and I will still give it UP. Lets see what second Lucius can do.EDIT: 7 HOURS LATER - NA NA NA. Screw this game. I am changing thumbs to DOWN and rating from 6 to 4.Bonus Point: Dante ManorRating: 4/10 "

												A pretty off-the-wall game that wasn't exactly done well. At first I had some problems with the game, and I even posted about a bug which got fixed in a quick response. But despite the developer's response showing that they cared about the bugs, it does not mean that the game as a whole was made into something that great.Despite how evil the premise is, I was looking forward to the game. Sadly, it wasn't executed as well as I expected it to be. It seemed cheaply thrown together into an over-the-top B-movie format. I genuinely think if the game had even more work done on it, it could've been a higher-level game than it is now. And according to many reviews, the sequel to this was made even worse, disappointingly.I would've liked if the story was actually more serious and if the characters weren't as silly. The gameplay as a whole isn't necessarily horrible, but many things are really easy or quick to do, and nothing got exciting at any point in the game. You can even get half of the items needed in the game just by running around and picking things up right away. I got through multiple ""missions"" really quickly because I had picked up all of the items needed for them earlier on.The fact that the ""missions"" simply mean ""Go pick up item X / Go to room Y / Use random skill"" goes to show how cheaply the game is done. Yes, as I said, I understand the premise, but playing the game didn't really do the idea justice. Besides that, the graphics were nothing special, nor was the voice acting (and lip sync didn't exist really). All in all, a rather lackluster game that I wish was made better.			"

Boy, was I let down, probably just my expectations but this game is very linear, has basic point and click puzzles, nothing special/interesting to do and seems very short. Great concept, needs more to it.Was worth it at 99c but I purchased the bundle at $10. Second game looks like it fixed some of these issues but appears to have far too many issues to stop me from getting a refund on the whole thing. Probably would've considered a $5 on just this one, but I can't.			"

												Hehehehe I wish I had more time to play this game.... To cut a long story short I'm just gonna say it is 'THE OMEN MOVIE = LUCIUS'.... You play as the Son of the Devil, who's born into a rich family....your aim is to kill people while maintaining your innocent disposition... Do this by cleaning up your toys like a goodboy, then go downstairs, turn the crosses upside down and lock your nanny in the freezer room.....(accidently of course ;) Graphics are fantastic, the sound and lighting are sensational and the setting is spooky. As you're killing these people so stylishly, you cant help but grin from ear to ear....and you always feel great when you please your father (The Devil) I give this game a 9/10.... Nuff said..... I must for every disturbed player like me :D			"

												Lucius aka the Omen, the game.You tricycle your♥♥♥♥♥through your fancy mansion looking for ways to kill servants, drunk uncles etc in accidentally convenient ways. Sounds fun?  It ain't.Main problems are that this isn't an open world (lots of carefully tucked away invisible walls, every mission opens a part of the mansion making it quite obvious to find the only solution to a kill) and one-way scripting death scenarios.I bought this game hoping this would be a Hitman BM with special powers, but instead they left nothing open in ways of creative kills, everything is scripted towards a specific kill.I'm still rooting for a Lucius 2, killing by accident/stealth/wit in a more open world would make up alot.IMHO this is worth 5$, it has some good moments,  but eh  all I can say: 'missed opportunity'.

												This is an adventure sandbox game in which you play as the son of Lucifer and kill household members. The gamplay is linear, and I wish there was more than one way to kill a target. But what makes this game truly enjoyable is figuring out how the next person is going to die. It is very fun playing as the bad guy for a change, and maybe I have a twisted sense of humor, but the death scenes are hilarious. I would recommend this game, and I also started a playthrough on my channel:

												This is an adventure sandbox game in which you play as the son of Lucifer and kill household members. The gamplay is linear, and I wish there was more than one way to kill a target. But what makes this game truly enjoyable is figuring out how the next person is going to die. It is very fun playing as the bad guy for a change, and maybe I have a twisted sense of humor, but the death scenes are hilarious. I would recommend this game, and I also started a playthrough on my channel:

												Lucius is a horror game that combines stealth killing like from Hitman games with puzzle solving but will you want to play this game ? In Lucius you play as Lucius who is the son of the devil. On his Six birthday Lucifer Grants Lucius powers but in exchange for souls which Lucius has to deliver to him by killing his fathers employees. So how is this game ? Overall Lucius is a very fun horror game. Now first the atmosphere is great. The entire game takes place in a mansion which is really confusing to navigate but theres alot of stuff to see and explore another thing thats really cool about this game is to figure out the ways that you need to dispose of enemies. You keep a journal which tells you about the victim and his or hers weakness which sometimes helps and sometimes doesnt. The game also has some illogical puzzles but just minor stuff and thats pretty much it. And plus this game takes inspiration from the Omen so you can practiclly say its Omen The video game. Overall its a really good game with a few small problems. I give Lucius a 7/10			"

												It's a shame Lucius is lacklustre. It's a neat concept for a dark and morbid puzzle/adventure game. It's a less-than-subtle homage to the 1976 film 'The Omen'. In it you play as the titular Lucius, a 10 year old boy to whom Satan (who looks and sounds like a poor Jack Nickelson impersonator) reveals is the antichrist. You're tasked with killing the entirety of the household, including your surrogate family, in ways that draw no suspicion to you, or your satanic nature.Asside from an entertaining concept the acting is probably the best thing about this game. Watching your family lose their minds over the inexplicable deaths tormenting them grows more and more harrowing as you progress.Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. This game is a technical mess. Objectives are unclear, gameplay is stifling, the sidequests are boring and the glitches are rampant.I spent a whole hour on one of the early missions because you cant use your satan powers when in direct line of sight of NPCs. After looking it up in a guide it turned out I had to stand behind a small, suspended rack of meat about 2 feet away from where I was standing. On the plus side, i found out if you walk lengthways into a door while it's opening or closing, it'll slingshot you outside of the map, allowing you to get a better sense of the houses layout. Later in the game you can unlock a gun and mind-wiping abilities, but aside from the tutorial, I found no place to use either of these for the whole game. Another sidequest reward is a Jack-in-the-box, the function of which I was never able to figure out, but it had a limit of 2 charges of whatever it did. This was my reward for spending half an hour gathering socks from around the house and putting them into the laundry bin, one by one.Despite the open world, it becomes quickly apparent that there's only one way to complete each mission. Ideally, a game like this would involve forethought, strategy and precision. Instead it's just trial and error see-what-this-thing-does.For the finale of the game it takes a stark departure where you are suddenly just throwing fireballs at people like the fantastic four. It feels like the core gameplay just gave up.Overall, Lucius is a neat concept but the execution feels rushed and incomplete. Can't recommend.			"

												I first played Lucius with high expectations but it only took me less than a hour that despite the great concept and promisse of this game, it failed deeply to deliver. For those of you who don't know, basicly the premisse of Lucius is that you're the son of Satan and he speaks to you at certain times teaching you new powers/spells and when you find a certain person on your house he'll tell you that you need to kill her. I understand that some games are better done if they restrict the player options ,in order to experience a story for example, but in this case I feel like the death of each one of those individuals being scripted didn't actually helped that much. Sure the developers created on their own way for each person to get killed in order to unfold the story which takes place around you and the detective which is investigating the deaths on your house along with your family but I feel like if they allowed to each player kill those people using their ""imagination"", per say, and their powers it would be actually alot more fun, don't get me wrong I actually thought some of them were well made. I also felt like the game was poorly optimized because I believe the cutscenes are rendered ingame and they ran pretty poorly for me for some reason but that's maybe just something on my end. One thing I really hated was that sometimes if you wake up and you need to get a certain item in order to kill someone, if you miss your ""window of oportunity"", like someone goes over to that room and they can't see and you need to wait for him to go to sleep it's actually pretty boring, atleast for me anyways. Overall I can't put myself to playing Lucius until the end because I just can't take it, the concept is great but it's poorly executed as far as I see it or maybe I just don't like the game at all. Eitherways, I don't recommend this one, beware.			"

												If you're seeing this review, then you're probably very interested in 'Lucius', a third person action-horror game where you play the son of the devil and go around reaping souls in pretty gruesome ways. While the concept looks good on paper, execution wise the game goes only halfway. Whether intentionally or not, it's pretty humorous going around as a little kid and messing things up around the manor. The character himself never talks throughout the game, which is pretty creepy and is even made reference to at one point in the storyline. The abilities you are able to use are cool as well, like mind control, telekenisis, and even fireballs! (although you can only use that ability at specific points, mainly scripted events).Unfortunately that's where the positives really end, the storyline of the game is pretty bland and not very in-depth. Not that long into the game you'll start to get somewhat bored of it and would rather just go back to your own evil devices. The cutscenes (which I'm pretty sure use the in-game engine) are god-awful, ranging from out of touch lip syncing, wooden voice acting and PS2 textures. Another thing is that actually figuring what to do next is a challenge in of itself, most of the time you'll be wandering around the manor, bumping into different rooms and accidentally finding important items. The worst part is if you fail on a mission, you have to start the ENTIRE mission all over again, which mainly happened for me during the stealth sequences in the game. The worst kind of Trial and error.Overall, this game is only really worth getting if it's at a low enough discount (75% or above) and even then save it for when you don't have anything else to play. It's not worth the wait or hype. Again this is my opinion, if you have a different view and enjoy this game wholeheartedly then that's great! :) But for me, it was a mediocre experience.			"

												The good first:Lucius is interesting, macabre, and keeps you wondering who you get to kill next. The storyline is pretty good. A couple of twists keep it interesting (even if you sort of see them coming, you get to say ""I knew it!""). I really did enjoy this game, and it's a game that I would reccommend... if you get it on sale.The bad:The game gives you literally no options. You have to do everything in EXACTLY the way the developers intended, or you can't complete the chapter. Personally, I'd prefer a little bit of an option on how to kill my victims... I don't want to complete elaborate schemes with no choices. Often, quick timing is required with skills that are less than precise, which can prove to be incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend it to those who rage easily. One scene alone I played for about 45 minutes before I could beat it, and had to continuously kill myself to start the chapter over. Furthermore, there is no ""save"" or ""load"" option. If you lose a level, you start at the beginning of that level. The levels aren't too long though, so it didn't bother me too much. Some of the cutscenes are very long; I was almost late to work because I was determined to get through the cutscene(s) that were playing, and it took 14 minutes (I had figured itwould only be 2-5 minutes). It's pretty glitchy, and some of your ""powers"" are very difficult to control.Overall:I do recommend this game. It's an interesting premise. Although it could have been better executed, I took it for face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. If glitches or elaborate gameplay irritate you, this may not be the game for you. If you can work around the glitches and enjoy games that are more like movies that you interact with, it's 100% for you.			"

												First time playing, this game was truly amazing, you're playing as the killer for once, as the bad guy, as the guy others fear and not the other way around. Mostly inspired by the Omen films I guess, you're basically the son of Lucifer. You live in this big mansion and you need to slowly kill basically everyone around you. Concept seemed fun, and it intrigued me to buy this game.You'll gain different powers as you progress through the game, but most of the time, you'll need to rig something to make it count for a kill. Now my problem with this, is there are no waypoints or no hints whatsoever, it is expected from you to immediatly know what to do or where to go. You'll probably look through guides a lot while playing this. If you miss a key item somewhere you'll be stuck till you find it. It's basically a linear game, you only have 1 choice and you can only execute the kill in a predetermined way. It's fun for the first time, but later feels like a chore. Especially with the addition of those 2 hour farming achievements, it's just a big drag.AI is poorly designed and most of the time you'll see them crashing into walls, walking and turning around at times for no reason. Storyline is predictable if you know the genre.I'd give this game a positive review, but it's basically a 1 time play. Those hour achievements could've been better if the game had a new game + mode, or a mode in which you could preform kills in a different way. All in all, overall disappointed with the game, had a lot of potential.			"

												It has a nice concept, but ultimately the game is just very poorly executed. On the technical side I've experienced numerous glitches and a few crashes. In-game the inventory and 'mission log' are very awkward to use, and the map is broken. The game offers little support for your objectives. As it has some puzzle elements this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the game has such tight grip on how a specific objective or 'kill' has to be executed that some kind of support would be nice. The fact that the game's kills are largely scripted doesn't even bother me that much. The main frustration lies in the fact that you have to carry it out exactly as the game wants you to. For instance, halfway through the game you are tasked with carrying water outside without gaining any suspicion. As all but one character are in the same room this could have been as easy as taking a bucket from the laundry room, filling it with water and carrying it outside without bumping into any NPC. Instead, the game wants you to go to a very specific room and take a very specific object to carry the water around. Unfortunately it doesn't end there. Some of the more interesting sections have you sneaking through the mansion at night. As some of the NPCs are still awake you have to take care not to bump into them. However, as the game is rather unforgiving in this, such sequences quickly turn into trial and error. In the game, you use specific powers such as telekinesis and mind control to achieve objectives. A downside is that simple things like picking up stuff or opening doors are treated in the same manner, meaning that this form of interaction also has to be selected from a hotkey. This became frustrating when I spent five minutes trying to open a door but wasn't able to do so as I still had telekinesis selected as active ability. When using a power such as telekinesis or mind control you have to aim extremely careful for it to take effect. Towards the end, this became so tricky that I had to go to the options menu to considerably lower my mouse sensitivity. The game has some annoying invisible walls (or rather 'fences') placed around some objects which obscure your ability to toss fireballs past them. A plus side is that this is one of the very few games where you play a true villain (not just an antihero) and that the atmosphere is very nice. It is just pitiful that the game is so poorly executed.Tl;dr: nice concept; bad execution.			"

												This game had me frustrated. The puzzles are sometimes stupidly hard to solve, even with clues, which will have you running up and down the hallways over and over again until you start screaming yourself red in the face. I found myself looking to the user made guides more often then I'd like to admit which left me feeling like a $3.00 hooker with a skin disorder. On the up shot, the guides were very well put together and very helpful if not a little presumptuous at times.I don't recomend this game for anyone with attention problems which, lets face it, is most gamers. The graphics are nice and although it lacked the horror aspect, which is what I half expected when buying it, the story is fairly well written.I didn't hate this game. I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone based on my experience with it. If it wasn't for the guides I would have given up on this game soon after pressing play.			"

												I guess, seeing trailers a lot of people may get an impression that Lucius is something like sandbox killing game... a Hitman game with demonic powers. Sadly - it's not.In a game, you play a role of Lucius, a young boy, who - thanks to his Grandfather's occult involvement - posses demonic powers. Each month, he's visited by Lucifer himself and each month he has to kill a new target.It's an interesting, if not slightly controversial concept, which should have allowed for wide spectrum of possibilities. And even first 3 of the chapters show a fair amount of potential that this game should have used to maximum.Well, the main problem of the game is that - there are no alternative solutions to a problem. After 5 or 6 missions, you realize that - even though ""the playground"" is getting bigger and bigger - the concept and possibilities the game gives you stay exactly the same. This essentially makes the game just a shallow adventure game, where player's task isn't to find the best way to kill a target, but finding a way that developer's designed.... even if it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so - in later levels, you're running back and forth, through a gigantic mansion, trying to find that one object that you need to finish up your task, only to find something that is as big as rock or battery(!). This alone wouldn't be so bad, if the game gave you enough hints on what you're looking for or what you have to do, but that isn't a case.Not only that - the game sometimes doesn't even fallow the rules of ""smart level design"" and places many objects that you have to use in shadows and badly lighten places - the type of places, where a player is least likely going to look for them. I remember being stuck in chapter 10 for good 10 minutes, only to realize that objects I was looking for were hanging on the wall - the only place in the entire the room, that was in the shadows. Finally, the design on a mansion itself is extremely confusing and it's going to take good few hours, before you're going to learn where to go, to not run in circles.From all of that, you may get an impression that I completely hated the game. That isn't the case. When everything was going fine and I had any idea what to do, where to find it etc. - the game was fairly entertaining. And storyline - even though, idea behind it felt flat on its face after 7 chapters - kept me interested enough to keep playing till the very end. The number of achievements also helped quite a bit, making me feel rewarded even for the most minor of tasks.When it comes to graphics - Lucius looks decent. It's more or less something that I'd except from a game of this calibre. There are few textures that don't look right and few places in a house, that feel empty, but it isn't anything game breaking. Character animations sometimes look a little stiff - especially facial animation could use some work. There are also some weird problems with optimization, where a framerate drops in some areas for no obvious reason, but - once again - because it isn't really an action game, I don't consider it a major problem.Lucius also has a decent music. Although, by the end of the game, you'll hear each of the tracks way too many times. Sound assets are good and fitting for the most part. Voice acting however is a mixed bag. I've played an English version and I personally wouldn't say that for the most part actors are doing a bad job. It's more of a case that script they had to work with and lines they had to deliver aren't very good. It's also obvious for me that in many places, they weren't given enough directions on how should they play their roles, which results in some hilarious conversations in few parts of the game.Bottom line - I'd avoid Lucius for the price of 20€ or even 10€. However - with 75% discount, I could recommend it to people that like adventure games or simply don't mind checking walkthroughs. It's a 6-8hrs long mediocre game, that sometimes shows its potential, but at the same time - is flawed with problems.			"

												This game makes me sad.  It's a classic story of ""so much potential.""  You basically play as a little devil-spawn kid (ala ""The Omen"") and run around the house plotting and executing the murders of various occupants in your house without getting caught.The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are.  It would be a lot more fun if you could wander around exploring and gathering and then choose an execution method based on your inventory, rather than having to find the items for the single available method.The other problem I had with this game was that it has far too many cutscenes which last for too long and happen too often.  It interrupts the gameplay.  At one point, you have to sneak out of your room to get some rat poison.  You have to sneak around without being noticed, which is actually a good deal of fun.  So I picked up the rat poison and expected to have to sneak back, but instead there was a cutscene that had me waking up the next morning.  One of the best parts of the old Thief game was trying to get back out after you've accomplished your goals.  No such ""extra drama"" here.  Just do your task and watch the next cutscene.I was very happy I was able to give this game a try, but I can't say I recommend it.  It's just too frustrating, the voice acting is poor, the characters are either unbelievably mean or oblivious, your actions are too limited, and worst of all, the story isn't compelling.			"

												I am Lucius, six-year-old son of Lucifer. I can shatter objects with telekinesis, control people’s minds, erase memories and even set things on fire with the power of thought alone, but right now, I’m running around a house carrying a single dirty sock. I’m supposed to be killing someone, but to draw attention away from my suspicious behaviour, I’m doing some chores around the house for my mum. One of those chores involves collecting dirty socks and underwear from various people’s rooms and taking them to the laundry room, and it takes forever because I can’t carry more than one sock at a time. There is something very wrong here.			"

												Although the story is just filled with plot holes and therefore unimaginable, I did enjoy the concept. The cinematopgraphy was incredible and a joy to view (just look at the screenshots I took), however they were unsupported by poor voice acting throughout. The only voice actor I found believable was the actor playing Will. Further, the games way of giving you a certain item to display hints on your hud was flawed as it didn't just show you hints specificially for the mission you were on, but instead, (I kid you not), it showed you hints for future missions aswell creating total confuson. An example of a plot hole I identified:-There is no way Lucius' parents are fine with never hearing Lucius' voice before, actually no one should be. However, they live day to day fine with it. Further, everyone in the house doesn't seen affected by the murders in the manor expect for the mother displaying a natural character arc. TL;DR:+Great game, great cutscenes, interesting concept- Poor voice acting, flawed help system, can't sympathise with characters due to lack of intentions and character arc.  "

												A really cool game that I believe was inspired from The Omen movie. You play as Lucius, the son of Lucifer. Lucius was born June 6th, 1966 (666 incase you haven't figured it out lol) into a family where his grandfather was worshiping and offering sacrifices in a hidden chamber all the way since his kids were young (Lucius bio father and his brother), which is the reason the family is so rich.The game starts when Lucius and his family are celebrating his 6th birthday when Lucifer visits him in a vision and points him to kill the maid. After he's done it, while Lucius is sleeping Lucifer visits him in his dream and teaches him a new skill. And that's basically what the game's all about, killing people and learning new abilities to use to kill people marked by Lucifer, until the end where you all the choas happens (won't spoil it) and you leave the manor as an innocent young kid and taken away by the detective after the fire that was burning down the manor. You can do many things other than solving puzzles and killing people around the house like tricycling around the manor, annoying people, messing around with your abilities, getting detected and then erasing the memory from those who saw you use it, doing chores for your parents and people who work at the manor which gets you some gifts like the tricycle, music box and a boad game.- Graphics: 6.5/10 but it really isn't that important to me.- Story: 8/10 It was entertaining and fun.- Gameplay: 7.5/10 Could've been better.- Price: I got it off BundleStars along with a few games in a bundle for $2.49 and it was totally worth it. If you don't like the full price, just wait for it to go on sale and get it along with Lucius II. Final score: 7/10. Good and fun game.			"

												You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play.If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you.The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.			"

												You play as the six year old son of the devil (like in The Omen). The goal is really simple: In each chapter, you have to kill someone in a SPECIFIC way. You have to find some items, put them (or interact with them) at specific places to achieve your goal. For me, it's not a problem. As long as you're okay with that, you'll enjoy it as much as I did!Cutest little devil. <3			"

												Lucius is an interesting game, which sadly doesn't live up to its full potential. It's effectively a linear puzzle game set in an open area. While you can get all of the items you need in game at any point (and I would recommend you to get them early because the game starts putting trials around getting some of the items later which can be skipped if you get them early on), you can only use those items in order as the missions require them.The game has a few issues: AI can lock you into parts of the map, the autosave doesn't seem to save at a lot of points making you redo a lot of what you have already done in the case of mission failure or getting bugged (and there's no manual save option), The voice acting is bland and often does not sync with the character animations, and the hints the game gives you to help you proceed often don't really help as they are far too obscure.Some assassinations are difficult, some are very straightforward. There are two ""boss fights"" if you could call them that, one of which resorts to a linear finale...There are stealth sections which when you first do them you will generally learn them through trial and error (due to a lot of insta fail sections), but after you get the ""forget"" power you basically run through them laughing like a wizard, because despite the power being limited use, there are more than enough uses to easily abuse it.The game isn't entirely bad, but its not what I was hoping for and does not live up to it's full potential by restricting playstyle despite the large amount of powers and interactivity given to you. It's more like an interactive movie than a game. It was still enjoyable despite all its faults, especially with the gruesome cuscenes, but I can't really recommend it. "

												Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.2/10, take your money else where.

												This is my revew on Lucius and I have to give it a 4/10 because there are bugs and alot of them and thats not really a bad thing because only one is game breaking and thats only happens for in my words the better ending. As for the other bugs they just break the immersion of the game. Also at almost random the frame rate would heavaly drop to almost a frame per second and everything would come to a crawl. Also the game has a hard time at really telling you what you really need to do and at times I had to use Youtube to finish some chapters because of how poorly the game told me on what i had to do.On the other hand the game is kinda boring ""unless if you like games like this"" the cutscenes are well done, and for the most part the voice acting is good. Sadly I really cant recommend this game unless its on sale because in a way the game gets you to kinda want to kill off the people in it other then your mother, your first victim, and the butler other then that the people you kill kinda had it coming.

												You play as the son of the Lucifer who goes on a killing spree while hiding in plain sight and make sure nobody suspects you in this game. Sounds fun, right?Sadly, no, this game isn't as fun as it sounds on theory.I really tried to like this game, I really did. But with mediocre story, boring puzzles, annoying music, confusing gameplay (you'll definitely need a walkthrough at some points) and not to mention the random glitches, I just cant make myself recommend this on a full price. Luckily this goes on sale/giveaway every so often so if you still feel like giving it a try, get it then.			"

												Just not fun. Its almost like a puzzle game, but it is made in a weird way that just doesn't work at all. It's a cool theme, being the spawn of satan, trying to kill random people without being suspected or worse, cought red-handed, but it's just so difficult to play. I think there's a second one, so I would look that one up. Probably fixed a lot of bugs and functionality.			"

												I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said ""click this, put this here, someone dies"", and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.			"

												I have a lot of hours recorded in this game. On this, on other (old) accounts. Why? Because it is simply amazing. I can do many things in it. Actually this is game where little kid Lucius, one sadistic little manipulative being is loved :3 (illuminati xD) This is a fun dark game, thats build on evil. When stuck in tasks, you have to think. That's also great thing, cuz u are helping ur brain. In this game, you also learn a lot of things. The voice acting is not that good, so i think it's about 8/10. Voice acting and lipsync often failes.With fun, this is also one ""MORBID"" game. Most of the time, you have no idea what to do 'cuz there is no hints where to go.Huuuge house sometimes becomes boring, when u have to wander around it over and over.Can't kill how u wants.Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !

												I really wanted to like this game. Everything about it made me believe I would like this game. But that just isn't the case. Slow dialogue, SUPER floaty controls, failstates that kick you back to the beginning of missions (which might be fine, except that due to the other faults, getting back to where you were is a task in patience), and a single piece of music looped over and over throughout the game. Everyone applauds playing the evil character, which is a cool idea, but I wonder if they played the same game I did. Because a cool idea that then results in a crap game, is still a crap game.			"

												More like explore the mansion simulator,a real mediocore game,could be better if the house wasnt so ♥♥♥♥ing big.Pros:- 9,99$ for this game is worth it.

DAFUQ AM I SUPOSED TO DO HERE -LUCIOUS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-BORING CHARACTERS!-THIS ISNT A HOUSE BUT A ♥♥♥♥ING MAZE-CONTROLS SUPPORT SO ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL-WHAT AM I SUPOSED TO DO WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEMON POWERS THEY HAVE NO USE AT ALL!Conclusion:But either way It's a nice game,but avoid this♥♥♥♥♥♥ 69/100 just because there is a nude scene  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and It's nice for a chil after playing all those FPS and head exploding games.

Despite the bugs, which can be really infuriating sometimes; this game is a gem of sorts. Head chopping, sending a nail through the face, burning a man alive... These are some of the ways of murder you will experience, which can be really satisfying. This game is gem, i hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.			"

												Ok, seriously: JUST LOOK AT THAT KID! If you would ever see a kid like this one, would you even get close to it? Of course not! Then why all these stupid people keep living in the same house with him? :P Anyway, the game is nice and, well, funny at some moments. It's difficult to do some missions, because you have to search the whole house to find a solution, but that's what makes the game nice and challenging. To be honest, I got it for free, but I would gladly pay a small amount of money to get it. By the way, it contains some very cruel scenes and it's about the devil, so avoid this game if you are still a small child, because, you know, it's PEGI 18. ;)			"

												To all atheists, and agnostics, this is actually a fun game. It would remind you of the Hitman series if you're familiar with it. The controls are a bit clunky, and the graphics are not bad per se, but the gameplay's nice. I wouldn't consider it a ""fun"" game, though. There's no replayability, except when you want to get all the achievements. So, technically, the interesting aspect of this game is its story. The death scenes of your targets are fun to watch, though. Overall, it's a good game, not great, not bad. Just good. Also, there are not many games that focus more on Satanic references and all, so this is one of the good ones.To all devoted Christians, nothing to see here. Move along.			"

												Do not buy this game. Trust me, it is not worth the 20 dollars. Only buy this game if it's extremely cheap on sale or you really wamt to play it for yourself. Even then, you will only be provided slight entertainment. You've been warned, I'm not entirely sure why this game has such high praise.			"

												More like explore the mansion simulator,a real mediocore game,could be better if the house wasnt so ♥♥♥♥ing big.Pros:- 9,99$ for this game is worth it. But you should wait for a sale more like for 1.49$ or something- 20+ Hours if you explore look for secrets and simply have fun with the mansion-Creative ways to kill-Lots of details-Nicely optimized-AI is kinda good...-You're a ♥♥♥♥ing demon and a son of Lucifer how cool is that?!Cons:-IN THIS EPISODE OF WAT!

												I really wanted to like this game. Everything about it made me believe I would like this game. But that just isn't the case. Slow dialogue, SUPER floaty controls, failstates that kick you back to the beginning of missions (which might be fine, except that due to the other faults, getting back to where you were is a task in patience), and a single piece of music looped over and over throughout the game. Everyone applauds playing the evil character, which is a cool idea, but I wonder if they played the same game I did. Because a cool idea that then results in a crap game, is still a crap game.			"

												Wish to kill your household members in a gruesome way? If yes, this the game for you. It can be whip to get your brains whacked up to think and plot your murder. Despite the bugs, which can be really infuriating sometimes; this game is a gem of sorts. Head chopping, sending a nail through the face, burning a man alive... These are some of the ways of murder you will experience, which can be really satisfying. This game is gem, i hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.			"

												Cool concept. A point and click adventure game where you are the child of Lucifier sent to destroy everyone in your mansion. However, it isn't executed all that well. There is only one way to solve puzzles that require specific items and actions which are far too unclear. Also a lot of the time the game becomes ""click the correct pixel"". AI is also basically nonexistent. NPCs only walk along predefined paths and constantly get stuck.			"

												When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced > Conflict Arises > Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy > Oddball Makes Friends > Oddball Gives Up > Friends Rescue Oddball > Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, ""BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!"" Adam Sandler's all like ""This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?"" Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like ""I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol"" but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a ♥♥♥♥♥.In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.8/10 Needs more Adrian.

There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to  solve the puzzles.My personal score: 6/10.Recomended if on sale under $10. "

												Welcome to another edition of ""A Gamer's opinion"", Where I tackle the over 300 titles in my library and sort the♥♥♥♥♥♥from the shiny:Lucius is an interesting title, it feels like an ode to ""The Omen"" series of novels/movies. The game puts you in the shoes of a young boy named Lucius whom is the son of satan or a very powerful demon at the very least. With powers including Levitation and Pyrokinesis (controlling fire), the game revolves primarily around quietly plotting the demise of your entire family and anyone connected to them (from the handyman and gardner to your parents).Pros:Very creative, and not enough titles portray the villain winning.Puzzles require a little thinking.You are rewarded for keeping in role (masking your intentions) by getting various items that help you throughout the game.Cons:The games extremely shortThe last open opponents you have are EXTREMELY difficult to the point of near infuriating if you don't know what your doingVery little replay value (except to watch the gruesome deaths everyone suffers)Conclusion: I'd give this game a 6.5/10, I'd be certainly interested to see a sequel however of an older Lucius continuing his father's agenda.

												Title: ""Lucius""Developer(s)/publisher(s): Shiver GamesLace Mamba GlobalGenre(s): Survival horror, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Lucius, released in October 2012, is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global for Microsoft Windows. It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Gameplay: Lucius is played from a third-person perspective. The player takes on the role of a six-year-old boy named Lucius Dante, who is the son of the Devil - the Anti-christ Lucifer. The player's main mission is to somehow kill all the inhabitants of the big manor (Dante manor) where Lucius and his parents live, giving his father the devil the required amount of souls for him to return to the world of mortals. This is done by orchestrating different kinds of plots and traps, causing the specified people to die and the killings to look like deadly accidents. The goal of the game is to rid the household of all it's inhabitants, which usually is done one murder per story chapter. To help kill the targets, the player has some different supernatural abilities - these include Telekinesis (manipulating items and objects by mere thought), Pyrokinesis (igniting fires and shooting fire balls) and Mind control. Lucius must also not get caught doing something strange and/or suspicious, and must act like a normal six-year-old boy. Getting seen results in an alert saying ""Caught!"". After this, the player has a few seconds to wipe the mind of the person who saw them, using the Mind Control-ability. Failing to do this in time results in losing the game and having to restart by the nearest checkpoint. Lucius can walk/run around relatively freely in the manor and garden, although some areas are locked until further story progress is achieved. Spread around the house are many Christian crosses (the family must be very religious, considering the number of crosses!). These crosses have a negative effect on Lucius, as he can't use his powers near them. This is solved by turning the crosses upside-down. By performing some small side-missions like taking out the trash or sort laundry, the player keeps up the appearance of a being a good boy and will also unlock some bonus gifts - including a tricycle which makes navigation of the manor a lot faster. The player has an inventory where usefull objects found in the manor are stored for later use. Objects are usually used by clicking on them and then clicking on the place where they are supposed to be used. There is also a map, for easier navigation of the big building. Story: When Lucius was born on the date of June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His childhood, spent in the luxurious manor on the private estate of his father, a U.S. Senator, was as normal as every kid's young years, excluding the extreme wealth of his parents. The night before Lucius turns six, the Devil appears in his mind and identifies himself as Lucius' ""real father"". The Devil tasks his son with aiding the powers of evil in killing all members of the manor, collecting their souls to help the Devil get stronger. Lucius kicks off this evil masterplan by murdering every member of his household, including staff, in order to obtain his father's vast fortune and make use of the political power associated with his name. The more people he kills, the more powerful Lucius will become. A police detective is investigating all the strange deaths and gets more and more baffled and confused by each strange death. As the police gets closer and closer to discovering the dark truth, Lucius must harvest the remaining souls of the manor and keep his true nature hidden, before he is revealed... My opinions: My thoughts when I first saw this game was ""Is this a game-version of ""The Omen...?"". And that thought may not have been so strange. Although Lucius has no confirmed connection to it, the game reminds a lot of the 1976 classic horror-film ""The Omen"". It has borrowed most of the main plot outlines: 1. Both works tell the story about a cursed boy who turns out to be the son of the Devil. 2. Both works feature a rich and socially esteemed couple with one child, living in a manor. 3. In both works, the boy in question has supernatural powers and uses them to kill people or cause problems in general. With this said, I don't want to risk sounding negative; I love The Omen and thus liked this game for the similar story. Although this game has its flaws (minor bugs/glitches and bad voice-acting), my overall experience was positive. Although basing most of it's story and gameplay around a 40 year old movie, the game felt like a fresh idea and something worth trying out. This turned out to be true, although I felt that the game was a tad short and could have had a deeper story. Also, for being a horror game, I didn't find it particularly scary. The characters and events were pretty boring, and not very surprising, but the ominous musical score created a fitting sense of dread and succeeded in making some parts of the story quite creepy. Especially sneaking around in the manor at night, with rain pouring down outside and thunder roaring felt really good. I will recommend this game to fans of The Omen and fans of Horror-games. Even though they lack any sort of official connection, I would also recommend watching The Omen before playing the game. The stories are entirely different, so you won't have any spoilers by watching the movie first. :)			"

												Welcome to another edition of ""A Gamer's opinion"", Where I tackle the over 300 titles in my library and sort the♥♥♥♥♥♥from the shiny:Lucius is an interesting title, it feels like an ode to ""The Omen"" series of novels/movies. The game puts you in the shoes of a young boy named Lucius whom is the son of satan or a very powerful demon at the very least. With powers including Levitation and Pyrokinesis (controlling fire), the game revolves primarily around quietly plotting the demise of your entire family and anyone connected to them (from the handyman and gardner to your parents).Pros:Very creative, and not enough titles portray the villain winning.Puzzles require a little thinking.You are rewarded for keeping in role (masking your intentions) by getting various items that help you throughout the game.Cons:The games extremely shortThe last open opponents you have are EXTREMELY difficult to the point of near infuriating if you don't know what your doingVery little replay value (except to watch the gruesome deaths everyone suffers)Conclusion: I'd give this game a 6.5/10, I'd be certainly interested to see a sequel however of an older Lucius continuing his father's agenda.

												Title: ""Lucius""Developer(s)/publisher(s): Shiver GamesLace Mamba GlobalGenre(s): Survival horror, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Lucius, released in October 2012, is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global for Microsoft Windows. It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Gameplay: Lucius is played from a third-person perspective. The player takes on the role of a six-year-old boy named Lucius Dante, who is the son of the Devil - the Anti-christ Lucifer. The player's main mission is to somehow kill all the inhabitants of the big manor (Dante manor) where Lucius and his parents live, giving his father the devil the required amount of souls for him to return to the world of mortals. This is done by orchestrating different kinds of plots and traps, causing the specified people to die and the killings to look like deadly accidents. The goal of the game is to rid the household of all it's inhabitants, which usually is done one murder per story chapter. To help kill the targets, the player has some different supernatural abilities - these include Telekinesis (manipulating items and objects by mere thought), Pyrokinesis (igniting fires and shooting fire balls) and Mind control. Lucius must also not get caught doing something strange and/or suspicious, and must act like a normal six-year-old boy. Getting seen results in an alert saying ""Caught!"". After this, the player has a few seconds to wipe the mind of the person who saw them, using the Mind Control-ability. Failing to do this in time results in losing the game and having to restart by the nearest checkpoint. Lucius can walk/run around relatively freely in the manor and garden, although some areas are locked until further story progress is achieved. Spread around the house are many Christian crosses (the family must be very religious, considering the number of crosses!). These crosses have a negative effect on Lucius, as he can't use his powers near them. This is solved by turning the crosses upside-down. By performing some small side-missions like taking out the trash or sort laundry, the player keeps up the appearance of a being a good boy and will also unlock some bonus gifts - including a tricycle which makes navigation of the manor a lot faster. The player has an inventory where usefull objects found in the manor are stored for later use. Objects are usually used by clicking on them and then clicking on the place where they are supposed to be used. There is also a map, for easier navigation of the big building. Story: When Lucius was born on the date of June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His childhood, spent in the luxurious manor on the private estate of his father, a U.S. Senator, was as normal as every kid's young years, excluding the extreme wealth of his parents. The night before Lucius turns six, the Devil appears in his mind and identifies himself as Lucius' ""real father"". The Devil tasks his son with aiding the powers of evil in killing all members of the manor, collecting their souls to help the Devil get stronger. Lucius kicks off this evil masterplan by murdering every member of his household, including staff, in order to obtain his father's vast fortune and make use of the political power associated with his name. The more people he kills, the more powerful Lucius will become. A police detective is investigating all the strange deaths and gets more and more baffled and confused by each strange death. As the police gets closer and closer to discovering the dark truth, Lucius must harvest the remaining souls of the manor and keep his true nature hidden, before he is revealed... My opinions: My thoughts when I first saw this game was ""Is this a game-version of ""The Omen...?"". And that thought may not have been so strange. Although Lucius has no confirmed connection to it, the game reminds a lot of the 1976 classic horror-film ""The Omen"". It has borrowed most of the main plot outlines: 1. Both works tell the story about a cursed boy who turns out to be the son of the Devil. 2. Both works feature a rich and socially esteemed couple with one child, living in a manor. 3. In both works, the boy in question has supernatural powers and uses them to kill people or cause problems in general. With this said, I don't want to risk sounding negative; I love The Omen and thus liked this game for the similar story. Although this game has its flaws (minor bugs/glitches and bad voice-acting), my overall experience was positive. Although basing most of it's story and gameplay around a 40 year old movie, the game felt like a fresh idea and something worth trying out. This turned out to be true, although I felt that the game was a tad short and could have had a deeper story. Also, for being a horror game, I didn't find it particularly scary. The characters and events were pretty boring, and not very surprising, but the ominous musical score created a fitting sense of dread and succeeded in making some parts of the story quite creepy. Especially sneaking around in the manor at night, with rain pouring down outside and thunder roaring felt really good. I will recommend this game to fans of The Omen and fans of Horror-games. Even though they lack any sort of official connection, I would also recommend watching The Omen before playing the game. The stories are entirely different, so you won't have any spoilers by watching the movie first. :)			"

												The premise for this game is pretty effing fantastic. You're the antichrist. Reborn into the child of a wealthy couple. Hellbent on doing the devil's bidding and fulfilling your prophecy as a killer, you set about racking up the numbers by offing kitchen staff and houseguests alike. Highly recommended to game collectors.			"

												If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game  story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the  game major source of fun which is killing. You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!			"

												I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant. In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.			"

												cant say I would like lucius. even with ultrahigh details, it doesnt even reach to same level with fallout 3 and that come out in 2008 so there is no excuse (since lucius come 2012, 4 years later) only thing it does is make loading time stretch forever, and there doesnt seem to be no excuse for it. does it make details look any better? cant really say it does, all the characters look exacly the same with ultrahigh and low detail, actually I think they look even BETTER with low detail. the house on the other hand becomes undetailed and bland, much of what can be expected, the effects come even worse. and still it dares to lag. not to mention how much it lags with ultradetails, that lag is through the roof.dishonored come out the same year and that game look damn awesome, it also work far bettereven when graphic settings were set as high as they go. so what is the excuse with this. WHAT IS THE EXCUSE! the game looks really really bad.also I dont think lucius is the only member in the family with satanic powers. since his parents and other members of the house can see through walls. I dont even know how many times I have failed sneaking mission because someone has seen me from even 3 rooms away. its not like they would hear you, you can run right behind them and they wont spot you. the only thing Iiked was the plot, but it has already been seen in movies before this. like Omen, and note that the movie come out in 2006. the game developers must have taken inspiration from that.

												Great idea, bad execution.The entire game feels really repetitive and gets boring after a couple hours. I have never really gotten into the story even though I have finished it. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.Pros:- Interesting ideaCons:- Limited gameplay. You have only one way to complete your mission even though there are a lots of possibilities that you can think of.- Bad voice acting. It is cringe worthy at times.- Frustrating hints. It's either a little hint per stage or no hints at all. I've spent quite a lot of time just running around the house trying to find something to progress further. Eventually I got bored and had to look up for a hints online.			"

												I am not impressed. It gets pretty boring and repetitive pretty fast. Including the idea is rather bland, simple minded, unoriginal, and many aspects of the game are very dull. Many of its ""missions"" have too little guidance and leaves too much for you to figure out on your own by some miracle. And there are also poor graphics which should not effect gameplay however in numerous occasions graphics glitches occur and materials often clip. There is alot that needed to be worked on in this game, it may  have some potential to be decent...somewhere in there, but I don't see it. I strongly recomend that you do not play this game. Honestly, this game should be free, there is absolutely no reason at all for it to be $ 9.99. If you were to pay one dollar for this, you would be paying two dollars too much.			"

												Lucius is an unpolished game with a unique setting. The game is totally linear and there is no freedom to try different things. It's no Hitman. It plays more like a point'n click game so there is absolutely no challenge at all once you know what to do. The puzzles were either very easy or just frustrating imo. I wouldn’t call any of them “challenging”.I ran into some bad AI interactions and minor bugs as well. The npcs repeated the same lines over and over again and they often spoke on top of each other. Towards the end it got annoying to hear Nancy (the main character’s mom) constantly ask you to do laundry when I had already completed the chore very early on. The game crashed a few times and one time I clipped through the staircase wall to the outside of the manor. I also ran into many minor flaws which made the game feel unpolished.Still, it was a somewhat enjoyable experience and worth the 1,89€ I paid for it. In my opinion you should only consider buying Lucius if it’s on big sale and the premise sounds interesting to you.			"

												Did you like Hitman? If answer is yes, then get Lucius. If answer is no, then bog off and go back to The Sims.Why is it similar to Hitman? Accident. The safest, the hardest, but the most sophisticated way to get rid of someone. Let no shadow of suspicion lay on you. The farther into the game, the more powers you possess and they stronger they become. Use your hiding skills, use items, use devilish powers to achieve what your ""Father"" tells you and don't get caught. Even if they find you, you still have a chance to escape. How? ""Father"" teaches you how to trick weak people to act according to your will (or rather His will).Anyway. You are Devil's disciple and you have to kill your targets. Area of your actions isn't big - it's a manor. 3 floors. Several people. Each must be killed in a specific way. Lucius is a very linear game. You can't choose targets and means to kill them. Your task is to figure out how to achieve this predicted result. You have the ""tools"", sometimes you have to find certain items, but in general you have to play in a specific way to set things (sometimes literally) in motion.Push them over railing. Kill them with an icicle. Burn them... and many others. Souls is what you need.Satan is your Master and you do what he says. Please him and bring him more souls.Graphics is fine. Sound is fine. Music is nice. Location is ok (a bit empty at times). Mechanics is simple. Story is good. Pacing is ok.So what's wrong with this game? Very linear. Little replay value. Simplicity. As with every game you expect to play it more that one time or at least offer something more on another playthrough.That's not happening. My suggestion is to treat Lucius like and point and click adventure game (just this time happening from 3rd person perspective). Those don't allow second playthrough as they serve all they got in first playthrough. Try to figure out puzzles on your own. If you like stealth, puzzle and adventure genres then Lucius is a good choice.It is a solid game overall, but nothing else.			"

												Lucius starts out promising, but completely fails to deliver any interesting gameplay. The entire game feels like a tutorial, holding your hand and slowly introducing new concepts on the way. Every ""puzzle"" is either incredibly obvious or makes no sense, but is either way handed to you.The various powers you are given are only useful in very specific situations and sometimes plain don't work since the puzzle does not call for them.All in all, highly disappointing from something so promising.

												Unlike real games, Lucius gives you almost no hints. It's a 3rd person game where you use your powers to murder people as you play as the son of the devil. More people you kill, the more your power grows in the story. The first time is a tutorial and basically tells you how to kill the first person and you're told each and every new target you get a hint in the jurnal. The hint is invisible to me or doesn't give me much of a suggestion. I was meant to kill some guy who smoked, ok. I realised damaging the gas on the cooker would be the point, however I had no idea how to make him go into the kitchen and light up.A very interesting idea, but it falls flat and the arm animation on the characters seem a little...off.

												I was not happy with my old review, so I am making another one.Lucius is a bad game.Lucius is a VERY bad game.In Lucius, your objective is to kill a specific target without being caught, Like in Hitman. However, in Lucius you are given no choice as to how to kill your target. There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine.What also sucks is how you never get to ""experiment"" to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying ""GAME OVER"" we all love. It is also a buggy mess,  ive had to repeat levels numerous times because a bug occured making the level unbeatable. Dont waste your time or money.			"

												Great concept, graphics for a game like this it's okay. You are Lucius, a little boy and a killer. It's like (Hitboy) ;) and movies like ""The Omen""You can open every drawer and cabinet, turn on/off every light. You can unlock 5 specials like telekinesis. You have an inventory and you can combine stuff. People talk to you and if you listen you can get infos about your next kill. If you finishes a job you get a final sequence with your kill which is mostly very violently and brutal bloody. Not for kids... but with kids. XD -Points for too lineary story. Every kill has only 1 solution. Find this solution is sometimes really hard. You have to check out the big house for every little piece you maybe need. Try everything and you will find your way.Another -Point for the ending. 1st it was terrible hard, 2nd it was harder if you dont know what to do and 3rd, it was too short. Final Fight and immediatly Credits.Price is ok and i was entertained.  7/10			"

												If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.			"

												This game lacks absolutely on being funny.The big problem here is that you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA of what to do and you find yourself wandering like an idiot in the house.Which is, as you may argue, NOT funny.The game lacks totally on giving informations about itself and about how to acomplish on tasks...Decent graphics, meh for the voice acting, definitely boring.Don't buy.

												I know this game is a good game. Sadly it just has really bad optimisation my laptop is not that strong but it can run GTA 5 on medium so I don't know why this game has such horrible fps even though I set it to medium and resolution to 1280 x 720. It still ran at a measly 55-ish fps. I know it's playable but I really didn't think such an old game can run at that much fps.			"

												To be very blunt, this game was not what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting a sand box-y style horror game where I would be given mission(s) and could choose to fulfill them however I wanted, what I soon discovered was that this is more of a point and click adventure game, where they expect you to follow very specific rules and paths in the game. On top of that, the graphics suck, they are kind of outdated, like Grandtheft Auto 3 graphics and even on good hardware seem to have issues with frame rates. Quite frankly, it's a massive disappointment.It would have been amazing if I could go about killing the people in the house, how I wanted, with multiple endings and murders, but that just isn't what this game is like. What's even more annoying is at the start of each mission, they usually give very, very vague hints and that's about it. I don't expect a puzzle to be handed to me, but when all you give me is like, ""I don't like this person"" and that's it, it can become incredibly difficult.The AI is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to say the least. During the tutorial the characters mother spent the entire time simply walking up against a locked door watching me do the entire thing without saying a word. it's not even remotely close to a ""open world"" when not only are rooms locked off if you have no buisness being in them, but there are extremely specific guidelines for each mission you have to follow. If this were an open world, I should be able to kill the people, howeverr I want and this simply isn't true. In short, a friend bought this game for me for Christmas and I am so very glad I didn't spend money on it, it's a waste of time and money. I feel bad my friend wasted money on this title. The developers had a real award winning idea here and they just wasted it with lazy design and production.			"

												Not bad at all, but a bit disappointing at the same time.I must admit that I was never that big fan of Omen movies, but I know them quite well, which made me wondering if this game will try to replicate and refer to it, as the main character, place, and story seems quite, well, familiar for everyone who watched Omen. As for the story - it's simple, slowly progressing as you make your next kills. Not much to say about it - probably could be a bit better seeing that all adults seem really clueless. But oh, this is the part of the fun.Graphics and music are also okay - I wasn't experiencing any sudden drop rates or weird rendering bugs - it's alright. I don't pay much of attention to graphics as long as they are fine-tuned. Animations and cutscenes are good, but the fact that little Lucius is keeping his poker face all the time is weird, or scary either. As for music, I wouldn't expect more. the single track that keeps repeating in the background while playing is matching game's atmosphere.IBut as for gameplay. Eh, here we go. The game itself isn't that sophisticated, I would call it fairly easy, but...Yeah. I've been playing adventure games for quite a long time but Lucius left me annoyed at times. Looking for a small, few pixels big object to break, or item to pick up isn't the way. And this brings up another topic. There's only one way to complete game. Everyone's way to hell is planned by developers and you need to follow it. No exceptions. You can't lit on fire a cute lady that is supposed to be poisoned. You can't shoot her in the face and then mind control the cop who caught you into committing suicide with the same gun. For obvious reasons - this isn't a sandbox game and any non-linear deaths would cause the whole scripted story-line to collapse. As for the length of the game - took me around eight hours to complete. Could be better. Why aren't people trying anymore?There are some bugs, some of them causing the game to crash (picking up dad's ammunition for the second time).I know that Lucius 2 is around the corner and it's promised to be the different game, making up for some of its precursor mistakes. We shall see.6/10 - Original game concept, but disappointing gameplay.+ Game concept, because there's nothing better than killing your family members on cold, winter night.+ Game length. Of course, another hour or two wouldn't be bad.+ Heh, son of satan.- Too linear.- Some annoying gameplay stuff.			"

												I just spent the last 6 hours playing through this insane game - and I loved every minute of it! As the classic narrative goes (closest resemblance here is Rosemary's Baby), Satan is invoked to claim a child as his offspring - that  would be our protagonist Lucius. He then continues to teach the boy in the sick ways of doing his bidding - the player takes over this role then. There is a total of 18 chapters and each contains a mission to creatively murder one or several people in a way that pleases his Dark Lordship, all while avoiding any suspicion and planting false clues and evidence. Technically this game is well done. The graphics will certainly not win any prices, especially the textures of the surroundings, but on the other hand, the effects look good and the characters show a variety of body language, facial expressions and are lip-synced. The gamneplay/controls and what little menu (inventory) you need are smooth and fine as they are. I especially liked the audio: a variety of atmospheric music (and the annoying music on the tape that you will sooner or later hand to the driver - which is meant to be that way :D ) and good voice actors.Overall, this game is unique: it's sadistic, dark and twisted, sometimes even humorous (depends on your kind of humor of course ;) ). The kill sequences, that crown your triumph at the end of each chapter, are a bizarre and wonderfully gruesome mix of sensation and childlike wonder - in the way children sometimes enjoy litting ants on fire and the like. An always fascinating and gripping ride from start to finish. 85% in my book.			"

												The game was pretty, engaging & overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, & exploring is a bunch of fun. My experience:Personally I love exploring, & I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, & get confused with the items & places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up & I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon. Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.Recommendations:Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, & look around the rooms to find all the items & hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, & it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely & u will do great.			"

												Lucius is one of those games that tries to present itself as new and unique, but it's really just a point-and-click adventure game delivered in a ""horror"" RPG package. There are some parts of this game that try too hard to be edgy or shocking, such as the couple (unnecessary) sequences of low-censored nudity and sex.Chapter after chapter is just a simple ""Use item X with location Y until Success"" puzzle. Most of these are adequately explained or hinted at, but you will have one or two that are so ridiculous and make no sense that using a walkthrough is almost a requirement. Occasionally you will have a time restraint, but these chapters are rare. Each chapter details an individual murder of someone living/working in your mansion, usually by some bizarre and unnecessarily complicated chain of events (well, the difficulty has to increase somehow).This game is technically ""open world"", with the player having access to the entire mansion soon after the first several chapters. Regardless of where you go, each murder has to take place in the same location with the same objects, and it is typically set up that you don't need to wander too far to find key pieces of the murder.Lucius is a puzzle game for those who like a little bit of a challenge, or for those that harbor an unsafe anger for childhood authority figures.

												Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution. Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.			"

												Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that!Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words.The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target.Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out. I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.			"

												Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The ""puzzling"" consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).			"

												Great idea, sub-par execution.Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime ""achievements"" to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box ""hitman""-esque game.Perhaps the devil really is in the details?			"

												Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20.  It is exactly what it says it is.  A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist.  Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment.  Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances.  One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing.  You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices.  This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way).  I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items.  When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it.  All in all a fun experience.  There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses).  Great value for the price I paid.  If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game.  Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people.  Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.			"

												If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10			"

												I've played this game for only a short time, but I've found the experience to be long and drawn out.  The system doesn't give you any way of assistance of navigating this confusing place, that is the Dante Manor.  If you had a more defined area to explore and search in, the pace would have been much faster and would have made for a much more novel game.  But as it stands, the game is fraught with small irrtations without relief.  The only source to find a way forward with the quests is to access walk throughs online.			"

												Lucius is a third person game where you take control of a young boy called Lucius. Satan himself visits his bedroom and commands him to become a serial killer. This game reminded me a lot of the movie the omen.+ graphics are nothing special, but get the work done+ every killing gets you a short cutscene+ big map+ the victims don't feel like random redshirts with no names+ great in-between cutscenes- very linear. there is always only one way to do things- game is very unclear what you have to do. I often used guides since I didn't bother- there isn't really an ending- clunky controls- the game is fairly short. I used guides often though- best thing about this game are the cutscenes. the gameplay is pretty annoying you put up with to see the short videos.This game has huge potential, but since there is always only one way to finish each chapter the game falls short. It's much easier to read guides than to waste your time by searching random little objects on the huge map. The cutscenes are worth experiencing the game. But since the gameplay is so irritating, you could honestly just watch a walkthrough on youtube.If you are still interested in the game, get it on a sale.Replay value: very low (too linear, gameplay is not fun, great cutscenes)Rating: 6/10 (not bad per se, but you won't miss anything if you don't play it)Recommendation: No			"

												While very linear and clunky at times, I found this game enjoyable and played it right through to the end despite being very frustrated with it on more than one occasion.  Something about the game made me want to keep on playing, even though it appears unpolished with more than its fair share of bugs. There is something of a charm to this game, the clunky character animations and bad voice acting often made me smile and reminded me of older generation games where things were more basic, so it gave me quite a nostalgic feel.It's a nice idea for a game (depsite the story being obviously copied from The Omen film!), you must play as Lucius, a young boy who is on a mission to reap souls for Lucifer.  To accomplish this, you must guide him around the house, killing 1 person at a time in a variety of creative (and sometimes ridiculous) ways, as another reviewer said, however unrealistic some of the kills are, they always make some sort of logical sense, so you don't feel too cheated if you have been stuck for a while and then accidentally discover the solution. Some of the kills do raise a smile with their creativity!Wait for the mission where you have to catch your uncle in a compromising position with one of the servants - I did laugh out loud when I opened the door!While the game is fully third person free roaming, it is very remeniscent of point and click games of old - 'combine object A with object B and use with interactive object C' etc, so you are very restricted in what you can do and must follow a set order of actions.There are several design issues with the game - often you come across objects that are meant for a mission later on in the game, you try to use them, thinking they are for the current mission, nothing happens so you discount them, only to find out later on in the game you can interact with them, but only when you are meant to.  I feel such objects should not  be accessible at all until they are needed or if they are, there needs to be some explanation for why you cannot use it, or even a 'I don't need this at this time' piece of text.The save system saves the game at the start of each mission stage, but also saves all sub-mission info done after that point.  As a result of this, you often end up with objects in your inventory that you have already used - eg. if you begin a mission, complete one of your chores, then quit out.  When you restart, the chore will already be complete but the character who asked you to do the chore will begin asking you again and the chore item is back in its place. This doesn't break anything, but could be confusing.I did encounter multiple crashes during the first stage of the boss battle at the end, I did however manage to get round it by rushing through once I had worked out how to beat him, still - there seems to be an issue there.To summarise - despite its shortcomings, this is a very enjoyable game and will raise more than a smile or two with its quirk and charm, if you are a fan of point and click - you should find this to your liking.

												A fun little game that I finished in (more or less) one 6-hour sitting. This game has as much jank as it has charm, and while being very linier, the puzzles are mostly stright forward (I resorted to a guide 2-3 times for specific moments, usually when there was a very specific spot you needed to interact with) and the murder animations are incredibly brutal, for the most part.The stealth sections are garbage, as are the 'fight' sections, but these are both in the minority. Acheivements are dolled out fairly generously to begin with, but there is a 40-hour playtime acheivement which, as I already mentioned I finished the game in 6, will require me to leave the game running on its own for quite some time.All in all, I recommend this game because it was fun and had enough content to keep me occupied and engaged for the entire time, which is more than can be said for titles like Assasin's Creed. Get this game, but get it on a sale, because as enjoyable as it was, it wasn't without its hiccups 'and' was completed in one sitting, so value that how you will.			"

												Decent gameplay and an interesting storyline, but vague puzzles, abilities being a bit confusing, and bad graphics bring the game down. 7/10. Still worth a try.Gameplay: The gameplay worked out well and fit the game's theme. You had to pick up things and use powers while appearing to be a normal non suspicious child. If someone saw you with a gun, or psychically moving things around, you'd lose the level and have to start over. There were also side quests (or chores) you could do to get extra rewards to help you solve the levels. A weegie board to give riddle tips, a music box that gave limited use to see useful items around, but the last was a tricycle which was akward to maneuver through the halls and wasn't really worth getting.Storyline: The storyline is well written and you can see bits of it happening while you walk around mid level. The characters all talk to you and will make comments about what all is happening which helped to expand the story. Add onto it the narrator explaining what all he saw going on and the connections he made after all was said and done being excellent really made the game worth while.Puzzles: Not really sure they are puzzles, but the levels had you do a series of tasks you had to figure out to get someone killed. The first few levels were easy enough to figure out how to do them, the narrator explaining that something was learned from that death that was important for you to use during it. The later levels became overly vague on what you were doing, one of the levels being explained with ""She is doing laundry."" If you followed her around, she walked between a few places but you had to break something on the other side of the room to be able to kill her.Abilities: As the game progresses, you get new powers. These powers level up as you get kills. There is no choice on what ability you level, nor is there an explanation of what these levels do. As far as I could tell, it was tracking progress through the game more than anything. To make things a little more complicated, some levels would start off with a tutorial on how to use an ability, then the level would prevent you from using it. The last ability even being removed from your ability choices after you get it. Though this was oddly done, each ability did get use at some point.Graphics: Blocky and weird. I don't mind blocky graphics, aslong as I can tell what everything is, but a character would pick up an item in a video sequence and the object would move seperately from their hand. A little bit of effort would be appreciated in that, if it was part of gameplay and the other characters moved things around I could understand, but it was a predone video.I had to look up walkthroughs for a few levels which frustrated me that the levels were too vague, but that could just be me. The graphics were still irelivant to my enjoyment and the abilities were easy enough to figure out the limits on my own.			"

First playthrough time: 5 hoursMajor Pros:Gruesomely murder everyoneYou can go back to previous chapters, including replaying the last chapter to get either of the two endingsSuitable amount of hints from a variety of sources (NPC conversations, journal, ""gifts"", intro dialog for each chapter, etc.)Minor Pros:Peep on ""adult"" behaviorIf you shoot someone, their ragdoll flies around the roomMajor Cons:Story is a little unbelievable, even for a ""son of Satan"" themed gameThe game doesn't do enough to create an appropriate mood for the playerSpells can be really hard to manipulate and the limits to your range aren't clearMinor Cons:Characters have no facial expressionLayout of the house can be confusing and it's not clear which of the servants' quarters are whoseSome of the Steam achievements didn't trigger for meI didn't find the story or characters to be all that indepth, but I did still enjoy the game. The first two ""gifts"" you get for doing chores can give you hints for each of your puzzles and most levels give you ample time to figure them out. The puzzles (murders) are all about the same length, four entries in your journal, though some take longer and more walking than others. While the story was sterotypical, I did like the mother's slow descent into insanity, which was one of the few character progressions. Figuring out each murder while not getting caught was pretty interesting, and none of the spell usage was too out there. While it's no masterpiece, I still want to recommend it to all the devilish little gamers out there who would enjoy smash expensive china, peeping on adult ""playtime"", stalking around in the dark, setting things on fire, and (of course) graphically butchering the 20 or so occupants of the house as a 6 year old boy with demonic powers.

Some of the puzzles are difficult simply because the world is big enough and interactive enough that it can take a while to find the right objects for your mission. I did expect the game to be scary, but even though it wasn't..it didn't really take away from my opinion of the game. The game does show the kills in detail, so if you don't like gore (even if it is mild gore)...you may want to reconsider. The images aren't that bad, but you will get visuals of people being cut in half and whatnot. My only objection is that the end level glitched and I wasn't able to finish the game. Even after checking a walkthrough to make sure I knew what I was doing, I was unable to complete it. The end level has two options - straight up just killing the people or figuring out a puzzle version. It is very frustrating because it is timed and you have a limited amount of space for moving. Kept clipping into a wall and just got my *** beat over and over. Other than that, definitely a good game and worth checking out.			"

												Lucius, The game I have heard its concept and plot from RPS. I admit I do quite interesting to see it by myself. 'Playing as a son of Satan with a power of demon to obliterate the house by a mean of ""Antic""' means. And the result?Pro+ Good soundtrack+Quite an OK voice cast+Interesting plot and story+Good conceptCon- Bad excution on say concept- The puzzle was too linear consider the potential it could offer- Stutter and glitchy graphic- Broken in game objects and glitcy still-Ugly graphic, especially near the end.    It could be a good game, But I still wouldn't reccomened to anyone. Not even to a hardcore puzzle or point ande clicking game as well.			"

												I thought this game was rad, it lived up to my expectations 100%.This game has an awesome cinematic feel, and the visuals are pretty damn good. The voice acting is lackluster at most points, but there's occasionally a shred of real emotion and that's pretty nice. The puzzles are pretty neat too, there's a lot of forshadowing (whether on purpose or not) due to being able to see what you can use your abilities on, so it's pretty satisfying to finally use something you've had in your inventory for a while, Although it can be a pretty big boner to realize you need to go find an item you should have already come across. A couple of the puzzles seemed pretty obtuse and confusing, but I get that way with most games like this so that might be just me THANKFULLY the game offers a pretty basic hint thingy which is optional so you don't have to deal with spoiled answers! The only reaaaaaal downsides I have to say are that there are definitely some glitches. I've been launched through the stairs quite a few times and while it's hilarious it's also inconvenient, but I don't remember having any gamebreaking bugs or anything. Also for being sort of presented as a sandbox, the game is linear as hell and there's no room for variation which kinda sucks but it's still fun figuring out all the prebuilt sequences. Thankfully I hear the sequel is truly openended and has traps and such so heyyyyyyyyyyyyyI'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GOOD AND I WANT MORE			"

Lucius... aka Antichrist Simulator from Damien Thorn, in The Omen (1976) movie.The game itself plays a lot like the Hitman series, minus the shooting aspect. Like the game name says, you play as Lucius, a 6 years old (midway in the game, you get 7!) who was fortunate enough to had been born in a satanic invocation. It doesn't take long to go around, learn the basics and then, get on with it on your murder list!There isn't much to be said about this game, concerning the story and gameplay. It gets the job done and honestly, I can't understand the gaming industry bashing this game. I liked it mostly for all its numerous faults and cons and it was satisfying enough to keep me interested and playing till the end (game is about 6 hours long).PROS:+Antichrist antihero (feels weird and cool at the same time! Be THE creepy kid with powers!).+Creepy, tensed and gory atmosphere during the murder scenes.+Game is challenging enough to keep you guess the next step although, you can always get a walkthrough guide to speed things up!+Lots of exploring to do in this huge mansion.CONS:-Some gameplay mechanics weren't responsive fast enough, especially during that Chapter 10 stealth mission. Patrolling grownups could see me even well hidden through walls and doors.-Straightforward linear killing list.-At some chapters startup, the game lacks direction as to where to go, what to do as you roam around the big mansion aimlessly. Quite irritating! Better read a walkthrough as I sure did around Chapter 5. Also, the map could use refinement!-The chores side quests are really worthless and only time sink. I suggest you simply ignore them... well the ones that you can as some could be mandatory, like that tape cassette for Micheal.-Save-game mechanic is atrocious. No quick-save, no auto save midway in a mission. You are forced to start a chapter and finish it so you can be sure the game saves your progress there.OVERALL:Faulty game but entertaining enough (to me though) to keep you playing until the showdown. Lucius felt exactly like ""The Omen"" simulator and it was a decent entry for this franchise. I do expect the sequel to surpass this game especially on the visual aspect as it is very lackluster (yes, game looks quite ugly), the gameplay mechanics and game direction with a better pathing on a reliable map.RECOMMENDATION:Loved The Omen movie and loves creepy adventure styles game? This game is for you! Just, wait for a decent deal before forking you dough in this game.RATING:666 / 666...6.66 / 10			"

												Lucius is a fantastic concept but it does fall short of the promise of it's early trailers. Playing any game as the antagonist, let alone the antichrist, is a tough balance to pull off as we need to be drawn into the character despite their actions. Unfortunately the gameplay is so linear with no real choice over who dies/how we are entirely alienated from the main character and their motivations. They are a silent cipher unquestioningly carrying out commands. Whilst this is not dissimilar to many point and clicks, guybrush threepwood had a personality that carried you through.There are other good factors about lucius such as clear intentioned level design and a dark humour that has great potential. These are not on their own redemptive enough and I would reccomend that you buy this game only in a sale or otherwise skip on to lucius 2.			"

												THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS, BUT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO MAKE EVERYTHING A SPOILER! Lucius is an outstanding game where you play as a 6 year old boy born on 6-6-1966. Somehow he is the son of Lucifer and notices him as his father, and thus he gains his demonic powers, which you will use to murder, and aid in sucicide, many people. Including your own parents! While you murder the people that goes along with the game story line, police, detectives, and everybody else will start to take cauction in the house. SO BE CAREFUL, and try not to get caught, This may be the only frustrating part of the game. So I would suggest a guide to help get items early to save time later, and  so you can understand your main objective. Also enjoy this marvelous game. 95.5/100 bananas :D			"

												This game is one of my favorites, now that I have played it, and completed it in about 9-10 hours. I got it when it was on sale before Lucius 2 came out, and I'm so glad it was on sale and I had found it. No regrets on buying it, but now that it's no longer on sale as of right now, anyone interested in getting the game at the normal price, don't question it, you won't regret it. Especially if you love to kill people for no real reason, creepy demonic stuff, and I do enjoy the most in this game, because some parts are a little confusing, trying to figure out exactly what to do [or how to kill the person] that it will put that person on a ""repeated"" schedule in the game until you figure out what you need to do, so you don't need to rush or panic that you can't figure it out for a while. I highly recommend!			"

												If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10			"

												Okay, well, I wanted to play this game to have fun, but all it was is a linear omen rip-off with stiff stereotypical characters and voice acting that did not match the characters blank expressions and stiff body language. I have play indie games where the characters were more life-like than this and offered more gameplay. I don't see how you really can just go on a demonic killing spree. You have to do things in order and kill people in order. You can shoot people, it might get you caught, but at least it might count towards the acheivment. You're limited of how and when to use your ""demonic powers"". It would have been nice for the game to have been environmentally interactive other than the mission ojective items so as the player break glass, create disturbances, and just cause mental havoc.I got this game on sale with a bunch of other games. After playing this game myself, it's not worth the $20 it's currently being sold for and find it's ridiculous. If one must get this game I suggest waiting for a big sale, maybe one that knocks it down to $7 or less, preferable $4. Good luck!Note: I came across this site while looking at the news page for Lucius. Even though it's a review for Lucius II, it may help alot on describing the game as based on someone else's experience much like my own and the expectations of the game and what was really delivered:  From RockPaperShotgun     http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/17/impressions-lucius-ii/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience.

												Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The ""puzzling"" consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).			"

												Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that!Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words.The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target.Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out. I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.			"

												(Spoiler Alerts) Ok so the game is fun but there are some huge freaking problems. My main one being: THAT CHAPTER 05B IS BROKEN! There you are, awake at night to get rat poison, and on your way to get it, your mom wakes up and you have to hide. Thats reasonable right? Except that once you go out of hiding when she walks downstairs, you can still somehow get spotted by her through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLOOR! Then once you get past that, you probably won't be beating that chapter, because you ave to break a light to distract a detective. You can break it and he walks into the darkness to see if someones there, so you should be able to enter the room, right? Nope, because the detective will turn and see you as soon as you make it within 2 feet of the door and SPOT YOU INSTANTLY!!! FIX THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥!! Other than that though, from what I've payed so far cuz I still can't beat chapter 05b, its fun and I reccomend it.			"

												good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is  when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says ""now, you don't need matches!"" immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.  when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up  pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of ""♥♥♥♥♥ hunters"" to my parents and housemates.

												ENI have honestly to say that I was following Lucius from a long time, but at one of the last sales I've been kinda let down by some bad reviews saying that the mansion was huge and you had to find little objects and made it sound like a pixel hunter game. Last monday I bought it tho, since it was very very cheap (less than 1€) and I saw that all the bad reviews were pretty wrong. Sure the mansion isn't small, but let me tell you that if you're a ""game explorer"" like me and love to go in every single place in games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim well this map will be a piece of cake and you'll learn it pretty fast.About the gameplay itself, yes there's no much freedom but it's kinda explained with the fact that the kills must look like accidents, but the puzzles ('cause after all it's a big puzzle game from a point of view, where you have to find out how to kill someone step by step) are never frustrating or absurds like in some point & click adventures.If I should point a flaw it'd be about the stealth sections 'cause more than real stealth they're just a series of trial and error until you learn the patterns of the NPCs, so while I understand the willing to vary the gameplay they've been implemented poorly unfortunately.So to wrap it up I'd suggest this game 'cause it's pretty good and entertaining, dunno honestly if at the full price it's back again (18.99€ here), 'cause while fun it's pretty short (about 6-7hrs, taking my time to explore, achievements, etc.)P.s.Yes I cheated my way through the 20/40hrs achievements 'cause there was no way I was gonna leave my PC on just for that, it'd be different if the game would take that time to finish obviously!ITDevo onestamente dire che stavo seguendo Lucius da un bel di tempo, ma ad una delle utlime svendite alcune recensioni che parlavano di una villa gigante dove dover cercare piccoli oggetti me l'han fatto sembrare un gioco stile ""pixel hunter"" e quindi ho desistito. Lo scorso Lunedì però l'ho comperato, dato che il buon sconto (meno di 1€) ed ho notato che le recensioni negative erano sbagliate. Certo la villa non è piccola, ma lasciatevi dire che se vi piace esplorare nei giochi come me ed amate andare in ogni singolo posto in giochi come Fallout 3 o Skyrim beh questa mappa sarà un gioco da ragazzi e l'imparerete velocemente.Riguardo al gameplay in sé, sì non c'è moltissima libertà ma è in parte spiegata dal fatto che le uccisioni devono sembrare incidenti, ma i puzzle (dato che alla fine è un grande puzzle game da un certo punto di vista, dove dovete capire come uccidere qualcuno passo passo) non sono mai frustranti od assurde come in alcune avventure punta&clicca..Se dovessi citare un difetto sarebbero le sezioni stealth perché più che un vero stealth sono solo una serie di prova e riprova finché non imparate il percorso dei PNG, quindi anche se capisco l'intenzione di variare il gameplay sono state implementate malamente sfortunatamente.Quindi per concludere suggerirei il gioco perché è buono e divertente, anche se non so onestamente se al prezzo pieno a cui è tornato (18.99€ qui), perché anche se divertente è abbstanza corto (circa 6-7hrs, prendendomi il tempo di esplorare, obbiettivi, etc.)P.s.Sì ho imbrogliato per ottenere l'obbiettivo delle 20/40 ore perché non avevo nessuna intenzione di lasciare il PC acceso solo per quello, sarebbe stato differente se il gioco avesse richiesto quel tempo per essere finito ovviamente!

												Lucius is a point and click story that takes place at the sprawling mass that is Dante Manor. Reminiscent of everyone's favourite little demon seed, Omen, you've got a lot of work to do for your infernal majesty. Dante Manor is a large place, especially for a young lad like Lucius. With a plethora of corridors and rooms, it can sometimes be confusing (it was for me, for many chapters until I learned it like the back of my hand) to get around. Thus, becoming lost within its many chambers and lobbies.Your objective; reap souls for your true father. Sounds easy enough, right? Each specific kill requires you to carry out specific actions with certain items and sequences which can sometimes leave you scratching your head as you go delving into every room within the Manor looking for the one thing you need. Despite this, every kill is well thought out and creative, making your toiling worth the while when you see your victims eviscerated.The atmosphere within Dante Manor is somewhat of a two-faced creature. On one hand, during the day, you have the grandeur of the estate. Accentuated by its gothic trimmings in the form of the sound track and formality. It seems calm - as if all is well. Contrast that to the way it carries itself at night. The despair drenched piano pieces, bleak ambience and the all too pervasive echoing of footsteps and doors being used really inflames the urgency to remain undetected or even be swallowed up by the Manor itself.The only thing I can really discredit Lucius for is its few glitches that will require you to do no more than restart a chapter, I.E. being swallowed up by the Manor's walls or an NPC misbehaving. Overall, a great game that'll have you scratching your head on occasion and will even have you laughing if you have a taste for the macabre, accompanied by a  fitting soundtrack. I'd definitely kill again.			"

												The game itself is nice: particular story and characters, the graphic is okay i guess, the mechanics are fine. There are some things that one could not love, like the ""ability"" of the tricycle of going down the stairs, and you don't have to get of the bike. Unfortunately if you are a completitionist like me you will be most disappointed when you will reach the end of the story and look at the achievements: even though the game itself will take 6-8 hours to complete, secondary objectives included, with no alternative choice for the kills on the main/story targets (so no repeatability at all), they want you to play 20 hours for an achievement and 40h for another. Well in a game with other ways to complete it, secondary objectives or extras its not a big deal, you would say. But no, sorry. None in here. And if you thought to do something else during these 40h you misunderstood.. You have to be in the game, no shortcuts.. Well, not a big fan..			"

Did you know there are two wine cellers? That drunk probably lost her earrings. And why do we have thirty rooms in this house? If we have that much freaking money just buy some more earrings!

												As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:LUCIUS:Lucius a game where you are a kid of a rich family, the son of Lucifer (your family doesnt know that, that is what makes the game exist), where you get orders from your father to bring him ""tributes"" by killing people. The thing is, nobody must find out who you really are nor what can you do, so, by using your mind and your powers you have to make every kill look like an ""accident"".Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.PROS:+Very good story.+Even if it isn't listed anywhere, it is an open world game, you can get almost anywhere in the house at any time of the game.+You can get a bunch of items in the inventory that can be usefull at any time.CONS:-The map is almost uselss, it has no explanation of the place nor your target. Needs too much thinking on finding out where to go.-The controls of the bike are bad, like trying to play a shooter game with a joystick bad.-The achievements are not a challenge at all, you can just do something, then replay it 4 times to get the achievemnt, doesnt matter if you get a Game Over.-The 40-hour achievent has no use at all, this a 8-13 hour game, you just have to leave the game running all night.TL;DR It is a good, not great, psychological horror game and has a good story.

												TL;DR: This game is honestly not that great. Took me 5 hours today to do the game entirely, including all the time I spent just running around the house trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do, which counts for most of it. For 20$, I would have expected more.Full review:Lucius isn't entirely bad, but it is far from great, and far from justifying the 20$ price.You start the game having only 1 power, which is telekinesis. There are a lot of items in the game that you can move and swing around, which is great, but there are two down sides to this: first, you are suspicious because of items floating in the air, while you are just standing there (but turning those crosses upside-down isn't). Second, it's pointless. You can move vases, cups, glasses, etc but it serves no purpose whatsoever.Second power you get is Mind Control, which is honestly not as great as it sounds. Just about everyone will be ""too strong"" to be affected, so the use that they say about ""mind controlling them so you can do what you want""... not so much. The only ones that can be affected are the people you need to kill, but only under some circumstances.Third is mind erase. Basically, if you get caught, you can wipe the person's memory, but once again, only in some circumstances. Caught at night walking around? Nope. Pretty much the only time it can be used is if you are caught swinging cups with your mind.Final power is an incinerate power. Sounds cool, yet again, just like the previous 2 powers, can only be used in some situations. In fact, I think there is only 2-3 of those, maybe 4. Not much.Aside from the powers, there are a lot of things that are lacking. I'm all up for a hard game, but at some point, give us some clues. One of the person to kill is the person taking care of the laundry (yes, that is ALL she does, for a family of 5 plus the workers). Only info you get is ""She takes care of the laundry"". That's it. You need to kill her in a way that won't incriminate you by only knowing she does the laundry (spoiler following) to in the end kill her in her bath.A lot of thing happens, or are said, that either doesn't make sense, or the characters are jumping to conclusion too fast. The more you advance in the game, the more those things are obvious. And yes, the following contains spoilers.---At first, there is a few things that bothers me, but it really starts with a confession from a cop to a priest:Cop: I've been having nightmares, terrible scenes playing in my head. And this family are the players.Priest: It sounds to be like this family needs help, my son.Priest: It sounds to me like the church should intervene.That is the exact text. What do they do? They try to contact the family to support them morally. Although it is ""helping the family, that is not an ""intervention"". Second, there is actually a scene where you are sleeping with your shoes on, and you get woken up by your grand-father that punches you in the balls. And no reaction about this last part, obviously. About the shoes, all the other nights you sleep with your slippers on.Third, you are told by your grandfather that your father and uncle never found the hidden door in the basement while playing there as kids... Really? They played there for years, in a room about 5m by 5m (max), with one of the walls being nothing more than a curtain and they never wondered what was on the other side? They never even noticed it?Fourth, a journalist that was unconscious, wakes up to you throwing a fireball at him. His first though? It is the reversed crosses on the walls that gives you your powers! Forget trying to run away from the 7 years old, fireball throwing kid here, let's instead try to put back those crosses in the right way.Fifth, your ""father"" finds a book about satan on your grandfather's desk. First conclusion? Your grandfather used a ritual to curse your family, and you are the source of that curse! Don't think that the grandfather, which was already sounding partially senile, could just have been weirder, or that all this is just stupid, noooo... ""It's the only logical explanation!"" (actual quote from the father)Those are only some of the points that I find illogical. There are many more.---As for the achievements... Most fit in one of two category: ""play the game"" or ""do useless stuff to get this"". Examples:Play 20/40 hours. With a 5 hours game, yes it will be hard, but not for the good reasons.Break X objects. Doesn't have any purpose, but you can get it!Get caught X times. Be rewarded for failing!Kill X persons. Basically, one per person that you NEED to kill. So 20 achievements right thereRun 26 miles. Yes I did get it. That's how much running in circle you do.Take 20 pictures. You only need to take one in the game, but if you click 19 more times...Finally, you would expect a horror game (or at least a game about satan and the antichrist) to have a dark atmosphere. Well, the only thing really dark about the game is the corridors, lacking lightning. All the murders are so cliche and msot are so predictable that the atmosphere it's trying to create just doesn't work.In conclusion, if the game was between 5-10$, it would be acceptable. But 20$ for less than 5 hours of gameplay, without replay value and with how the game works, it is not worth it in my opinion.			"

												God this game was such a disappointment. You're never really told what to do, but it's not a sandbox game. There are specific tasks you have to do, you're just never really told what they are. This is not a fun game where you run around as the devil's child and wreak havoc. This is a linear game in which you have absolutely no choices and all of the deaths are completely scripted. Pretty much the entirety of this game is running around a giant mansion trying to figure out where you're supposed to go or what item you're supposed to pick up. It really doesn't get much more exciting than that. Waste of my money.Edit - forgot to mention, the entire game takes less than a couple hours. Like I said, waste of money. Buy a different game that's actually entertaining and has replay value.			"

												It doesn't really give you free roam and the puzzles it wants you to solve can only be done one way and that way is the most annoying because you have to wait until your victim gives you hits like ""I'ma go fix the piano."" Not worth asking price. I believe I paid 5 dollars for it on sale. I'd wait for that again.(Edit) now that I think about it, it was actually a gift... But it was on sale for 5 dollars at one point.

												I do not recommend buying this game at full price - I got it for 2 dollars though, and if that is still the price when you see it, then by all means, drop two bucks. That being said, this game is a mess.I like the idea - I REALLY like the idea - but the execution is mediocre at best. Run around a mansion as a 7 year old and murder everyone in various ways. Sounds like a blast! I didn't even care that it was all scripted, and that there was little to no creativity allowed. What I cared about was the wacky bugs and confusing as hell missions. I had to look at the wiki in order to figure out what to do in the last half of the game, and I regularly play the Sherlock Holmes games, so I'm no stranger to adventure/puzzle games. But there is very little guiding your way. An intial mark on the map shows you your target, but after that, nothing. No markers showing important objects or following your target or anything. You can get a couple ""gifts"" that give you hints, but unfortunately my game bugged out and failed to register my ""chores"" so I couldn't get past the Ouiji board (which only hints at an important item to obtain, not what to do). Need to kill one of the maids? Clearly the thing to do is...break the washing machine by dropping an iron into it, thus making her...take a shower? Of course! Need to kill the driver? Well break that washing machine with the iron again to lure out the mechanic (because to hell with washing clothes!), then...find a mix tape so he can turn around and listen to it, allowing you to get some paint thinner and a rag to knock him out with? Masterful! There are also plenty of zero purpose items in the game. Books and bottles can be picked up, but serve no purpose. You can't even throw them to distract NPCs away from locations. Light switches can be flicked on and off, leading one to believe that there is a ""stealth"" aspect of the game Nope...in the one section where you can do it, darkness has no meaning - mom will find you whether you are standing in pitch black or right under the light bulb. There is a section of stealth gameplay later in the game where darkness actually matters...but you take out the power to the mansion, thus rendering the switches useless anyway!The powers are cool, but you rarely get to use them. Telekenesis is your go to, followed by mind control. You can mind control a few of the people in the mansion, but unless they have some scripted interaction in that particular ""chapter"", you can't do anything with them. Later in the game, you get some offensive spells...but unless you choose the ""Action"" ending (oh yes, that is a thing), you will use the fireball spell twice and the combustion spell - your last spell, btw - once. Yep, one time. The only truly useful spell that doesn't require a scripted event is memory erase, where if you are caught doing something, you can make them forget (but only 6 times a chapter). And don't even get me started on the bugs. I have witnessed: an NPC walking into a closed door, effectively locking it for me. A chore not registering as complete (taking out the garbage), thus failing to allow me to continue that line of ""side quests"". Dropping that iron into the washer didn't work a few times. Dropping a hair dryer into a tub didn't work because it got stuck behind it, and was out of ""range"" of telekenesis. Entries in my journal not registering, leaving me with zero clues on how to continue. And many more minor annoyances (glitching through walls, glitching through each other, falling through the floor once, getting stuck in the courtyard on a very small ""hill""). The voice sync is awful, the voice acting is...not terrible, but not good either. If what they do with their faces could be called ""expressions"" or ""emotions"" then those are awful too. Many of these could of probably been fixed, but clearly the developer did not see a reason to. Overall, the game is a mess, but it is certainly worth the two dollars I paid for it. I love the idea, and I would like to see more from the developer (although I'm told the sequel to this is even worse), but please polish it up, give a bit more creativity, and let us use our damn spells! If there isn't a sale on, avoid this one. If there is, anywhere from 1 to 5 bucks...go ahead and give it a whirl.			"

												I'm playing this, because it's an adventure game. But I've never played a game so full of bugs. Clipping issues, falling through the floor constantly in one climactic scene, etc. I'm honestly surprised they came out with a sequel considering they haven't even worked the bugs out of the first one yet.The concept is ok and while it's working properly it's pretty fun, but when it isn't you want to have an exorcism performed on your PC.However, there isn't much actual story. You get assigned someone to kill, you kill them (and have exactly one way to do so), and then it fades to black and the next ""mission"" starts. I was really expecting more of a sandbox. If you are patient with bugs and like the idea of basically being the kid from the Omen, then this could be recommended. For everyone else, spend your money on a telltale game or something.			"

												At the beginning I thought this is a stealth game but after playing a while it turns out to be some kind of puzzle game. You control a kid with superpower trying to kill the visitors of the family, not much of the story kill you are simple a killing machine with a boy face.You need to actually observe lots of rooms without the help of hints, since the inventories you need are not marked on the map, and you probably find the right tool for mission 6th before you start the first one lol. So I'd say this is a difficult game sometimes you can get lost and not sure what to do. I'd say for a indie game it's a decent one. Though unlike Hitman series, which kills people for a reason, I feel a bit uncomfortable killing good people for devils, but it's only a game I guess...			"

												I would recommend playing this game, it's very good in my taste! I loved the main character plain and simple, the graphics were good, and there were plenty of neat ways to kill people. One of the bad things is, any kind of hint the game supplied such as the notes in your notebook weren't that helpful about 30% of the time in my experience. There were also more than enough bugs/glitches to even count, which most of the time ended in a game over or just simply resetting the level and doing all of that stuff you FINALLY accomplished all over again. But my main pet peeve about this game was that the telekinesis power was EXTREMELY hard to use. Things would go off into random directions or the item itself that you were trying to move will just be stuck in its place.Other than physical game problems (bugs, glitches, mechanics, etc) both endings were just terrible. I appreciated the alternate ending feature, but both endings consisted of almost the exact same gameplay content at a ridiculously difficult level lol. Worst part about it, there was only a slight difference in the ending cinematics. Both endings in general were not creative at all.  When I played the first, it was 3/10. The second one I'd give maybe a 5/10. Although my review sounds more negative than positive, I do like this game and rate it above average; my critique in endings of anything is always picky anyways lmao. But over all, the story and characters intrigued me the most, so I'd give it a solid 8/10, probably would play again! :^)			"

However, as the majority of people who have reviewed this game have stated, many times I was stuck wondering what to do. I also didn't favor running all around the house for the chores or items needed to make a kill. It seemed a bit tedious after a while. (♥♥♥♥ the laundry chore. Just skip it.)But the kills! SO rewarding!Lucius is one of the only games which compelled me to complete all of the Steam achievements. I have them all except for the ""I like this game"" and ""I'm addicted"" achievements. My only peeve with these 2 achievements is that it takes less than 5 hours to finish the game, so 40 hours is a LOT of time to fill!

												If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10			"

												I got this game for 99 cents, which is good, because if I paid full price for it, I'd be angry. And the worst part about it is that the game had so much potential! I'm not against these kinds of stories. The Omen, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, I own all three of them. Playing as Damien (I mean Lucius) should have been great!And for a while it was. The first few kills really did work, and I thought I got this game at a bargain. Loved the gore, too.Then it started sucking. Not the story. That part is good all around. I really enjoyed that aspect of it. And for a game like this, the visuals aren't terrible either. No, I'm talking about the quests themselves. Now, I'm not against difficult games. Far from it. But they sprinted across the line between difficult and next to impossible unless you know what to do next. For the majority of them, really. I appreciated the Ouiji board (first and last time I'll ever say that) for giving me the much needed clues to get a rough idea, but once I found my next victim, the game would basically go ""okay, kid, here's a giant mansion and a crappy map to get you through it. Go find this obscure item that you would have no reason to go looking for. Combine it with this other obscure item, then follow these contrived steps to get the kill. Now, this might have worked a little better if there were multiple ways to get a kill. And if the house were a little smaller. Not a lot, but just a touch. Then when you have no idea what to do, you don't have to spend half an hour looking through every room and drawer and hope you stumble across the next item. But nope, it's ""do this, then this, then this, then this.""Again, I'm not saying that I want the game to be easy. But I also don't want it so difficult that it's contrived. But I was willing to overlook all of that for the story. It really was interesting. Until...A game-breaking glitch. *sigh*So in one chapter, you have to kill a guy by using your fire powers to burn him to death. Like most video game bosses, he takes three hits. I fought him about five times, and this is how it went: 1. It worked fine, I just didn't have my strategy down. Fair enough. 2. I hit him, then he... disappears. You're in a small dungeon, so there's no place to hide. He just vanished, forcing me to re-start. 3. He's immune to your fire. 4. He's immune to fire. 5. He's immune to fire. At first I thought ""hey, I'm just missing. I mean, not sure how I can miss with a fireball bigger than I am, but whatever."" But repeatedly hitting him (in an area where the crosses were upside-down, mind you) with massive fireballs at point-blank range and not giving him a scratch lets me know, hey, this game is broken. I kinda want my 99 cents back. Difficulty bordering on being too contrived I can handle. It's irritating, but I can handle it. And they don't do it all the time. Sometimes you can figure it out with what they give you. But oftentimes I'd look up the solution, expecting to see something that made me go ""oh, I just missed that. Silly me"" and instead getting ""why on Earth would that be the next thing I do?""As a final note, something that amuses me about this game: the upside-down cross. I know it's a popular devil image and whatnot, but ironically so. It's supposed to be a symbol of defiance, but, if you read the history of it, it's actually a symbol of deep reverence and respect towards Jesus. The apostle Peter demanded to be crucified that way, as he didn't feel worthy of dying the same way his lord did. Just a funny note. I know symbols change and all that, but yeah.So overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. 5 for a great idea, decent visuals, good gore, some creativity, an a nice story, and -5 for... pretty much everything else.

												3.5/10.Not a very good game. Its like an adventure puzzle game, but with all the negatives. It wants to be hitman, how you kill people. But instead of multiple ways to kill people there is only 1 solution. And this involves pixel hunting 1 object which you need to use on another object. Game doesn't help much with directions and hints sometimes. Other problems involves doing things in perfect order you wouldn't know. In once instance, after the game led me to this person I talked to, I then had no hitns or objectives left to do. I was apparently supposed to go talk to this one person hidden away in a corner, which would then force me to take a nap, going to the next stage of the level. The annoyance to do everything in sequence they choose, when they don't give you hints, is frustrating and poorly done, but not fun. Also theres the terrible game design. If you are spotted its game over and you lose all progress in this level. This means going back through the cutscenes that dont skip, even though they say they do. It also involves doing all tasks over again. Best part is the spotting system. I got spooted once by a person with their back turned to me. There was another one where a guy was walking away from me, and it was pitch black outside, and I got instant fail. To use instant fails and repetition but then not even have the spotting system functional, it just screams sloppy game. Leave this bad game for the devil to play,			"

												For the price, its not a bad game. A little clunky but you get used to it after a little bit.Edit:Bugged achievements have really made this game obnoxious. As an achievement hunter, this game would normally be an easy 100% completion. A lot of achievements will unlock as you play through, and also a lot will trigger without doing all the requirements. But when you play and play and play and the time achievements don't trigger(see my play time) it pisses me off to the point i'm glad I got this game for free from an auction site.

So try if you find it cheap, and you think you may enjoy the gorey deaths and the idea of being Satan's child, but it's nothing special.Pros+ It's a game about being the Antichrist and killing people!+ Deaths are cool, sometimes gorey and even funnyCons- Controlling the damned kid is a pain- A few bugs scattered around- Voice acting is not really good, and the dialogues seemed kinda bad to me- Full of cliches, it's a story we've seen a lot of times before- Silly characters all around- Linear and a bit boring after the first few kills- The house is big but mostly empty of content, nothing worth exploring			"

												This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.  Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10			"

												I was very supprised with this game. After finishing this game I look back and realize there are three things that makes this a game i can recommend. 1. The house is a character, the house has alot of detail and is layed out in a manner that makes it fun to traverse.  2. Not sure if it is intentional, but its like a bad horror movie you get to play. Some of the sappy things that you would see happen in 80's horror movies, make this game fun. 3. This game would be a complete disaster if it didn't control good, but the controls work great and make alot of sense, and the parts that are not that great make for fun to master like the telekenisis. If you can get this on a sale it makes it even better, but if not I would still recommend this game a purchase.			"

												Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't.  You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.

												Reading other reviews there's a lot of condemnation for a linear point and click style strictly story line game.  Makes a change really with all the open world games out there and ""lets see how many different ways you can come up with to kill people"".  If you want open world, free choice on actions and outcomes then this game is definately not for you.  It's basically a game version of The Omen type story.  Without giving too much away, small boy, spawn of satan, kill you family and develop your powers.  It's very imaginative in how there is little guidance and you actually have to think on how the game wants you to do the murders without getting caught, with only a little guidance on where your next move takes you.  All in all I believe it is a charming little game dedicated to one of the classics in the horror genre which puts you in the place of the demon child.  If you like point and click type games, free roaming but with a very scripted storyline and an intelligent game you have to think about then I would definately recommend this game!  :)			"

												This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5€			"

												OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10			"

												Lucius is an alright game,  i would recommend it mainly because it is different and it's got a twisted story line.  the only thing i really don't understand fully about the game is that there isn't much of a direction given as to what to do. i get the concept of basically killing everyone in the house, but theres no direction as to how to go about it.  you basically have to guess on where and what to grab and what you can get and can't pick up. overall i would say get the game on sale, i don't believe that it's worth the 20 dollars at full price.

												An interesting game concept; play as a demonic possessed kid and kill off the household. It's kinda like playing the Sims if you were Satan.You free roam around the house looking for a way to kill your next target, set everything up, then let the brutal cutscene commence. Most of the puzzles involve just setting up the murder in the house, which the game kinda helps you with so its not like you run around clicking everything. Some of the murders are a bit mild, like you just poisen them and watch them die. Then you get to most of the others which escalate to the level of sawing a guys face in half with a saw. So if you like gore, this might get you off a bit.Though the game is short and can be completed pretty quickly, its best to wait for a sale to buy. Even though the game is kinda amusing and interesting, it's content is still not worth $20.			"

You live inside a giant mansion and try and find clever ways to kill staff members, guests and just about everyone in the house by staging events that look like accidents. For every soul you get Satan he grants you more powers such as telekinesis and stuff like that. Its a awesomely evil game and watching dumb humans fall for your evil traps is hilarious.

So try if you find it cheap, and you think you may enjoy the gorey deaths and the idea of being Satan's child, but it's nothing special.Pros+ It's a game about being the Antichrist and killing people!+ Deaths are cool, sometimes gorey and even funnyCons- Controlling the damned kid is a pain- A few bugs scattered around- Voice acting is not really good, and the dialogues seemed kinda bad to me- Full of cliches, it's a story we've seen a lot of times before- Silly characters all around- Linear and a bit boring after the first few kills- The house is big but mostly empty of content, nothing worth exploring			"

												At first I wasn't sure if I would like this game. I had many problems (finishing quest before starting causing the quest to get stuck, and getting stuck in numerous walls) but I went with it (not gonna lie, those pantie physics made me want to keep playing). As the game went on I started liking it more and more-Until the last level.(spoilers)I chose the puzzle instead of action… it made me so mad. Trying to kill the priest I was aiming for the chandelier but I ended up getting “caught.” So? He knows I’m trying to kill him, why would it matter if I get caught? Then I realized I was supposed to use the fire to get him. Dang priest ran out so fast I don’t even know how many times I had to restart because I ran out of time. Then, after that, when getting the father, I encountered a problem where after he was knocked down I was stuck. After messing around with various powers it eventually popped me to where I needed to be and I completed the game.It’s not an overall bad game. I thought the game was enjoyable, but there are some things that can really make you angery- things that should have been fixed.As for recommending- it's a tie.			"

												Hi guys, may the satanism and blasphemy be with you!While my introduction rises the best welcomes of the year, I've played and finished this game and this is my opinion.Step 1 - if you don't like puzzle game with classic satan cliche' it's better if you look elsewhere, but if you get this game under the helloween moon, a bit for fun, and a bit for curiosity, you will not regret.The game focus on how to kill people of a house without be directly involved. This means no shotguns, no direct approach, no fireballs... (maybe). Anyway you have to inspect the house, find elements and merge them with the environment to produce consequences... people react to consequences and in that fault you may arise into the lucifer domain, killing without a trace.A part the story that is enough funny and ironic, the game is serius and grab from pagan legend the history of possessed people. In any case you are the Evil there, so you don't have nothing to fear about. This make the story a horror story.. fo the others!Well it's all funny?Yes... someway. I've noticed a couple of bugs (the most bad was at the last scene, so I had to reload the game to have the game complete... and this was disappointing) but in general the quest are interesting. You will have to use also superpowers during the game progression, with an insert of new mechanics to complete the job. Boring is also the saving system. If you quit, some object and actions you have done will be erased. The checkpoint are of course the kills. Graphics is detailed but a bit plastic. Your character move and play without saying any word, while the people of the house always repeat the same things.Well, if you are going to get a smooth and interesting halloween this is the game for you. Do not expect it will last a life.. just a couple of days to be finished.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10			"

The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.			"

												This game is intensely fun, allowing you to play as the unrepentant villain in a Hitman-style game that never feels to big or too small. As you learn the mansion, you zip around looking for targets, because this game doesn't believe in giving you everything on a silver platter, and I like that. It looks great, and after five hours I only experienced one glitch. My only real complaint is the initial unforgiving nature of the stealh bits, but it's later rectified by a skill you get. This game is worth every penny you spend on it, and I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes stealth-action-puzzle games.			"

YouTube™ Video: Lucius ✭ 1 - Children Are Evil 

			Views: 13		

			I'm sure at that age he doesn't really understand the consequences of his actions... If you liked the vid, I do plenty of this, why not subscribe here to keep up to date?		

Note : Recommended if it's going for a cheap price... Lucius didn't have much chance of leading a normal life, right from the get go, he's the subject of a summoning ritual while in the womb, and if that wasn't bad enough, at age 6 Satan decides it's time he became a contract killer.Though don't get your hopes up that this is childhood assassin's creed, there's no combat, or planning out your custom method for taking out the designated target. Instead each ""level"" is; you wander around until the camera zooms over to your designated target, then you look at what's around that the game wants you to use to kill them. Sometimes the game helps you out and zooms in on your implementations of death too. Some of these kills get quite creative, others are pretty dumb and sadly others are obscure to the point of frustration. Speaking of which, there's also a night time stealth mission, which is probably the lowest point of the game.As the body-count increases Satan comes more impressed with your ability and grants you additional powers. The most useful is telekinesis, allowing you to interact with things from a distance. Sadly the remaining powers are pretty limited in their uses; Mind Control does exactly that, but its a case of knowing when the game expects you to use it, who to use it on, and what specifically they are supposed to interact with, which really destroys the potential for experimentation. There's also fire, which serves as pretty much your only form of direct offense.While the premise is pretty dumb, and working out what the game wants you to do can be laborious, the game does have some pretty interesting puzzles on offer, and what's more just the idea itself more than makes up for the lack of sparkle in the execution.Sure, there isn't much to the world (it all takes place in a pretty large house) and it doesn't look great; the character models are serviceable, but the animations are really quite poor, and the voice acting (while there's lots of it) is pretty forgettable (except one of the maids and the terrible attempt at an accent). Oh and in the credits they list out all the free sound effects and music that was used in the game...But for as idiotic as the plot is, it's pulled off so well! The progression from working your way up from the lower tiers of the household and the increased violence that accompanies keeps the game chugging along at a decent pace and leaving you wondering what could possibly be up Lucius' sleeve next.The storytelling is actually pretty amazing, and the game manages to maintain the dark mood almost the entirety of it (a few of the kills are pretty dumb). An investigator chalking the initial deaths as accidental, the belief that the house is cursed, the idea that there's some kind of coverup, how the blame shifts from one character to another... It a really interesting tale. Sure the actual script isn't on point 100% of the time, but the idea stands up and shines through despite the shortcomings of the game.Lucius, from a gameplay perspective, is not a delight to play, everything about the implementation is incredibly average to below average... But it is saved by it's plot, which is memorable and something that I've actually discussed with friends, even if only to talk about how messed up some parts are... Which is something that I haven't done with games that have far more polish. It may be asking a lot to overlook the aesthetics, but if you're willing to, you'll uncover one of gaming's better told stories.			"

												To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.  Grab this game when it's on sale!			"

												Lucius is a puzzle game about killing people with demonic powers and some stealth elements.The story is basically Satan wants you to give him sacrifices and he gives you power in return.The game has some good points and some weak points.Pros:-There are a lot of mysteries around the manor-The map is just the right size for the game... Not too big or too small.-Mind control is fun! (When you can use it)-Detective is a cool characterCons:-There's only one answer to the puzzle... So you can't think of another way to kill your target more than the onethe game offers to you-There are some bugs on the game (The one I remember the most is the No-collision door to the garage in the final episode, which lets you go outside the manor, where you shouldn't be able to be on normal circumstances)-Trycicle controls are way to sloppy-Abilities are very situationalI think this game could've been more than what it is right now, it surely does have the potential.But the way it is now I'd recommend you to buy it only if it's on steam sale.If I'd have to rate it I'll give it a 6.4/10			"

												If this game had been released on the PS2 around the year 2000 I would have loved it.The game itself is pretty fun, some of the deaths can be a little funny just how ridiculous they are, however, towards the end you can see how the developers started to run out of ideas and got bored, early on in the game it took a lot of thought and time to kill a person, towards the end you kill a lot of people within the space of an hour in very dull and unimaginative ways. I mean come on...  Using the iron to break the washing machine... TWICE? The game is pretty glitchy, although I managed a full playthrough without having to quit the game to fix a bug, a lot of the bugs just ironed themselves out after waiting a while.TL;DRStarts off well, the kills become unimaginative and boring towards the end and the ending is anti-climatic. 5/10			"

												It got an interesting premise since it is like the unofficial video game adaptation of The Omen. That being the premise and the fact it comes from an indie studio are the only reasons why i can consider it an OK game and understand why some people love the game.The only things that really bothered me about the game is that still has glitches considering how many updates it has had and that is very poorly optimized. It also got some really annoying achievements that force you to waste your time just for the sake of it. You can still manage to get them all in 15 hours like i did. If you don't care about the achievements, it can easily be finished in 10 hours or less. It may say in my profile or this review that  i played this game for 40 hrs or more, Hell no, i just left it running to get 2 achievements that require it.Hell yes that you may like it. Liking The Omen movie is a big requirement though. In my case, I did liked it. However, I also got it for 1 dollar, so, that helped its case too.[ Nominated it for a steam award ]			"

I also appreciated playing the roll of the bad guy for once, & to have all the answers that everyone else is trying to figure out.The story is engaging, albeit pretty cheesy & predictable, but I got more of a feeling of old-flim nostalgia than annoyed at it. I'd give the story overall a 8/10.The controls were pretty good on a XBox 360 controller, & I was able to run the game passably on a toaster of a laptop.			"

												If you're a big fan of the horror series The Omen and also enjoy the Hitman series and puzzles, this is for you, but only if it's on sale.  Given that the game tends to retail for $19.99 this title is way over priced given the average game design, wildly fluctuating difficulty, laughable lip syncing, and sub-par voice acting, I simply can't recommend it otherwise.PROS:- Essentially lets you play through a game simulating Damien from The Omen- Decent sized map to keep things interesting- You can earn a surprise gift by doing most of the available chores that pays homage to The Shining and The Omen alike (though it adds little practical use aside from the easter egg reference)CONS- Very specific target demographic, I think most would be unhappy if purchased- Game is VERY short and could be completed in under 5 hours if game objectives were clearer- Regular price is absurd for the content offered- Gameplay is limited and will lose many players' interest- Story is very shallow and essentially follows the general storyline of The Omen series- The difficulty curve is all over the map.  Some parts of the game are exceedingly simple while others have you running around in circles wondering what you're doing wrong until you give up and look at a walkthrough.- 2/3 of the gifts given for performing the tedious chores are simply avenues for hints which end up being necessary when the game's solutions are unclear and annoying- Although there are 2 different endings, this adds practically no replay value "

												It's a tough call to recommend Lucius. The premis behind the game is solid. You play as the anti-christ being trained by you real father aka Satan to hone your powers on your birth parents and their staff by killing them all one at a time without being caught. The execution however is rocky at best. Stiff animations and an overwhelming lack of instruction leaves the experience more frusterating than it needed to be. One more than one occasion I started a chapter not knowing who my target was so I wandered the huge property of the mansion, checking every room I could think of for nearly 45 minutes before I finally caved and checked online. That's a bad sign for game design. This is an indie title and if it wasn't released during the Halloween season there's no way the producers would be able to justify the $30 price tag. My bet, this title is going to see a price drop and if you're curious about it, wait for it to a $5 sale and pick it up, otherwise, you're not missing a lot here.			"

												Before you buy the game, please not that it is VERY HARD. There are many components you have to think of before killing each person. Unless you look up a walkthrough/playthrough/guide, it is going to be difficult.That being said, this game is also good, and it feels like you've actually accomplished something once you've completed on of the components. So, here is a crisp list of pros and cons to help you decide if you want to buy the game or something.Pro: GameplayIt's very important that your gameplay is a pro, that is a MUST with the community, And luckily for Lucius, it actually has unique gameplay that is quite good at the same time. You really have to think and explore, which not a lot of video games take the time to do these days.Pro: Amount of ContentThere are around 16 puzzling levels that feel like a game in themselves. And if you're a completionist like me, there are many achievements for you to collect. All of which aren't to difficult but aren't easy either.Con: UnpolishedThe game feels like it's in beta, with the slighlty (quite slightly) long load times and the unsynced voices. It just feels slightly unpolished and could use that extra push to get it to the finish. I also ran into some door glitches on my joutney through the game.Con: TutorialsThe game doesn't do the best job of explaing things. Pure and simple.Pro: StoryGood enough story to make you acrually want to kill people. You don't really care about the people that you're killing, Which in a sense is actually GOOD. Becasue it makes you feel like a cold hearted killer.Overall:Lucius is worth the full price. There are better games around it's price, but Lucius feels good enough to be worth the price. I got it for 1,45 when it was on sale, and it was extremely worth it.Also Tom's♥♥♥♥♥is 10/10.			"

												As you can see I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already found a couple of issues with the game, that's quite off putting for me. First of all, the 3rd person view they've decided on using for the game, is incredibly annoying. Lucious's head is in the way a lot of the time if you need to have a closer look at things (which you often do), and at too far a distance, it gets hard to see what's hidden inside all the drawers and cupboards. Secondly, I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of a ""sandbox"" mode, when this game is being described by the developers as ""Open World"". I can accept the premise that the house and the surroundings is the only area you can be in, but the fact that it isn't sandboxed, and it feels like you're being forced to do things in a certain way (where's the fun in that?) is definitely a bit off putting. However, when all that's said and done, I haven't played that game that much yet (mainly because of the 3rd person issue), so as such, this review can mostly comment on the mechanics of the game. The actual game itself, and the premise for it, seems amazing (which is why I bought it in the first place), so hopefully these things will manage to negate the drawbacks of the game.I'm still having trouble getting into the game because of the way they made 3rd person viewing, and the lack fo any 1st person viewing, but I'd still reccommend this game try, if you happen to find it on offer.

												A smart game with a great story and lots of character. There is many well made cinematics and good use of music. I very much enjoyed running around the classically decorated old mansion discovering how to take out each target.  I had to resort to a walkthrough for just a few parts but that hasn't made the game any less enjoyable. I'm just a few chapters in and so far I'm very impressed. This is a must play for practical thinkers and murder enthusiasts alike.			"

												Got this for $2 on a Steam sale, not worth more. This is an incredibly frustrating, glitchy point-and-click I had to consult a walkthrough for on almost every level, because you are given almost no clues and controls are not straightforward (ex: really hard to lift objects with telekinesis and get them where they need to go). I frequently got clipped between front doors and cabinet doors and had to restart. Other reviews made it sound like there was more of a story; characters repeat the same line of dialogue every time you approach them each chapter, so you don't care about any of these doll-like creatures. ""Chores"" are a fairly meaningless function unless they're central to the person you're supposed to kill that chapter. Since this is obviously an homage to The Omen, I was really hoping for all-out 70s references and decor, but there is none. Only thing I got a kick out of was Lucius's resemblance to Mads Mikkelsen and the soundtrack. Kept playing just to see all the ways he would kill, and because I try my darndest to complete something I've paid for, but Lucius has no replay value and little payoff the first time around.			"

												TL;DR for lazy people: Boring, confusing, horrible stealth mechanics. Decent story.This game sounded a whole lot better on paper than it is in practice. You're a creepy mute kid who is apparently the son of Lucifer and you have to kill everybody in your house so your father can have souls, using diverse methods to knock off your targets one by one while making it look like an accident.Unfortunately, finding how to do it is a hassle, there's only one way to kill each target and it's not always obvious. there are few clues and if some of them are usually simple and clear, you never know where to find the item, you have to search a huge, confusing manner to find said item and use it. Even after you found the thing, it's not always clear where and how you're supposed to use it. This game doesn't hold you by the hand.Despite those problems, the game is rather interesting to follow as some drama starts because everybody's stumped and the detective in charge has no idea how all these deaths happen. But then comes ... The Betrayal. The one chapter that manages to ruin what little fun this game managed to offer. You have to cause a power outage so you can sneak around to get in the garage, which is on the ground floor, on the absolute opposite of your starting point. Here, you have to contend with locked doors and horrible stealth mechanics that barely work coherently. you can't see a thing but you don't dare use the flashlight in case this game actually makes you easier to spot when your light's on. All you do is try just about every door in the frickin' house while avoiding the adults patrolling with flashlight for no obvious reasons while your remaining satanic powers are drained because you manage to get spotted by someone who's at the far opposite of you in the corridor or by people you couldn't see or hear and open the exact same door you were planning to open.This, this is what killed the game, that was barely alive in the first place. It'll probably end up being one of those curios I bought for a buck that I'll never finish, let alone re-install and that's too bad 'cause I'm rather curious about how the story ends. Oh well. "

												My name is my own, but I assure you, it is important.My review is rather simple and to the point;Luciud is a fantastic game insofar as it is not only well written and acted, especially for an ""indie"" developer, but the game itself is rather well made, easy to learn and presented well. The graphics, while not on the level of those super-realistic new games, are just as good as any, and better than I would expect to see. The voice acting, whilst not always on-cue, is itself fair. I have yet to finish the game, but I also have yet to encounter any sort of graphical, scripting or other errors one usualy finds in the ""bigger"" games of today, bugs being so prevailient within most engines, I am supprised to find a 'clean' game. Now for the story, the one thing I hold highest in any game. The story is amazing, well written, well executed and in plain simple english, it is great. If this game were a book, it would be a great read and I would have trouble putting it down.You can be assured that apon completion of this game, I will be purchasing the next Lucius title, quite happily.

												A short way in and already frustrated. I can't stand it anymore. It's not like it has no shred of  entertainment value, but I find it far from a fun game. It's linear, so you have no choices in how it goes - I had hoped for a little more creative space, but that's my faulty expectation I guess. It's more like a chore-like puzzle than anything else. At one point you need to gather laundry... somehow you can only do this one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sock at a time. It's a minor thing, but the annoyance builds. And why the hell do I need to do that with 2 housekeepers in the house? WTF.It's buggy... I had a bug right at the cinematic after the tutorial. Lip sync is off, clipping in animations. At one point you need to avoid your mother, but her pathing is so utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that she gets stuck on the staircase, or in an open doorway, fails to open a door and just keep walking at and away from it.... and half the time the game just games over right there. I just can't get past after 8 tries. It's bloody annoying, because it's not the challenge but the game that keeps me from progressing.At other point you just know that you need to use a specific item, but you move on because your cursor doesn't trigger a use function... only to find out wih google you needed to target a specific micro part that takes a while to get your cursor on right. Come on...After a bit I just lost interest. Oh, another person needs to die. Okay.It's a nice theme, but the gaming element is just weak. I will try to finish it, but it just feels like driving with the handbrake on and a steering wheel that will only turn left.EDIT after a few more hours: On the last few missions, my save file is corrupt and I can't play it. It just crashes when I load it and I really can't be bothered to start the earlier mission again. The entire experience was meh, no replayability, the steam achievements are not challenging because you get them after each scripted kill. I spent near to no money on it, so no harm done there, but damn don't bother with this.			"

												Lucius is a puzzle game, where the puzzle to solve is murder. The replayability is very low. The puzzles aren't always challenging, just frustratingly clueless. And often repetitive. I finished it under 5 hours. The only reason I have so many hours on this game is for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ achievement. 40 hours ? Really ?

												Lucius feels more like a point and click game with a third person interface than it does a stealth/horror game.  The world is too big.  There isn't much room for creativity.  It seems you need to find the one item that will allow whatever the next death sequence is to take place.  The voice acting is stilted.  The writing is pretty generic.  All in all, life is short and there are stronger games out there to play.			"

												Have you ever seen the movie Omen? No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.The game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.Now, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.Anyways 7/10 Would try again.			"

												Childhood.  Birthday cake.  Playground.  Friends.  Family.  Schooling.  Presents.  Horsing around.  Dead bodies aplenty.  Huh?  Now, most people would never equate dead bodies with their childhood but you will when you play as the son of the devil.  Lucius is the a gem of a game beacause it flourishes with what so many fps video games refuse to admit to: that we don't need a reason to kill anyone.  Okay, in Lucius ""dad"" wants more souls so we have to kill people for that reason.  However, like every other gamer whom has played this game the joy of Lucius lies in the simple question ""whom should I kill today?"".  As I played I thought of a song from a little known heavy metal band from detroit called Meliah Rage.  That song was ""Kill To Survive"".  As people died before my eyes in all matter of gore I sang to myself, ""I kill for killing, cause killing is my life..... I kill to survive"".  That's as much as I can remember but this game delivers that devilsih joy of just killing people.  Of course if I had made Lucius it would get ban every where on Earth because there are levels of depraivity, narcisism, and homicidal intention that people in the real world sink into without remorse.  I would have given the gamer not just mind control but several options to make those dummies do something disgusting. Hopefully the secong game of Lucius will set our murderous selves free and let the gates of hell consume the world.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Thumbs up.			"

First playthrough time: 5 hoursMajor Pros:Gruesomely murder everyoneYou can go back to previous chapters, including replaying the last chapter to get either of the two endingsSuitable amount of hints from a variety of sources (NPC conversations, journal, ""gifts"", intro dialog for each chapter, etc.)Minor Pros:Peep on ""adult"" behaviorIf you shoot someone, their ragdoll flies around the roomMajor Cons:Story is a little unbelievable, even for a ""son of Satan"" themed gameThe game doesn't do enough to create an appropriate mood for the playerSpells can be really hard to manipulate and the limits to your range aren't clearMinor Cons:Characters have no facial expressionLayout of the house can be confusing and it's not clear which of the servants' quarters are whoseSome of the Steam achievements didn't trigger for meI didn't find the story or characters to be all that indepth, but I did still enjoy the game. The first two ""gifts"" you get for doing chores can give you hints for each of your puzzles and most levels give you ample time to figure them out. The puzzles (murders) are all about the same length, four entries in your journal, though some take longer and more walking than others. While the story was sterotypical, I did like the mother's slow descent into insanity, which was one of the few character progressions. Figuring out each murder while not getting caught was pretty interesting, and none of the spell usage was too out there. While it's no masterpiece, I still want to recommend it to all the devilish little gamers out there who would enjoy smash expensive china, peeping on adult ""playtime"", stalking around in the dark, setting things on fire, and (of course) graphically butchering the 20 or so occupants of the house as a 6 year old boy with demonic powers.

												Pros:- Storyline is nice- Episodic- You literally get to kill people living in that house ( except the dad. well, i wont add spoilers regarding his death. lol ;) )- Blooooood <3- You get to kill a teacher :D :D :D (well, technically he killed himself. lol)- I love how Lucius watches them die with that same expression.Cons:- Buggy. >  Chapter 4 after you kill Jed, there are times that the game wont progress and you'll have to restart the chapter again.> Chapter 5b where you need to get past the detective in the garden. I managed to get past him using the same strat as i did before it worked. It didn't work the first time or the following times, but after a few hours of trying using the exact same strat, well, it worked. Definitely a bug. Needs an update.- The map is not helping that much in finding rooms. I always end up getting lost in that mansion. Maybe add room names instead of drawings.Overall, i'll give this game 9/10. It's a must play :)			"

												Lucius is about the son of Satan. He’s come back to take over the world. In order to go concur the world he, for some reason, has to kill off his family. While he’s killing off whoever the family slowly starts getting paranoid as to whos killing everyone. Some have emotional breakdowns and then the police get involved. The lead detective bumbles about and tries to piece it all together. Every once in a while Satan will drop by and give Lucius power ups.This is one the few games I really really wanted to like. For once you play the ultimate bad guy and there are weird justifications for doing tons of gory bad things. Then you get to read his journal entries and shows the mindset of a terrible person for once. However it doesn’t do much else. The story is so frail that it doesn’t really explain why its a good idea to kill off your family, nor how he was going to go about ruling the world. Think about it. If he kills off his family he’ll be a penniless orphan and will only go on to kill other families. On top of that there is zero time for character development to make the player care about the people who are being killed and much less why they are killed.Now murdering them all is a mixture of grotesque and unique. This portion of the game is pretty much a stealth puzzle mixture and all the combinations are interesting to figure out. Although some do die in cliché ways, although the setup is always different. This gameplay as a whole isn’t too difficult. It’s a lot like some of the older point and click games where you take everything that isn’t nailed to the floor. After that you explore the house to find the special spot to use it.Also some of the best power ups that Satan gives you come really late in the game and you won’t be able to use them except maybe once. Like it you eventually get to wipe peoples memory after they catch you doing something bad, which would be hella useful in earlier parts of the game. But it’s only introduced after 3/ 4 ths of the game is complete and since you’ve already killed some 10+ people there are less people in the house to catch you. So it doesn’t really serve a purpose unless you really suck at stealth. Or better yet, you don’t get the ability to conjure fireballs till the second to last level. How awesome would it have been to just go around smokin mofos left and right with this ability? Well guess what? It isn’t happening.This wasn’t a great game and it wasn’t what I hoped it would be. The graphics are OK, but not great for this generation. The voice acting is sometimes just terrible, or feels like a bad B movie. The characters are sometimes completely cliché, like the only butler in the game is British. On top of all that a lot of the story is just stupid. It basically amount to “go out and kill everyone just because!” and then it doesn’t give you a option not to kill them or give you a better explanation.So if you do pick it up try to find it cheap. It’s a short experience and there is little replay value. Sure there are two bonus levels, but they’re hard, boring and serve no purpose. Also the story is going to be too bland for some people. Hopefully they’ll make a sequel seeing as they could easily fix things and adjust the story and game mechanics.4.5/10			"

												While it was sort of neat to play as the kid from The Omen I didn't find this game to be well made. My buddy's psychology class touched on this game. Occasionally you say things like ""I'm the devil's son, I'll kill you!"" and so on but reay Lucius is mildly interesting at best. Not amazing ot new in most ways aside from the controversial setting. If its on sale for roughly $2 go ahead, otherwise don't bother.			"

												Lucius is a rather funny game in that the atmosphere is really great and playing a 6-year old antechrist is rather appealing. Plus it's pretty easy and shouldn't be too frustrating.Halas, the graphical engine is very poor, the cutscenes are kitsch and the gameplay fails to deliver. It's a standard point&click in third-person (which is nice), but the controls are a bit clumsy and you encounter far too many bugs. I may have actually recommended this game without the two overly buggy and unplayable action sequences.Though if you prefer atmosphere before gameplay, go ahead and play Lucius. You really could find some enjoyment in it. I must admit I did.			"

												The game looked really promising and it gets to be really cheap on sales (around 90 cents), but it's so buggy that messes up the game. You literally have to start over chapters due to the game being extremely buggy and causes you to be unable to process the to story.Cons:-The facial expressions are the worst.-Memory wipe power was worthless.-Some controls are clunky.-Most abilities are lame.-The House / Enviroment design in the game is rather poor.-The game offers no replayability.-The story is very short, you can beat the game in around 2-3 hours (if you can stand playing it for that much).-Too linear.-Boring concept.Pros:-You can ride a tricycle on your way to commit murder.

												If you're a big fan of the horror series The Omen and also enjoy the Hitman series and puzzles, this is for you, but only if it's on sale.  Given that the game tends to retail for $19.99 this title is way over priced given the average game design, wildly fluctuating difficulty, laughable lip syncing, and sub-par voice acting, I simply can't recommend it otherwise.PROS:- Essentially lets you play through a game simulating Damien from The Omen- Decent sized map to keep things interesting- You can earn a surprise gift by doing most of the available chores that pays homage to The Shining and The Omen alike (though it adds little practical use aside from the easter egg reference)CONS- Very specific target demographic, I think most would be unhappy if purchased- Game is VERY short and could be completed in under 5 hours if game objectives were clearer- Regular price is absurd for the content offered- Gameplay is limited and will lose many players' interest- Story is very shallow and essentially follows the general storyline of The Omen series- The difficulty curve is all over the map.  Some parts of the game are exceedingly simple while others have you running around in circles wondering what you're doing wrong until you give up and look at a walkthrough.- 2/3 of the gifts given for performing the tedious chores are simply avenues for hints which end up being necessary when the game's solutions are unclear and annoying- Although there are 2 different endings, this adds practically no replay value "

												Lucius feels more like a point and click game with a third person interface than it does a stealth/horror game.  The world is too big.  There isn't much room for creativity.  It seems you need to find the one item that will allow whatever the next death sequence is to take place.  The voice acting is stilted.  The writing is pretty generic.  All in all, life is short and there are stronger games out there to play.			"

												Have you ever seen the movie Omen? No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.The game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.Now, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.Anyways 7/10 Would try again.			"

If you look at reviews outside Steam you'll see a more realistic picture: clunky controls, uninteresting graphics, lame puzzles/missions.

												Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of  immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done. Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned ""I Love Lucius"" achievement as ever.

												Lucius is a third person game where you take control of a young boy called Lucius. Satan himself visits his bedroom and commands him to become a serial killer. This game reminded me a lot of the movie the omen.+ graphics are nothing special, but get the work done+ every killing gets you a short cutscene+ big map+ the victims don't feel like random redshirts with no names+ great in-between cutscenes- very linear. there is always only one way to do things- game is very unclear what you have to do. I often used guides since I didn't bother- there isn't really an ending- clunky controls- the game is fairly short. I used guides often though- best thing about this game are the cutscenes. the gameplay is pretty annoying you put up with to see the short videos.This game has huge potential, but since there is always only one way to finish each chapter the game falls short. It's much easier to read guides than to waste your time by searching random little objects on the huge map. The cutscenes are worth experiencing the game. But since the gameplay is so irritating, you could honestly just watch a walkthrough on youtube.If you are still interested in the game, get it on a sale.Replay value: very low (too linear, gameplay is not fun, great cutscenes)Rating: 6/10 (not bad per se, but you won't miss anything if you don't play it)Recommendation: No			"

												While very linear and clunky at times, I found this game enjoyable and played it right through to the end despite being very frustrated with it on more than one occasion.  Something about the game made me want to keep on playing, even though it appears unpolished with more than its fair share of bugs. There is something of a charm to this game, the clunky character animations and bad voice acting often made me smile and reminded me of older generation games where things were more basic, so it gave me quite a nostalgic feel.It's a nice idea for a game (depsite the story being obviously copied from The Omen film!), you must play as Lucius, a young boy who is on a mission to reap souls for Lucifer.  To accomplish this, you must guide him around the house, killing 1 person at a time in a variety of creative (and sometimes ridiculous) ways, as another reviewer said, however unrealistic some of the kills are, they always make some sort of logical sense, so you don't feel too cheated if you have been stuck for a while and then accidentally discover the solution. Some of the kills do raise a smile with their creativity!Wait for the mission where you have to catch your uncle in a compromising position with one of the servants - I did laugh out loud when I opened the door!While the game is fully third person free roaming, it is very remeniscent of point and click games of old - 'combine object A with object B and use with interactive object C' etc, so you are very restricted in what you can do and must follow a set order of actions.There are several design issues with the game - often you come across objects that are meant for a mission later on in the game, you try to use them, thinking they are for the current mission, nothing happens so you discount them, only to find out later on in the game you can interact with them, but only when you are meant to.  I feel such objects should not  be accessible at all until they are needed or if they are, there needs to be some explanation for why you cannot use it, or even a 'I don't need this at this time' piece of text.The save system saves the game at the start of each mission stage, but also saves all sub-mission info done after that point.  As a result of this, you often end up with objects in your inventory that you have already used - eg. if you begin a mission, complete one of your chores, then quit out.  When you restart, the chore will already be complete but the character who asked you to do the chore will begin asking you again and the chore item is back in its place. This doesn't break anything, but could be confusing.I did encounter multiple crashes during the first stage of the boss battle at the end, I did however manage to get round it by rushing through once I had worked out how to beat him, still - there seems to be an issue there.To summarise - despite its shortcomings, this is a very enjoyable game and will raise more than a smile or two with its quirk and charm, if you are a fan of point and click - you should find this to your liking.

												Lucius is a fantastic concept but it does fall short of the promise of it's early trailers. Playing any game as the antagonist, let alone the antichrist, is a tough balance to pull off as we need to be drawn into the character despite their actions. Unfortunately the gameplay is so linear with no real choice over who dies/how we are entirely alienated from the main character and their motivations. They are a silent cipher unquestioningly carrying out commands. Whilst this is not dissimilar to many point and clicks, guybrush threepwood had a personality that carried you through.There are other good factors about lucius such as clear intentioned level design and a dark humour that has great potential. These are not on their own redemptive enough and I would reccomend that you buy this game only in a sale or otherwise skip on to lucius 2.			"

												At first I wasn't sure if I would like this game. I had many problems (finishing quest before starting causing the quest to get stuck, and getting stuck in numerous walls) but I went with it (not gonna lie, those pantie physics made me want to keep playing). As the game went on I started liking it more and more-Until the last level.(spoilers)I chose the puzzle instead of action… it made me so mad. Trying to kill the priest I was aiming for the chandelier but I ended up getting “caught.” So? He knows I’m trying to kill him, why would it matter if I get caught? Then I realized I was supposed to use the fire to get him. Dang priest ran out so fast I don’t even know how many times I had to restart because I ran out of time. Then, after that, when getting the father, I encountered a problem where after he was knocked down I was stuck. After messing around with various powers it eventually popped me to where I needed to be and I completed the game.It’s not an overall bad game. I thought the game was enjoyable, but there are some things that can really make you angery- things that should have been fixed.As for recommending- it's a tie.			"

												Okay I first heard of this game by watching a Youtube streamer play it and I can say I sat and watched him play the entire game and enjoyed the storyline, the game play and even the fact that the main character is not your usual protaganist. I really wanted to play it so I went straight onto an e shop to see how much it was, though unfairly I was unemployed at the time so I could not afford to buy it so imagine my surprise when today on Steam it was reduced and I had money to buy it at last. I played it straight away and although I am rubbish with keyboard controls I found it quickly enjoyable and amusing. The dark story despite having seen it all before was much better than any goody two shoes story of heroism I was used too simply because of the idea of the story despite there not being a great deal of story anyway. I really suggest this game to any gamer type.			"

												This game makes its players struggle through its endless bugs, truly awful voice acting/animation, and cheesy dialouge with overuse of slow motion that gives the game an almost comedic tone.Never the less, I did force my way though the levels, and I still got some fun out of it, but otherwise I'd really not reccomend this. It is just too shoddily made. 4/10.			"

Being Bad Never Felt So GoodThis is a small game that provides some light-hearted entertainment for a few hours, bringing out the goofy serial killer in you. The crimes are fun and the house an ideal setting for the shenanigans of the son of the Devil, meaning the missions are fun and engaging. However one drawback is that the game is not always that clear in direction on who or how people need to die, which sometimes has to be specific, making the game go somewhat slow and confusing whilst you ponder over your next move. Also some of the items placement means that you better get used to Tour De Manor and the sound of trike wheels on hard floors. The killing mechanics are easy to use and fun to understand making gameplay smooth and easy. The drawback such as confusing objectives and sometimes annoying bugs cna be overlooked for this cheap and hillarious title that can easily bring numerous hours of fun7/10 "

												This game contains some of the most old school and classic deaths ever just. wow i haven't seen those deaths since Tom & Jerry but instead now the victims actually. But admit it you probably jsut buyed this game because of the nudity didn't you, you probably got a dirty mind. well atleast you didnt't come for the story because that is♥♥♥♥♥♥ it develops poorly let me tell you the story and how it develops. Warning: absolutely jsut boring spoil;ers you probably already new. you turned 6 years old and find out you're the devils son great now go kill people in your household because your dad wants you to that. thats litarelly it. nothing changes! but ofcourse you came here to mess around or for the nudity. you probably came for the nudity (pssst the sex scene is random and the shower scene is at chapter 14 but you haven't heard that from me). and most importantly its a fun game, well if you have dark humor like i do its fun. the gameplay is oke to i guess doesn't have any replay value theres no secrets well theres one but you get there via story progression but for an open world game the fact that theres no secrets just dissapoints me.+Old School Deaths for all the people who came out there mother before the year 2000.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>+Naked Woman, Shower, nuff said.+Fun for people with a dark sence of humor.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ story-No replay valueThe game is fun and hilarious but if it had a better story or even the slightest bit of replay value it would had been a higher score. 6/10.

												I got this game for 99 cents, which is good, because if I paid full price for it, I'd be angry. And the worst part about it is that the game had so much potential! I'm not against these kinds of stories. The Omen, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, I own all three of them. Playing as Damien (I mean Lucius) should have been great!And for a while it was. The first few kills really did work, and I thought I got this game at a bargain. Loved the gore, too.Then it started sucking. Not the story. That part is good all around. I really enjoyed that aspect of it. And for a game like this, the visuals aren't terrible either. No, I'm talking about the quests themselves. Now, I'm not against difficult games. Far from it. But they sprinted across the line between difficult and next to impossible unless you know what to do next. For the majority of them, really. I appreciated the Ouiji board (first and last time I'll ever say that) for giving me the much needed clues to get a rough idea, but once I found my next victim, the game would basically go ""okay, kid, here's a giant mansion and a crappy map to get you through it. Go find this obscure item that you would have no reason to go looking for. Combine it with this other obscure item, then follow these contrived steps to get the kill. Now, this might have worked a little better if there were multiple ways to get a kill. And if the house were a little smaller. Not a lot, but just a touch. Then when you have no idea what to do, you don't have to spend half an hour looking through every room and drawer and hope you stumble across the next item. But nope, it's ""do this, then this, then this, then this.""Again, I'm not saying that I want the game to be easy. But I also don't want it so difficult that it's contrived. But I was willing to overlook all of that for the story. It really was interesting. Until...A game-breaking glitch. *sigh*So in one chapter, you have to kill a guy by using your fire powers to burn him to death. Like most video game bosses, he takes three hits. I fought him about five times, and this is how it went: 1. It worked fine, I just didn't have my strategy down. Fair enough. 2. I hit him, then he... disappears. You're in a small dungeon, so there's no place to hide. He just vanished, forcing me to re-start. 3. He's immune to your fire. 4. He's immune to fire. 5. He's immune to fire. At first I thought ""hey, I'm just missing. I mean, not sure how I can miss with a fireball bigger than I am, but whatever."" But repeatedly hitting him (in an area where the crosses were upside-down, mind you) with massive fireballs at point-blank range and not giving him a scratch lets me know, hey, this game is broken. I kinda want my 99 cents back. Difficulty bordering on being too contrived I can handle. It's irritating, but I can handle it. And they don't do it all the time. Sometimes you can figure it out with what they give you. But oftentimes I'd look up the solution, expecting to see something that made me go ""oh, I just missed that. Silly me"" and instead getting ""why on Earth would that be the next thing I do?""As a final note, something that amuses me about this game: the upside-down cross. I know it's a popular devil image and whatnot, but ironically so. It's supposed to be a symbol of defiance, but, if you read the history of it, it's actually a symbol of deep reverence and respect towards Jesus. The apostle Peter demanded to be crucified that way, as he didn't feel worthy of dying the same way his lord did. Just a funny note. I know symbols change and all that, but yeah.So overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. 5 for a great idea, decent visuals, good gore, some creativity, an a nice story, and -5 for... pretty much everything else.

												Lucius is a puzzle game about killing people with demonic powers and some stealth elements.The story is basically Satan wants you to give him sacrifices and he gives you power in return.The game has some good points and some weak points.Pros:-There are a lot of mysteries around the manor-The map is just the right size for the game... Not too big or too small.-Mind control is fun! (When you can use it)-Detective is a cool characterCons:-There's only one answer to the puzzle... So you can't think of another way to kill your target more than the onethe game offers to you-There are some bugs on the game (The one I remember the most is the No-collision door to the garage in the final episode, which lets you go outside the manor, where you shouldn't be able to be on normal circumstances)-Trycicle controls are way to sloppy-Abilities are very situationalI think this game could've been more than what it is right now, it surely does have the potential.But the way it is now I'd recommend you to buy it only if it's on steam sale.If I'd have to rate it I'll give it a 6.4/10			"

Your notebook says he like to smoke... and everything else is up to you... There are at least 10 ways how you can kill this guy,but you have to kill him via prescripted way.Im giving 5/10 for this game.			"

It's a puzzle game and as such there is not a lot of replayablity as there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles. Think of it more like a 3D Phoenix Wright game and you'll enjoy it. Little Lucius is very fun little murderer to play as and watching the family (especially the mother) go nuts as the body count in the house rises is a treat. The murders are also all pretty inventive and fun to watch. Some are just downright gruesome. Give it a playthrough with these things in mind and you'll probably like it.			"

												The concept of a young devilish child reaving havoc was one that definately piqued my interest, however, sadly dissapointed with the gameplay. One of the many problems I found with this game that I don't usually have with many others is that I have to constantly refer to other sources for help. You will find yourself looking for quest items that are often way too subtley hidden in a mansion where you will pace back and forth, room to room just looking for something to get by. The problem lies in the lack of the games ability to aid the player without necessarily giving anything away (Note: You are given a tool to find items but even this is given 6 limits and can only be used in a room so it is nontheless wasteful unless you know the item could be in a specific room). Even better yet this could be solved with a non-linear format, one which provides players the ability to use multiple killing methods. This would increase replayibility and ease the painfully dullness of searching items. Some of the game mechanics lacked sense, for instance why give certain abilities only to be limited. The game sacrifices player free reign with a linear story line which isn't that great to begin with. You'd think that with multiple deaths in one home would peak the interest of the media (besides the one journalist) and feds or perhaps even motivate the family or employees to move out, but the characters all lacked sense regardless of how ""strange"" or accidental the deaths are. It's no surprise that the sequel, (yes there's a sequel) didn't do well. Once the intial pique of the concept passes, theres hardly anything else that holds you there. The game needs to be rebooted, everything but the concept out the window.			"

												I really like this game, and feel bad about liking it at the same time. For anyone who has seen any of ""The Omen"" movies, the main story is pretty much the same, for the ones that haven't, here it is. You play as Lucius (duh) the son of Lucifer (pinnacle of evil etc.) and you job as his son is to give him offerings in the form of human life. You start of easy with little accidents that leads to fatalities, and slowly work your way up with power he grants you as you go along. You live in a huge mansion with lots of staff, maids, a driver, mechanic, custodian and you even have a private tutor. Each mission introduces something new you can do or have to do, in order to act innocent you have to appear to be a good boy and do chores, which gives you presents (that's how parenting works) This game have some issues though, for me it was mainly graphics, in the form of lighting effects that were way off at times, but also some crashes, which is really annoying because you can't save. The game autosaves for you, mostly after a kill (a new chapter begins). It still alot of fun though and there alot you can do, and it takes you awhile to figure everything out in every mission. Overall a solid experience and loads of innocent blood. 6.7/10			"

												Pretty good game! The story was good and fun, and it kept me engaged until the end. Now, disregarding the story, I will describe it from an achievement hunter's perspective. Many of the achievements are unmissable and go along with the storyline. This covers the mission achievements as well as many of the ability ones. With a little bit of time and persistence, all of the ""do this 50 times"" or ""collect 20 whatevers"" can be done easily. The only hard ones were the distance achievements (I just rode the bike and ran around the courtyard for like 30 minutes IRL) and the playtime achievements. The problem with the playtime achievements is that you have to be IN THE GAME. You can't leave it open and go to the internet, you can't even pause or sleep your pc or anything. You have to be actively standing in the game for 40 hours. I left it open overnight with the lowest quality settings running like twice and that took care of it.Other than that, it was fairly easy to 100%, and it was enjoyable to play. "

												I would have loved to play it however I can't due to a slow computer, I would love to know if they are working on a mac version and if they are when that would be released.			"

												This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing.Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it. It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. Go buy it if you want to play it, I had a fun time with it, and I believe you won't be disappointed			"

												Truly a messed up game. You play Lucius, son of Lucifer in a house of people who were once your family. You need to kill them all for Lucifer to harvest their souls. Maids, chauffers, deputies, family, no one is safe from this messed up 6 year old. It's a VERY linear game where you need to kill people in a certain order and a certain way for a scripted event. Some deaths are very gruesome like the nailgun to the back of the head. It's a very mature game that's almost a puzzle game. A very interesting take on The Omen film. It's not a great ache but it's not bad.It's 20 very short chapters, will take you no less than 7 hours to finish this game. If you just want something to hold off your satanic killing/assassinations... this is a decent game.			"

												Great game with a great story. The controls are sometimes frustrating, but its not really a big issue. The story is kinda short. Still its one of the best indie games on steam			"
