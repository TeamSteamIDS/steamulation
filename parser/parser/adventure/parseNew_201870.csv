												Assassin's Creed Revelations marks the end of two eras as it explores the final adventures of Ezio Auditore and Altair Ibn-La'Ahad.Witnessing Ezio and Altair come to grips with the lives they've lived is a remarkable sight, easily worth one more trip to a world we've experienced for several years.The game's story not only involves Ezio's quest to uncover the secrets of his order, but his budding romance and entanglement in a complex political situation as well. Add in flashbacks to key moments in Altair's life and brief, optional excursions to Desmond's mind in the Animus and this plot is packed to the limit. The most compelling material by far involves Ezio, as his storyline is the most complicated. His quest to discover more information about Altair ties itself to the political and social turmoil in Constantinople. On a basic level, Revelations functions much like the Assassin's Creed games that came before. You're still accepting various missions that task you with chasing, stalking, meeting or killing certain targets. The curse of the franchise has always been that it seems to fill your time with missions that are completely irrelevant to the larger story. Ubisoft more or less avoids that trap this time, mostly because its plot has so many layers.Ubisoft made a number of additions to Revelations in terms of control, weaponry and gameplay. The most critical alteration is simply a button layout change. Players will now directly access a secondary weapon in addition to a primary one.Bombs serve as an extension of your more flexible combat options. Throughout Ezio's time in Constantinople, he'll acquire a wide range of ingredients that can be assembled into three different categories of bombs.Though missions and core combat mechanics remain very familiar, Ubisoft did add a new dynamic to the territorial control element of Revelations. Multiplayer is augmented again this time around, with various new modes, a wealth of customization options, a better interface and even a story mode that will allow players to learn more about the modern day Templars as they progress in the Abstergo facility. Revelations serves its lead characters well and is a very effective bookend. The improvements in graphics and storytelling, combined with already-great voice acting and music, help make this a memorable finale for some of the most interesting video game characters we've seen in this generation.

 Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.  Plot  – Similar to the previous one, this also requires you to play them for you to truly understand what has happened. Following the events from Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood , Desmond Miles, have entered a comatose state and the only way for you to get back in the real world is to relive the remaining gaps of his ancestor. And from this, it’s high recommended that you also play the first Assassin’s Creed as this will also tell the story of the Altair. So in short, there are three stories that can be found in this game. First, is about Desmond Miles and his time on the Animus Island where you are imprisoned while on comatose state. Second is Ezio Auditore, instead of picking up from where it ended on the previous game, time has pass by and he is now on his early 50’s. And lastly, is Altair’s story. Environment and Design  –  The game is set on Istanbul, definitely quite a turn from the previous games. The map is divided into two large areas, though this time it does seem a very large map due to not having any horse to help you get into places but also the underground tunnels are limited. It does take some time for you to get to one place to another because of this. The areas are completely improved and more realistic as there are more animations for the NPCs around you. The game also has a noticeable day and night cycle, and during somewhere midnight, the streets are almost empty. They also made a great job on creating the map; one of my favourite areas is the bazaar. It is an indoor market with open entrances.Unlike the previous games, starting off with this one does seem kind of new. The UI are redesigned so it took me a few minutes to get used to it. And there are couple of times that I had to restart the game due to the screen being stuck on a black screen or having bugs while loading. Also, starting the game without any sound can occur. Gameplay  – A lot of features have been introduced in this game. Now instead of having the usual dual blades, now you get a hidden blade and a hook blade. Even though the hook blade is still used as a weapon during combat, it also offers a huge help on parkours. You can now climb a little higher with help of the extended reach from the hook, give you a huge leap on lanterns and giving more animations during the parkour. This blade can also pull down scaffoldings, damaging those who are nearby and even do flips towards an enemy. Speaking of enemies, the finishing moves also received some updates. Lots of animations have been added and you look more brutal on delivering those finishing moves.Next addition was the creation of bombs. Now at first I had some troubles on using them, in fact I didn’t start using them until I was one fourth of the main story. There are three categories for the bombs that you can create, first are the explosive bombs. This are the bombs made to damage and kill of those who are hit. Next are the tactical bombs, these are used to help you out during combat which gains you a huge advantage towards the enemies. And lastly, are the decoy bombs. This bomb can lure a group of soldiers away from an area to avoid any conflict.A feature removed from the previous game was the ability to lower your notoriety by ripping off wanted posters of yourself. Now the only way to get less suspicious is either bribing a herald or killing an officer in the area. And this is not so bad at all, in fact, when you’ve reached the highest notoriety possible there is a chance that the Templars may assault one of your dens. And to defend them, you will be playing a tower-defense like mini-game. And having  high notoriety, also has a chance that you also get hunted down by a mercenary, this leaves you to keep on your toes at most times.Now, coming back from Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, recruiting assassins are also doable in this game. And in this game, they’ve added a depth on this feature. Some recruits have a backstory with them, requiring you to do a different ask instead of just helping him kill of the Templars who are harassing him. Not only this but there are stories around the brotherhood you are managing once you’ve trained an assassin to the max level. Controls  – Please take note that the controls has received some changes, some keys are altered and some are assigned to a new one. Your weaponry is now divided into two, the main weapon and the secondary equipment. With this, you can combine different weapons and equipment to your liking.  Conclusion  – A game that started with a great story, also ended with an excellent one. If you have played the previous games, I don't see any reason for you not to get this.  And this really left me very satisfied; it really is a one hell of a ride for me. Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.Thank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.Assassin's Creed II - ReviewAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood - Review "

												This game is by far my favourite game out of the AC series.It combines the already good gameplay of its predecessor with innovative mechanics (hookblade ftw!) , some of which even made it to a fully implemented machanic in newer installments of the series.I recommend playing this game AFTER playing thru the other two games of the Ezio-storyline to be able to fully appreciate the story of AC Revelations.The biggest plus however is the wonderfull music by Jesper Kyd, which made the game even more awesome.Not only does the game have a great story, it is also full of wise and deep quotes and speeches:""Even in times of peace, the poor are always under siege. "", Yusuf Tazim--- Ezio: ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted.""Sofia: ""That is rather cynical.""Ezio: ""It would be if it were doctrine. But it is merely an observation on the nature of reality. To say that nothing is true is to realise that the foundations of society are fragile and that we must the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted is to understand that we are the architects of our actions and that we must live with our consequences, whether glorious or tragic.""---""What is a man but the sum of his memories? We are the stories we live! The tales we tell ourselves!"", Clay Kaczmarek(Sixteen)---""You see, the standart ottoman hookblade has two parts, the hook and the blade"", Yusuf Tazim---""Claudia, my dearest sister. I have been in Acre a week now, safe and in high spirits, but prepared for the worst.The men and women who have fed and sheltered me here also give me warning that the road to Masyaf is overrun by mercenaries and bandits not native to this land. What this could mean, I dread to guess.When I first set out from Roma ten months ago, I did so with a single purpose. To discover what our father did not. In a letter written the year before my birth he makes mention of a library hidden beneath the stones of Masyaf castle. A sanctum full of invaluable wisdom.So what will I find when I arrive there?Who will greet me?A host of eager Templars, as I fear most strongly?Or nothing but the whistling of a cold and lonely wind?Masyaf has not been home to the Assassins for almost three hundred years now. Can we still claim it for our own? Are we welcome there?I am weary of this fight, Claudia. Not because I am tired, but because our struggle seems to move in one direction only. Towards chaos.Today I have more questions than answers. This is why I have come so far. To find clarity. To find the wisdom left behind by the great Altaïr, so that I may better understand the purpose of our fight. And my place in it.Should anything happen to me Claudia, should my skills fail me, or my ambition lead me astray, do not seek retribution or revenge in my memory, but fight to continue the search for truth, so that all may benefit.My story is one of many thousands, and the world will not suffer if it ends too soon."", Ezio, in the first letter to ClaudiaMy feelings...[i2.kym-cdn.com]10/10 would feel again			"

												The fourth release in the synchronisation failed... I'm sorry I mean Assassin's Creed series (some of you will get that joke).  Again I highly recomend that people play this series from the start, the storyline is actually very well written, rather I should say storylines since there is more than one at play here (must stop, spoilers).Aside from the usual bugs here and there (what game doesn't have them?) things like suddenly not being able to move past a certain spot because the floor tiles change (just fast run, for some reason a very few spots get treated as if they were ledges) and the usual ""hey I totally didn't jump sideways you did that"" moves this game is a lot of fun, especially if you like scaring everyone around while you scream at your screen (a personal favorite of mine).The graphics continue to improve, well... except for Desmond hisself, there's just something about him and one other character he talks to that just doesn't look right, all the rest though, the character you play the ones you meet and the environment itself, very good.The puzzles you do get in this one can actually be figgured out without having to google ""what squiggly line matches the number this time"" to get past them, I mean I'm reasonably smart, I don't stick my face in the fire to see if it's hot or piddle on an electric outlet to see if it's live, so most puzzles I'm fine with (except which squiggly line matches the number with no clues at all puzzles).In case you've read all this and are still scratching your head wondering wtf does this guy like the game or not, yes I do, so go play it already.

												So this is the first Assasins Creed game I decided to play on PC, considering I usually play it on XBOX. My experience at the beginng with Uplay was awful. Ubisofts pc ports suck. I signed into a account where they never told me it got deactavited, so I had to Unlink uplay, uninstall uplay, reinstall uplay, uninstall the game, and reinstall the game. Yeah. Thanks Ubishit. The game it selfGreat game! Awesome story, great fighting, good graphics, and cool weapons. Its a great AC game! Has everything you want out of Assassins Creed. Ezio is as always a badass.The Game itself: 96/100 DesmondsUbisoft: 1/8 IGN too much uplay			"

												Assassin's Creed: Revelations is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassin's Creed: Revelations is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.Desmond has fallen into a coma state. To save Desmond, Rebecca and Shaun plug him back into the Animus and then put the Animus into a safe mode. In the Animus, Desmond then meet the subject 16. Now Desmond has to find a way to sync nexus so that he can regain his broken mind and get back to real life.Assassin's Creed: Revelations takes us into new atmosphere, the city of Constantinople, which is now has been renamed Istanbul by the Ottoman Empire. The gameplay offers the same gameplay with the previous game with some expanded aspect. The Assassins recruit system has been improved and the Assassins now perform better in combat. The environment has changed and wont feel the same anymore as you're now playing in the eastern part of Europe. Graphics and effects still feels the same except the change in environment settings. With the new setting, it makes the game feels different while still retaining the Assassins style of play. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations it's good game. Single-player:You got new location - it's Constantinople (Istanbul now), weps from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and few new: new knife-hook for the right hand, to much bombs: bomb-thorns, bomb-bait, poison bombs and so on (same time here we are can select battle tactics), not long story but very interesting (mine time 17 hours). We are will got more about Altair and him life; open world, but not big - two Islands (one city). About graphic: this game was make few countries like France, Ukraine and so on. They are make new nice Assassin's Creed game, that graphic to much better, but to much colors at Turkish outfits. That bad to my eyes ^ ^Here Ezio find new girl :3 They are will live long and happy <3 Cos she is redhead (all redheads is cutie<3).Here no sluttie at city ^ ^ only Gipsy :DMultiplayer:Assassin's Creed Revelations it's second game of Assassin's Creed which got multiplayer. Not much chars for select how was it in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and few maps. New gameplay: several new game modes for multiplayer (to much interesting).Graphic at multiplayer looks not perfect like at single-player.			"

Posted: May 7, 2015
												Time to review what I consider to be one of the best ways to end an amazing trilogy off in a nice little bow.To take into consideration:This game was bought by me during the Ubisoft Weekend Sale whereby I got this game for €8.99. ($10.13 in USD and £6.64 in British Pound Sterling) When I intially bought the game, it was the Gold Edition meaning that in this review I will include The Lost Archive, Mediterranean Travel Map Pack and The Ancestors Character Pack.Storyline condensed by me:You play as Ezio Auditore De Firenze, this time continuing off from where the story left off in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood whereby it is Ezio's time to travel to Constantinople. With the history of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad to give Ezio a sense of direction as to what to do and what to discover, he sets off in order to finish off what Altaïr wanted discovered.Pros:  The game has an amazing story that definitely finishes off what the trilogy and the first game wanted to finish off. The fact that you get to have a nice change of pace with switching between Ezio and Altaïr and finding out more about Altaïr's history and the remainder of his life as well as what would be continuing to Ezio's as well. The game's pacing was excellent in this game, in my opinion and the changes gave the game an advantage for me rather than a negative.  The gameplay sticks true to the others being as simple to pick up and play however with new added bonuses such as the Hookblade addition and bomb additions. As well as that, there were definitely bigger emphasis on history and story in this game. Collectables in this game didn't just serve a purpose as a collectable such as the feathers in the other games but you got collectables such as the Niccolò Polo books. I just wished we got more epic moments like Maiden Tower or Hagia Sophia dungeons because they were fun and memorable as hell. They definitely refined the gameplay making a lot of features that were minor annoyances in the previous entries such as the collection of feathers and the incentive to find a map to collect them all for 100% is a bit more toned down. In this game, you collect Animus Data Fragments which could then be used to Desmond's story but when you do reach 50/100, you get a helping hand from the game whereby the locations of the other 40-50 are shown.   What else can I say about the graphics but praise them? Heck, they're the same from every other Ezio Assassin's Creed game and this game pretty much does the same. But what I do love about the Ezio and even the first Assassin's Creed games is that if you have a usual not-so-buffed PC like I do, you'll be able to run this 50 frames-60 frames really well. But this game still delivers having excellent notable moments in which you do have to just stop and observe or maybe take a photograph of how beautiful the visuals were handled. As well as that, the art style in the Lost Archive was quite unique and a pleasure to look at.  As well as that, the edition of more characters and not just characters but even more memorable characters gave the game some charm to me. I mean, who the heck can forget the darling Sofia or the stereotypical ""branch of the family tries to take power of the main family,"" jerk Prince Ahmet?   The edition of more game modes such as the tower defense mini-game (which I honestly wished was implemented more to the game) and the Lost Archive and Desmond Journey missions which was a unique sandbox platforming first-person narrative on the lives and history of Desmond and Subject 16.  The exciting and fun multiplayer which will certainly keep you going after the main quest is over. It makes assassinating all the more rewarding when it's with other players with proper A.I. And the extra characters in the Ancestors Character Pack and the additional extensive maps tying into the main story of the Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack just give the game more valour and quite the experience.Cons:  Money building in this game is unbalanced, in my opinion. Wanting to obtain 100% income in Constantinople could not have been any harder with the game giving you income in the bank every 20 MINUTES! As you can see by my gameplay time, I've exceeded the point in which I should've finished and 100% completed the game due to income griding because it takes sooo long and it's so tedious to get income quickly to pay for monuments. That's another issue I had with the game, the fact that monuments were so expensive and two 20 minute income grinds were what was necessary to upgrade the monuments. (even if everything else is upgraded) In my opinion, the way to have reduced the time spent on getting income was to either 1. Lower down the time taken from 20 to maybe 10 minutes for income. 2. Lower the cost of monuments to perhaps 30,000 so that at least one income obtained at the bank can be enough to pay for one. Or 3. Have more things to do in the after-game besides the challenges for the factions. Which brings me to my next point..  There wasn't a lot to do after the main story was completed. If you were like me and you completed all the side content during the main story such as the ""Desmond's Journey,"" sections, the bonus missions you're given like the Vlad the Impaler mission or even so much as to collect all the Ishak Pasha maps.. you found yourself being barely able to do anything post-game especially if it included grinding for gold. The only thing I found to do was the challenges themselves or the Assassin's Recruit and Job missions which were fun to initiate but for the most part way too long especially if you were not really doing anything. Although the Master Assassin missions were quite fun. ;3  Multiplayer nowadays is unbalanced with new players being partnered up with level 50 players who are certainly veterans of the multiplayer and there was no sense of matchmaking involved. But then again, how can you blame it when not a lot of people are playing this game online? But due to the staggering amount of players who play online, you're crippled and feel like your money wasn't so much worth it for the extra characters and maps because everyone just plays the usual maps over and over again. This makes multiplayer all the more repetitive and honestly turned me off after the 15th time playing and constantly telling myself to give it a shot when it does become repetitive after a while.  Not necessarily a con to be added onto the score but if you aren't a fan of long credits that run on for 16 minutes or so, make sure to find something to do when the credits come about because they aren't going to be as interactive as Assassin Creed 2's gameplay at the credits. x3In conclusion:An excellent game which holds up and has become one of the top best Assassin's Creed games for me. In my opinion, although the gameplay can seem lackluster especially in the multiplayer, this is a game definitely worth playing in your life if you love games with an interesting story topped off with more history than the other editions that came before and character development. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can't wait to review the other Assassin's Creed games and play the ones I haven't yet. I give Assassin's Creed Revelations a 9/10 and a recommendation to buy it but only with the intent of perhaps buying The Lost Archive and the full game if you think you won't be as invested into the multiplayer as I have.Thank you so much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.~ Raphy <3 c: "

												+Constantinopoli is looking great.Much better than Rome.Also its rather big,so there is much to explore.+Mediterranean Defense mini-game.+Improved brotherhood managment.+Altair flashbacks was very memorable.Generally i love the idea of Ezio\Altair crossover.+Improved main characters faces and models.+Improved graphics.+Interesting side missions.+Great ending of Ezio`s trilogy.However they could end Desmond story too,not stretch it to AC3.-Story is weak.Sometimes i cant even understand characters motivations.-Many non-main characters has the same face.Even in Brotherhood and AC2 i didnt noticed that.But here they use the same faces in Altair and Ezio stories.Why they cant just make some more faces?-Bombs.They are not so useful as game tolds you.But developers just force you to use them.-Stealth is ridiculous.-AI is still too dumb.Well,Revelations is ok,but its much  worse than AC2 and Brotherhood.Recommended only for fans of series.

												Assassin’s Creed Revelations is the last game that follows Ezio history. After Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood it was almost impossible to have a better game. Revelations doesn’t have as good of a story, but sincerely I loved it.✬ The graphics and gameplay are good.✬ Twice the game glitched out and I had to restart the synchorization and this is very annoying. However, AC: Revelations has fewer bugs than AC: Brotherhood.✬ Although the story is not as impressive as the AC: Brotherhood, I liked the plot.✬ Relive the moments of Altair's life was fantastic. (I have not played AC I, so maybe that is why I've enjoyed this point)✬ It was very cute to see Ezio in love. After many battles and missions I found that the moments with Sofia gave another dynamic to the game.✬ I did not find the tombs honestly very difficult.✬ I did not like that the story was passed in Turkey (in Ottoman Empire), I think they could have chosen another country like France or Portugal (muahahah)Revelations was not a game made in a rush, in my opinion. It was an epic end to a fantastic story. I will have many memories of Ezio, the best character that AC ever had. Therefore, I recommend that you buy the game, it is very worth it!★★★★★★★★★★ 10/10			"

												This game follows the formula established in AC2 and AC:Brotherhood.  You'll find the same economy system, shop restorations, etc.  The notable additions are:* Extended activities to do once your assassin recruits level up* Craftable Bombs* Assassin building defense minigame (essentially tower defense)The tower defense minigame is a bit annoying, but I'm glad they introduced it since in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, there weren't any serious consequenses for allowing your notariety to max out (by doing ""illegal"" things).If you haven't played either of the prequals, hold off on playing this one, since the story picks up where they left off.  I don't think that the first Assassin's Creed game is necessary, however, to know what's going on.I enjoyed AC2 and AC:Brotherhood and I enjoyed AC:Revelations as well.  They stuck to what worked in the previous games and added a bit more.  I'm glad I didn't get it when it was full priced but I think anything around $10 is easy to justify for this title.EDIT: I noticed, as I was recently playing, that I really like the NPC models/textures.  They are significantly more alive and colorful that they have been in the past AC games.  Quite impressed.			"

												Pros:- Great gameplay.- Great graphics. - Decent story.- Fun and enjoyable city exploration. - Fantastic way to conclude Ezio's trilogy and life as an Assassin.Cons: - There were a few glitches here and there, such as when you have to fight a man called Shakulu later in the game, the game crahses and stops responding. Those who experience this issue should go into task manager, right click on the process ""ACR.exe"" and click ""set affinity"". From there, disable all threads except for one. Core 0 should remain ticked. This will make the game lag heaps, but after the fight has finished you can turn them back on. You don't need to restart in between re-enabling. - Again, much like ACB the game is reletively short at only 9 sequences.			"

												So you've put in the work!  You created a pitch black cape, grab a black leather glove (from OJ Simpson fame) taped a butter knife to your wrist and put on a raiders hooded sweatshirt.  You're totally ready for a new adventure as everyone's favorite assassin Enzio Auditore.   You start up the game excited to finally see what really happened during the events of the previous game.. (cliff hangers tend to do that)...Nothing more needs to be said as the real life story isn't driven forward much at all in this game, but that doesn't detract away from the brilliance of this wonderful game..The Story....  Back again As Desmond Miles, only this time Desmond Miles is in a coma, brought upon by his interactions with the Apple from the previous game.  Fear not, instead of seeking out medical attention, or generally waiting for Desmond to wake up as going into a coma is a serious side effect of the Animus.. his trusty companions decide the best course of action is to strap Desmond into the Animus for yet another fun and exciting adventure as Enzio..  Immediately you'll notice something Enzio is a geriatric now.  He's old, he looks to have aged about 40 years since Brotherhood, but we'll let that slide because in all honesty Enzio is probably the coolest fictional old guy since the Dos Equis guy.. Enzio finds himself in Constantinople, on a mission to discover the secrets of Altairs (the assassin from the first game, for those who don't already know)  Waltzing up and just going into the library would be too easy.. we are talking Assassin's Creed here.  So after a nice little tutorial missing you're thrust into Constantinople, all alone, broke, and injured..  The story picks up from there...  or it doesn't depending upon how you look at it..The Gameplay..  it's fairly familiar by this point, run, jump, collect, kill, sneak... a few major additions in this game was the hook blade, a nice little addition, also you can now create bombs, lethal, stun and Smoke varieties..  These are pretty much game changers once you get used to how they work..  Another addition is red and yellow trails when you open up eagle sense.  It's kind of cheap in all honesty, but sometimes you just want to watch the world burn..   Towers used from the last game are back.. only now they are no longer called Borgia towers (since the Borgia family was pretty much removed from the AC universe in the second game)  Now they are known as Dens, which you unlock to gain a new hideout for your assassins.Another neat addition to the game was den defense.. (which is a simplified tower defense game), while the concept was pretty neat, in 24 hours of playing, I only managed to initiate 2 den defenses.. The first tutorial one, and the second one happened not too long after that..  It wasn't for lack of trying as I left my suspicion meter in the red for hours, and paid close attention to the map, wandering around various parts..  Needless to say I think this aspect was broken in my game for some reason..   The recruitment system is back, and it's been expanded upon quite considerable.  You can now reach level 15 with individual assassins, and you can set them as leaders of the individual dens.  Furthermore, the quest system seemed to receive an overhaul as well.  Now you can have your assassins take over a city, (instead of just quest there)  when you're in control you receive cash, experience and bomb making materials.  A neat addition to say the least, especially as money in this game is fairly difficult to come by until you've opened up almost all the shops and banks.. As well as playing Enzio, you'll get the chance to play as Altair.. although his missions are fairly limited but are really interesting and help show what became of Altair after you left him.. Overall..  I'd recommend this game, although after playing Assassin Creed 2 and Brotherhood, this game felt like more of the same, where as the previous games seemed to get better as time went on.  Although it could have just been me starting to get burned out on Assassin Creed.  Also the game didn't feel quite as epic or as well put together as the previous 3 games.. Not just the story but the bugs, glitches, and general unstable nature of the game.. especially when closing the program down, which crashes 90% of the time.  Almost inexcusable at this point in time, matters are made worse because the crashing often times results in a locked up computer. *Quick Note.. Multiplayer is still alive in this game, but it's pretty much on life support.  After playing Multiplayer long enough to get level 20 I can say that any new comers to multiplayer will be in for a very daunting task.  You'll likely be matched with level 50's who have all the best perks equipped..  Although after I gained some levels and learned the game it was more fun than I expected.. Although some things a bit cheap, that comes with almost every online game..			"

												As in the previous titles, Revelations is a nice continuation of the series, but the flaws in the franchise begin to pop out.  The storytelling is stilted and generic as always, leaving the player wanting something in the way of literary ingeunity.  The graphics department has truly outdone itself, with this being one of the best-looking games of its generation.  One major problem with Revelations is that the size of Constantinople seems dwarfed by Rome from Brotherhood, despite the fact of it being 3x the size at the times the game take place.  The campaign is also noticeably shorter and playtime is likewise surprisingly shortened.  Overall, it maintains the great aspects of the franchise but seems to have taken a step backward rather than forward.			"

Assassin's Creed Revelations ReviewThis review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.I love the Assassin's Creed franchise, but this is by far the weakest link in its chain. It feels like Ubisoft took everything that made AC: Brotherhood great and then added a few new features that drag the game down.Pros Great graphics (considering its age). Fun gameplay. Constantinople looks and feels great. Free running hasn't changed, except for the addition of the ""Hookblade"". Great story that will leave fans of the Ezio trilogy satisfied. Ezio is older but still a fantastic protagonist. Altair is also great, although he has a new voice actor.Cons Tower defence game is so unambitious and irritating. New notoriety system is awful, knock over a civilian and you get 25% notoriety, renovate a building and you get 25% notoriety. There are only two ways of losing your notoriety. Bribing an official will loose 25% (But you can't always find them) and killing an eye witness who never witnessed you commit a crime will loose 75% (they too can be hard to find), but they are usually protected by guards and if you are seen attacking them your notoriety increases again. If you are notorious for a certain amount of time templars will attack your dens and you will have to take them back using the tower defence game. Recruiting assassins is slightly different, where you would have killed a group of guards you now have to do a quest or race them. It gets to the point where you don't want to recruit them. A new weapon if forced onto you for the whole game, the bomb is rarely needed and in my opinion doesn't belong in the game. Nothing has really changed throughout the series, characters still handle the same, the parkour is still the same and he structure of the missions are still similar.I haven't tried the multiplayer (I never really liked MP in AC) but I imagine the multiplayer is dead given the age of the game.SummaryThere is probably a few things that I have missed but I would only recommend this game if you are a fan of the series and you want to see a conclusion to two of the best protagonists in the franchise. I would only buy it if it is on sale, it may be worth £14.99 but I would wait until Steam has a sale, where you could pick it up for around £3.75.			"

												I was going to write a short joke of a review but this time I was so impressed by the game that I had to take a serious tone. I am genuinely impressed by how much this game has to offer. It is not so much a revolutionary improvement of the AC formula but instead a perfection of almost every single mechanic in the game. Since this is the fourth game in the series you can clearly tell that they have had a lot of time to improve and polish every detail of their now distinct form of combat, stealth, free-running and so on. Although the combat is still pretty much the same as in brotherhood the animations have been cleaned up and a lot of new ones added. This makes the combat feel very fluid and the addition of the hook-blade makes for some extremely awesome and brutal finishing moves. Even though this is still the same parry and counter based combat from the previous games, it has been polished to perfection and is the best the series has ever seen.This game does a great job of tying up the stories of Ezio and Altair leaving you with a very satisfying conclusion and setting up for a new assassin in the next game. The storytelling mechanics that the game employs are superb and make use of inception like memories inside of memories. This is complemented by a less exiting but still interesting story about the sultans of Constantinople and their struggle for power. While this may not be as good as the conspiracies of the second game, it serves as a well fitting background for the main story of Desmond and Ezio.In my honest opinion this is my favorite AC game so far and well worth your money.

												It's kind of impossible to follow all the Assassin's Creed yearly releases, so I'm still 2 games behind. Although this is inferior to Brotherhood I did enjoy Revelations more, maybe because I was a bit tired of Assassin's Creed when I played the previous one. I enjoyed Constantinopla and Ezio's final chapter, he is truly one of the best protagonists of this generation and AC story is more enjoyable if we see it as Ezio's personal journey. All the crap around Animus, Desmond and the gods is a big, giant mess.3,5/ 5			"

												A reasonably good addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise. I say 'reasonably' because at its release, I didn't find it quite as groundbreaking as Brotherhood or AC2, but there are things present in Revelations that must be seen if you call yourself a fan of Assassin's Creed. Even disregarding the fact that Altair, Desmond and Ezio are in the same room at the same time in one of the best scenes in the series' history, it's a nice send off to our favorite Italian assassin.It's been real, Ezio Auditore. I'm gonna miss all the times we hookbladed up Hagia Sophia and punching those minstrels in the face.			"

												I had read it online somewhere and it is true – Assassin’s Creed Revelations is the best way of seeing off both Ezio and Altair. All good stories must come to an end and the superb character of Ezio, whom you played with since that first fist-fight in the streets of Florence, all the way to the very last sequence in Revelations, could not have wished for a better ending.The game goes on as you might expect, though everything is again technically enhanced and better than in the previous installment. Ezio continues to be a spiffy, sharp-tongued and cavalier signiore, who blends beautifully into a superbly designed Ottoman Konstantinople, where you can feel as if in a real city, with markets, slums, palaces and all. Sure there are the continuing problems, such as guard intellect and the fact that they simply can’t seem to remember that you were the guy who just now killed someone, and there is this new addition of bombs which is just a little bit too much, however all in all, the game delivers.The ending of the game, in how it is sequenced, and Ezio’s words both towards Altair and as to his own life, could not have been said better and although there is a sadness in seeing this great character leave, there is also the satisfaction that it simply could not have been done better. Congratulations Ubizoft on sending off one of the most beloved game characters ever in an appropriate and dignified manner.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Revelations is the 4th mainline installment of the Assassin's Creed Franchise and as such I'll start by saying if you haven't played at least Assassin's Creed II then the events of this game might just be going over your head. However in terms of raw gameplay it's still a fun game, with fairly basic combat mechanics which are coupled with some crazy death animations (and of course the craziness of ragdoll physics). Many a demented cackle has been produced as bodies have been flung, or barged off of a tall building - I should probably seek help...The missions and quests are fairly generic, and if I'm honest there aren't too many standout moments in the game mission wise aside from the final run (which is now becoming something of a trademark in the Assassin's Creed series). Storywise I felt again the game never really got going while playing, yet looking back it clearly did. This was a far more streamlined Assassin's Creed game compared to the other installments, and a quick check of the played time shows I managed to complete the main storyline within 13hours of gameplay. This could mean one of two things: There was a reduction in superficial sidequests to advance the mainstory; or I simply didn't bother exploring and living in the world. The Story content itself is finally satisfying, as in previous Assassin's Creed games they never really explore the actual origins of the Brotherhood. Thankfully this game does, and it presents it in such a way that it finally ties the first Assassin's Creed directly into the rest of the franchise (rather than it being some previous ancestor of Desmond that he's forgot all about). If I'm honest, I think I preferred the small glimpes into Altiar's history, and the 'payoff' was nice. Of course Ezio's story is progressed along nicely too, and he's aged, has changed slightly and has a rugged man beard that inspired The Last of Us.They even manage to build up Desmond's character, even if he is in a coma and trapped within the Animus! And of course there's some ball twisting progression of The Firsts in there too. So overall Revelations managed to bring together the 3 (all in 1) Main Characters of the Franchise and progress them along nicely. I just feel like the City's mission was a little lacklustre as the fight between the Ottomons and the Byzanite's wages across Istanbul. I never really felt I was involved or playing a critical role in the outcome - perhaps I'm missing the point and Ezio wasn't a crucial figure in those events. The city design itself is an interesting one too, as I felt way more relaxed playing the game. It didn't feel as open or as grand as Italy in ACII or Rome in AC: Brotherhood. It was close and pretty low profile, and for some reason it didn't feel as though I was ever in any real danger, despite the game's attempts to throw danger at you in the form of the 'Awareness' meter. Which brings me onto the Assassin's Den Management subgame - it never triggered for me. Perhaps I was a great Assassin Master who managed to keep the Assassin's activities a secret from the evil Templars, but outside of the pre-planned tutorial on the Tower Defense Sub-Game, it never happened again in the 13 hours I played the game. Overall I'm happy I played Assassin's Creed: Revelations, as it does do some fan service to tie all of the loose character plots together, and brings Desmond to life. However, I think at this point if you haven't enjoyed Assassin's Creed II/Brotherhood then Assassin's Creed: Revelations is probably not for you. One for the fans. "

Posted: July 1, 2015
												This game is an odd entry to this series. Not odd as in bad, but odd as in often quite different from previous entries but simultaneously repeating past mistakes. Often, sadly, lacking polish -- it seems like they didn't have time to properly finish this game.As always, I will go through the different elements and parts of the game in a haphazard order.Immediately you'll notice Ezio looks quite different from the previous entry. He is much older, even though only 5 years have passed since Brotherhood. Besides the age, his whole facial structure is different and he has strangely hazel eyes. Not really anything to complain about, it just threw me off since he doesn't really even look like the same character.They seem to be trying to go for the 'weary traveler in search of answers/far away from home' sort of character development with Ezio here. That works out okay. The story in this game is, at the very least, better than AC1, II, or Brotherhood -- not to say that is much of a standard.Style-wise, we've departed from ACII/Brotherhood. Different UI, enemy types, textures to go along with the Constantinople/Masyaf setting.For the music, Lorne Balfe is in charge as opposed to Jesper Kyd this time. He does a great job. The music has its own sound quite different from II or Brotherhood. It's some of the best music in the series. Dramatic and powerful pieces really help bring together the feel of the game -- Ezio's last adventure/searching for answers at the end of a journey.For the gameplay, we still have chain kills and assassin initiates you can call on anytime. The game is still absurdly easy, though they made chain kills slightly harder by making the time you have to counter a little less and varying up enemy types -- some are harder to counter/might need to switch weapons. A small improvement, but not nearly enough.They added a hookblade and ziplines and the game talks about these things as if they're really important. They aren't. Hookblade is a replacement for climb leap, and it looks really stupid compared to regular double blades. Ziplines just let you...move across rooftops slightly faster? I guess? Again, hardly makes any difference.They added a bomb creation system that goes just too far in complexity for anyone to devote time or effort towards. I don't really mean that it is difficult or complicated to understand. I just mean that adding a system that allows for creation of different effects -- distraction, crowd dispersal, AoE attacks, crowd attraction -- should be WAY easier. I shouldn't have to craft that stuff, it should just always be on hand and easily refillable. Good idea, badly executed.They added a castle defense minigame for your 'assassin dens' that indicate your control of the city -- like the Borgia towers of AC:B, except you have to defend these. The minigame isn't bad if you're on KB+M, though I know it's not great if you're on a controller. I'm one of those weirdos who plays AC with KB+M and prefers it. It's an okay minigame, but it just seems sort of thrown in there, and lacking any depth or reason to keep playing it.Constantinople is pretty and large. It is not quite as pretty as Brotherhood's Rome, partly because they decided to apply this gross smoky visual effect over the screen at all times. Besides that, a lot of the city is just colored brown and dark green, just sort of a splotchy vomit color. So how is it beautiful then? The citizens, unlike AC1, II, and Brotherhood, actually have more routines and activities in the city. So, atmospherically, it is superior to the previous entries. In the other games, citizens walk around and gather in circles -- that's pretty much it. Here you will see vendors at their shops, fishermen actually fishing, beggars begging, and so on. The populace is lively and realistic, and it helps a lot in making Constantinople worth exploring and experiencing.For side content, there is simply much less when compared to Brotherhood. It actually just seems like they didn't have time to finish many missions. There are 'thief contracts' -- but only two. This game has less of the focus on the three factions -- mercenaries, courtesans (Romanies), and thieves. Which is good, it was really odd how ACII/B were so fixated on them. So the side content ends up being much less plentiful and it detracts from Constantinople -- just less stuff to do here. The lack of finish is a sad reminder of how they could make these games so much better if they would take their time and not rush them out yearly.The story, as I said before, is at least better than the 3 previous entries in the series. There is much more structure, more explanation of Ezio's motives and reasoning for doing this or that, and things happen more naturally. Ezio is looking for answers in Altair's vault, he needs five Masyaf keys, he must search for them in underground crypts and on the bodies of templars/byzantines. He writes to his sister, Claudia, frequently. His letters to his sister are used simply to remind the player of why Ezio is doing what he is doing, what his motivations are for continuing and what his thoughts on current events are. This is very helpful to the player and a huge improvement compared to the simply shoddy storytelling in the previous games.The Masyaf keys let us play as Altair in memories that occur after the events of AC1. As I've explained at great length before, AC1 has bad storytelling, terrible voice-acting, and Altair is a stupid character. However, Revelations took this opportunity to make something decent out of Altair's story. He has a real voice actor who actually sounds Arabian/Middle-Eastern and his story has drama, loss, and death all complemented by Balfe's excellent soundtrack. Altair being able to invent and wield a gun in the 1200s, however, is a little silly -- the sci-fi crap doesn't excuse it.The separate part of the storyline concerns the heir to the Ottoman throne, the Byzantine templars, and a pair of breasts  known as Sofia. The player is sort of expected to believe that Sofia, a twenty-something book store owner, falls in love with fifty-something Ezio, because the developers wanted to give him a happy ending. Whatever, it's dumb but I expect it from these games. Somehow, the player is expected to care about the Ottoman story but I don't know why anyone would, the game even goes as far as to tell Ezio that it's none of his business by the end anyway.They really enjoy bending history when it comes to the Ottomans v. Byzantines business. The Ottoman Empire was quite the utopia and the Byzantines quite oppressive and evil according to this game's revisionist history. These games always slip in highly modern viewpoints about fairness before the law and equal treatment that never really existed in the 1500s to appeal to moderns playing this game.Desmond is much less annoying because he's in a coma and trapped inside the animus with Subject 16. The first-person platforming sections that go into Desmond's past are just fine, nothing too bad. Worth going through. So that's something of a plus compared to the atrocious dialogue in II and Brotherhood between all the modern characters.Still, decent enough to be worth playing and having enough that it does better than the other AC games to be worth buying -- so, like Brotherhood, pick it up when it's cheap and go through it.

This is my opinion of Assassin's Creed Revelations                                                                                                                                                 AspectRatingStory8.5Graphics8.5Sound9.0Gameplay8.0Overall8.5Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average Despite adding a number of features, Assassin's Creed Revelations is very similar to its predecessors, and that's both its biggest strength and weakness. There's nothing wrong with Assassin's Creed. It's a great franchise with unique, compelling and well-designed gameplay. The catch is that we've effectively been doing similar things for the last several years now. Incremental upgrades are more than welcome, but at some point players need a new experience.That said, Revelations serves its lead characters well and is a very effective bookend. The improvements in graphics and storytelling, combined with already-great voice acting and music, help make this a memorable finale for some of the most interesting video game characters I've seen.  If you've been following the lives of Altair and Ezio this long, you owe it to yourself to see their last adventure.			"

												Assassins creed revelations is an open word action game which is extremely popular for the parkour and its story.Ezios trilogy is my favourite of the series and i think that its worth for everyone to play it.Dont mind the graphics they are extremely good for the game.Revelations itself is very good and i absolutely recommend it.It took me 17hours and i only focused at story,so if you play it for first time,you ll probably spend around 25-30hours so its worth the price(at sale 100%).The main story is awesome it continues the 3rth part of ezio's trilogy and its not dull.The sound is not disapointing and i really like the original songs from the older ac games.Things you can do(you can parkour in the whole city,do different type of side missions,create a crew of assassins,craft weapons/etc,help civilians,and much more things you can do.I truly believe that its worth to try assassins creed revelations and i strongly recommend it			"

												As compared to brotherhood, there may not be many new things added to the game. There's the hook blade and bomb crafting which are both excellent. The Den Defense and Desmond platform missions are however, not so great. Apart from these there have been many tweaks, but they are all minor. It feels and plays just like Brotherhood. This is the ONLY flaw in the game. The game is terrific in all departments. The Story is the best I've ever heard. It's absolutely stellar. There are a lot of moments in the game that quite frankly WILL take your breath away and leave you with goosebumps. Storytelling has been improved by miles and the cinematic cut scenes are excellent. Ubisoft has done a great job in tying up all the main characters together and the story really comes together in the end. A perfect goodbye to Altair and Ezio Auditore. Their stories are legendary, they are an inspiration and they will never be forgotten. Ending could not be more perfect. It's explained perfectly and really stirs up a lot of excitement for what's to come ahead. Assassin's Creed Revelations : ""Checkmate. Your Move Assassin's Creed III.			"

												According to Oxford Dictionary, the term Revelations means (as a noun) - A surprising and previously unknown fact that has been disclosed to others - (mass noun) he making known of something that was previously secret or unknown / Used to emphasize the remarkable quality of someone or something. Basing on that, the title Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is a suitable heading for the third and final instalment of Ezio Auditore da Firenze yet this time, it also tells the story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad basically giving both of them the closing curtain call. However, if you want to ultimately see the final chapter, it’s advisable to also see the short film Assassin's Creed: Embers. Nevertheless, even though it’s the final chapter for both of these famous assassins, the game plays out the weakest of Ezio’s trilogy and, unfortunately worse than the first Assassin’s Creed game.The franchise Assassin’s Creed grew way too fast in popularity as shown during the past three games. The first had a decent storyline and approach whilst Assassin’s Creed II added many more features that made Assassin’s Creed I look like a tech demo. However, in Brotherhood, even though it’s my favourite out of the four, starting to show cracks in the storyline thus using the ‘band aid’ approach, especially when playing the modern day characters with Desmond and those obnoxious kids. Seriously, it was so messed up, the game can do without them. However, this ‘tradition’ carried on into Revelations yet, this time, those kids played a minor role and thankfully, Desmond now has a backstory via the Animus Shards scattered throughout the map of Constantinople.Revelations, whilst not a bad game overall, is the game that needs to tie up loose ends from the previous Assassin’s Creed games (including the DS / PSP ones). It looks like Assassin’s Creed was getting way out of proportion with its storyline with plenty of ‘WTF’ moments near the end. It feels like Ubisoft have no idea where this franchise is heading too thus making this game the closing chapter and start fresh if another game was in production (for which it was, titled Assassin’s Creed III). If you managed to get on hold of the Animus Edition, it comes with the Assassin's Creed Encyclopaedia explaining the history as best as they can. It’s a worthwhile addition if you want to stitch up the potholes this game has created. I guess the game can be viewed as the scapegoat, the victim of its own success that had to be released to get some closure to this fantastic series.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/assassins-creed-revelations/user-reviews/2200-12651770/7 / 10			"

												This game has been getting a lot of criticism, from players and critics alike, but I URGE fans of the franchise to muster all their patience and stay with this game through the somewhat lacking opening and certain annoying gameplay elements. Why? Because Revelations truly shines where it MATTERS — the story. The finale is breathtaking, bringing an excellent conclusion to the stories and lives of two remarkable characters, Ezio and Altair. I will admit that the first chapters may seem somewhat ""filler-ish"", and Desmond side-story is marred by questionable gameplay, but trust me, your patience will be well rewarded. Reviewers complain about villains, saying they're not ""bad"" enough (Gamesradar review), not as fun as the Borgias. Way to miss one of the points of the entire series. The game makes an emphasis on the fact that Templars are not ""evil"", and Assassins are not ""good"" — those two are merely world views, perhaps one with more merit than the other, but neither is infallible. People fail to realize that Assassins are essentially a terrorist/intelligence organization that forges alliances and ""removes"" people to further its nebulous cause, a distant idea of freedom, not to ""uphold good"". And it makes sense that this conclusion is not apparent to those who've only played AC1/AC2/B, since both protagonists were young and foolishly romantic back then. This is why I consider it very important to play Revelations, as it sheds light on the bigger picture of the ancient struggle and the fragility and imperfection of the Creed, through the wise eyes of aging Ezio and Altair. If this fails to move you, then there is exploration of mortality, regrets, retrospective, love of life — Revelations greatly amplifies the beautiful sadness of watching Ezio and Altair's lives come to an end.As for the gameplay, combat is a little bit tougher than in Brotherhood (kick-spamming is no longer stupidly effective + enemies are tougher), 100% synchronization in individual missions is quite hard to achieve, thanks to simple but better challenges, such as ""lose no health"", whereas Brotherhood mostly peppered you with stealth challenges which were rather simple, especially with the crossbow. Furthermore, the Assassin training ""mini-game"" is now much more rewarding, not to mention that the old and wise Ezio is now a true mentor, who gets a chance to work with individual aspiring master assassins personally, through the assassin side-quests — which, by the way, touch upon the moral dilemmas, ""gray area"" and the paradoxes of the Creed. AC:Revelations fleshes out the Assassin brotherhood theme MUCH better than AC:Brotherhood, and I'm amazed that so few people recognize this. Your ""pet"" assassins finally have some sort of personality, and you feel more compelled to keep them safe. Another nice touch is that each assassin randomly chooses favorite tactics and weapon sets (yes, there are even crossbow/hidden blade assassins), and they use bombs, too.Also, if you hate the Tower Defense minigame, it's VERY easy to avoid entirely — just make sure you watch your notoriety meter. The only time you're forced to play it is the first den defense ""tutorial"" mission, and it's hardly something to complain about. Hell, some might even enjoy it (I almost did). You also don't have to craft bombs if you don't feel like it.I put this game easily on par with Assassin's Creed 2, and as far as emotional engagement is concern, I would put it even above any of its great predecessors.

												Dear Claudia,This game's storyline is amazing. It details the final missions of your brother, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, while introducing a bunch of different and memorable characters and locations for you to explore.It also explores the memories of Altair Ibn-La'ahad, one of the greatest mentors that shaped the way the Creed is today. It picked up where his story left off, in the first game in the series, and gave a satisfying yet saddening ending.Although the game sometimes makes me jump off a wall when I don't want to, I still love this game.Truely yours,Daemonic			"

												Requires finishing the first two parts of the Ezio trilogy (AC2 and Brotherhood) beforehand, in order to fully engage in the story. I also recommend finishing AC1, in order to appreciate Altair's expanded story. Revelations is largely more of the same: while a fair portion of the gameplay is repeated from Brotherhood (especially the city quests), it ties up several loose ends with the Ezio, Altair, Desmond and Subject 16 storylines, and adds some fun new features - such as ziplining with the hookblade - which help make it a worthwhile playthrough. I found the Desmond memories more interesting than the Ezio storyline and enjoyed learning about Subject 16 in The Lost Archive DLC, both of which are set in environments reminiscent of Portal, making a nice diversion from the Constantinople setting. The addition of both the Mediterranean Defence meta-game and bomb-making seemed rather superfluous to the rest of the game but somewhat interesting nonetheless. I would have liked more voice-acting in the Animus database entries, as the feature seems to have been dropped for this iteration. After four games set in very similar locales, I'm looking forward to a change of environment with AC3.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												It is with genuine sadness that I come to the end of Ezio's story. If you are looking for innovative gameplay, that ship has sailed, as the mechanics are essentially an evolution from AC: Brotherhood. There are a few interesting additions, such as unique missions for master assassins or the hookblade for climbing, but its not going to win any awards in this department. However, where this shines is the writing. For someone invested in Ezio's story, it was a fine wrap up and send off for him - and as a part of this we see Altair's life fleshed out in key scenes. We have another plot update for Desmond, and you can also play through parts of his memories (In a somewhat portal-esque puzzle based fashion) in order to understand more about him before his capture by the Templars.If you are new to the series, I wouldn't get this straight away. Play the others first, and if you want to see the end of Ezio and Altair's tale it is a great experience - if a little short for my liking.However - Ezio playing the lute dressed as a minstrel singing songs about beating people up? Too good to miss.			"

The RPG Aspects of the game are great, plus the (assassin's) guild leveling system and the constant income / town rebuilding system motivates a lot.Additional features include a tower defense game for districts (fun the first time, strange anytime else, though), loads of secrets to be found and actual, real historical backgrouds for (fictional and real) persons and places.And, mind you, the Hidden Blade. And Bombs. And Parachutes. And Poison. And Trowing Knives. And Swords. And Guns. And Crossbows. And... Well, you get the idea: If it kills people, it's in this game ;-)			"

												Assassins Creed Revelations had a few ups and a few downs. For instance, the main quest of the game is to open a library that finding the 5 keys takes up 90% of the main story. But some of the additions to the game including The Lost Archives dlc which made some of Brotherhood make sense and some of the character development make sense, I would go to say that this game was alright. My biggest problem with it by far was the map and the river separating it. It wasn't the end of the world but it definitely was annoying.			"

Assassin's Creed: Revelations is a parkour beat'em up adventure game. With his mind shattered and overwhelmed by the memories of his ancestors, the Assassins connect Desmond's body to the Animus in hopes his mind finds its way back to him. Desmond relives the last memories of Ezio Auditore, now a grizzled mentor, who, while retracing the steps of Altaïr, arrives in Ottoman-controlled Constantinople.Pros: The game add new mechanics, among which the Ottoman Hook-Blade that allows ziplining and greater reach in parkour, as well as an interesting crafting system for a variety of bombs. Loot is no longer meaningless, as it now consists of components for the bomb crafting. As opposed to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the open-world isn't stretched with large masses of empty land, but consists of one much larger city, Constantinople, whose design is a much better city to run and jump in than Rome was. You must now train your assassins to Master levels and assign them as Den Leaders of neighborhoods you take over from the Bezantine Templars, or risk having them take back control. Also, the exploration ""dungeons"" are much grander than before, crumbling in your passing rather than just dropping a convenient ladder for when you fall. When Desmond logs out of his ancestor's memory, he arrives on Animus Island, a world template within the Animus' OS, where he can platform through the program and think back on his childhood in the Assassin Farm by unlocking Animus fragments found throughout the game.Cons: The game is very familiar, very much like the previous ones, and graphics haven't seen much improvement. The Tower Defense-like mini game of defending your dens against Templar retaliation just doesn't fit in this action game, nor does the Desmond platforming from The Lost Archive DLC. It is close to impossible to maintain influence in foreign cities through sending your assassins on mission, unless you dedicate yourself to just a few cities, otherwise by the time you complete a sidequest or two your influence will have re-dropped dramatically.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!Assassin's Creed: Revelation is another good chapter of the series, and a great closing to the Ezio trilogy. If you enjoyed the story of the previous games, you'll want this one. But it's once again ""more of the same"", so don't even consider if you are tired of the mechanics you've been playing with so far.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Posted: September 15, 2016
												So after starting this game in 2012 I finally came around to finishing it in 2016... This is because playing a big open world game like this feels like a rather big undertaking for me. Not that the games are bad, just that they demand alot of time and I rather not get into it unless I feel I have that time without feeling stressed about it. Once I started up again I played it almost every day until I finished though.I'm gonna review this in the aspect of it being the last part of the Ezio Trilogy. I was delighted to spend more time with Ezio Auditore, and get to some sort of conclusion with him and Desmond.Compaired to the other two, I have to say this is my least favourite though. The settings are not as varied or beautiful as in AC II, nor are the missions. Constantinople is the only city you see (and a rather bland one at that) apart from a dreary underground cave town, and a bit of the boring Masyaf by the end of the game. I miss the horse riding from previous installments (though I seem to be in the minority there), colors, the warmth of characters like Leonardo Da Vinci, & more humour. There are no set pieces that stand out like before, apart from SPOILER! running along burning ships in the harbour. SPOILER END!I don't mind playing an older Ezio, that suits the story progression fine, and he is a wonderful man when he is more wheathered & experienced. But I did not feel as emotionally involved as I did in II or even Brotherhood. The supporting voice cast are also less stellar than in past efforts, with exception of John De Lancie.In II, we got to experience Ezio grow from a young scoundrel to a avenger of his family, and to a defender of the people and freedom in general. The story moved at a steady pace, and I shed a tear over the tragedies in his life, as well as stood in awe over the beauty of the scenery at times, accompanied by the exquisite music by Jesper Kyd. It was close to a perfect game in my opinion.So it was a tough act to follow, naturally. Brotherhood did well though, almost as well.All 3 are well worth your time and effort, but as they progressed they became less effective in their storytelling, and bugs and glitches increased as Ubisoft released them with what felt like increasing haste. Sure, one should ride on popularity and try and respond to fans and consumers thirst for more, but not at the expense of quality control.I suspect also that the writers didn't know how to end Desmonds, Ezios or Altairs stories, and just made it up as they went along, which is an oportunity lost. For me the ending of the trilogy left me wanting, but not for more or for clearer answers, but rather to replay AC II, to remember the series when it was at it's best.			"

 Introduction Assassin's Creed Revelations takes place in the 21st century.You play as Ezio Auditore, who is older and near the end of his days.This game is the last chapter for the ""Ezio Trilogy,""For the final chapter of Ezio, you continue to gain better fighting techniques and weapons such as the Hook Blade, while attempting to open Altair's hidden room with the masyaf keys. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed Revelations seems to have been more stealth based, rather than a full on assault.Gameplay seems much quicker due to the Hook Blade making you able to travel quicker.There are separate side missions where you have an army of Assassin's, almost like a tower defense game. Combat Combat has been modified a bit, including tripping opponents, rolling over them, and using a hook blade to give you better fighting techniques.Fighting seems to have sped up, with a lot more different ways of attacking, including throwing grenades at enemies.StoryFinishing off the Ezio series, you're trying to collect all of the masyaf keys to open Altair's hidden room with his secrets in it.The second part of the story, is you're in Constantinople training Assassins, and taking bad the city from the Templars.Finishing the story, you open Altair's room, and you reveal his secrets. Graphics The graphics have improved from the second game, with pretty god rays, and a sand like screen effect which fits well.Coloring is nice enough not to use SweetFX, and skin textures/hair textures are nice.I played in 4K DSR 60fps maxed, and the game looked pretty, and the textures looked good with it like this. Optimization It was pretty glitchy in this game.I was getting frame drops from 57-60 on whatever settings I used, and cutscenes would lag if they changed camera angles.I should be able to run this game with no issues, but even on lowest settings I was having issues, but I got use to them. Bugs Characters would stutter/lag at random points, whether it's an NPC or an enemy.A few times I got stuck in the map.Invisible spots that you can't walk through. Personal Experience From the first game, up til this one: it has been my favorite.Aside from the few glitches, the story really interested me and the some of the characters were really funny.Overall I loved it, and will play again in the future I'm sure. Pros Great story and ending.Wonderful characters and their graphics.Fun game with nice ideas. Cons Micro-stutters.Lag.Glitches. Conclusion Ending the series of Ezio, this will complete his journey and is a great idea to play if you've played the past two.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise.

												+) Amazing story like always. Epic ending! like no other.+) Improved Characters for developed story. This will catch your mind in instance.+) Difficulty of battles have gone a little higher which is just about right. Last series was too easy.+) Dropping rocks, Collapsing structures and floors, falling down the pit! This game has raised its bar. Cheers!-) Thief mission has poor description. It never told me that! So how the heck should I know to do what you ask me to do! Making me waste time will you?-) Opening stores raises notoriety. This was really bothering, for it was extra work. The fact that ways to lower your notoriety was limited than before made this more drastic. It was a buzz kill for I had to stop a lot of times to bribe and such. However they did made the gage go slower so I don't know, maybe it was ok but all I remember now is that it really dragged my buzz.-) Fast Travel needs to have map clicking ability. Searching through list was inconvenient and poor. I mean come on. Still?-) I don't know if it's Windows 10 comaptibility issue but the game twitches in every first launch.			"

												After not playing an Assassin's Creed game for a fair few months I was looking forward to getting stuck into another. There isn't much I can say about Revelations which hasn't already been said before.It carries the same weight as the previous games in the serious, the combat mechanics are almost identical. You can pull off some real fancy counters with some even more satisfying sounds.You have to have played some of the previous games to understand much of the story but you can try and pick it up as you go. I only finished the main story and that lasted me about 15 hours, and there is still opportunity to play the side missions, do all the optional stuff afterwards to, I would expect you can wrack up 20 hours+ in Revelations if you wanted to span it out as far as possible.Can't go wrong with this title.

												Back from when Assassin Creed games had a climbing system more complex then a one-button automatic. With things like timing, skill and freedom (imagine! You can jump diagonally!!!11). And a story! And a ""real world"" part that wasn't an annoying and soulless collection of stupid mini games! Good times these. In hindsight the last real Assassin's Creed! And Revelations is the second best for me after AC 2. Played both several times. The way Revelations combines the story lines of AC1 and 2 and of Altair and Ezio, and brings it to an (magical moments!) conclusion, is just beautiful and very well made and written. Compare this to the story of Syndicate (liberate 30 parts of the city - The End). It shows that the Ubi-Formula isn't bad IF you build a proper game into it.All further Episodes had their various problems, but with AC2 and Revelations i have literally nothing to complain about. Except Uplay of course. With the best game Ubisoft ever made (AC2) they also introduced Always-On DRM. Man i hate these guys for the way they treat customers...! The list of Ubisoft annoyances is endless.... and still grows. Anyway: Both games have aged extremely well. Revelations still looks amazing. Only the lod in far-distance views show the age a bit.Had a massive stuttering graphics bug, apparently common under Win10. Running the game as Administrator solved the problem.  Also out of the box 21:9 support.			"

												Join Ezio Auditore on his final journey, which will take you to good-old Masyaf and to another capital of the ancient Roman Empire, Constantinople. Not quite a revenge or liberation tale as the last 2 games, but a search for knowledge, left by Altair in a library built near the end of his extensive life. What will wait you inside? That's for you to find out.Not only will you get to experience Ezio's last chapter, but also control Altair for a second time during key moments of his life, from a young and humble apprentice to an old and wise Mentor. While I consider it to be the weakest of the trilogy, it's not without its merits. The introduction and conclusion are among the best in the series and the characters are still interesting. Bombs are probably the biggest addition, and I'll just say they can be useful at times, because I usually don't bother tinkering with them. Constantinople, although beautiful from afar, didn't feel as varied or memorable as Rome, which is ironic, since it was so aptly named as the ""Crossroads of the World"" due to its cultural and religious diversity. I don't see the point in bringing back Brotherhood's system of ""city-restoration"", since the Ottomans have been there for some 60 years now. The fact that the fast-travel points are unlocked from the beginning doesn't leave much room for exploration, and I'm generally against fast-travel right off the bat, since it doesn't feel earned.Despite these last few negative points, there is much enjoyment to be found here, especially if you liked Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood (which you should finish before going into Revelations).

												In my opinion, this is the best add-on to AC2.  It perfectly wraps up Ezio's story along with Altair's story.  Around 90 hours of gameplay.  Rich storylines and exciting gameplay.  Comparable to Tomb Raider franchise and Prince of Persia franchise. ^5			"

												This game was looked down apon by many fans of the Assassin's Creed series, and for a while, I was one of them.  After being persuaded by a friend to continue playing the game though, I realized the story and detail this game has to offer.The game has a slow and rather unintriguing start.  The introduction of the new mechanics, environment and people can drag on and get a little boring, but the game soon picks up.  This edition of the Ezio trilogy takes him to the city of Constantinople, where his aim is to find a way into the library of Altair.  Meanwhile, turmoil is brewing in the city with the dispute over the next Sultanate, and the underground Byzantine templars that are against the Ottomans.  Ezio finds himself in the middle of this mess, and as usual, badass-ness ensues.  As the game progresses, the story gets more intricate, with more historical figures introduced and a few plot twists.The environment of the game was different in some ways from the previous settings, but still enjoyable.  The addition of the hookblade made the game so much better, with its ziplines and fast climbing.  From the marketplace to Topkapi Palace, there is a lot to explore and plenty to do.  Oh, and that is without even mentioning Cappadocia, which has a breathtaking environment.The gameplay itself was great.  I did not make use of the bombs that much when I played through, which I do regret since it seemed like a great feature.  Despite this, the storyline contained plenty of action and explosions along the way!  Not going to spoil much, but it was certainly a thrill with some of the more advanced weapons that came during the time period.There were some downsides to the game, but they were pretty insignificant.  Many criticized the Den Defense feature, which is understandable, but did not affect the game too much.  The storyline only required it to be completed once, and as long as you kept your notoriety low, there was no need to worry.  In the end, it gave players more of an incentive to be careful! :PI don't really want to spoil any more, so I'll just end this by saying that AC:R is really underrated and definitely deserves its place in the Ezio trilogy.  It delivers great endings to both Altair and Ezio's stories, and certainly makes them memorable.  The game was by no means at ACII's level, but it was still amazing and a ton of fun.			"

												If you've played Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, don't expect much new in the way of game mechanics. If you're looking for a great conclusion to the Ezio story, then you will love this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed before and are looking to get into the game, don't go for this one first. You'll be wondering what is going on for much of it. Try the original Assassin's Creed or Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.Story: Ezio - spends most of his time in Constantinople, looking for the keys to the Masiyaf library. Along the way he'll tangle in local politics, romance a charming woman, and of course climb and sneak around looking for all those hidden loot caches. Desmond - he is put into the Animus by a certain someone (no spoilers) to prevent the onset of madness after the events at the conclusion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. He needs to untangle the strands of his mind (reaching a ""sync nexus"") to be certain of his sanity before returning to the real world.Setting: Constantinople (Istanbul). The city looks glorious. Ubisoft clearly spent a lot of time on the look and feel of the city, and this is arguably one of the greatest successes of Revelations. There are also numerous caves to climb / explore, as well as a wonderfully atmospheric excursion to an underground settlement. Gameplay: If you've played Brotherhood, you know what to expect. Combat is nearly unchanged. Store renovations are everywhere. Recruiting new Assassins is unchanged. There is a new ""tower defense"" mini-game. Seize Templar towers (a la the Borgia towers from Brotherhood); but if you acquire enough notoriety, the Templars can take them back. Sounds good on paper, but unless you are just completely careless (or don't care about notoriety), you'll rarely see this mini-game after the tutorial. For moving about the city, the ""hook blade"" has been added, basically allowing you to zip-line all over the city. It works well (and is required for the completion of several timed missions), but the zip-lines only work in one direction, limiting their usefulness. There's bomb crafting, which is useful in some situations, but isn't required. And - that's about it.Assassin's Creed: Revelations is the perfect conclusion to the Ezio triology, but it would be a mistake to think of it only interms of Ezio. To get the full impact, you need to not only have played the first (original) Assassin's Creed, but have also engaged with it on an emotional level. Then, having played through Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood, you start Revelations with a return to Masiyaf. This is a great moment that had a lot of impact for me. Also memorable were several flashback scenes where you play as Altair once again. Even if these sequences weren't tied into the narrative, they would still be fun. But they are. The story of AC: Revelations is arguably the strongest of the entire series, as it effortlessly weaves three narratives - Desmond, Ezio and Altair - into a complicated tapestry that makes absolute and complete sense. And the final conclusion - which I won't spoil - truly contains revelations of the highest order. I could not imagine a more satisfying ending to the Ezio Auditore trilogy, who IMO is one of the best characters ever created in any media. Multiplayer is pretty much dead, making The Ancestors Character Pack and the Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack moot and near-pointless DLC. The Lost Archive DLC, however, is essential. Maybe the game-play time is short (2-4 hours), but story-wise it focuses entirely on Subject 16 and his story of betrayal and madness.			"

												One word to explain this game is fantastic. One of the greatest games in the franchise so far.---Singleplayer---StoryRevelations manages to fork out a very good story, as we expect from Assassin's Creed games. It has a perfect blend of dialogue and character building with a side of edge of the seat esque action and drama. For those who have played the previous games the story in Revelations will further explain things for you and will send you looking back on them with a nostalgic smile.MechanicsThe mechanics in Assassin's Creed Revelations are a small improvement on Brotherhood's system. Combat is essentially the same except a little more fluid and with a few extra features added. The combat also has a nice set of new kill animations.The free-running mechanics are fluid, yet clunky in some areas. This clunkyness can cause a few frustrated curses at your monitor/tv screen but it doesn't cause too much of a problem. Revelations also carries over the 'rebuilding Rome' mechanic (except this time you're re-building Constantinople), although I didn't find it that useful this time around as you can get the best gear pretty early on which brings me into the next topic. One of the best swords in the game very early on, and you can get the best armour in the game in sequence five, while these aren't bad things they somewhat ruin the point of renovating Constantinople to earn money so that you can buy better gear. While the mechanics are mostly good, they still have some bad aspects that are frustrating, but not game ruining.GraphicsThe graphics are superb, not really much I can say against this. They are a moderate improvement from Brotherhood.---Multiplayer---Assassin's Creed is now known for some pretty good and unique multiplayer. It combines the superb free-running system with online cooperative or competitive play. There are many game modes to choose from across many levels. The multiplayer also comes with a great character customization system. Revelations added a new feature to it's multiplayer which was the addition of abilities. These abilities can range from things such as making a clone of yourself to decieve other players or to throw a knife at your target to prevent their escape. While multiplayer isn't as active as it once was at the time of this review being posted, it still has a playerbase and you can still find games in most of the gametypes.---Score---Overall this game is fantastic. It's a 9/10 from me. It would easily hit the 10/10 if it ironed out the annoying clunky aspects of the parkour system and perhaps added a larger reward for rebuilding the city by renovating shops and the like.			"

												The last chapter in the ""Ezio Trilogy,"" Assassin's Creed: Revelations (AC:R) concludes the stories of Altaïr ibn La-Ahad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze creatively binding the two together providing a satisfying ending. AC:R streamlines the action and breaks up the tediousness of climbing by combining elements from the past games and by introducing the ""hookblade."" The game also features ""Desmond Sequences"" that are a unique form of first-person platforming missions, but are served as unlockable levels. It should be noted that three downloadable content packs are available: Ancestors Character Pack, Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack and The Lost Archive. The Lost Archive is a singleplayer expansion to the rather monotonous ""Desmond Sequences.""			"

												Man, that surely was emotional! The ending forced a bit of tears out of my eyes (you'll see why if you choose to buy this game)!Although Revelations is definitely a lowpoint in the Ezio Trilogy (AC2, AC: B, AC: Revelations), it is a GREAT game and you should still get it, especially if you have played the first two Ezio games. Here we go:Ezio Story: 4/5Desmond Story: 3.5/5Gameplay (although the game was almost seamless, there are rare glitches to be found, which foreshadows AC: Unity, such as a citizen having a sudden seizure, or one of your fellow assassins suddenly climbing an invisible ladder in the sky (after I threw one of my knives into him while he was climbing a ladder))...anyways: 3/5Music (I must include this, because a lot of emotions, especially sadness came over me while playing Revelations): 4.5/5Aesthetics/Overall atmosphere of the game (once you get used to the fact that the Borgia guards are now Ottomans and Byzantines) (BTW, the setting is great!): 4/5Total grade/rating: 19/25= 76/100 = 76% = technically a C, but I would personally say B-Other ratings, in my opinion (just in case):AC2 = A-AC: B = AGet it.

												As with Assassin's Creed Brotherhood you play as Ezio Auditore, this time in the city of Constantinople. Ezio is now looking for several keys to a vault that Altair sealed centuries ago. Each key lets you relive a select memory from Altair's life, which is where the revelations happen. In this way it gives closure on both Ezio and Altair's stories at the same time.The game shares a lot of similarities with Brotherhood: the majority of the game takes place in one city where you liberate areas and recruit new assassins who you then send off on missions throughout the region.Graphically Revelations is definitely the best-looking game in the series so far.Ubisoft made a few gameplay additions to spice things up. My favorite is the new hookblade, which makes climbing a breeze; it also has other applications like ziplining between buildings (why these ziplines are all over Constantinople I have no idea) and the ever-useful hook-and-run maneuver. Bombs are interesting, but I didn't use them much except when the game prompted me to.Another nice addition was some backstory for Desmond. As you might know, at the end of Brotherhood Desmond falls into a coma and they put him into the animus to keep him from losing his mind. There you get to play through a few first-person levels that tell us about Desmond's life before he got mixed up with Abstergo. It's nice to know more about the person who you are playing as, and solidifies him as an actual character rather than simply the guy who you have to go through to get to Ezio.The Lost Archive DLC does something similar for Subject 16, and it was very moving. I would recommend it to those who are interested in good storytelling.This may have to do with the fact that I completely ignored all side missions during my five hour push to the end of the game, but Revelations seemed much shorter than the previous games in the series. I only spent 19 hours in the game; for reference the amount of time I spent in the other games are as follows:Assassin's Creed: 22 hoursAssassin's Creed II: 39 hoursAssassin's Creed Brotherhood: 36 hoursOverall I would recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations to those of you who felt that Altair and Desmond felt hollow in the previous games and those of you who are obsessed with plotlines.

												Another good Assassin's Creed game. Note that I wrote ""good"" instead of ""great"" or ""awesome"". It has great potential, but it doesn't develop very well throughout the main plot. When buying this, expect to be entertained only by the story missions. Not having what to do except to follow the linearity of the game is a bit frustrating. Unlike 2 or Brotherhood, this installment isn't as long or extensive, in terms of gameplay time or maps. One has enough money, by the end, only to rebuild about 70% buildings and buy about 70% of what shops offer. The title's setting is Constantinople, which is big indeed, but the whole game is restricted to that ares, except for a few missions which take you to Masyaf or Capadoccia, which are small and not fully explorable, by the way. For movementation, the lack of horses on the city is another downside, as it could be a time saver and more interesting than the fast-travel system for many trips.On the other hand, Revelations earns new gameplay refinements. The addition of bomb-crafting and using definitely makes for a better experience. There is also the new hookblade, which replaces your secondary hidden blade to make climbing easier, faster and more practical. Story-wise, it wraps-up Ezio Auditore's story in an interesting way. That is why one should first play Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood to know the main character better and have a better experience.Overall, I'd recommend Revelations in case one likes the Assassin's Creed series, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the amount of content or excitement the assignments bring.

												I loved it. I would have written a review for the original one since that's the one that got me hooked on the series, but I played that one on the PS3, so I can't review the PC version. Fair enough. I have the PC version now, though, and am planning on playing it.Revelations, on the other hand, I played all the way through on the PC version. First off, if you've played this game or any of the others on the consoles only, you have no idea what they're supposed to look like. The graphics are astounding. That out of the way, the obligatory ""eye candy"" factor, what's the game really like?The good: As is the case in every previous installment, you can lose yourself completely in this one. You don't have to, but if you want to spend a month playing nothing but this game, you can. On the other hand, and that's another thing I like, if you just like the story, you don't have to invest the rest of your year in it. And it's a good story too. Great dialogue, color and characters that actually feel real with a few twists thrown in on top. As I like to say when I run into that rare creature, the game with a good story, ""it would make a great movie.""It ties up a lot of loose ends too, closing out the stories of Altair and Ezio very well indeed and, quite frankly, even as a fan I was beginning to reach the point where I wasn't sure that Ezio's story, as fascinating as it is, could be milked any further. I like closure. At some point. I'm done with Ezio and Altair now, and not in a bad way. It's all good.The bad? The side games get a bit repetitive. At first I was determined to dominate the Med and renovate every public lavatory in Constantinople before I'd finish the game. At the end, not so much. But that's what I like about these games: You can carry on with the side games, quests, mini-games and so on for as long as you like them, and then you can get right back into the story and finish the thing if you've had all you can stand. And you'll STILL end up with weeks of play time. You don't miss out on anything.Except for the Desmond's Journey optional side game, which I only made it through the second sequence of before I tired of it. Placing blocks in space and playing first person Tetris just doesn't do it for me, sorry. But I didn't lose anything because of it, so *shrug*. I would have loved to hear all about Desmond growing up, though, but it just wasn't worth it for me.Overall? A great romp. Beautiful, stunning even, with a story that reads like a book to the point where I couldn't wait to go to the next mission point to find out what happened next. Just like a good book. That with some awesome fight animations, controls that keep getting better and cinematics made for movies, not to mention the awesome soundtrack and it's a very nice package of awesome interactive entertainment indeed. Oh, and with a bit of history thrown in for good measure.I may be lonely in appreciating the database entries about historic locations and people, but I appreciate them very much. History isn't taught near enough in schools nowadays.9 out of 10.			"

												Only Old Men Are Going to BattleThis time, the story tells of the final path of the assassin Ezio (but not about the finale of his life, do not worry), and at the same time will tell what happened to Desmond after a very unexpected finale Brotherhood. As fans of the series will appreciate raised the veil of secrecy over the fate of Altair what happened to him after the end of the original. These episodes are short, and all we have collected from five pieces, but memories of the protagonist of Assassin's Creed for the number one, perhaps, the best moments of Revelations. And reveals a character in less than two hours better than the entire length of the first part.But the central face of the story, of course, is old audience. Before us is a life already wise, experienced a lot of hardship and bitter lessons, a man of fifty-two years. But age - not a hindrance still playfully jumping on the roofs. Is that the place of Venice and Rome came to Constantinople (now - Istanbul), divided into two large water area. Swim from one to the other will not work, so I have to use a system of fast sewer tunnels (the good, this time some of them are open from the beginning), or hire a boatman, a taxi driver.But before you go to conquer the cultural capital, Ezio will visit the fortress of Masyaf. There must be a hidden secret library of the Assassins, which houses a terrible secret. And we should in that that was the first to find five keys to the door and it does not give the Templars get their dirty paws on the ancestral knowledge. The adventure will be exciting, especially failed entry and smart, a strong finale. The only pity is that in the middle there is a noticeable sagging.Star, but removedTo carry out this very good mission will have the old ways. As before, we have to be worn on the roofs of the beautiful city, hidden in the crowd, and expertly clean goal. Tasks are varied and a good imagination. For example, one would have to change a traveling musicians performing in front of all of society and color eye-catching, while your minions-assassins quietly sent to the bottom of the well of another Templar. And such original instructions are not enough. Generally, Revelations, unlike its predecessors, most focused on the story. Create your guild kills, pumping recruits and buying buildings unobtrusively offered as a short rest in between missions. No side orders and the competition is not provided. The only thing to do in town, so it is rare to weigh cuffs bullies, but to catch the thieves. And the modest size of Constantinople the same Rome.At first glance, to distinguish the ""revelation"" of the sequel or Brotherhood is difficult. Mechanics, control and brotherhood economic part have not undergone any changes. But, of course, the developers could not leave his project completely without innovation, but they seem to be strained at times and sucked from the finger. For example, now our excesses in the streets much more serious consequences. If the anger of the Templars or the custody of the Ottoman Empire, and take away time from the suspicion, you have to reflect their attack on your base captured. Completed this part of the game as a simple little variation on the theme of tower defense. On a narrow street on the headquarters of the guild systems brave marching troops of the enemy, and we set on the roofs along the road of various fighters and build barricades on the road. FUN, this is simple and at first even like, but get tired very quickly. Therefore we recommend to you as soon as possible to get a masters Assassins (students pumped up to level 15) and instruct them to defense.Another innovation is the bomb - a new weapon in our arsenal. On the one hand they are useful: they can be used to distract enemies, destroy them or to demoralize and disorient. Recipes - Sea. Experimenting with various integral components, which are abundant in the trunk or on the corpses, we can get explosive movement with very different characteristics. But here's the situation when they really need, are extremely rare. Of course, you can actively use them, but it is almost always much easier to operate the old fashioned way.But the most small, but among the most useful upgrade uniforms became a hook knife. Thanks to him, acrobatic part has become more dynamic and diverse. If you can not reach out his hand to the ledge, then a new ""gadget"" you will gain. As well as make it easy to bring down the opponent with the legs, jump with pots and lamps mounted to slide on and pull a cable. Particularly effective in the latest version jump to head to some poor fellow-guard.			"

												Assassin´s Creed Revelations is the third and final entry in Ezio´s trilogy, attempting to give a closure to both his and Altair´s journey, all of this while pushing Desmond´s story forward. A hefty promise, but the real question is, will it succeed?It´s no easy task to juggle three main characters at once, but Ubisoft has done a remarkable, if incomplete, job. There´s no denying that Ezio and Altair´s portions are handled extremely well, providing insight into both of the character´s final days as the emblematic assassins they are, and getting to know what happened after the credits rolled in the first game of the series is an absolute delight, but the same sadly can´t be said for Desmond´s sections. Although its evident that the developers tried to take a different aproach to the familiar gameplay by giving it a first person treatment, the final product comes out as uninspiring and dull.  Nevertheless, the overall storyline more than makes up for it, and rounds up these characters on a high note. Fortunately, Ubisoft made absolutely no mistakes with regards to the audiovisual style, maintaining the excellent values proposed by both ACII and Brotherhood, and manages to set the bar even higher with sharper details and fantastic voice acting. The beautiful city of Constantinople takes center stage, a breath of fresh air just when Italy was beginning to feel a little stale at the end of the previous entry in the series, and cements the franchise´s reputation as one of the most stunning ones around. The gameplay aspect remains almost untouched compared to Ezio´s other adventures, but giving that it was superb in most of its aspects, that doesn´t really count as a negative, although a little more innovation wouldn´t harm, either. Notable additions to the formula include the trusty hookblade, which allows you to extend your reach and prevents you from falling to your death (a regular in the series), an improved use of bombs which range from lethal to tactical and sneaky, and the ability to defend your captured dens via a tower-defense-like minigame which feels like un unnecesary step in the wrong direction, even though it can be fun the first few times. The multiplayer portion first introduced in Brotherhood makes a return, and even though it sports a few new flashy additions, doesn´t provide enough content to keep you away from more complete online experiences for long. It´s a nice complement to the main adventure for sure, but one which, if given a little more polish, would have been up there with the genre giants. Overall, the game is a considerable leap from the previous title, which felt rather disappointing and ""safe"", and does enough things right to distance itself from it and stand high among the franchise´s best offerings, surpassed only by the magnificent Assassin´s Creed II.  It can only get better from here...Pros:+ Beautiful open world crammed with things to do+ Breathtaking visual and audio design+ Engaging plot which overarchs two of the most loveable characters in gaming and brings them together like never before+ Long, varied campaign which tosses you in a variety of engaging scenariosCons:- Uninspired Desmond sections- Engaging, yet short-lived multiplayer component- Feels  somehow similar to previous entries- No more Ezio and Altair :(Conclusion: A fascinating adventure which closes the lid on one of the most gripping stories of modern gaming, Assassin´s Creed Revelations grabs hold of you and doesn´t let go until you have seen everything it has to offer, and believe me, that is going to take some time, my friend.Grade: 9.1 (Amazing)			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations is the most epic Assassin's Creed Game yet. The Game has a lot of stuff for you to do including free roaming the big city of Constantinople, Riding on Zip lines and Assassinating Byzantine Templars and Ottoman guards, doing Master Assassin Missions and many more fun things to do. In this game Master Assassin Ezio Auditore Travels to Constantinople in Search of the Keys Into Altair's Library brought to Constantinople with Niccolò Polo and on the journey he meets a Young Master Assassin Named Yusuf Tazim. This Game's Story, Gameplay and Graphics are Amazing!. You will get hooked into the story immediately after you start playing the game. This game is set 2-4 years after Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. There will be a lot that you will enjoy about this game and I really think it is worth the money. So if you have money and don't know what game to buy I highly recommend you buy this game. All AC fans will love this game it is a great addition to the AC series. So get this game bros!.			"

												This game was very conclusion to the great trilogy of Ezio Auditore. We followed him from Assassin's Creed II to Assassin's Creed brotherhood to this one. I feel like the game had been a great experience, yet it felt like it was lacking in some sense. The graphics were amazing the story of course still great, but it was a bit short. The game I felt came too soon and they could have added so much more! I did enjoy exploring the cities although it seemed to go too fast to explore, and creating the bombs with different ingredients were a fun trip too. The city of Istanbul is were you are located at and it just beautiful! maybe on of the greatest locations so far. The addition of the knife grappling hook also made it ever more so worth the while.I loved it, but wouldn't call it my favirote. Though I would recommend it for any person who has completed the first three.			"

												The shadow war still continues on in the eyes of the public, but happily the series slightly returns to a more gray-morality route. Granted, it's returns to gray moralities is not by giving the Templar characters more noble causes per say, it's more that Ezio does more things that can be contrued as villainous, bad means to an end.The story is better, the characters are better, the combat is just as fluid as Brotherhood's, the parkour is improved with the hook blade, and the game just overall feels good.However, the game is also the most linear Assassin's Creed yet, and barring AC1, also features the least amount of side missions. The game does let you feel like a leader through being able to train your Assassin recruits and have them go after specific Templar targets (targets you can play as in the multiplayer portion of the game).Desmond's section in the game is a strange, optional, first-person puzzle game, it's strangely fun, but there is no worthwhile free-roam section.90/100			"

												The first downside is, this requires Uplay.Second, this is my only opnion about the game, if you don't like being spoiled, scroll to other Spoiler-free reviewsStoryline: 7 / 10 - Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing in Constantine, the storyline has almost, nothing to do with finding the key to open Altair's library - You're helping the prince then suddenly you want to find some books... - So.... how many Apple of Eden are there in the AC Series?                            - Much shorter than its prequel, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed II (probably cuz there's not much to do in Contantine?)Audio: 8 / 10 - Not the best, not bad Gameplay: 8 / 10 - Has its moments, the hookblade is good, but the Bomb Crafting is not an optionThe 120 possible bomb combinations means you combine this material with others, total there are about 9 types of bomb divided to 3 groups that you can mixed with other type of fuses and gunpowders and there's some type that you'll never want to craftOverall 7.5 / 10, I suggest buying this game when it's on sale, so far the highest sale is -50%, and you should play its prequel ( AC II and AC:B )			"

												AC: Revelations is the bookend on the Ezio arc, tying up his story and neatly bringing it all back to Altair, from the first game. I really like the decision to give Altair a final conclusion and make it playable. It adds depth to the story and to the lore when you connect these two characters, centuries apart. It gives a nice sense of history. Then, of course, there are the Desmond sections. Personally I've never hated them as much as some, mostly it just seems like a missed opportunity. The potential is there to add a lot to the story but it's just under and/or incorrectly utilized. That being said when it isn't forcing you through inane free running puzzles you do learn a little about Desmond's past, about why and how he ended up where he is.For the most part base gameplay is unchanged. The biggest differences are the addition of a hook blade which mostly effects free running (higher climbing jumps and zip lining), bomb crafting/use (use is up to your play style. You don't have to use them but they can be useful), and a tower defense mini game that is thankfully entirely optional (which begs the question ""why is this in the game?""). The combat is a little less of a grind with the counter-kill/kill-stringing system which can have you speeding through a group of enemies in a flash. Although the ability to kill an entire group of guards without breaking stride makes you wonder why they bother having the fights in the first place. Unfortunately this tweaking of the combat system has continued the trend away from actual planning and assassination toward big raging battles and waves of enemies. There are a few forced stealth sections but those are almost always very linear with a clear path and sequence of actions. It's really a shame because they give you so many weapons and skills but don't really give a lot of ways to fully utilize them in a stealthy way.Overall this really is one of the better games so far in the series. The game world is still huge and beautiful and stabbing guards in the neck from the third story doesn't really get old. If you've played the rest of the excellent Ezio story arc then this is a must play. If you haven't then you should go play the others first then pick up Revelations.			"

												Assassin's Creed: Revelations - it's Assassin's Creed. Again.At this point in the series, you know exactly what you're getting into. The basic gameplay has remained unchanged from the previous game, and the only new gameplay hooks are completely superflous. Bombs are largely useless, except in really specfic situations; the Tower Defence-styled ""Den Defending"" is not only boring and frusting, but you're likely to not even see it (I had to actually try and get my Infamy up just to see them), and the Hookblade just basically changes your combat and climbing animations, and not much else.So why am I recommending it? Because at its heart, the gameplay still just works. Combat is shallow but cool looking, the world is graphically beautiful (even if Istanbul is far less colourful than Rome and Italy), the full syncronization goals still add great replay value, and fans of the series will definitely want to see the wrapping up of Altair's story. The actual ending to Ezio's story however, is reserved for the Ubisoft-produced film short, ""Assassin's Creed: Embers"", so make sure to give that a look when you're done the game.Also of note is the incredible ""Desmond's Memories"" minigame, which is a first person puzzle-platformer where you assemble and place blocks to traverse surrealistic Animus worlds as you find out about Desmond's life before becoming an Assassin. ""The Lost Archive"" DLC consists entirely of new puzzles and story in this style, and for that reason alone, the DLC is highly recommended. The gameplay in this supposed minigames not only outclasses the main Assassin's Creed gamplay, but with a bit more depth, would easily stand as its own game.			"

												The first downside is, this requires Uplay.Second, this is my only opnion about the game, if you don't like being spoiled, scroll to other Spoiler-free reviewsStoryline: 7 / 10 - Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing in Constantine, the storyline has almost, nothing to do with finding the key to open Altair's library - You're helping the prince then suddenly you want to find some books... - So.... how many Apple of Eden are there in the AC Series?                            - Much shorter than its prequel, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed II (probably cuz there's not much to do in Contantine?)Audio: 8 / 10 - Not the best, not bad Gameplay: 8 / 10 - Has its moments, the hookblade is good, but the Bomb Crafting is not an optionThe 120 possible bomb combinations means you combine this material with others, total there are about 9 types of bomb divided to 3 groups that you can mixed with other type of fuses and gunpowders and there's some type that you'll never want to craftOverall 7.5 / 10, I suggest buying this game when it's on sale, so far the highest sale is -50%, and you should play its prequel ( AC II and AC:B )			"

												AC:R does everything that AC2 and AC:B did right, and adds to it. There is just as much faffing about as you like though it's mostly not required. Horses are inexplicably missing, but you get to recruit much earlier. The tower defence segment can suck a fat one. Also, the begger women are back in packs. The setting and cutscenes are beautiful, as is the smooth combat. I give it 9.9 ! and highly recommend to all.			"

												10/9 for me , one of my favourite games and what to say , I have not finished the single player yet,and i don't know a lot about the story, but i know it looks pretty nice on a Full HD monitor or Tv whatever.it has a similar gameplay to Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood , not the best optimized game though, but it's pretty much playable on a GTX 260 OC edition , 8GB DDR3 Memory and an FX6300 six-core CPU ( I know it's not the best GPU , gonna upgrade it soon) I get a Minimum of 35-40 Fps and a Maximum of 50-60 Fps on max settings , excluding AA, i only run it with 2x AA , since i get unplayable framerate drops on 4x and above.I'm playing multiplayer mostly and it's fantastic (Y),and in multiplayer i get a solid 60FPS in every situation...All in all I highly recommend, and feel free to add me on Uplay: george940203 or on Steam :)			"

												More AC....yay!  The problem is that it's just that....more AC.  I love the franchise.  I love parkouring  my way up buildings that should be unscalable...I love droppimg down on enemies and cutting their throats...I love everything about the franchise...EXCEPT the hard fact that it hasn't progressed at all from the initial jump from AC1 to AC2.  Now, I'm a firm believer in the notion that ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  Assassin's Creed has always been about climbing, jumping, leaping over obstacles that no mortal man could handle, and that's why I keep playing.  And I will keep on playing thru AC3 and all subsequent releases.  BUT the devs have GOT to add something else to the mix to keep it interesting.Bottom line...if you liked AC2, and Brotherhood, you'll enjoy this release.  I liked it simply because it's more of the same AC that I love.  But don't expect anything revolutionary here...it's what you crave, but nothing more.			"

												I forget which one this is.. it's the continuation to one of the games where you kill people. Numbers are nice. Put more numbers in your games.Oh, and you know what Ubisoft? How about you just release these as ""Expansions"" or ""add-ons"" instead of an entire ""new"" game? So Ezio's older, big woops.It's fun, but more of the same.. including the rediculous story-line and plot-within-a-plot and stuff. Multiplayer is great though.. if you want to raise your blood pressure.Don't pay full price for this, get it on a sale.			"

												Compared to AC2 and Brotherhood, this game feels like a shameless cash grab. The story after AC2 and Brotherhood felt complete, this feels like it was tacked on afterwards. It's not all bad, the trademark AC action is still there and Ezio has a few new tricks (bombs, ziplines) but overall the game isn't as polished and just doesn't feel like it was necessary.If you're an AC fan I would still recommend it, as you'll want the story and the core AC gameplay is still fun, but beware that this game is not as good as the games that came before it.

If you get into the story, you will feel really well. After first playthrough, when finding Altair in his library, I felt chill going down my spine. It felt great, the story, graphics, controls, animations, everything. If you like story-based games or just like the idea of Assassin's Order, at least give this game a try. It really deserves your attention. Vittoria agli Assassini!			"

												Revelations can't be described as a complete disaster. It is an AAA-class title, with fascinating visuals, complex game mechanic and so on. Were it an independent project, with no connections to Animus and stuff, I'd maybe even praised that thing. But as a part of bigger body... it is certainly one of the dumbest volumes in the whole Assassin's Creed series (if not the worst), and can be pictured as a filler into complete AC scenario plot. Rare calculated ""breath-taking"" action moments fitting an adventure game dissolved in dozens of hours of useless grinding, with the same gameplay mechanics as in the AC Brotherhood, but more spoiled. So if you are still not bought that game, I seriously advise you to hold your hand. At least until you see some really big discount...What I don't like about Revelations? The usual stuff: all those things Ubisoft called as ""key features"" and ""revolutionary gameplay"" in their hyped proclamations, in fact don't work as supposed. Broken balance, questionable game plot, and the worst of all - the feeling that I'm not fitting into intended audience of that project. The motivation of protagonist may be suitable for teenager, grown up by Hollywood, but sadly, I can't buy into that crud no matter how hard I try.What I want to say by that is that Revelations was presented as a game which reveals so much of the Truth, making some serious fixing to the story which started to sink into unwanted tangles and incoherent twists... And it was Revelations that made it all clear: the basic Assassin's Creed story about saving the world and the ages-old struggle of total control and total freedom... it's the least attractive game feature both for players and for game designers.To put it simple, all the promised Truth that Revelations ""revealed"" to the player - not really informative or least entertaining (that especially corresponds to the memories of Altair). The Assassins made a truce with Turks, so they kill political leaders in countries that Ottoman empire desire to conquer and take low profile in return. Was it about just cause? Bringing people more freedom? I doubt that. In this turn, I started to question myself, what's the real difference between Assassins and Tampliers? That question was supposedly answered in the first game, but Revelations severely undermined previous scoops. Now it's more like ""bad guys are those who shot at us""... considering the fact it is Assassins who usually shoot first.Okay, let's forget about history lessons and questionable ethics of the game characters. Let's talk about gameplay, the thing I honor even more than distinct scenario.If you were playing before in the Assassin's Creed 2 and AC Brotherhood (which I strongly suggest), you'll see that almost all key features remained the same. You strolling the streets of the big city, climbing the roofs and towers for better sightseeing, you meet new people and kill the most of them... You collect some prize chests scattered across the city, and use money from them to buy new weapons and even new stores and historical buildings. Or don't buy. It is irrelevant, in the end.If we talk about anything but main missions in the Revelations, gameplay may provide only conceptual interest. Ezio, now a renowned mentor, nurtures other assassins more than killing himself. Side-missions for levelling your students now taking more and more time, becoming a constant push-pull on the map, where assassins competing with tampliers. Even more, game designers attached a tower-defence mimimi-game, which is so irritating that common advice is to avoid it by any cost. As of Ezio and his abilities, it's safe to say that he's armed to the teeth right about from the start of game. And after he take a hookblade and crossbow - and especially after the first student raise into master level (which can achieved quite early), it's all starting to look like T1000 was sended to the past (to ensure Suleiman's reign, maybe?)... Seriously, all those healthkits, poisons, quite-fast pistol, silent and deadly crossbow... and bombs to send terror into crowds, all that combined feels like overkill. Something like adding half-pound of sugar into (name)Cola bottle.At the bottom line, about 5 hours of gameplay can be noted as somewhat interesting - main missions (some of them) and cut-scenes. And again, I must repeat that the scenario there even more grotesque than in the Assassin's Creed 3 (which I thought was impossible...). The only thing the screenwriters performed well is the love-line for Ezio. Taking the full perspective on gameplot leaved me puzzled and even ashamed, for Ezio, for Altair, for Desmond... How so? What's that was for? What was the reason? - those unanswered questions fumed me into this negative review...Mark 6/10. You can play it... but there are plenty of more worthsome games in the world.

AC revelations runs smoothly on lower end PC's, even running at about 30 FPS, lowest settings, on some laptops. I've played for 79 hours on this game, and still havent beaten it.

												I've put many hours in to this game and there is still so much content to be explored, as a big fan of the AC series I would have to say this is one of the best. The mechanics are just as you would expect from an AC game except for the new hook that allows you to climb faster, which is a great addition because it makes climbing much faster. This game is incredibly fun to 100% there is so much to do and explore you will likely never get bored, there are all kinds of upgrades to get which adds many hours of gameplay, one of the great things about upgrades is you are basically invincible by the end. The story is very interesting and a little different than other AC games, the levels are fun and never really get repetetive. Pros/consPros: great gameplay/mechanics, great story, fun levels, great graphics as you would excpect from an AC game, upgrades and renovating buildings are some amazing features from this game that kept me coming back to try to get 100% and allow you to get high amounts of money.Cons: There are some glitches here but none of them are game breaking so don't worry about that, most of them are actually pretty hilarious, controls are odd at first which is not really a con because you get used to them fast but it is still something to watch out for (I recommend using a gamepad if you have one) Overall I would have to give this game a 9/10. You don't have to play the previous games in the series to enjoy this game, but you should for the story (which is amazing) Do yourself a favor and buy this game. I'm sure you'll have lots of fun with this game and get way more than 6 hours out of it.			"

												To be fair, I've played alot of Assassin Creed games and I can feel that I do not follow the mainstream opinions on games. For starters I loved AC3 even though everyone says it was a disapointment, I really enjoyed it. Now getting back on topic, Assassin creed Revelations will forever hold a dear place in my heart and will forever be in my top 5 games in all time. It has great music but the music was not as amazing as in other games. The game play is really similar to the previous game but the hookblade is added and is a amazing feature that is unique only to this game. The storyline has to be one of the best Assassin Creed storylines I played. The map is kinda cramped but ehh what can you do am I right, you do with what you are given. The reason people get this game and why this game is ranked so high is not because of the hookblade or the new map or the same old mechanics, it is ranked so high because of it's storyline. It's the final game of the Ezio trilogy and it provides the essential closure that every gamer craves and needs to basically needs to not die emotionally. If you are a highly commited fan, and have played the previous games before this game, this game is a must have for every single fan. You can get away with not having a game like Assassin Creed Liberations, but if you do not have Assassin Creed revelations it is like reading a book and not reading the conclusion, the ending. Also really good graphics. Fighting 7/10Missions 8/10weapons/amor unlockables 2/10city 6/10Storyline 10/10!!!!!!!!!Thank you for reading and I hope you guys find the same satisfaction I found in this game, have a wonderful day!

												Assassin's Creed games are great in general, but they should've called this one AC 2.75 or something. It's basically ACII AND Brotherhood all over again, but this time there's practically nothing new. Yes, there are bombs (which I hardly used), a hookblade (which was actually pretty good), a parachute (never used it; only for the story) and a tower defense mini-game (which works alright, but doesn't belong in the game if you ask me), but it's just not enough to call this a NEW Assassin's Creed game. They're really milking the franchise. However, the story IS told in a better way and you get to play as both Altair and Ezio. You also get to play as Desmond, obviously, but that's only a matter of minutes, thankfully. Desmond's segments are critical to the story, but it diminishes the gameplay experience. It just pulls you out of the entire experience.All in all, you really can't go wrong with AC. Just don't expect too much from it.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												I found this to be a pretty descent game though I would not pay the full price for it, if it were me i would wait for it to be on sale allthough thats just my opinion. This game had pretty good graphics and you can play it with an intel celeron although it will run somewhat slowly.  The storyline bored the hell out of me though except for the altair memories. I would say its okay although it completely severed itself from the storyline of the two previous games of the ezio trilogy.  Anyway if you want a game that is big on the storyline then go buy ac2 or ac3 because this game doesnt have much good story to it.  and if you want gameplay then ac4 is the way to go and if thats to expensive then ac brotherhood is the way to go. ac= Assassin's Creed			"

												Best AC game. It is hard to compare Venice and Constantinople but I would pick Constantinople as a better city, it is much more colorful, it is larger and I like how a river splits the city. The gameplay is good i would  definitely get it if I were you AC3 is nowhere near as good.			"

												The final works of Ezio are memorable indeed. From his birth, we have seen this man age and become an elder. A process you in the beginning feel quite a bit.There is a beginning section where you are wounded and need medicine, limiting your climbing abilities and forcing you to make do with what you have, which are haystacks. A nice way to get people gradually reacquainted with how you do things in the AC series.Constantinople is now your playground. Everything you could do in Rome, can now be done there, and more. The Hookblade serves as an additional climbing method. Whereas in Brotherhood, you could leap and grab hold of a normally unreachable spot, you can now use this technique to climb even faster by launch yourself a second time. A rush to do several times in succession, though for some reason it still functions perfectly for dual assassinations.Bombs can be put together now as well, allowing you to carry three types. To distract, to kill and for tactical purposes. For every type, you can put together several ingredients with different effects befitting their purpose. Distracting bombs will usually distract guards and such, while lethal bombs will kill in various ways. Tactical bombs can range from smoke bombs, to bombs that drop fake coins to lure a crowd of people, and much much more.Whlie an excellent game, I can't say that you'll be able to fully appreciate the game and story if you haven't played it's predecessors.If you have been following the AC storyline, you'll enjoy the progress of Ezio and the hidden history of Altaïr. Especially the latter's closure is a potentially emotional one.A worthy end to a storyline focussed on an Italian Assassin. Up to the next one!			"

												More than likely if you’re checking this game out you’ve at least played AC2 and probably Brotherhood. In that case, you know what to expect from AC: Revelations. Fortunately for us, Ubisoft realized this and is very quick to drop you into the action with minimal opening tutorials and hand holding. This way the game dug its hooks in quick and held me throughout the roughly 30 hours it took to get 100% synchronization.Both of the new cities, Constantinople and Cappadocia, are a joy to explore and move through, befitting of the signature feature of the series. In the opening cinematic as you first step into Cappadocia I definitely had a stop and stare “whoa” moment. These cities become more than places but characters in the story that you get to know more of as you play.Without spoiling anything, I was pleased with most of the new characters as well as how they handled the old ones, particularly in wrapping up Ezio and Altaïr’s sagas. I would have liked to have seen some of the villains fleshed out more. There were several that we don’t see enough of to avoid feeling like they’re one dimensional characters there just to fulfill a checklist that says a boss fight is needed. The voice acting and Jesper Kyd’s soundtrack are high quality, as usual. The interactions involving Ezio and one of the new characters, Sofia, are among the high points of the writing and acting. I was also pleasantly surprised with the telling of Desmond’s story, despite that portion’s odd gameplay.There are some unique features in this game that create a couple minor stumbling points. The most notable is the first person Desmond sections that I just mentioned. I wouldn’t call these a complete failure though. In fact, I expected far worse considering some of what I had heard about them. Some of these areas are visually stunning and the soundtrack caught my ear a couple times. It’s the first person view and simplistic gameplay that drag them down. For whatever reason there is also a tower defense type minigame that isn’t good enough to deserve a place in the game. If you’re careful with your notoriety status in the regular game you shouldn’t have to do this often, I only ever did it twice.While I only spent 2 hours playing multiplayer, I enjoyed the time. It certainly is a different experience and takes a different mindset to play against other people. If deathmatch with a stealth aspect and AC’s fluidity of movement sound appealing to you then I think you’ll enjoy this.			"

												Assassin's Creed games are great in general, but they should've called this one AC 2.75 or something. It's basically ACII AND Brotherhood all over again, but this time there's practically nothing new. Yes, there are bombs (which I hardly used), a hookblade (which was actually pretty good), a parachute (never used it; only for the story) and a tower defense mini-game (which works alright, but doesn't belong in the game if you ask me), but it's just not enough to call this a NEW Assassin's Creed game. They're really milking the franchise. However, the story IS told in a better way and you get to play as both Altair and Ezio. You also get to play as Desmond, obviously, but that's only a matter of minutes, thankfully. Desmond's segments are critical to the story, but it diminishes the gameplay experience. It just pulls you out of the entire experience.All in all, you really can't go wrong with AC. Just don't expect too much from it.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Revealations is a great finale' to the Ezio Aldatore trilogy. The setting of Constantenople was well chosen and executed. Being able to make different custom bombs was an unexpected addition to the game and allows for a variety in playstyle which I wasn't anticipating.Everything about this game continues in the good, amazing tradition in every other way that the other ""2"" games do. A must have for the AC devout.			"

												So, far I have played AC3, AC, AC2 and now AC Revelations. But apart from AC, which was a horrible game, just a next step after Prince of Persia, I think AC Revelations is the weakest point before the Connor's story. I haven't played Brotherhood yet, but I've heard it's the best in Ezio Trilogy.Don't get me wrong, ACR is a good game, definitely worth the price. The main story is interesting, the combat is smooth, most missions are fun, there are new weapons and tactics, the narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. But the game experience itself just doesn't feel that fresh anymore. I guess, there's just that many AC games that you can play before the excitement starts to fade.So to sum up the pros and cons...PROS+ Good main story, but not as good as before or after+ You are not forced to play as Desmond, if you don't want to, in order to proceed. It's constant Ezio/ Altair experience+ Combat and camera is working perfectly (it was a big problem in previous parts), so you always jump and land, where you want+ Narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. You can cross the whole city, without touching the ground. Ziplines are also a nice introduction+ Some new useful weapons such as bombs, a crossbow and a hook blade. Parachutes are very useful, tooCONS- Income problem is still not fixed. You're short of money in the beginning, and you're millionnaire, when you don't need it anymore- Only 4 locations (Masyaf, Constantinople, Cappadocia and Maiden Tower)- Boring side quests (except for Master assasin missions) and grinding challenges. Ultra-boring Desmond sequences, which are basically about Desmond's memories and block building- Kind of short, compared to other parts- The game does not introduce all gameplay elements equally well. For example, Mediterranean defense, assasin assignment, assasin promotion, den attack triggers are not explained enough.I didn't play the MP, but if it's the same as in AC3, I don't even want to try.My overall rating 7/10.

												If you think the older AC games were better, you'll probably think this one has the most solid gameplay out of them. It takes everything from AC 1, 2, and Brotherhood and tries to focus on the good stuff while eliminating some of the more tedious elements. It also introduces a nifty secondary blade for the speediest parkouring yet and a crafting system for bombs that a lot of people overlook but it is nice to see developers still trying to create novel experiences. The story is also decent and it ties up the Altair and Ezio stories in a satisfying way while leaving a cool hook into AC 3. On top of that, there's an few optional first person platforming levels tossed in that give some of Desmond's backstory in a totally new way. And if you like that, there's a dlc that adds more of it that tells the backstory of subject 16 wihch I thought was pretty cool. And continuing from AC Brotherhood, there's even a multiplayer mode that seems pretty similar and is more fleshed out. Sadly, I think it's even emptier than ACB's multiplayer and you'll probably get rekt by Prestige level 12 players while trying to start out and learn everything.			"

												This game is adequate.The GoodIn this game you will use time traveling Prussian warhammers and fake♥♥♥♥♥Aladdin shamshirs to slay peasants in groups of three. Or at least thats what I did with about 92 hours of my 99 hours of gameplay. (I do not regret it) The other portions of the game that worked were the heroic sendoffs for Altair and Ezio. These characters represent the golden age of the assassins creed universe so it was nice to see them get a respectful sendoff rather then be overused in future cash cow moo creed titles The BadThe pacing wasn't perfect. The historical research wasn't as meticulous as in previous games. The ""Den Defense"" minigame is essentially optional... The antagonists weren’t particularly threatening. Horrific Islamic war criminals are presented in a positive light and freedom fighting Greeks seeking to reclaim their homeland are presented as the villains.... (what a brave stance for the developers to take) The tutorial mission and the ending mission are basically the same. You cant steal/use Turkish rifles, you can steal from peasents in front of guards ext. The game feels repetitive and short and like the content cut from previous titles were thrown into this game as a haphazard mix. The UglyYou can play as Desmond as he navigates some cheap♥♥♥♥♥""jump over things"" minigame where he monologues about his past. You may choose to simulate this experience by slapping yourself with a mouse pad.... you know where.Bottom Line.The games budget was triple slashed when it became apparent that it would only be competing for market share with Assassins Creed 3. You can see the scope that was intended for the game and literally feel missing content as you faff about. It’s clear that the developers aspired only to adequacy and met it not with leaps and bounds but as a half asphyxiated carcass crawling over the finish line before collapsing but whether it’s by an inch or a mile the game made it. It IS adequate, its pros do outweigh its flaws. So yeah, I liked it, I liked my time traveling Prussian warhammer and my fake♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Aladdin sword and ""macing"" peasants was thoroughly amusing. I'd do it again. That said my hope is that they merge ASII, Brotherhood and Revelations into one super title for continuous gameplay enjoyment.Probably the last real Assassins Creed game.			"

												Drawbacks:Graphics haven't improved much from AC2 and Brotherhood. In fact, I noticed that there were a bit more glitches in this game than the previous ones. Newcomers to the series will definitely not benefit from starting with this one, but this has been an issue since AC2.Story and characters are not as engaging as the first 2 arcs of Ezio's story. And the modern side to the tale gets more convoluted than ever. Good points: The setting of Constantinople is again beautifully crafted. Turn off the HUD and explore. The music is gorgeous, shame that this is Jesper Kyd's last work in the Assassin's Creed series. The multiplayer has improved and added new game modes. But you might be hard pressed to find a lobby nowadays. The bomb mechanics are quite nice and the hookblade as well. I would recommend this game only if you have liked Ezio and you want a conclusion to his side of the story.			"

												My personal favorite of the series so far. This game brings closure to Ezio's story and provides a smooth transition into the next game. Desmond is given more story and there are optional levels where you can learn more about his life by solving puzzles.Revelations takes Ezio back to the route of Assassin's Creed and has him follow the trail Marco Polo has left for him in Istanbul. At the end of each memory sequence there is an Altair memory which reviells the events following the first game.As well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!As in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations. This, to me, makes a lot of sense as Ezio is an older and even more experienced assassin.Couldn't recommend this more espesially as it's normally ont £2.50 on sale!			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations has an amazing graphics and incredible gameplay, full with action objectives and interesting story, the last in the Ezio saga, who also comletes the Assassin's Creed 1. the only disadvantage in my opiion is the fact that the game is very short and almost does not provide you the options of an open world gameplay like it's former. yet the location is very exotic and different than the rest of the games so far, and the game brings many answers to interesting questions about the franchise. in addition the game contains another version of the multiplayer gameply, who had been improved, clearly, and has an interesting story as well.

												This game dissapointed me in a lot of ways, though it impressed me in one.Gone are the crazy puzzle sections from 'the truth'.  I can't get over that, they were awesome, and added so much 'current time' backstory.As it is, the game has very little connection to the current time, the primary plot thread  literally does not move until the end of the game.Something cool they did add though is the portal-like puzzle sections for desmond's backstory.  Though interesting, his backstory is too much of a retread.Anyway it was worth what I paid for it, but I can't really reccoemend it unless it's $30 or less.			"

												Every time I play a new Assassins Crees Game it gets better and better. There are more variaety in the missions and the story keeps getting better and better.I love the fact we can see all Ezio Auditore's life as an assassins since the AC II. However i found more fun to play the AC Brotherhood than this one. It's still an awesome play and fully recomended.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Though I had tons of fun and loved every minute of it, it just feels like an Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood 1.5. Improved graphics, tweeked gameplay, better multiplayer, and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks to date, it is a solid entry to the franchise. Yeah, it feels a little bit rushed and though the story is good, you can tell Ubi is stretching it. Some new elements are a welcome addition (bombs) and others missed the mark horribly (Tower Defense anyone?). Good game overall.			"

												It's alright, but taken as a whole, it's probably my least favorite Assassin's Creed game so far (AC:III or portables not included). It suffers from feature creep - bombs seem like a silly improvement that will get little use, and the tower defense minigame is straight up dumb. The freerunning is the same as before, with no real changes. The meta-story with Desmond is a nonstarter, fleshing out his backstory a tiny bit but not resolving the cliffhanger of AC:Brotherhood at all. Overall recommendation: it's more of the same from the last games, except not quite as well executed. Give it a whirl if it's on sale.			"

												Revelations is a bit of a bittersweet experience. On the one hand the game offers up a lot more answers and insight into the story arcs of Ezio Auditore, Altair Ibn La'Ahad, Desmond Miles and the struggle between Templar and Assassin but at the same time the entire thing feels like it's tied together very loosely. Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood featured Ezio Auditore struggling against the Italian Templars first as a means for personal revenge and then as a true Assassin fighting against tyranny. With the shift to Constantinople both Ezio and the player feel like complete outsiders with no real stake in the budding conflict between Ahmet and Selim over the Sultanate. The entire expereince is even ironically summed up at the end of the game when Ezio is told to leave and never return - leaving any and all of the player's victories and failures feeling hollow. To make matters worse Revelations is the first installment in the series to really not bring anything new and ground-breaking to the franchise. The biggest additions are the hookblade and the bomb making but both of these things feel like they were just added out of necessity rather than as interesting and enjoyable features.The most outlandish of the new ""features"" however is Desmond's Journey (and later the Lost Archive DLC). Seperate from the main game, these portions have you navigate puzzles and obstacles from a first-person view while learning more about Desmond Miles and Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16). While the concept is interesting it just feels out of place and as a result kind of unnecessary.  The multiplayer however did see some improvements - namely the introduction of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes as well as the ability for players to customize their characters' clothing and weapons.Overall I believe Revelations' real issue stems from the fact that it's trying to cover too many bases at the same time. Attempting to tie up loose ends between mutiple characters spread out over different time periods and games, moving the main modern day story arc along, AND giving the player a new location with a new historical story-line and characters proves to be too much for Ubisoft to stuff into a 25+ hour title and in Revelations' case it definitely shows.

												Assassins Creed Revelations continues the story of Etzio, though aged, still has his talents as the great assassin. You are thrown into many different environments. Scaling buildings, fighting opponents, and managing your brotherhood is easier, than ever. Ubisoft adds a few kinks so that things aren’t too easy that is. Defending your Den’s from attack, adds a defensive gameplay to the game, which has never really been done before in any previous AC game. The story is just as compelling as the last, with stunning visuals to lead the way. Soldiers can counter, your counter adding some interesting fights, as not all enemies can just be killed with a thrust of a sword, or axe. And on top of that multiplayer has improved as well. The game is once again a must buy. This story is definitely something you won’t forget.			"

												The third Ezio Auditore da Firenze game is as good as ever. One thing I like is the games change, but still feel like sequels. AC II was a country roaming, assassing vengeance quest. AC Brotherhood was a power building game, build your strength, make your mark, raise you team and then strike. This game is more story based.The intro is my favourite to the three Ezio games. Masyaf castle is an excellent setting, and the story is just great. You leave Roma for once and go to Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey) to follow in the footsteps of Niccolo Polo to retrieve the 5 keys to Altair's library. Excellent game once again, keeping in the same style of the other Ezio games.However, I personally was not a fan of the bomb mechanic that was introduced. I preferred the tooth and blade style.			"

												Neue Stadt zum Rumlaufen, neue Story, gleicher Held, gleiches Gameplay - AC Revelations zusammengefasst.Punkt I: Die Stadt - Konstantinopel / IstanbulWie für Assassin's Creed üblich, eine wunderhübsch animierte, lebendig wirkende Welt mit Passanten, Marktschreiern, Wachen, Händlern - allem was eine Assassin's Creed-Stadt eben so braucht. Historisch und proportional korrekt nachgebaut, kommt sofort das tolle ""Jaaaaaaa-hier-darf-ich-rumlaufen-Gefühl auf"". Sehr gut gelungen.Punkt II: Die Story - Gut gelungen, wenn auch kurzKurz und knapp wie auch schon in Brotherhood erzählt Revelations eine vergleichsweise gute, schnörkellose Geschichte, wobei es den größten Nachteil aus AC II nicht wieder ins Spiel bringt. Ein zwei Twists sind auch mit dabei - alles in allem für ein AC-Spiel wirklich angemessen.Punkt III: Der Held - EzioGleiche Animationen, nur 2 neue Tricks (Hakenklinge im Kampf und Hakenklinge bei der Fortbewegung) - Ezio hat sich nicht viel verändert, nur dass er jetzt halt um die 50 Jahre alt ist. Seine Kampftechnik beeinflusst das nicht, im Gegenteil, er lernt sogar noch brutalere und assassinigere (ist das ein Wort?) Killmoves. #Sein Charakter bleibt auch nicht auf der Strecke, denn seine freundliche, inzwischen natürlich weisere Art wird angemessen, aber nicht übertrieben betont.Punkt IV: Das GameplayWie Schon in Punkt III erwähnt, so hat sich das Gameplay nur um 2 Tricks erweitert - Die beiden Eigenschaften der Hakenklinge, die man für's Klettern, für's Seilrutschen und für's Hinterhältig-töten nutzen kann. Deutlich stärker macht einen das nicht, aber wann waren der Kampf oder das Klettern in Assassin's Creed schon schwierig? Das einzige was es tut, ist cool aussehen und sein, und die Steuerung ein wenig erleichtern - was es wohl auch soll.Fazit:Obwohl die Steuerung, die Grafik, und das generelle Gameplay sich nicht im Geringsten von den beiden Vorgängern AC II und AC: Brotherhood unterscheiden, so ist doch AC: Revelations für seine 15€ auf jeden Fall lohnenswert. Eine Kaufempfehlung für AC-Fans und Neulinge!			"

												Coming into this game, I was very nervous. I had played all the Assassin's Creeds prior to this and loved them, with Brotherhood easily being my favourite. Now I was nervous coming in because going to Constantinople from Rome was a big jump and I didn't think I would have fun in this new city. I mean it's kind of hard to top going after the Pope and the Borgia family. I was so frightened about this problem that I actually delayed myself playing it for a very long time. I can say, however, that this game did very well. As the conclusion to Ezio Auditore, this game gives him a wonderful send off, while still making sure that everything is fun along the way. While this game doesn't quite meet the high-stakes assassinations of previous games, it does plenty of new things that come in to replace them, and most important, makes them feel very natural. Now I won't spoil anything, but some of the setpoints are very fun. Some of the side dungeon-like crawls are especially fun and make for excellent game play where you feel as though you are a real assassin having to fight time and perils, compared to the idiot who bumps into everyone while running. As far as plot, some of it's pretty good. Overall, it's fairly average for a game. I say game and not Assassin's Creed because plot is not something any of the games are trying to accomplish. These games are to make you feel like an assassin in the most spectacular ways possible, and this does that very well. Overall this game receives a: 7 out of 10			"

												Revelations is, at best, more Assassin's Creed. If that is what you want, that is what you shall receive, but there is very little of note for the game itself. It is hard to recomend it over Brotherhood, and it is far from the high point of AC2, it is simply another formulaic yearly sequel.The combat is largely unchanged from Brotherhood, and retains the sense of bloat that was present in its predecessor. While there are 6 ways to kill an enemy from range, you rarely ever need anything more than the throwing knives, a weapon found in every entry of the series so far. The missions are somewhat lackluster as well. While the challenge feature from Brotherhood remains present, the ""challenge"" seems to have been left out. The challenge requirements for most missions are laughably simple, and often can be accomplished without any real difficulty.If you want more AC, that is what Revelations offers, but if you just want the pinacle of the series, stick to AC2			"

												I've written many recommendations for the entire Assassin's Creed franchise. Yet here I find myself at a loss for words. This is the one of those series, that just keeps getting better and better. I think I can count the amount of series that can boast that, on one hand. Revelations takes the amazing parts of Assassin's Creed and adds a pinch of reality. You don't just run around aimlessly butchering stuff, you need to take up the mantle of being the Mentor for the entire brotherhood, you need to direct attacks, organize defense on a much larger scale than you used to, all while attempting to progress the story and learning your part in the grand scheme of things.

												I love the writing in this franchise and the way they finished with the stories of both Ezio and Altair only furthers my appreciation. Just like Brotherhood there is a new big city, new characters and new features with around 20-30 hours single player game time not including all the fun side missions and 100% synchronization challenges. Multiplayer still feels unique and is still going strong with a few upgrades implemented although they still need a text chat, perk balance and lighting that hits the thick players running around on rooftops. If you've played the other AC games you know what to expect by now and if you haven't then go buy the first Assassin's Creed because Revelations feels like a season finale.			"

												It's really good because it keeps everything that made Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood great and added new elements to gameplay like the hookshot that allows for faster climbing and ziplines that allow for faster travel around the city.  It also explains the history of Altair and how Desmond, Altair, and Ezio are all connected.  Assassin's Creed Revelations is not a perfect game however.  It's too short with the campaign being only about 10-11 hours.  Also the setting in Constantinople is not as fun and scenic as the Italian cities or Rome, Florence etc.  I still would reccommend it to anyone who's played all the other Assassin's Creed games.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												People often wonder whether AC R. is worth the money given that is doesn't add in to any great extent to the AC series but to  those people I say please just splash out. As the subtitle suggests, the game brings greater clarity to the overall storyline of AC and adds insight into Ezio and Altair. The gameplay is recognisable and clean and there is a greater graphical clean-ness. The storyline is interesting and enjoyable and adds new weapons and armour. No, the game isn't a necessity to the series but is still and 9/10 for me.			"

												Assassins Creed Revelations continues the story of Etzio, though aged, still has his talents as the great assassin. You are thrown into many different environments. Scaling buildings, fighting opponents, and managing your brotherhood is easier, than ever. Ubisoft adds a few kinks so that things aren’t too easy that is. Defending your Den’s from attack, adds a defensive gameplay to the game, which has never really been done before in any previous AC game. The story is just as compelling as the last, with stunning visuals to lead the way. Soldiers can counter, your counter adding some interesting fights, as not all enemies can just be killed with a thrust of a sword, or axe. And on top of that multiplayer has improved as well. The game is once again a must buy. This story is definitely something you won’t forget.			"

												Neue Stadt zum Rumlaufen, neue Story, gleicher Held, gleiches Gameplay - AC Revelations zusammengefasst.Punkt I: Die Stadt - Konstantinopel / IstanbulWie für Assassin's Creed üblich, eine wunderhübsch animierte, lebendig wirkende Welt mit Passanten, Marktschreiern, Wachen, Händlern - allem was eine Assassin's Creed-Stadt eben so braucht. Historisch und proportional korrekt nachgebaut, kommt sofort das tolle ""Jaaaaaaa-hier-darf-ich-rumlaufen-Gefühl auf"". Sehr gut gelungen.Punkt II: Die Story - Gut gelungen, wenn auch kurzKurz und knapp wie auch schon in Brotherhood erzählt Revelations eine vergleichsweise gute, schnörkellose Geschichte, wobei es den größten Nachteil aus AC II nicht wieder ins Spiel bringt. Ein zwei Twists sind auch mit dabei - alles in allem für ein AC-Spiel wirklich angemessen.Punkt III: Der Held - EzioGleiche Animationen, nur 2 neue Tricks (Hakenklinge im Kampf und Hakenklinge bei der Fortbewegung) - Ezio hat sich nicht viel verändert, nur dass er jetzt halt um die 50 Jahre alt ist. Seine Kampftechnik beeinflusst das nicht, im Gegenteil, er lernt sogar noch brutalere und assassinigere (ist das ein Wort?) Killmoves. #Sein Charakter bleibt auch nicht auf der Strecke, denn seine freundliche, inzwischen natürlich weisere Art wird angemessen, aber nicht übertrieben betont.Punkt IV: Das GameplayWie Schon in Punkt III erwähnt, so hat sich das Gameplay nur um 2 Tricks erweitert - Die beiden Eigenschaften der Hakenklinge, die man für's Klettern, für's Seilrutschen und für's Hinterhältig-töten nutzen kann. Deutlich stärker macht einen das nicht, aber wann waren der Kampf oder das Klettern in Assassin's Creed schon schwierig? Das einzige was es tut, ist cool aussehen und sein, und die Steuerung ein wenig erleichtern - was es wohl auch soll.Fazit:Obwohl die Steuerung, die Grafik, und das generelle Gameplay sich nicht im Geringsten von den beiden Vorgängern AC II und AC: Brotherhood unterscheiden, so ist doch AC: Revelations für seine 15€ auf jeden Fall lohnenswert. Eine Kaufempfehlung für AC-Fans und Neulinge!			"

												Okay, it's not AC II, it's not Brotherhood, but it's still a good game to play. The final game to feature Ezio Auditore as the main ancestor whose memories are explored might not be quite as good as it's predecessors, but the journey to the Eastern side of the Mediterranian offers a wonderful experience never the less. Beware of a few plotholes and contradictions though, as well as a few bugs scattered throughout.The economy system is present once more, allowing you to revitalize Constantinople by opening shops, buying monuments and installing assassin dens throughout. The (by the end of the game) huge amounts of income this generates allow you to purchase a variety of nifty items and of course more of the above. New gameplay elements including the hookblade and craftable bombs allow the player to have more fun in the cities.Sadly enough there are also a lot of downsides to the game, the world is smaller, with most of the action taking place in Contantinople. There are also fewer things to do with the factions, they're basically tools to use rather than that they feel... thought out, vibrant or whatever. The assassin den missions are fun, but repetitive, with little variation between them.Still, while not a dazzling gem, this game is still fun to play. Especially if you played the previous two installments and want to see what happened to Ezio.			"

												Revelations is, at best, more Assassin's Creed. If that is what you want, that is what you shall receive, but there is very little of note for the game itself. It is hard to recomend it over Brotherhood, and it is far from the high point of AC2, it is simply another formulaic yearly sequel.The combat is largely unchanged from Brotherhood, and retains the sense of bloat that was present in its predecessor. While there are 6 ways to kill an enemy from range, you rarely ever need anything more than the throwing knives, a weapon found in every entry of the series so far. The missions are somewhat lackluster as well. While the challenge feature from Brotherhood remains present, the ""challenge"" seems to have been left out. The challenge requirements for most missions are laughably simple, and often can be accomplished without any real difficulty.If you want more AC, that is what Revelations offers, but if you just want the pinacle of the series, stick to AC2			"

												Coming into this game, I was very nervous. I had played all the Assassin's Creeds prior to this and loved them, with Brotherhood easily being my favourite. Now I was nervous coming in because going to Constantinople from Rome was a big jump and I didn't think I would have fun in this new city. I mean it's kind of hard to top going after the Pope and the Borgia family. I was so frightened about this problem that I actually delayed myself playing it for a very long time. I can say, however, that this game did very well. As the conclusion to Ezio Auditore, this game gives him a wonderful send off, while still making sure that everything is fun along the way. While this game doesn't quite meet the high-stakes assassinations of previous games, it does plenty of new things that come in to replace them, and most important, makes them feel very natural. Now I won't spoil anything, but some of the setpoints are very fun. Some of the side dungeon-like crawls are especially fun and make for excellent game play where you feel as though you are a real assassin having to fight time and perils, compared to the idiot who bumps into everyone while running. As far as plot, some of it's pretty good. Overall, it's fairly average for a game. I say game and not Assassin's Creed because plot is not something any of the games are trying to accomplish. These games are to make you feel like an assassin in the most spectacular ways possible, and this does that very well. Overall this game receives a: 7 out of 10			"

												It's really good because it keeps everything that made Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood great and added new elements to gameplay like the hookshot that allows for faster climbing and ziplines that allow for faster travel around the city.  It also explains the history of Altair and how Desmond, Altair, and Ezio are all connected.  Assassin's Creed Revelations is not a perfect game however.  It's too short with the campaign being only about 10-11 hours.  Also the setting in Constantinople is not as fun and scenic as the Italian cities or Rome, Florence etc.  I still would reccommend it to anyone who's played all the other Assassin's Creed games.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.			"

I tried it a few times just to make sure I wasn't crazy.

												I've only just started to play Revelations, I must say it has been good for the most part. There are a few things that urk me though, for one the character models for Desmond, Ezio and Altair (Clay somewhat included). I loved the way the characters looked in Brotherhood, but now Desmond looks like Adam Sandler, Ezio's head is more of a Gorilla shape/void of emotion, and the first thing I noticed about Altair is that his nose is bigger than his whole face. Speaking of Altair, the voice actor they used to replace him; while I understand the change of accent seeing how he is in that type of area, I don't like the fact that Altair's voice is deeper. Another thing that sort of bothers me is the aspect that your Templar meter goes up everytime you renovate a location, I understand why they put this in considering you're building up in an area where they would be looking for brotherhood activity, but they could have at least implimented more than just bribing Heralds and killing witness.

												To me, this game is sumarized in two words. And these two words really don't warrant a spoilers warning (in my opinion) because ultimately the developers were very open in saying that this is what you'd experience when playing this game BEFORE the game came out. So here's the two words. You get to say: ""Goodbye Ezio"". Which. You get to play as him ONE LAST TIME, before inevitably saying goodbye to the most timeless and compelling character in all of Video Game history (my opinion). Though this game DOES wrap up the story arc oriented around The Apple Of Eden, to me, ""Goodbye Ezio"" is the thing that truly stands out.Though this game can be sumarized in two words, it's just as amazing as any game in the series (pardoning AC3... what a disapointment).

												The game finally speeds up the pace which was slowed down in Brotherhood and rushes through diverse set of events without ever leaving the space for boredom. It feels somewhat shorter than its predecessor, but this helps keeping things interesting through and through. Gone are the brilliant puzzles from ACII and Brotherhood, but they're replaced by first-person storytelling sequences with platforming elements. Main theme by Lorne Balfe performed by the winner of a fan singing contest sounds amazing and is probably the most memorable musical piece in the whole series to date. Multiplayer got a facelift as well and now features a sort of a storyline with cutscenes. The game once again manages to pull off a mind-blowing and heartfelt ending that leaves you with a melancholic afterthought.The best AC game since ACII, a magnificent conclusion to the stories of two brilliant characters.

												For three consecutive years, Ubisoft has been releasing new installments to its Assassin's Creed franchise. My fears with such quick sequels were quelled with Brotherhood, which bested its already remarkable predecessor by a mile. Needless to say, Revelations had a lot to live up to.I'd be hard pressed to highlight memorable additions in this new iteration. While Revelations recaptures what made its prequels amazing, it lacks innovation. The few new inclusions are a tower defense mini-game, bomb crafting, and puzzle sequences featuring Desmond.If you loved Brotherhood's multiplayer, it's still as exhilarating as ever here and the plot remains a meticulous tapestry of fact and fiction. Any fan who has followed the storyline will appreciate this new installment which concludes the journeys of Altair and Ezio in heartwarming fashion.At the end of the day, Revelations is still worth recommending, despite it coming off as more of an expansion than a full-fledged sequel.Grade: B+			"

												For me this game falls in between Brotherhood and II, leaning more closely to II.  Knocks against it: they've changed the controls ever so slighttly between this one and the last two games; just enough that you'll die a couple of times in the heat of the moment because you fell back into old habits.  The writing is poor; the first assassination made me wonder if the writeres even understood Ezio's character.  New character models for Desmond and Ezio; can't reaally figure out why Ubi decided to do this for the last game in the series, but by they time you start to get used to it, the game is over.  The mini-games suck; I dont' care about a crappy tower defense, or a bomb-making game.Things it does right: parkour, and killing.  Luckily, those two things are enough to make it worth it.			"

												Revelations feels like a true progression to the Assassin's Creed franchise, expanding on everything that was new in brotherhood, but giving it purpouse and depth. Assassin recruits are given more meaning, as once you level them to 10, you can assign them to a den and begin a mission with them in which you actuall interact with your recruits. Gaining recruits seems some similarly unique missions, as aposed to the simple 'defend the civilian' from Brotherhood, which still exists but in lesser numbers. Missions for your rEcruits also has a purpose, letting you gain control of other reagions of the world while you work towards your goals in Constantinople. The story is much richer in Revelations, and ties up loose ends, and gives a very satisfying conclusion to both Ezio and Altair's storylines. Desmonds story is progressed only slightly, but some of his backstory is filled in, more than him actually making any forward progression in the over arching plot. The new setting is refreshing from ACII and Brotherhood's focus on Italy, and the new characters you meet are easier to connect with, and care about than in previous titles. The new hookblade adds some much needed precision and functionality to free-running, and adds some speed to vertical transitions. Finishing animations add a lot to combat, and might actually make you stick around and fight a pack of guards instead of running away and hidding.All in all, this s the best game in the Ezio trillogy, and in the first 4 games.

												Assassin's Creed Revelations is a great addition to the ever expanding and intriguing Assassin Creed series. At first look and play the game seems as usual and repetitive as the others. Revelations continues off with Ezio Auditore an assassin fighting to rebuild his brotherhood while trying to piece together some of the past history of the Assassin Brotherhood. On top of that he sparks up somewhat a romance with another main character.  All in all the game deliver a very immersive gameplay, expanded its resources, and even added new locations. Although not the most gripping AC game so far it earned a place in the story by shedding more light on past events and developing Desomond Miles character for the future series.			"

												Just like Assassin’s Creed 2 and Brotherhood before it, Revelations is an Action Adventure 3rd Person RPG. Not much has changed in this one from Brotherhood as Ubisoft felt like they had figured out the best formula to make just about the perfect Assassin’s Creed. However they have added a few things to combat and the cities. In Revelations you can now build different kinds of bombs with different ingredients that are useful in lots of situations.  The various bombs include Caltrop Bombs (explodes caltrops that hinder your enemy’s movement), Cherry Bombs (which make a large sound that can lure guards away), Gold Bombs (Filled with coins that cause the crowds to create a distraction) and several more. They also added a hook blade that while climbing doesn’t really add anything else but when the player is running towards an enemy can use the hook blade to vault over them and keep moving. It also allows the player to utilize the zip lines. On top of that another game mode was added within the single player called “Den Defense.” This mode is sort of like a tower defense mini game in which the player uses “resources” to buy different kind of assassin’s that defends an Assassin’s Den from the Templars. It is a nice fun way to get away from the tediousness of some of the missions.Overall the gameplay didn’t change much however it did seem like at times they had broken the fights a little more making it more difficult to do various moves and allowed for the player to get hit more in fights. Unlike the other two games I started to get a little irritated with the bugginess of the combat and climbing at times. 	The story continues after the ending of Brotherhood in which Desmond has fallen into a coma because of the event that happened at the end of Brotherhood. His Assassin comrades decide to put him back into the Animus where he awakens to Subject Sixteen and Animus Island. Desmond must find out the location of the lost city from Ezio before the Animus deletes and purges him from the system (exactly what happened to Subject Sixteen). When he begins as Ezio he finds himself in Masyaf (The Assassin’s Stronghold from the first game) trying to open Altair’s library to discover the location of The Great Temple but there are Templars everywhere. Ezio discovers that the way to open the library is to find the 6 Masyaf keys that are located in Constantinople/Istanbul. While he is looking for the new keys he discovers a plot by the Templar led Byzantines to retake Constantinople from the Sultans. Unfortunately I can’t give too much more in plot as it would reveal and spoil too much but suffice to say I enjoyed this story the most out of the three.  	It felt like a lot more detail went into the cities in Revelations than Brotherhood or Assassin’s Creed 2. There are a lot more colors, more subtle details and even the characters/NPCs have more life to them. The locals felt unique and the design was quite impressive. It also feels like this was a better done port that the other two as it runs better on my PC however it wasn’t without its bugs. I did get frequent bugs and crashes while playing and it did set me back a bit. However the voice acting is just as good as the other two games if not better. Roger Craig Smith has done his best as Ezio yet and all of the Turkish characters had a fine accent as well. The music actually felt more like it was made for a cinematic experience and that added to the game a lot as well. Overall I felt like the story was the best yet in this game however the gameplay felt forced and buggy. On top of that the game had several crashes that did make me do parts over again which was unfortunate. However with that being said and even if the score is lower I believe that this game was the better game simply because of the story (That is the part I feel is most important in a game).•	Story  - 5 out of 5•	Gameplay – 3 out of 5•	Graphics – 5 out of 5•	Sound  - 5 out of 5•	Fun – 4 out of 5A total score of 4.4 out of 5 "

												Revelations is the Fourth Installment of the Assassin's Creed series.In Revelations, you pick up a bit afterwards where Brotherhood left off.If you haven't played Brotherhood, beware of the lines below.You've been warned.Since Ezio now has no enemies in Rome, and his Brotherhood keeps expanding, he  decided to learn more about the Assassin's, and the best way to do it, would be to visit their birthplace, the Assassin Den of Masyaf.This is the last game that was played on the skin of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in this game, he already has quite some age. It would be impossible for him to live much more afterwards. This game is the one that concludes *his* story.I have to say, the game was okay to me. Some people may not like it.It's set in Constantinople, wich is one of the largest cities that ever existed.You've got alot of collectibles to find, and the story itself is great.You also have Multiplayer, wich is okay, but too focused on upon.I'd say, good purchase, but get it on discount.

												After the collapse of Cesare Borgia on Rome,Ezio seeks for answers to questions that were following him for a very long time during his lifetime.As a result,he left Rome and headed to Masyaf,the home of the first appeared Assassins,but after so many centuries since the Crusades,Masyaf hasn't been home to the Assassins for a very long time.As he explores Masyaf,he heads to Constantinople,since the Templars who were on Masyaf where sent by their Masters from Constantinople. About the gameplay ; Graphics are increased and are even better,Ezio is more lethal and wise in combat than ever,allowing you to defeat any kind of enemies even with the worst weapon.			"

												Maybe one of the most memorable and diffcult experiences in the ac franchise.Economy system is not as easy as it used to be, thus making the game more challenging to complete. But the key elements are all there. Awesome story, epic graphics and a nice conclusion to the assassin saga of the middle ages. So far after ac 1 revelations is the best this series has to offer (without having played 3). To all ac fans its a treasure to behold!!!			"

												Young Italian born, Love and Tragedy, Experienced Veteran Assassin, Revolutionary and PassionEzio Auditore da Firenze, now an aging mentor, filled with Questions and Struggle.The Fourth and last game with the aging italian assassin.My friends, my brotherhood, we have seen Ezio go through much in his life, we have seen family, love, tragedies, revolutions, mysteries, and yet this final chapter concludes his journey. Expect; literally everything that made Ezio who he is, what he became, what he struggled for, and what he fights for.We see a man who is plagued with questions that need answers, that can finally end this war between Templars and Assasin's.He still is smart and despote his old age, still can make an old lad learn new tricks.The unexpected marches to your door, only to find a new sense of adventure, love, companionship, struggles, death, corruption, greed, betrayal, treachery, and wisdom.I cannot say for sure, if you will enjoy this game, as much as I have seen Ezio grow from a young lad to an aging man. It is heartwarming and sad for him to continue to find answers that long elude his blades.But, keep in mind this game wraps up previous questions like that of Desmond and the unknown that plagues each and everyone of us who have been with them for over  two games. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, You're final journey is at last within your blades reach.Take the Leap of Faith. 9.63/10			"

												If you played AC and wondered what happened to Altiar then this is the best follow up game, as it explains events after taking back Masyaf.ACR in itself is just a continuation of Ezio's story, while not concluded (imo). Its the usual run around/climb buildings we loved in AC1.			"

This one is streamlined in a good way and has done away with the horse riding between cities, etc. You get in the action and stay there. The Desmond chapters have more in common with Portal, but If you liked Brotherhood you'll like this one just as much.			"

												Taking the best from the previous series, game gives you an amazing experience, action-packed intense gameplay, random and interesting missions. Story is great, ancient Istanbul is huge and interesting to explore, music is so much epic. Some people say brotherhood/revelations is more like addon, but this isn`t true. It took me almost 30 hours for about 87% total sync and still have some side-missions left. If you`re up for a good mature story in an open-world sandbox - pick it up immediately.If you`re a series fan - this is must have of course, will fill up the missing story chapters so you can see the untold earlier Altair`s stories, Desmond past and so much more.

												ACR is the latest installment to the AC series. The story continues with Desmond and Ezio. If you followed the AC series then this will be an excellent addition to your list. The physics and overall gameplay has been improved, but as usual sometimes they just don't do what you want. Hopefully with improvements in the games this will be better in future. Overall the story remains as excellent and puts more light on what happened. Additional videos and content are only available on the other side of the world though.The one problem that most followers of the series will have is that the version available in the US is much more limited than the ones available in Australia for example. Additional maps and characters, items and side-stories that are not available and are region locked made many shy away from this. Personally I only purchased it because I got a coupon for 50% off - else I would not have purchased it for the original price without the perks that are available elsewhere.			"

You'll never want something to be over faster than the tower defense gamemodes thrown in for what feels like last-minute attempts to save face in this mediocre expansion.The story of subject 16 is finally resolved, and bridges some gaps between ACII and ACIII. Not a necessary buy, but a good one to experience the whole series. Multiplayer doesn't add much, if anything, besides skins. "

The gameplay is the same but  with a few new features like the tower defence type game on your assasins dens and being able to use bombs and ziplines etc. I did miss the wealth of locations in the previous games but still it was alot of fun being in a different location with different types of people and enemies. Again definitely recommend it if you enjoy any of the games but i'd recommend you play them in order to follow whats going on.			"

												I've only just started to play Revelations, I must say it has been good for the most part. There are a few things that urk me though, for one the character models for Desmond, Ezio and Altair (Clay somewhat included). I loved the way the characters looked in Brotherhood, but now Desmond looks like Adam Sandler, Ezio's head is more of a Gorilla shape/void of emotion, and the first thing I noticed about Altair is that his nose is bigger than his whole face. Speaking of Altair, the voice actor they used to replace him; while I understand the change of accent seeing how he is in that type of area, I don't like the fact that Altair's voice is deeper. Another thing that sort of bothers me is the aspect that your Templar meter goes up everytime you renovate a location, I understand why they put this in considering you're building up in an area where they would be looking for brotherhood activity, but they could have at least implimented more than just bribing Heralds and killing witness.

												To me, this game is sumarized in two words. And these two words really don't warrant a spoilers warning (in my opinion) because ultimately the developers were very open in saying that this is what you'd experience when playing this game BEFORE the game came out. So here's the two words. You get to say: ""Goodbye Ezio"". Which. You get to play as him ONE LAST TIME, before inevitably saying goodbye to the most timeless and compelling character in all of Video Game history (my opinion). Though this game DOES wrap up the story arc oriented around The Apple Of Eden, to me, ""Goodbye Ezio"" is the thing that truly stands out.Though this game can be sumarized in two words, it's just as amazing as any game in the series (pardoning AC3... what a disapointment).

												The game finally speeds up the pace which was slowed down in Brotherhood and rushes through diverse set of events without ever leaving the space for boredom. It feels somewhat shorter than its predecessor, but this helps keeping things interesting through and through. Gone are the brilliant puzzles from ACII and Brotherhood, but they're replaced by first-person storytelling sequences with platforming elements. Main theme by Lorne Balfe performed by the winner of a fan singing contest sounds amazing and is probably the most memorable musical piece in the whole series to date. Multiplayer got a facelift as well and now features a sort of a storyline with cutscenes. The game once again manages to pull off a mind-blowing and heartfelt ending that leaves you with a melancholic afterthought.The best AC game since ACII, a magnificent conclusion to the stories of two brilliant characters.

That's the laziness of these developers, All they had to do was stitch this game together with Brotherhood and boo yah...You got two games in one, loads of DLC along with Ezio dying off perfectly in his little ""Pixar "" movie...Not only would they have made money, they would have made money with a more reasonable game. No justification calls for glitches and  bugs in this one, and this game was alot more interesting than Brotherhood.

												AC2 started off with a very good storyline, which Brotherhood extended. However Revelations is where things got really interesting with the introduction of a variety of bombs which made completing missions a lot more ""have it your way"". Of all the AC2 titles, would definitely recommend Revelations the highest in terms of gameplay... although the original AC2 had a much more interesting storyline. Brotherhood was in-between the two on all counts!			"

												     Well it's assassins creed nothing really more to say.  If you have the money I'd really say just skip this game although if your like me and can just play these games for hours on end for no apparent reason might as well pick it up.  Story line is good and is the end to the Ezio Alditori line, the 2 major features of this game are, taking place in istanbul not constantinople, and ezio's new tool the hook blade.  Both are very fun but the hook blade is more or less a gimmick, and The map had buildings so close together there sadly wasn't able to put horses in.  TL;DR  Really just for fans of the series.  6.5/10			"

												People often wonder whether AC R. is worth the money given that is doesn't add in to any great extent to the AC series but to  those people I say please just splash out. As the subtitle suggests, the game brings greater clarity to the overall storyline of AC and adds insight into Ezio and Altair. The gameplay is recognisable and clean and there is a greater graphical clean-ness. The storyline is interesting and enjoyable and adds new weapons and armour. No, the game isn't a necessity to the series but is still and 9/10 for me.			"

												Not quite as good as Brotherhood, which I consider the AC masterpiece so far, but still very enjoyable.  The bomb mechanic and shoehorned tower defense game are very unwelcome additions to the formula, but it advances the pseudo story and it's great to hang out with Ezio once more.  Don't spend too much money on the DLC.44hrs.technical glitch.  I had some major stuttering with this game until I used a frame limiter to limit the frames to exactly 60fps.			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of the better games in the franchise,graphical not a lot worse then Black Flag. The game also has a great storyline,and, a lot of fun to play, even without playing a story mission.Roaming through the streets of Instanbul is awesome,it's not a boring open world, a thing which would have made ACIII suck less.You can spend a few hours on making the city free of Templars, and even more in the huge assassins-management minigame.A lot of bang for buck, mostly now it's older.Though you may think the multiplayer is impossible to play, because there are just a few people,you can play multiplayer matches sometimes (not at 1 in the morning though).But the coolest thing in the game is, of course, Ezio's SUPER AWESOME ACCENT!!

												The story of Revelations depends very strongly on knowing who Altair, Ezio, and Desmond are already, and how they got to where they are now, so play the games in order. That said, Revelations offers some neat new gameplay elements on top of the excellent AC formula, at the risk of becoming slightly bloated (which has me excited for AC3's fresh start). Like its predecessors, it packs tons of detail into its environments, and tells you tons about the history of its primary city. More importantly, though, it provides great expansions and satisfying conclusions to the stories of Altair and Ezio, leaving the series fully free to explore new assassins and work on Desmond's story.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/08/assassins-creed-revelations.html "

												End of an era. Assassins Creed Revelations is probably one of the games in the Assassins Creed series i did not like the most. But this do not mean that i didnt like the game. Set in 1511 in Constantinople, this game follows the last story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, as he tries to find answers about Altair iben La-Ahad, earlier master of the assassin order. The game had a pretty storyline, wich turned out to be Ezios last. The characters, music and setting really gave the city of Constantinople an uniqe touch and feeling, the same sloppy multiplayer retuned with not so many changes, something that were a bit disapointing. All in all it was a great game, and you have to play it if you want to play trough the Assassins Creed series, but dont expect this one to be the best of the franchise. 8.0/10 -MaxzpyroP			"

												If you play games for the storytelling, then you might like this game. This title concludes Ezio's story from AC2 and AC: Brotherhood, so you will probably like this story if you liked the story from those titles. The voice acting and dialog are very good in my opinion. None of the characters stood out as particularily annoying either. There is also some optional extra story related to Desmond's past leading up to the first AC title that is unlocked by collecting DNA fragments while playing as Ezio. I found the story to be somewhat interesting, but it wasn't worth dealing with the awkward first person perspective game play.If you play games for the game play mechanics and like the game play mechanics of the previous Assassin's Creed titles, then you will probably like this title. The controls are still a little awkward. I often found that Ezio trying climb walls unintentionally when all I wanted him to do was run straight. Bombs were added along with the ability to craft them. Ingredients for them are found all over the place in chests, looted from enemies or purchased from vendors. I found these to be pretty useful during my playthrough, and they offered some variety to the combat.The hookblade was added which allows Ezio to climb faster, use ziplines and perform some new combat moves. While climbing up a wall in the previous titles, the player could jump up and grab a ledge that was slightly out of reach. The hookblade essentially just removes the need to press another button in order to grab onto that ledge after jumping. Ziplines are randomly placed over the city rooftops, but I found that I rarely used them during my playthrough as they usually didn't go in the direction I was heading. The hookblade can also be used during combat to do a ""hook and run"" (Ezio rolls over the back of an enemy and keeps on running), ""hook and throw"" (Ezio rolls over the back of an enemy and throws him to the ground) and ""counter steal"" (Ezio hooks the pocket where the enemy's coin purse is and jacks it). The only time I ever used these moves during my playthrough was to complete the challenges associated with them.This title also has a number of challenges associated with the assassins, the mercenary guild, theives guild, the romanis and bombs. Most of the challenges are relatively easy to complete (Call assassins in during combat 25 times, Distract guards with romanis 15 times, Perform a hook and throw 10 times, etc), but a couple of them are quite frustrating (Perform a counter kill streak of at least five 10 times). I completed all of these challenges, but I had to look up how to complete some of them on the internet. Completing groups of challenges will unlock perks associated with each faction (faction weapons, reduced faction hiring cost, faster ""call assassin"" recharge, etc). I found completing these challenges to be mostly worthwhile.There is a metagame called ""Mediterranean Defense"" that is basically used as the main way to level up your assassins. The player selects a city, then a mission in that city, and finally assigns one or more assassins to that mission. Money, assassin XP and a percentage of control over the city are awarded at completion. The player can also assign assassins to each city which can then be used to complete missions without using the ones alotted for the ""call assassins"" ability. Each ""day"" (every 20 minutes of active game time not spent in any menus) money, assassin xp (for stationed assassins) and bomb ingredients are awarded for each city the player has control over. However, a random percentage of assassin control is also subtracted from each city. If a percentage of assassin control reaches zero, templars will lay siege on that city. If the player doesn't complete a special mission with a day, control over the city and all assassins assigned to that city will be lost.Something else to note is that there are two optional parts of the game with completely different game play mechanics. The first is the ""Desmond's Journey"" sequences that are unlocked as the player collects certain numbers of DNA fragments while playing as Ezio, and the other is the main story content for ""The Lost Archive"" DLC. The game play for these sections is in first person perspective, and the player must overcome puzzles by placing different shaped platforms to walk across. It vaguely reminded me of Portal without the gun. I found the game play for these parts to be awkward, frustrating and completely out of place in an AC title.Overall, I enjoyed my time with this title. However, there was one thing in particular that annoyed me: the ""Mediterranean Defense"" metagame. Since I had put so much time into assigning the maximum number of assassins to each of the 10 or so cities, I felt compeled to maintain control over the cities. Every 20 minutes I'd have to go through and assign missions. This became very tedious and annoying.			"

												I genuinely didn't like this game when I first started it, mostly because a lot of everything I hated about brotherhood carried over to this game. But It is a nice tie up between Ezio Auditore and Altiar.You can build your assassin's up in this game. That part I liked. You can increase your income and free most of the city between the two factions. That part I liked. Keeping your notarity down, swimming, etc. etc. The mounted turret in the later sequence was probably the most hated thing I could think of, not to mention the 75% impossible♥♥♥♥♥♥to get 100% sequence. It is for more patient people then I to achive that amount of BS. Your ""mad skillz"" to climb higher walls were replaced with the ""Hookblade"" which, the idea is nice. It allows you to Counter steal in the middle of battle and get medicine rather then dying becuase brutes done ♥♥♥♥ed up your face. Though most of the heavy armor have been replaced by more skillful guards which makes the challenges very ♥♥♥♥ing hard.The story is the only reason why I played this game which, in my opinion, should only be half the reason, not the whole reason you play a game. Without going much into it, you visit Altiar's old home before Constantinople, finding a big locked door and leading you to hunting down keys in the city. True, the plot has completely diverted from ""Listen, learn, kill"" from assassin's creed 1 to ""listen, learn, lara croft treasure hunting"" but it really is a nice change of pace. I lost track of why I was killing so many damn people in assassin's creed 2 to be honest. Even the in game diagram didn't help me. Anyways, you help this Sophia in her attempt to get books and civilizations earliest Blu-Ray disks in order to open the library of Altiar.The endgame takes a weird left turn as to how people stopped attacking you with the most predictable end in-game. It does explain some of the visions from Assassin's Creed 2 though. All in all, Not my favorite game in the whole series so far, but It's a tie between this and the first assassin's creed. Assassin's Creed 2 is still my favorite so far.P.S. I'm not too concerned about if this review is helpful or not, I'm just writing these to bookmark if I've played them all the way through or not.

												This installment in the series ties all the previous games into a single cohesive story line.Not being a fan of multiplayer games, Revelations is in someways the best game in the series, as after this title the games focus seemed to be more towards the multiplayer aspect. I've played and enjoyed III and Black Flag (Which is a total departure from any of the previous games). They are always decent. In terms of story though, Revelations marked a high point in the Creed games, that I've yet to see another one achieve.Overall 7.5/10   (in my ratings ""5"" is the base line and is a ""OK"" game)Graphics: 8/10 (At time of release)Sound: 5/10   (Music and Effects)Voice Acting: 7/10Story: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10			"

Pros- Great stories of Ezio and Altaïr- Wonderful view of Constantinople- Multifunction hookblade and zipline- Various bombs and bomb crafting- Can recruit many assassins (more than AC Brotherhood)- Eagle sense makes the trail of target or guard is visible- Great soundtracksCons- No auto-push people- Just 2 kinds of city events- Too easy to gain money- Can't do anything outside the memory (only Desmond's Journey)To say that nothing is true, is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile, and that we must be the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted, is to understand that we are the architects of our actions, and that we must live with their consequences, whether glorious or tragic.- Ezio Auditore da Firenze - "

												Assassins Creed Revelations continues the story of Etzio, though aged, still has his talents as the great assassin. You are thrown into many different environments. Scaling buildings, fighting opponents, and managing your brotherhood is easier, than ever. Ubisoft adds a few kinks so that things aren’t too easy that is. Defending your Den’s from attack, adds a defensive gameplay to the game, which has never really been done before in any previous AC game. The story is just as compelling as the last, with stunning visuals to lead the way. Soldiers can counter, your counter adding some interesting fights, as not all enemies can just be killed with a thrust of a sword, or axe. And on top of that multiplayer has improved as well. The game is once again a must buy. This story is definitely something you won’t forget.			"

												Neue Stadt zum Rumlaufen, neue Story, gleicher Held, gleiches Gameplay - AC Revelations zusammengefasst.Punkt I: Die Stadt - Konstantinopel / IstanbulWie für Assassin's Creed üblich, eine wunderhübsch animierte, lebendig wirkende Welt mit Passanten, Marktschreiern, Wachen, Händlern - allem was eine Assassin's Creed-Stadt eben so braucht. Historisch und proportional korrekt nachgebaut, kommt sofort das tolle ""Jaaaaaaa-hier-darf-ich-rumlaufen-Gefühl auf"". Sehr gut gelungen.Punkt II: Die Story - Gut gelungen, wenn auch kurzKurz und knapp wie auch schon in Brotherhood erzählt Revelations eine vergleichsweise gute, schnörkellose Geschichte, wobei es den größten Nachteil aus AC II nicht wieder ins Spiel bringt. Ein zwei Twists sind auch mit dabei - alles in allem für ein AC-Spiel wirklich angemessen.Punkt III: Der Held - EzioGleiche Animationen, nur 2 neue Tricks (Hakenklinge im Kampf und Hakenklinge bei der Fortbewegung) - Ezio hat sich nicht viel verändert, nur dass er jetzt halt um die 50 Jahre alt ist. Seine Kampftechnik beeinflusst das nicht, im Gegenteil, er lernt sogar noch brutalere und assassinigere (ist das ein Wort?) Killmoves. #Sein Charakter bleibt auch nicht auf der Strecke, denn seine freundliche, inzwischen natürlich weisere Art wird angemessen, aber nicht übertrieben betont.Punkt IV: Das GameplayWie Schon in Punkt III erwähnt, so hat sich das Gameplay nur um 2 Tricks erweitert - Die beiden Eigenschaften der Hakenklinge, die man für's Klettern, für's Seilrutschen und für's Hinterhältig-töten nutzen kann. Deutlich stärker macht einen das nicht, aber wann waren der Kampf oder das Klettern in Assassin's Creed schon schwierig? Das einzige was es tut, ist cool aussehen und sein, und die Steuerung ein wenig erleichtern - was es wohl auch soll.Fazit:Obwohl die Steuerung, die Grafik, und das generelle Gameplay sich nicht im Geringsten von den beiden Vorgängern AC II und AC: Brotherhood unterscheiden, so ist doch AC: Revelations für seine 15€ auf jeden Fall lohnenswert. Eine Kaufempfehlung für AC-Fans und Neulinge!			"

												The third Ezio Auditore da Firenze game is as good as ever. One thing I like is the games change, but still feel like sequels. AC II was a country roaming, assassing vengeance quest. AC Brotherhood was a power building game, build your strength, make your mark, raise you team and then strike. This game is more story based.The intro is my favourite to the three Ezio games. Masyaf castle is an excellent setting, and the story is just great. You leave Roma for once and go to Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey) to follow in the footsteps of Niccolo Polo to retrieve the 5 keys to Altair's library. Excellent game once again, keeping in the same style of the other Ezio games.However, I personally was not a fan of the bomb mechanic that was introduced. I preferred the tooth and blade style.			"

Explore all the popular tourist sites from the comfort of your PC. The wide arsenal of weapons and armours and the rich story will keep you entertained for hours. The end of Ezios and Altairs story may leave even the toughest of men with a tear. This is one of the best games made by Ubisoft. From the Immense environment and open world, the deep and immense story to the classic stab and dash game play. This will be one of the games that will be in your hall of fame.

												If you think the older AC games were better, you'll probably think this one has the most solid gameplay out of them. It takes everything from AC 1, 2, and Brotherhood and tries to focus on the good stuff while eliminating some of the more tedious elements. It also introduces a nifty secondary blade for the speediest parkouring yet and a crafting system for bombs that a lot of people overlook but it is nice to see developers still trying to create novel experiences. The story is also decent and it ties up the Altair and Ezio stories in a satisfying way while leaving a cool hook into AC 3. On top of that, there's an few optional first person platforming levels tossed in that give some of Desmond's backstory in a totally new way. And if you like that, there's a dlc that adds more of it that tells the backstory of subject 16 wihch I thought was pretty cool. And continuing from AC Brotherhood, there's even a multiplayer mode that seems pretty similar and is more fleshed out. Sadly, I think it's even emptier than ACB's multiplayer and you'll probably get rekt by Prestige level 12 players while trying to start out and learn everything.			"

												This game is adequate.The GoodIn this game you will use time traveling Prussian warhammers and fake♥♥♥♥♥Aladdin shamshirs to slay peasants in groups of three. Or at least thats what I did with about 92 hours of my 99 hours of gameplay. (I do not regret it) The other portions of the game that worked were the heroic sendoffs for Altair and Ezio. These characters represent the golden age of the assassins creed universe so it was nice to see them get a respectful sendoff rather then be overused in future cash cow moo creed titles The BadThe pacing wasn't perfect. The historical research wasn't as meticulous as in previous games. The ""Den Defense"" minigame is essentially optional... The antagonists weren’t particularly threatening. Horrific Islamic war criminals are presented in a positive light and freedom fighting Greeks seeking to reclaim their homeland are presented as the villains.... (what a brave stance for the developers to take) The tutorial mission and the ending mission are basically the same. You cant steal/use Turkish rifles, you can steal from peasents in front of guards ext. The game feels repetitive and short and like the content cut from previous titles were thrown into this game as a haphazard mix. The UglyYou can play as Desmond as he navigates some cheap♥♥♥♥♥""jump over things"" minigame where he monologues about his past. You may choose to simulate this experience by slapping yourself with a mouse pad.... you know where.Bottom Line.The games budget was triple slashed when it became apparent that it would only be competing for market share with Assassins Creed 3. You can see the scope that was intended for the game and literally feel missing content as you faff about. It’s clear that the developers aspired only to adequacy and met it not with leaps and bounds but as a half asphyxiated carcass crawling over the finish line before collapsing but whether it’s by an inch or a mile the game made it. It IS adequate, its pros do outweigh its flaws. So yeah, I liked it, I liked my time traveling Prussian warhammer and my fake♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Aladdin sword and ""macing"" peasants was thoroughly amusing. I'd do it again. That said my hope is that they merge ASII, Brotherhood and Revelations into one super title for continuous gameplay enjoyment.Probably the last real Assassins Creed game.			"

												Drawbacks:Graphics haven't improved much from AC2 and Brotherhood. In fact, I noticed that there were a bit more glitches in this game than the previous ones. Newcomers to the series will definitely not benefit from starting with this one, but this has been an issue since AC2.Story and characters are not as engaging as the first 2 arcs of Ezio's story. And the modern side to the tale gets more convoluted than ever. Good points: The setting of Constantinople is again beautifully crafted. Turn off the HUD and explore. The music is gorgeous, shame that this is Jesper Kyd's last work in the Assassin's Creed series. The multiplayer has improved and added new game modes. But you might be hard pressed to find a lobby nowadays. The bomb mechanics are quite nice and the hookblade as well. I would recommend this game only if you have liked Ezio and you want a conclusion to his side of the story.			"

												Revelations' singleplayer portion is the shortest amongst all Assassin's Creed titles, which only took me approximately 4 hours to finish. The game has great voice actors, but the characters are limited by poorly structured cutscenes, and facial animations were often too unnatural to ignore.Thankfully, Ubisoft has successfully refined the multiplayer portion. New unlocks, character customization options and the return of some Brotherhood maps are very nice additions. In fact, Revelations' multiplayer gameplay is probably the only factor that redeemed this title the privillege of being called an Assassin's Creed game.			"

												First MAJOR downside: 16 minutes of unskippable credits. I have no idea if there's anything after them, and I don't care enough to watch 16 minutes of names that mean nothing to me to find out. Brotherhood did this too, I don't know why the games keep having this garbage.Second less major downsides: camera is annoying, Ezio sometimes seems to act like you've given him a book on general relativity if you input too many commands, and the menus load way too slowly.Third: I had to install the game on my C drive to get it to launch, rather than my separate hard drive with literally all the rest of my Steam games are on. Assassin's Creed III also has this problem.But besides that, this was a really good game. Great story, great gameplay, ran smoother than the previous Assassin's Creeds and the controls listened to me more, mostly. The story would probably make absolutely no sense if you haven't played through the previous games, but it's still fun in the off chance someone buys this one on its own.In the end, it still has a lot of the issues the previous games did with zero improvement on them, but like Lego games it continues to be fun and makes you want to keep going in the series.

												Another expac for AC2, after the brotherhood expac.The story continue with a mostly older Etzio but there are a few part with the first AC hero Altair. Story was more fun than  brotherhood, but couldnt compare with the AC2 story of course! This time, the city is constantinople.Again, we come back with brotherhood assassins crew that you can send on missions to become better assassins. Again, i spent more time buying all the shops and monuments and playing with my crew than running the main mission (I actually got the master assassin armor before i finished getting the first crappy leather set of armor from the shop! hahaha). There is a concept of setting up a new den after you capture templar regions in the city. Similar to what we already had in brotherhood, but this time, the templar can capture it back if you're not careful!Also, we get introduced to all kind of bomb making. Actually, this game is fantastic for terrorist in training. The amount of bombs you can use is just insane and pretty overpowered! It's a good thing you can only bring 3 bombs of each type on you at a time or you would do nothing else to assassinate your targets but bomb them! But then, they put bomb making tables everywhere in the map so you are rarely more than 1 minute away from making more bombs! And you always get more bomb making ingredients than you know what to do with (i never bought any bomb making ingredients. In fact, i sold so many ingredients for big $$$! Especially at the start when you are poor, its a fantastic way to make money).The gameplay is awesome and fun. What is also very special about this game is the templar you kill. In all the templar kill you did in the earlier AC, templar always die with arrogance and naked lust for power that you cannot root for them, they are insanely evil and corrupted by power. But in revelation, it's quite the opposite! Each templar death made me question my motives as an assassin! The templars that we kill always had pretty good reasons to do what they did and they sincerely believed they were trying to help humanity become better! And they always said: What are you assassins doing to help humanity? And we just can't answer positively that question. I'm telling you, each templar death is not rewarding but very troubling! That's freaking AWESOME in  a game!!! Completely different from the other templar death in previous AC.Now the only lowdown would be when you go back into the animus and play as desmond. Man that was freaking boring. I don't know why they even bother with that part of the game. Fortunately, you can skip it and get back to play Etzio which i did since it was far more fun.			"

 Assassin’s Creed Revelations Retrospective Review Assassin’s Creed Revelations has the best story of the three games, thankfully taken as a trilogy it it is a fulfilling one. We see Ezio the man mess up more, he is older, wiser, and a little slower. He remains a great character. Altair is another character that is reintroduced to fill in the gaps of what happened after the events of AC 1. This time he is voiced correctly and for the most part the story told in his timeline is good. However, his timeline also has the weakest gameplay. Now as much as Revelations feels like the end of an era, it also feels like a stop gap. Desmond himself as a character does not move in his respective arc in any meaningful direction. This is supposed to be helped by the inclusion of the FPS section of the game, but unfortunately they are terrible, more on that later. If you are looking for a fitting end to Altair and Ezio’s stories, then this is the game for you. Unfortunately, this games offers little when it comes to other more important things.Gameplay in AC: Revelations suffers greatly. It has the same controls as all the other games, but all your side excursions are ripped wholesale from Brotherhood, with less success. Everything you came to love in Brotherhood is expanded on, but turns into a tedious, tremendous waste of time. This is probably Assassin’s Creed at it’s most Call of Duty like, at least until I play Rogue, which I hear is pretty much the same game as AC4. After a while I just played through the sequences and did little else once I got all my recruits to Assassin level. Lastly the side objectives in Revelations are the worst. Most are poorly worded, and usually become irritating. This will probably be the only AC game where I didn’t bother to get 100 % synchronization in the story missions, simply because I could not be bothered with the system. Oh and one more thing, Desmond now has a FPS puzzler. These puzzles are terrible, poorly thought out, and not challenging in the slightest. It’s the worst addition of the series and is a waste of time. After you finish these puzzles, Desmond decides that he will be an Assassin...again? This side story is incredibly stupid and repetitive and does nothing, but mess with the main game's pace. Didn’t Desmond already decide that he was going to be an assassin? Why do I need to take him through these sequences so he can finally be one with his destiny? It is an incredibly insipid waste of time for a character who can’t seem to give himself a break and by the end has moved through his character arc only a bit. At this point I can see why people were fed up with the Desmond storyline, but I feel the fault has to be with the writers, who probably had been writing him out of the series ever since Brotherhood. The environment of AC: Revelations is I believe the strongest. The city is beautiful, colorful, and diverse in a way the other Assassin’s Creed games have never been. It’s probably my favorite city from the AC2 era of games. The performance of the game has  improved greatly from the previous AC games. I don’t know if this had to do with the fact that now I’m using Windows 10 or this is just the best port of the AC2 series, but I think it’s a little of both. I did get some stuttering, but it only happened twice in the game as opposed to every couple of hours in AC2, and random areas in AC Brotherhood. AC: Revelations is the worst game of the Ezio saga, but it has the best story. If you have been playing this series for the story, then picking up this game is a no brainer, but if you did it for the gameplay, then picking up AC2 is probably best. Why is it the worst game of the saga? The side objectives prove to be frustrating instead of fun like in Brotherhood, the side missions are borked with endless tedium added to probably lengthen the game. This is the weirdest part since the game is easily the shortest of the three games. AC: Revelations is worth your time if you love the story, but it doesn’t hold up if you are looking for innovations in the series gameplay. Revelations is worth playing for a fan, but a casual player should steer clear away from this game and just jump in one of the numbered entries. Despite all this, I still reccommend the game, especially if it's on sale. Some notes  I played this on a i7, GTX 970, Windows 10 Computer  I played for about 26 hours  I got 76% synchronization  Be sure to watch Assassin’s Creed: Embers (It meanders a bit, but it proves to be a fitting end to Ezio’s storyline)[/list] "

												Let me start by saying this: If you liked Altair (AC1) and the first two games of the ""Ezio Trilogy"" (AC II and ACB), you really should play this game, and I do think you will enjoy it. It brings an ending to the story of these two characters, and on top of playing an older, more experienced Ezio, you also get to play some parts as Altair. Mechanics-wise, the game picks up where ACB stopped and adds to the mechanics you know from the previous 3 games. You still micromanage your assassins, recruiting and training them, and you send them out on missions. This time, they don't only bring back money, they can also take over other cities, which will provide you with incoming money and components for the other new addition - bombs. The bombs have a rather complex system... you have three categories, of which you can have three bombs on you. For example, a shrapnel bomb, a smoke bomb (similar to the good ol smoke bombs from ACB) and a cherry bomb, which you can use to lure away guards, distracting them. You can put together those bombs, deciding whether you want them to explode on impact or with a delay, or whether they work like a mine, with a tripwire. It's a nice addition, but to me, it's not a total game-changer. You should get used to those bombs and their benefits, and use them (the game will teach you how, and you can also ""test"" the bombs in a kind of a simulator). Other than that, it's a lot like ACB... crossbow, assassins you can command and have them attack enemies for you, etc. Climbing is a bit more convenient now due to the new hookblade, which also can be handy in combat. The game DOES have a few issues... I had a few crashes (apparently when some popup came up in my taskbar, the game crashed... at least I suspect that to be the reason), while the overall performance was great even at ultra settings. The controls... sigh... well, I do play AC games with an Xbox controller, and I think thats a LOT better and easier than using kbm. However, the controls still are often pretty... imprecise, wonky, weird. You know what I am talking about if you played earlier ACs... jumps going wrong as Ezio will not jump to some kind of ledge, but suddenly jump to the left or right. The hookblade, which will make you climb upwards faster (and allows wider jumps as you can grab ledges with it), might cause you to accidentially do backwards jumps sometimes. I guess that's the curse of the series... those controls. I noticed a big improvement in Unity (yes, I know, the game has serious issues)... climbing down and fast parcour seems so much easier and controllable in Unity. I can't pinpoint why that is, it just feels that way when I compare parcour and races in ACII/ACB/ACR and ACU. The story is a bit confusing (MUCH less so though if you played the previous games and know what the Apple Of Eden is, what the Templars do etc.), and I am not sure how well this game would work for you if it was your first AC-game. I did enjoy it a lot, and the atmosphere of the game is AWESOME. Old Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) has a lot of vibe to it, and looks beautiful. Right now, my favorite setting is Paris in ACU, followed by Constantinople and Rome (ACB)...it's up there.Great game, great ending to the Ezio-trilogy AND AC1. If you enjoyed the first two Ezio-games, make sure you get this one. Pros: - Great atmosphere/setting- Good story/ending to Ezios and Altairs story- Some minor improvements to climbing, weapons, assassin guild etc.- Great soundtrack - Play as Altair- Very cool intro- Some very cool missions/memories... (wait till you have to prevent an assassination at the palace, with some Italian musicians involved...)- Some epic moments and Indiana Jones-like fights (thinking of one of the last battles in which Sofia was involved)Cons:- Occasional crashes (YMMV)- As usual, kinda problematic controls - Might not be a good standalone or ""get into the franchise"" type game, start with AC or, even better, ACIIAnd... once again, and I am not gonna spoil anything - if you did like Ezio and Altair, you owe yourself (and them) to play this. The ending of their story (for a bit more of Ezio's story, check out the ""Embers"" movie on YT) is quite touching - yes, it's sad, but to me, it was a satisfying ending to the story of two amazing heroes9.5/10			"

												Revelations' singleplayer portion is the shortest amongst all Assassin's Creed titles, which only took me approximately 4 hours to finish. The game has great voice actors, but the characters are limited by poorly structured cutscenes, and facial animations were often too unnatural to ignore.Thankfully, Ubisoft has successfully refined the multiplayer portion. New unlocks, character customization options and the return of some Brotherhood maps are very nice additions. In fact, Revelations' multiplayer gameplay is probably the only factor that redeemed this title the privillege of being called an Assassin's Creed game.			"

												An improvement over the previous titles in game mechanics, Assassin's creed Revelations gives the player a satisfiying ending to the stories of it's first two protagonists, Ezio Auditore and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. While the plot is a tad weaker than the other entries in the Desmod Story Arc, it's characters are rich and vibrant and the conclusion makes up for any misgivings you might have. All in all, Revelations is a visually beautiful game with a soundtrack to match. In the end you'll wish you could go back and experience it for the first time all over again.10/10 would assassinate again. "

												I actually liked the game, but:> there are nearly no so lovely designed side-missions from the previous games (or show me them, I couldn't found them)> the story was cool, but a bit too short - and I had nearly no rememerable moments, I had from brotherhood; Nothing, I'd like to repeat> after completing the story the world was too empty and I had nothing to do anymore> Upgrades are kinda irrelevant (despite armor)> Fight system is less OP, the fights are longer, but it feels a bit more boring> bombs are useless. I've used them like in some story missions, where it was nessecary, but not really more.All the good sides are mentioned in other reviews, I don't want to repeat them.In my opinion AC:R was a dissappointment after AC:Brotherhood; it was shorter, shorter and shorter. The charakters were'nt so good, as in brotherhood, the story wasn't so interesting. Yet, as a little film to get the Ezio-triologie to the end it was great, but it was far away from being so ubergood, brotherhood was.If you're an AC fan, who have played AC 2 and AC Brotherhood, I highly recommend it. As a little film to end the story (atmosphere of old and wise Ezio is great!). But don't expect too much, as I did.			"

												If you ever thought that your Ezio was overpowered before, get a load of Assassin's Creed Revelations. Now he has different kinds of grenades bombs - to add to your arsenal of of hidden blades, poison darts, swords, guns, anything you might want. Oh, and a ""hook-blade"" to give you even more mobility. Story is the same Assassin's Creed jazz - if you liked it before, you'll like it still. Istambul is nice city to explore, you can have fun with that.			"

If you liked AC II and Brotherhood, there's no reason Revelations should let you down (you can also check my reviews of AC Brotherhood, since Revelations is very much like it with minor new things here and there, like bullet time moments and zip line actions). In certain areas this title surpasses previous two in the department of epic moments. The game is still a bit grindy, but beautiful location in Constantinople makes up for it. This is also great continuation of Altair and Ezio story and great ending for Ezio trilogy.  "

In multiplayer aspect I think is good game. Interesting to play. Unfortunately in multiplayer we can't change ""our side"". We always be templar on this series. Visual graphics is so wonderfull but not the best. But its no matter, because we can play without loss our performance. For sound effect...is very nice too. I love for the background music.

													Summary: The final part of the Ezio Trilogy, Revelations gives deeper insight into the future of Ezio Auditore, the Assassin Order's history and potential future, as well as pushes the characters of Desmond Miles and even Altair further. Ezio Auditore, now with beard and commonly referred to as ""That Old Man,"" takes center stage and the game as a whole gives a thrilling conclusion to this marvelous written and spectacularly acted individual. Assassin's Creed: Revelations begins almost immediately where Brotherhood left off, so it is highly encouraged that you do not begin playing the Assassin's Creed series from this point, as you will be somewhat lost in the story. The game gives a small synopsis of what has occurred in previous installments, but considering that Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood are still well developed games to this day, it would be best to play them first.	Story: We find the current timeline of this game in the midst of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the remnants of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople. A now experienced ""Old Man,"" Ezio leaves Italy behind to make sense of the history of the Assassin Order and the experience of his ancestor, Altair. The story and everything that makes it is the most exceptionally well done in this installment. Voice Actor Roger Craig Smith still shines as Ezio, making us believe that this is indeed an aged and seasoned assassin. The characters he interacts with all help to shape the world surrounding us. You care about almost everyone regardless of how little they may be highlighted, even to a fault. I actually wish we would have had more time with Sofia Sartor, an Italian book collector with whom Ezio befriends. This is an example of how unfortunately short lived this game in particular is. Concentrating on the main story while doing some side content, I beat this game in 17 hours, the shortest out of the Ezio trilogy. 	On the present day storyline, Desmond is trapped in the animus, interacting with subject 16, also trapped and with an unsettling demeanor. While each moment with these two characters is well done, it is also short lived and not built upon too much. As you collect animus fragments in Ezio's storyline, you can also unlock First Person puzzle missions on the Animus Island where Desmond is stuck in. Unfortunately I could not do these missions, as there is STILL a bug in the game that will cause the game to crash whenever you try to enter the mission. I've been told this was also an issue with at least the PS3 version but I am currently unaware if this was ever patched on that version.	Gameplay & Content: What you are familiar with from the previous installments is further fine tuned in Revelations. The platforming is better, though not by much (I still occasionally jumped to my doom every so often due to bad positioning of Ezio, the camera, or the occasional platform that was a little too well hidden). Horses are no longer a feature in the game, though not exactly needed. Much of the side content from previous games was either ratcheted down or completely taken out. I never once saw Assassination contracts, which fortunately were brought back in Assassin's Creed III for those who enjoyed them (Not me, I tended to ignore them). New side content, such as the ""Tower Defense"" imitation you are introduced to near the beginning of the game, is easily forgettable and even seems like the developers went out of their way to hide the fact that they exist. 	Main gameplay missions are the typical ""Kill this target, tail this target,"" but occasionally they throw something quite fun and unique in to surprise you. At one point you get your revenge on those pesky minstrels, steal their clothes and become one yourself. Not only was this mission clever, it was fun hearing Ezio mock the very existence of minstrels with his lyrics. I would almost encourage you to play this game for this part alone. 	The new bomb system in this game that replaces the smoke bombs from the previous games is for the most part ineffective I found in most situations and at best very situational. Attack bombs you have too much of a chance of hurting yourself, decoy bombs either fail at distracting your enemies or immediately blow your cover regardless of distance, and even stun bombs won't work on most enemies. Only the ""Smoke Screen"" bomb, which is literally the smoke bomb from the previous games, will actually work for you. Thankfully this was a feature that was scrapped in future installments and I say good riddance. Audio: There is not much to say in terms of the audio. As a AAA title sound and music are top notch. The background music is beautiful and relevant to the setting, and sound effects are quality and impactful.Graphics: This game is a bigger step ahead from Brotherhood than Brotherhood was to Assassin's Creed II. Everything is much better detailed and animated, which helps give you an idea of where the series is headed in terms of graphics. However I am not sure if this a problem with my Graphics card or with me, but just like the previous games in the series, I had problems with shadow flickering. On my NVidia GTX 970 I'm surprised to see this STILL occurring. Additionally this still shows the issue of NPCs and world props loading in later than they should be, sometimes scaring the ever loving hell out of me. This is a problem that STILL persists with Assassin's Creed III as I have been playing it.Final Thoughts: While a step down from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood overall, it is still worth the time and price for the story alone. Ubisoft provides a thrilling and immersive experience in the open world of Constantinople despite its many glaring flaws. As far as the story for the Animus Fragment puzzle missions? Would probably be best to youtube them. "

												The weakest of all AC titles, almost no revelations at all.It only concludes the story of Ezio/Altair which was epic, but the game is very short, the tower defense missions are horrible, you have to go back once in a while to defend towers from being attacked over and over again..The gameplay remains the same like the previous installments, which is good, the music is excellent as always and the story is the best thing in this game, but this sequel won't tell you much..The MP is quite fun and original, but very frustrating sometimes.My Rating: 8/10			"

												The Ezio Trilogy is amazing. Assassin’s Creed Revelations is the best one yet. The gameplay is basically the same, but now there are bombs and tactical defense of assassins’ dens. As usual, the environment looks realistic and buoyant; Constantinople is the prettiest city Ubisoft developed so far. This is one of the games that pay most attention to storytelling, if you like plot-centered games, the AC series is the way to go.9.5/10			"

												It took 14 hours to finish this game.Just like the previous game, AC: Brotherhood, they continue the trend of improving on the negative aspects of previous games. I think it definitely helps with your enjoyment of this game to play it right after beating the AC:B because it helps you appreciate the imrpovements and differences.Combat is improved with the addition of stronger enemies that can't be insta-killed. It encourages you to make more use of your various tools and stealth, which enhances the variety of the gameplay.The long climbing / free-running segments in AC:B could feel like a boring slog at times. They've dramatically improved that in this game - any sections that have an emphasis on free-running and climbing have an engaging, well-designed ""flow"" to them that was lacking in the previous games. The addition of the hook blade makes climbing more engaging because you can go faster if you use the hook correctly, and it allows the levels to give you more of a sense of speed and traversal because of things like zip lines and long jumps. Overall, these sections have gone from being a dreadfully boring thing that you just have to force yourself through to a very fun and exciting bit of gameplay.The setting in AC:B was starting to get stale after being so similar to AC2. Things like the voice clips, ambience, architecture, and stuff like that just started to make the game feel a little bit too familiar. They've addressed this by bringing you to a whole new, unique location in this game. It seems like a small difference, but it really is a great relief to not be hearing the same random voice clips from the guards and citizens as they react to you.The only spots where I didn't enjoy the game involved having to re-do certain long sections during missions when I failed or when a bug caused me to fail, and the tower-defence like mode where you have to defend your captured strongholds. In such a huge game as this, random bugs are an inevitability. Thankfully, the checkpointing system is usually quite forgiving (or at least I got lucky), so you only have the occasional frustrating moment, but there were a few sections where I had failed right before a checkpoint and had to replay 5 minutes or so. That's just not very fun when those 5 minutes are pretty much the same every time. There's really only a few missions that have the capacity to be frustrating, though. As for the tower-defense, it's just not fun. I frequently found that, while I could successfully and easily hold back all of the waves, I lost right at the end when the siege unit comes through. When that happens, you may find yourself in a situation where you don't have money for more units so you just have to sit there watching the siege unit plunk away at your base until you die. I think that you're supposed to disband the units that the siege engine has already passed and re-assign them to be near your base, but I ended up not getting a chance to try this out. Anyway, I don't come to this game for tower-defence, so it's kind of an annoying interruption. You can avoid it in several ways, thankfully, so as long as you put a little bit of effort towards that end, you won't have to deal with tower defence.There's plenty of other things that I won't go into that adds to the appeal of this game.Overall, I think it's more fun than AC:B because they had time to see what people thought about AC:B and improve upon it.

												Além da mudança de cenário e as óbvias adições na história, não espere nada muito novo em AC Revelations. Basicamente os mesmos recursos que apareceram no AC Brotherhood foram mantidos (quase) intactos aqui. As granadas talvez tenham sido a adição mais notável, mas são praticamente inúteis se você já está acostumado com a jogabilidade da série. A história, como sempre, começa lenta e previsível e segue assim até a metade. É só daí pra frente que a coisa fica realmente ~REVELADORA~, com um dos finais mais jaw-dropping que eu já vi.			"

												A fitting end to the Assassin's Creed II storyline that nicely wraps up many questions, fills in much needed details, and leaves you wondering where things will go next.  The Den Defense mini-games, a tower-defense style mini-game, are an interesting addition to the various activities you'll find around the city.  I did miss the larger environments and the horses, but honestly, they didn't add much to the game.  The Assassin's Apprentice missions really add more character to the Brotherhood concept that the last game brought to the table, and really serve to make you form a bit of a bond with each of the assassins you recruit, rather than just more fodder for you to throw at guards.  The first-person Desmond missions were boring and repetitive and barely provided any story for the amount of time spent just to unlock them, then by plodding through the yawn-inducing puzzles.  I'd rather they'd expanded on or done something similar to the previous game's modern-day Monteriggioni sequence			"

												Heya, Almog here friend of the real Rander and real owner of AC:R.I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an open world with a few factions and their little challenges, just beating down guards, following an epic journey after a failed too-old-too-ambitious for his own good Ezio Auditore Da Firenze.The game itself quite disappointed me after all the babling about playing with both Ezio and Altair when you can only play Altair and some stages.The game's engine itself got improved more and more, the only two bad things is (one mentioned above) and the other is the horrible interface, I have to wear my glasses to see how much templar awareness I have?Anyway I was very very satisfied with the multiplayer, playing as (spoiler) Vali the rogue assassin and other semi-assassin-mission targets is an awesome idea.I would not recommend the DLC too much but its a fun idea if you wish to be more hidden then usual, especially at rome and port maps.Rating: 7.8, GET IT, LOVE IT!

												And my revisit continues with the 4th installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise, here comes Revelations!Having already played this game on the PS3 at its launch back in 2011, I can say that I had mixed feelings with this game. Many good aspects saved the bad ones for me. Namely, this game feels very much like a ""forced-filler"". Granted, Ubisoft had their plans for the Ezio Auditore character and I can respect that. But at least, Ubisoft has done a fantastic job for Ezio's conclusion of its trilogy.So now Ezio wants to uncover the secrets left in Massyaf library by Altaïr but he can't access it. So he has to go over Constantinople, trying to find the keys left there, on purpose.PROS:+Story takes a while to begin, but contain a really good conclusion for my favorite character, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad.+Emotionally fulfilling ending for Ezio Auditore.+Soundtrack as good as previous AC games. It is a shame Jesper Kyd won't return for the other AC games.+Gameplay mechanic got refined in most areas. Hook-blade is a great new addition so were the bombs crafting.+Cities are still great to explore.+Solid visuals.+Brotherhood recruitment is refined. You now have missions to promote an assassin to a den leader.+Multiplayer got much improved, even if I barely played it. I do like the way they're made as a Templar's training grounds. CONS:-Uplay DRM. I had trouble activating my Deluxe and DLC contents on Uplay since these addons aren't activatable on Uplay but    IN THE GAME itself. And if you try to activate contents on Uplay often, you get a temporary ban... irritating!-Gamebreaking bug met during the 'Setting Sail' mission. Had to restart the game many times.-AC formula has grown old. I could feel the AC fatigue in this game.-Main story with Desmond Miles in Revelation is the weakest of the AC games.-The mini-game for sending your assassins in other cities is quite pointless, especially once they're all high level, this mini-game becomes pointless because the Templars always miraculously reclaim the claimed cities of your assassins.-Tower defense mode. Sure they're a new mechanic of the game but not because you make new stuff makes it good.-Desmond sections are very bland. First-person puzzling. Boring, too long for so little revelation. You better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!-Poor pacing. Slow start... very slow progression... then once you reach the near-end sequence, it is a non-stop ""end-mission"".-Very little that's actually new-No horseback riding.-The Lost Archive DLC is quite pointless. It is an interesting backstory of Subject 16 but you gotta cope with the annoying bland First-person puzzle platformer. Better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!OVERALL:Somehow, my least liked AC game of the franchise, so far, since I haven't completed AC 3 and AC 4 yet. But this one feels very much like a flushed out filler, a game that wasn't really needed. The story of Ezio got to end properly and a good service for Ezio's fans. But I could realy feel the AC fatigue in Revelations, especially on the Desmond Miles main story. It was very bland and its First-person puzzle platformer was quite boring. It's not hard, just too long for the few little ""secrets"" that gets revealed. Just watch Youtube videos or read AC Revelations Wikia instead!RECOMMENDATION:If you had managed to play AC 1 till AC: Brotherhood, yes, you must play AC: Revelations. The conclusion for Altaïr was my main appeal since not only it was well done, but actually made sense with Ezio's story too. If you're a newcomer to the AC franchise, well you're not in the right place to start playing here, with Revelations. You'll feel quite lost on the whole saga. The story is quite important and you either better play the previous games or get informed on the main events of the other games.RATING:7.5 / 10Maybe someday, we'll be able to play as a Templar, single player speaking? That is my greatest wish for this franchise! Or heck, make another IP and focus on the Templar side of story! I'd love that very much Ubisoft!And now, to continue my AC marathon with AC 3...			"

												The Ezio Trilogy is amazing. Assassin’s Creed Revelations is the best one yet. The gameplay is basically the same, but now there are bombs and tactical defense of assassins’ dens. As usual, the environment looks realistic and buoyant; Constantinople is the prettiest city Ubisoft developed so far. This is one of the games that pay most attention to storytelling, if you like plot-centered games, the AC series is the way to go.9.5/10			"

												It took 14 hours to finish this game.Just like the previous game, AC: Brotherhood, they continue the trend of improving on the negative aspects of previous games. I think it definitely helps with your enjoyment of this game to play it right after beating the AC:B because it helps you appreciate the imrpovements and differences.Combat is improved with the addition of stronger enemies that can't be insta-killed. It encourages you to make more use of your various tools and stealth, which enhances the variety of the gameplay.The long climbing / free-running segments in AC:B could feel like a boring slog at times. They've dramatically improved that in this game - any sections that have an emphasis on free-running and climbing have an engaging, well-designed ""flow"" to them that was lacking in the previous games. The addition of the hook blade makes climbing more engaging because you can go faster if you use the hook correctly, and it allows the levels to give you more of a sense of speed and traversal because of things like zip lines and long jumps. Overall, these sections have gone from being a dreadfully boring thing that you just have to force yourself through to a very fun and exciting bit of gameplay.The setting in AC:B was starting to get stale after being so similar to AC2. Things like the voice clips, ambience, architecture, and stuff like that just started to make the game feel a little bit too familiar. They've addressed this by bringing you to a whole new, unique location in this game. It seems like a small difference, but it really is a great relief to not be hearing the same random voice clips from the guards and citizens as they react to you.The only spots where I didn't enjoy the game involved having to re-do certain long sections during missions when I failed or when a bug caused me to fail, and the tower-defence like mode where you have to defend your captured strongholds. In such a huge game as this, random bugs are an inevitability. Thankfully, the checkpointing system is usually quite forgiving (or at least I got lucky), so you only have the occasional frustrating moment, but there were a few sections where I had failed right before a checkpoint and had to replay 5 minutes or so. That's just not very fun when those 5 minutes are pretty much the same every time. There's really only a few missions that have the capacity to be frustrating, though. As for the tower-defense, it's just not fun. I frequently found that, while I could successfully and easily hold back all of the waves, I lost right at the end when the siege unit comes through. When that happens, you may find yourself in a situation where you don't have money for more units so you just have to sit there watching the siege unit plunk away at your base until you die. I think that you're supposed to disband the units that the siege engine has already passed and re-assign them to be near your base, but I ended up not getting a chance to try this out. Anyway, I don't come to this game for tower-defence, so it's kind of an annoying interruption. You can avoid it in several ways, thankfully, so as long as you put a little bit of effort towards that end, you won't have to deal with tower defence.There's plenty of other things that I won't go into that adds to the appeal of this game.Overall, I think it's more fun than AC:B because they had time to see what people thought about AC:B and improve upon it.

												THIS GAME. If you have played the other assassins creeds you will love this one. With your familuarity of Ezio it really shows how his wisdom and heart have developed. He is no longer an arrogant young man (not saying he wasnt cool) But it is nice to see him develop in maturity as he gets older. Also The story gets really heart wrenching near the end and the last scene with ezio (not gonna give any spoilers) just was 10/10 in setting voice acting music etc. BUY THIS GAME AND EVEN MORE SO IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE OTHERS.

												Revelations again comes off the heels of its predecessor Brotherhood and improves on many things from it. The hookblade is easily the greatest addition, improving climbing speed, maneuverability and gameplay. Other new additions such as bombs are all woven into the storyline very well and make sense. More compelling characters, fantastic music, and visuals, along with a nice change of scenery from Italy, are all welcome.I would only say that it lacks a really detestable villain, like Brotherhood had, and not -quite- as many interesting supporting characters, however, still entertaining. Even the tower defense minigame is strange in this series, but fun. All in all it's a fantastic adventure with challenges and goals, with some clever and satisfying revelations, both to Ezio and Desmond. Well recommended for if you enjoyed AC2 / Brotherhood. Wouldn't recommend it to new players of the series however. That's about it.			"

												My favorite of the AC2 era games, it delves into both the end of Altair and Ezio's era in a cool way. The annoying climbing puzzles and tedious tombs of AC:Brotherhood are gone, replaced with more action-oriented 'tomb sequences' that felt inspired by Uncharted 2 that were way more entertaining. Only main annoyance was that there is a bug with the deposit you're supposed to get every 20 minutes that made its frequency vary from 20 minutes to multiple hours, so I felt stiffed on my income for a lot of the game... but the best armor and weapon aren't bought with gold anyway, so it didn't really hurt the experience overall.

												Gee... What to say about this one? I'm already running out of ideas and it is only game number 4 out of 14 or so (and I heard complains about the Call of Duty franchise repeating itself).Ezio ""Manlyman"" Auditore da Firenze de la Jolla Cardinal strikes again - just - not that fast anymore. Ezio struggles a bit since you are playing an very old version of him. He had his best days behind him and still he is able to do all the crazy stuff you did in the other games (Phew! - what an relief).Ezio already gave the bloodline to the next generation and in the end when you meet the ""spoiler"" you go wandering yourself why a) ""spoiler"" is talking to you and b) how Raymond (main Character... remember) is able to see his Grandfather at this point when the Ani..machine is taking him back to his genetic memorys in the first place if future is not predicted, which if so happen to be would make no sense for any conversation between him and ""spoiler"" in the first place... or maybe I'm just loosing interest and want to play ""Death from above"" on every enemy in the game like before.8/10 Is it me or is the gaming-experience getting worse?

												Desmond Miles is your typical eighteen year old guy. He works at a bar selling cocktails named after secret societies and carries a blade under each arm. To afford such a lifestyle, he agrees quickly to the ToS of some big-name company and ends up captive in their massive cross-shaped facility and informed that Christianity is not only a lie, muslims are going to kill everyone for their own good. To cover for this fault in logic, Desmond is then informed that nothing is true, everything is permitted, and then is flipped off and winked at by the nurse, who Desmond then kills. No answers are given for this course of events, and the creature ""Q"" from Star Trek is encountered next inside a miniture Tron island, where you're told to purchase the DLC. Meanwhile, there's a minigame involving Desmond's crazy uncle who runs across rooftops and stabs people while throwing money at courtesans which explains why he's everyones great uncle.			"

												Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is the 3rd game to feature Ezio Auditore, and the 4th game overall. While it doesn’t really move the present-day plot along very much, it does conclude both Ezio’s and Altair’s (the protagonist of the first game) storylines, effectively wrapping up every major loose end before the start of AC3. The game primarily features an older, mid-16th century Ezio, on a quest to learn more about Altair and the Assassins. This leads him from Masyaf to Constantinople, where the majority of the game takes place. The new setting of Constantinople is visually nice and as usual is a cool place to explore. However, it feels smaller than previous games. My feeling is that making this game was most definitely more of a financial than a creative decision. In other words, because of having to crank out a new game on a yearly basis, the scope of Revelations had to be reduced. This is not only reflected in the smaller size of the world, but also in many of the creative aspects. There are no major changes to the established formula that one might expect from a series on its 4th iteration. The mission types and game mechanics are all pretty much the same as in Brotherhood and AC2. Luckily, that means that the game is technically near-flawless... however, on the flip-side, it’s creatively a bit stale. The one major thing that Revelations introduces is a sort of ""tower defense"" sub-game, which involves (you’ll never see this one coming) defending towers using various types of Assassins and defenses. However, this is an odd addition, as I came to find out, it can potentially be avoided entirely. You see, these missions supposedly only pop up when your notoriety gets too high, but if you manage to keep your notoriety low and assign Assassins to each of your towers (as I did), you will never experience this mini-game beyond the initial tutorial. I had completely forgotten this was even a thing until I was just now thinking about what new mechanics were added to this game. So unfortunately I can’t speak to how good or bad this new addition was. It just seems an odd choice to add this whole mechanic and then not have it be a mandatory part of the main game.One other new gameplay addition comes in the form of a series of optional 1st-person puzzle levels. These are available in the present day Desmond sections, and serve as a way to tell the story of his past. These levels are really hit or miss. The 1st-person controls are awkward and the abstract nature of the levels is a bit odd. I thought the idea was interesting, but eventually the whole process became quite tedious. Your mileage may vary on these levels. They are completely optional, however, so there is nothing lost by avoiding them, except some Desmond back-story. Incidentally, there is also a DLC pack featuring similar levels which fills in the story of Subject 16 (Desmond’s Animus predecessor) and Lucy Stillman. If you like the style of these levels, you may be interested in checking that out, but I’m not sure it’s worth the price (I recommend just watching the important bits online).At any rate, the main draw in this game is clearly what it does to conclude the storylines for Altair and Ezio. For that reason alone, it’s worth checking out if you are a fan of the series or either of those characters in particular. However, just keep in mind that other than that, this game is literally just more of the same, with little innovation. If you played the previous games and find yourself tiring of the AC formula, Revelations likely won’t satisfy you from a gameplay aspect. But, if you can handle one more round of the same thing, this is a nice ending to the first part of the AC story, and worth checking out.Grade: BNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			"

												Don't buy this ****** game. It installs its own protection, uplay, and requires you to go online and share personal information to play a game you already own and have paid for. Also, CD key. Why is this even on STEAM? If I knew it had another protection I would not have bought it.This is insane. I don't care for UPlay, I don't want it, and now I can't get rid of it. What next, Origin as well? I hope they choke. I made a new account, but they wouldn't let me log in until I verified my e-mail - apparently personal data is part of their asking price.Also, fresh install, fresh uplay, click to play, denied. Updating game. Updating uplay. Updating uplay again. What is this joke? Why would you download and install an old version? What is my PC, the neighborhood hooker that everyone can just throw in?DO NOT BUY. It is a drag on resources, installs software without asking, does not make it clear that it requires online accounts and personal info to play, this hast to stop.I regret giving money to these people. I already finished the game, I liked it, and I wanted to support the developers. And now I regret it. It took literally 2 minutes to load the game on a quad core i7 with an SSD and gigabit internet because all of the updates.Also, nobody at Ubisoft heard of a firewall. Do you really need 50 connections? Really?DO. NOT. BUY.			"

												I personally am a very big fan of the assasins creed series and when i bought this game i was hoping it would be an epic ending to the story of our favorite italian assasin Ezio, however I was a bit dissapointed with the game. Being in the same city for so long which (correct me if i'm wrong) was called Constantinopole, was really a bore for me personally and i really thing they just dragged that part of the game out. It seemed that all the same colors really just ran into eachother creating a big blob of desert color. The actual gameplay really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because you could be just climbing a building and then boom, Ezio just jumps off and you die and start for the last check point, this was a real downer for me. To generalize the gameplay was really rugged and i didn't feel like an assasin, i fealt more like an elephant that kept randomly jumping off buildings and tripping over my feet. All in all I still finished the game because really wanted to get the story and not just go to the next game and just be like ....what? and I am not really the type of person to just look it up on the internet. But unless you are like me and want to experience the story I recomend to just look it up. If you read this I thank you for your time, any feed back or pointers would be great thanks.			"

												This will probably be my last review of an Assassin's Creed product. To its credit, Assassin's Creed: Revelations is better than Brotherhood and is pretty much the sequel Brotherhood was meant to be. Although whereas Brotherhood was an unimaginative rehash of previous gameplay principles, Revelations appears to be this dubious mishmash of poorly implemented game ideas.There's less filler missions but now you individually rescue about a hundred citizens to induct into your assassin ranks. They removed the cryptography puzzles (a shame since I honestly enjoy cryptography) and inserted first-person PLATFORMERS into the metagame sequences instead. There's this odd TOWER DEFENSE mini-game, and it's presented both as a fail condition from being too notorious yet comes with rewards of its own. The Awareness Icon can go blow itself: even at max notoriety, Ottoman soldiers won't challenge you unless you're already doing something suspicious and Byzantine soldiers always view you as an enemy anyhow. Finally, challenges are back and in greater number than ever. They were probably intended as a tutorial device but the sheer quantity of tasks required grinds the story to a halt.A major sticking point for Revelations is how utterly unbalanced it is. I was used to unbalanced mechanics from when one could simply wait for money to fall from the sky and open up better equipment toot sweet. That's still there but now you have the main map open from the get-go and access to END LEVEL EQUIPMENT as soon as you unlock your towers and complete your assassin network. Master Assassin armor and 5/5/5 weapons by sequence three? You better believe it. Bomb crafting seems to be the major drawing point of this installment and they're both easily accessible and eminently customizable. Sadly, simple smoke bombs were already overpowered by Assassin's Creed 2  and have now become superfluous by the sheer amount of killing tools you possess. Furthermore, they can only be crafted at specific crafting stations, meaning you won't be able to switch to the right bomb in the middle of a mission when they'd be relevant.I really wanted to give Assassin's Creed: Revelations my thumbs up; it's essentially a Michael Bay movie set up in Turkish gunpowder civilization. But as much as I enjoy the stunts you pull throughout the story, there is no defense for the clunky gameplay mechanics. I imagine one could say the same for the series as a whole.			"

												AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. I am literally unable to run it due to the DRM complaining about my CD key even though I have never run it before on any other. It seems Ubisoft tries their hardest to make all their games as difficult as possible (or even outright impossible) to run. Save yourself a mountain of hassle and buy a game that *just* plays without all this unnecessary DRM nonsense that you don't even need because I'm running it through steam anyway (you'd think they'd be authentication enough).

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but overall it feels like a giant rehash of everything that worked, and and even bigger slump of things that didn't. AC2 Brotherhood has been my favorite so far. The characters the collor pallete, everything just *worked*. Pacing was fast and interesting, as well as the ammount of achievments that felt right. (save for a few final missions). AC2 Revelations is a reskin, that went overboard with with tedious. The awareness factor increases super quick, and killing officials or bribing the heralds only takes it down 25%, not bad, doable, but just buying a shop bumps it 25%+ as well. The mini tower defence game is tedious and boring, it yields nothing that you can find in the world which will give you an edge. Ezio is still amazing, his old age only breeds a more powerfull Alpha Wolf rage that is ready to crush all opposition, and as much as I love Altair, the voice actor is different, so he feels a bit more bland. I bought this game regardless, because I like the cannonical events and want to see what happens to the characters of the AC universe. If you are not OCD about this, and couldn't care about the characters or the story developments, then feel free to skip this game unless it's $5 during a steam sale. In my opinion, this is the worst of the games so far, not considering AC3 & Black Flag.			"

												Easily the weakest game in the series. Too many gameplay elements are forced in that have no place in AC. This results in a very long and tedious tutorial and a very easy game.Even during puzzles and forced action sequenses the camera points out exactly where to go. For a ""puzzle"" I spend some time figuring out how to go about crossing the room, but it turned out all I have to do is hold free run + W and watch. Don't try deviating from your pre-aproved path, free running, but not free.The story is generaly weak or at some points just downright stupid, the only redeeming part is is a good ending. If you're willing to do annoying first person platforming there's more backstory to discover but I simply found the platforming way too annoying, partly due to the terrible controls and no way to change them.The game is still reasonable in the end but mainly due to being based on AC2, it only substracts from that base.If you are a fan of the series you'll likely pick this up at a sale anyway, but for newcomers to the series this would be a very bad introduction: get AC2 instead.

												Heyyo, This is probably the worst entry in the AC series for me... it's a console port that looks as good as the first AC game but runs worse... plus some of the fight achievement requirements of taking no damage are quite difficult when you can't do a counter-attack to kill some of the NPC's and sometimes it'll put 5 of those in a fight... so then you have to mash your left click like crazy and hope the others don't swing at you as you do... otherwise you take damage and buddy's health seems to be back to full... sigh.

												Overall: 6/10Careful! When you read you are in the risk of breaking into tears. Read at your own risk!This game is very enjoyable indeed with the new features and stuff. I liked it a lot and i still like it like the previous AC-Games. Parkour, Assassination, Stealth, Tactics, Surprises, Brotherhood, Optional-Rewarding-Missions, Story, New Wisdom and more. The protagonist is back and wise & dangerous as ever but you also play the previous protagonist again.PRO'S+ Have a visit in Turkey Constantinople/Istanbul+ Tower-Defence based missions available (Make your stand there!). This one i like probably the most!+ Replay the previous protagonist. The actual protagonist is good too.+ Challange's and Assassin-Missions are rewarding a lot!+ Many varianting memory missions+ Like the part with the hookblade & ziplines+ You can craft BOMB's!CON'S- However you play the previous protagonist, his voice is DIFFERENT and not original!- UPlay fux everything up! I had to ""modify"" something before i could play it! No help from support!- First civilisation do not fit in such games like this IMO- Mentioned before, that some optional challanges or missions are rewardable you can (and i did) right on your start of the game gain the rewards for the very BEST EQUIPMENT available ingame, and as the game progress you will find nowhere better stuff than you got rewarded! This makes this same a walk-in-the-park.- Game is very short!I do not recommend to pay for this game since the developers have gone on a moneyhunt and are releasing since AC3 non-assassin games with cheap tricks. AC - Revelations IMO was the last entertaining and yet an assassin game. However it is still worth playing. I do not support the dev's any further because their products have gone worse and I still have the inability to play it ""clean"" without UPlay.			"

												An enormous disappointment. While Constantinople is visually amazing and a great location choice, the game's story is so boring and unimaginative that I got tired of it before even reaching the halfway mark. I stuck through it up to 100%, and can round up the game's qualities: Jannisaries, grenades allow for some cheesy and fun moments, Constantinople, and your assassin trainee's unique missions. I'm not going to list the faults, only mention what bothered me the most: putting Altaïr back in the game. For me this effectively ruined the character, who was so enigmatic in AC and mysterious in AC II (as an almost-god among assassins). Putting him in Revelations took the mystery out and threw the crappy combat in, and it ended up seeming like Ubisoft just threw him in to please the fanboys. Huge mistake.			"

												Straight to the point. 7.5/10. It's Assassin's Creed, if you liked the others, you'll probably like this one. Which is both great and what's bad about this series. The game hasn't really changed the forumla much at all throughout the games, it just feels lazy to me. The game is still fun, it's basically just the same thing as Call of Duty at a lesser extent at this point. I don't really know what else to say about it. It's worth it if you're a fan of the genre/series, but in my opinion it's somewhat boring if you've been playing every single AC game since. Only major complaints are the PC controls are really odd at first, and the graphics are fairly ugly.			"

												The final installment of Ezio's story.  Ezio is now an old man but still an active assassin.  The introduction of the hook blade is one of the big changes in this game, allowing for more options in both fighting and freerunning.  One thing I really liked is the hook-and-run, which allowed you to get past a bunch of guards making a roadblock.  This game also introduced the den defense minigame, which I wasn't very fond of.  I want to freerun and assassinate people, not play a tower-defense game...  One more thing they added was bomb crafting, which I never used ever...  While not as good as the first two, Assassin's Creed Revelations is worth playing simply because it provides closure to Ezio's story.			"

												Heyyo, This is probably the worst entry in the AC series for me... it's a console port that looks as good as the first AC game but runs worse... plus some of the fight achievement requirements of taking no damage are quite difficult when you can't do a counter-attack to kill some of the NPC's and sometimes it'll put 5 of those in a fight... so then you have to mash your left click like crazy and hope the others don't swing at you as you do... otherwise you take damage and buddy's health seems to be back to full... sigh.

												Like with most Assassin's Creed games, you play them for the story, not innovations in the gameplay over preview games. You should only get this game if you are interested in the story. It may be a bit of a filler but it definitely pumps you up for the next game in the series. Worth a sale purchase for the fans of the series.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----I'm basing my rating on the game being part of a larger whole of the series. I do not recommend playing this game on it's own.Story: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 2.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 3.5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 2.5/5Music: 4/5			"

												This was the first assassins creed game I have ever played. (the first one on pc being ac brotherhood). I originally played this on the Xbox 360 then some time passed and i got into pc gaming and when i bought this and played it through to the end. I wasn't disapointed. I even teared up a little bit because i was so emotionally invested into the characters. That may be because this was my first game that i actually loved... the single player was byodiful, graphics were very nice and i could even run it at about 60 fps on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer which was suprising. The multiplayer was tough to get a grip on but i got the hang of it eventually.			"

												As much as the assasins creed games are fund to play -their rewards leave much to be desired.  All of the rewards for completing x y z challenge are wholly unnecessary, as Ezio is so blatantly OP that he doesn't require the help of anyone else in the world.Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  It's certainly unbalanced.  I got through the majority of the game without the bombs, and didn't realise there was a tutorial mission until I had gotten through the game and was wandering around for 100% sync.  Wandering around for the chests is useless...if not for the memory, I wouldn't bother.  Even now that I'm actively trying to use my bombs, I still have far too many materials.  There's no one on the multiplayer version either, which is sad, and no way to get the achievements singally.Not sure I like the trend of the jump puzzles becoming more cinematic...though it is pretty.Fun game - a little broken.

												AC: R is the third an the last part of Ezio Audiotre's journey to fully understand what being an assassin truly means.The game introduces a new mechanic called ""The hook blade"", which is basically a hidden blade, with a small hook on, helping you climb faster and fight better. And, frankly, that's the best thing in the game. Except for the mission you just go and pick flowers.Anyway, the game has a lot to improve. Maybe not gameplay-wise, but story-wise. The plot of the game just felt very dull, although it gave a closer look into Ezio's personal life, which was pretty nice. After all the **** that went down in Italy, the Ottomans just don't feel like anything.I know, I know, maybe I'm being too critical, but the game didn't make me feel anything, until the very last three or four missions.Still, the game finishes Ezio's story, and even though I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't played AC2 and AC: B, the game will be a satisfying end to Ezio's legend, for those who played the two games before.

												It's a little more of the same from previous entries.The ""hook"" is a nice addition but the map was reduced to one town and horses were removed - both of which made this game seem much smaller than Brotherhood.Den defense and Mediterranean defense were kinda ""meh"" and required more attention than they deserved.  Den defense is forced and is required way too frequently until you build up your assasin's enough and then it just disappears altogether.  Mediterranean defense required WAY too much attention to maintain a hold on a region.  It became way too distracting especially for a ""completionist"" like me.If it weren't for previous entries this would be an excellent game in and of itself and definitely worth recommending.  If you've played previous entries you know what you're in store for.I haven't spent any time on multiplayer but I imagine it's as fun as Brotherhood. I just got burnt out on playing Brotherhood so I moved on to other games before giving this one a try.			"

												This will be a brief summary of the Assassins Creed series in which Ezio Auditore da Firenze was the protagonist, and an opinion about the final part of the trylogy.  From all the three games (AC II,  Brotherhood and Revelations), this was my favorite. Not only for putting an end to an amazing story, and the life of a man, but for technically very well created. Being outside of Europe (kinda) was a nice fresh experience, I liked the city of Constantinapole. It was more alive, than Rome and other italian places, in my opinion. The engine seemed to be updated, I saw some beautiful light effects and the enviroment was more detailed. I recommend you turning off music and just walking around on the streets listening to your surroundings. Whole new game, isn't it? This series always represented a different world view and lots of hidden messages throughout the story. That is that drove me to play the game more and more, I found it really exciting. Sadly the gameplay can be repetitive sometimes, and even frustrating when you're too far away from a fast travel point, but close enough to your target location, so you have to run across the city. 'cause no horses in Constantinapole are allowed...Even though its small mistakes, this series is a must-play for all gamers out there, I'm looking forward to the next episodes.  "

												Revelations was just a pleasure to play, the final chapter in the trilogy, you get to play an older and wiser Ezio, leaving Rome in search of answers eventually leading him to Constantinople. The story itself is really well made, combining scenes from Altair’s past and Ezio’s fight for knowledge and clarity, the story keeps getting better and better as you go through sequences.The gameplay itself didn’t change much from the previous games, the combat animations are still the same but improved, Constantinople also has an Assassin presence, as their mentor Ezio recruits and trains them as he did in Rome, calling upon them while taking Bizantine Templar strongholds or sending them across Europe on missions. Maintaining the banks and shop management, adding to this there is a notoriety consequence that calls Templar attention.The time period is very well portrayed, the city is beautiful and filled with monuments and landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, this does wonders for the game’s immersion. It was also a refreshing change of pace from the Italian cities, combined with the great soundtrack; it truly is great to play a game like this. I could not recommend this game enough, it quickly became my favorite of the trilogy, the portrayal of the city, its people and history is amazing, combined with good missions with interesting characters. It is definatly worth the purchase.			"

												ACRev is continuing from the ACBro which the story of the ancestor tell us now Ezio is going in adventure to reveal what Altair has left behind, as for Desmond, he is being trapped inside his mind after kiling Lucy in ACBro.It's definitely level up from the ACBro in terms of gameplay. Now you have many arsenal of weapon in your hand to assasinate the enemy. But, from the money to get mechanic is the same from ACII and ACBro.And in this ACRev, you will know Desmond's past and what happen to Altair after he defeat Al Mualim.I really recommended this game to other fan of AC and to all of you who want to play it. Even though Ezio is becoming old, his skill as an assassin's is getting more polished.So it's definitely worth to try.			"

												For an Assassins Creed game, it did pretty... bad. The story is not thrilling as the others installments on the series but can get you hooked at some point. The love between Ezio and Sofia did not receive as much attention as it should have. However, if you think of this as just a game and not as part of a series, it can surprise you. The game is simple enough, no stealth, slaughter everyone and proceed. You'll only use stealth when the game makes you. Assassins Creed is much more of an Arcade than a stealth type of game, and the difficulty is the same. If you want an easy, fast paced and parkour game, this is the game for you.			"

												I like this one. If you just focus on the side missions, meta-games like den defending, sending assassin's to other countries, it's just the same game as Brotherhood with a change of scenery. Istanbul is not even fun to explore like Firenze or Venezia (yeah) Because while the European setting of the first two games is quite colorful, Constantinople is in sepia tone and full of mosques and such. Maybe I don't find it interesting because it's my everday scenery but there is a problem in color grading of the game. It just makes it boring. Istanbul is still beautiful  in the game but...And they didn't even use much of a music to support the atmosphere. The ones you hear (except one or two when you hear during cutscenes) are just backgroung chorus that you shut your ears later in the game. Maybe they tried to avoid being oriental with the east theme but it didn't work good for them.Still there's the good old Assassin's Creed feel when you walk the streets, pass people in their everyday walkabouts, run on roofs and climb fast to incredible hights for the view of the beautifuly modeled city.And if you just focus on the scenario it's just like the headline says. There are ""revelations"" and boy are they exciting as hell. Some nice diologs, a couple of loveable characters, really important pieces about the past and the future. And toward the end it would become really emotional. If you finish the meta-game crap early in the game (you don't need to do that more than one or two times though) like I do, you can enjoy the awesome scenario till the end (like I enjoy) hopefully. Now I just need a discount for the 3rd game.			"

												Revelations brings an end to Ezio's trilogy and what an end it is! A great story with the most charming of all the AC protagonists, returning to the setting that made the first Assassin's Creed so unique. Pro's:- Great Story and Storytelling, has some of the greatest moments in the series.- New mechanics such as bombcrafting and a parachute and small advancements in managing your Brotherhood.- New setting with Constantinople and surrounding area including the good old Masiaf. - Costantinople is grand, colorful and busy. No grasslands and empty areas as in Rome. - Gameplay remains unchanged from Brotherhood, Ezio is still capable of murdering guards in style, even in his fifties.- Old Ezio is of all other games in the series the most likeable Protagonist. He is wise, calculated and badass, always teaching his fellow Assassins what he has learned throughout his life. But in his heart he has not changed, he is still a ladykiller and even as an old man he still flirts with a significantly younger woman. (SPOILER: Successfully!) Con's:- Not much new in terms of gameplay. If you don't care for the story it may not be worth it for you.- Uplay.- Ubisoft.- Desmond is suddenly black. How did that happen?- Credit scene cannot be skipped in case you want to continue playing after finishing the story.- Ubisoft. If you really enjoy Ezio's story, this game will be a blast for you. If you are more of a mechanic and gameplay focused player, there isn't much new to Revelations that would excite you. Revelations scores with it's story, setting and atmosphere.It finishes off Ezios story very well while shining a brighter light on Altair's life and how he influenced the Assassin order, how he fundamentally changed them to what we knew them as as Ezio. In completely optional puzzle sequences inside the Animus you can also learn more about Desmond and his early life, how he became a bartender instead of an Assassin. Overall in my opinion ot has the most exciting story and the most diverse way of telling it of all AC's. It has some epic and hilarious moments. The final chapter of Ezio's life as an Assassin and the final chapter of the Assassin's Creed series for me.			"

												This is a step back for Assassins Creed compared to the Brotherhood game. You play in Constantinople but it doesn't seem as colorful or as exciting compared to Rome. There are fewer chases, assassination targets and hidden tombs. I really miss the long planned infiltration missions like Castellode Santo Angello in Brotherhood. This game has only one. There is a crazy fixation on bombs for some reason too. There are ingredients everywhere but there are pretty useless. It's a shame Ezio's last game has to be so bad compared to the previous....

												This game is not as good as Assassins Creed Brotherhood or AC3 but it still provides a fun gameplay. The hook blade is handy in scaling walls, but you'll end up (at least I did) using your wrist pistol more often than the previous games, as you face tougher enemies like Janissaries that carry two weapons most times instead of Halberd wielding guys in clunky armor. Ezio is an old fart but still runs around and jumps across buildings as if he never aged a day. Age has no meaning in video games neither does time. I'd still recommend getting it, but don't expect the same type of game as Brotherhood. 7.5/10			"

												Ubisoft clearly has forgotten to develop the gameplay after the succes of ACII. Revelations is exactly the same as Brotherhood, but in a different, far less interesting city. There is not as much to do, the mythology is completely absent, and most of the gameplay is just repeating the one thing over and over again. Revelations is more like ACI than II. The annoying bugs and the gameplay that by now is as rusty as a hundred year old cemetary gate from a bad horror movie, make Revelations into a mediocre game at best.			"

												'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' was a fantastic game, improving on and adding much to the greatness that was 'Assassin's Creed II'. The completist in me really wanted to see the Ezio trilogy to the end, but I just couldn't because 'Assassin's Creed Revelations' just didn't improve on 'Brotherhood' enough and add more value to the previous games to make it really worthwhile.The graphics in 'Revalations' are gorgeous (even by 2013 -- 2014 standards) and I love Constantinople as the setting, but the whole game felt sluggish -- like the aging Ezio ironically. When I found out that in this game, Ezio tasked himself on another hunting quest, I thought, ""Again?"" The freshness of Ezio's adventures was gone and the Ubisoft team should have stopped while Ezio was still on top. Adding new weapons to your arsenal was not enough to keep me interested, and I actually found myself dreading the need to invest in city businesses and to train assassins all over again.The pacing of the game was off-putting as well, with the Den Defense minigame to be most annoying. Similar minigames were found in games like 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' -- it wasn't fun then, and it isn't fun now (or ever). Plus, Den Defense was not what I want to do when I play an 'Assassin's Creed' game.Unless you're truly invested in Ezio's adventures, don't bother with 'Revelations'. There are too many good games out there for you to spend your hours on than this game.			"

												Could not get any asscreed game to run on windows 10. Googled around, it's a common problem. Ubisoft does not officially support windows 10. This game installs another launcher (ubisoft launcher), and I believe it requires an internet connection. Ubisoft is everything wrong with PC gaming. Never giving them another dime.			"

												Revelations was just a pleasure to play, the final chapter in the trilogy, you get to play an older and wiser Ezio, leaving Rome in search of answers eventually leading him to Constantinople. The story itself is really well made, combining scenes from Altair’s past and Ezio’s fight for knowledge and clarity, the story keeps getting better and better as you go through sequences.The gameplay itself didn’t change much from the previous games, the combat animations are still the same but improved, Constantinople also has an Assassin presence, as their mentor Ezio recruits and trains them as he did in Rome, calling upon them while taking Bizantine Templar strongholds or sending them across Europe on missions. Maintaining the banks and shop management, adding to this there is a notoriety consequence that calls Templar attention.The time period is very well portrayed, the city is beautiful and filled with monuments and landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, this does wonders for the game’s immersion. It was also a refreshing change of pace from the Italian cities, combined with the great soundtrack; it truly is great to play a game like this. I could not recommend this game enough, it quickly became my favorite of the trilogy, the portrayal of the city, its people and history is amazing, combined with good missions with interesting characters. It is definatly worth the purchase.			"

												Fantastic game and probably the best in the series. Beautiful realistic reconstruction of medieval Constantinople, with georgeous light effects, music and movie-like camera, while preserving fully controlled 3D experience. Action, love, adventure, mystery and intelligent story. The best of the main character Ezio Auditore da Firenze in his mature age. Only few glitches in comparison to the other games in the series. Thanks to the atmosphere, cinematic action and intelligent story one of the best PC games ever. A must play experience. Don't forget to visit the inside of Hagia Sophia temple (accessed only by fulfilling certain task)!			"

													Assassin’s Creed Revelations is a third person parkour/stealth game, and the third in the Assassin’s Creed II trilogy of games. While on the surface this game may seem similar to – indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.Story	Ezio Auditore is graying, but he hasn’t slowed down yet. After travelling to the fortress of Altair, the assassin protagonist from the original Assassin’s Creed, in search of answers, he is confronted by a group of Templars who are searching for five keys that could open up Altair’s vault and give them access to the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact left behind by Those Who Came Before that can reveal many secrets and control men’s minds, among other things. Ezio must find the keys before them so that he can keep the artifact safe.	Alas, this game’s plot is quite poor compared to the previous games; the plot is motivated entirely by a “collect the soup cans” plot, where you try and collect the magical keys before the bad guys do. The cast is all new, with only Ezio appearing from the previous two Assassin’s Creed II games, and while there are flashbacks to Altair’s life in the aftermath of the original Assassin’s Creed, having never played the first game, I’m not sure to what extent some of the characters are carried over from that game.	The biggest problem lies in the fact that the modern-day plot – the entire reason that Desmond, the protagonist, is flashing back through his ancestor’s memories – takes an extreme back seat throughout the game. Desmond spends the entire game trapped in the machine that allows him to view his ancestor’s memories, and thus the meta-plot comes to a screeching halt and the whole game feels like a pointless cash-in, something which Ubisoft created to exploit AC II once more before finally releasing AC III. While the meta-plot never consumed a huge fraction of the previous games, its absence here is very notciable, as Ezio’s story just isn’t that interesting or high-stakes, and none of the characters I encountered in Constantinople connected with me in any way. The whole “conspiracy theory” angle that the previous games had is almost entirely lost, with no real signs of said gigantic conspiracy appearing in the game, and without that whole aspect, the game is simply much less interesting.Gameplay	The gameplay is virtually unchanged from the previous Assassin’s Creed II games. Ezio starts out with all his toys, and he only really gets a couple new ones – a hook that he can use to extend his reach while jumping, which is vaguely interesting for some platforming, and bombs, which have a variety of effects, but the main one is basically “win fights even more ridiculously easily than before.” There were a few acrobatic maneuvers added to close combat, but they’re mostly pretty worthless; combat is extremely easy and I never even once had to use the new maneuvers to win or escape.	The gameplay is still the same formula as the previous Assassin’s Creed II games: you spend the whole game running through a city, climbing buildings and occasionally murdering people. The parkour is pretty smooth, but honestly has begun to wear a bit thin; while it is neat being able to climb buildings, in the end it is mostly just following paths through the environment which mostly feel extremely straightforward and without much skill. Because Ezio does so much automatically, there’s very little challenge in the platforming aspects of the game, and because Ezio is so good at instantly killing enemies – indeed, he can kill every enemy in the game with a single hit, and oftentimes, kill entire groups in this manner – there’s very little challenge in combat. The main challenge of the game is sneaking around stealthily, and a few missions where you aren’t supposed to kill people, but even all of that is easily done within a couple tries.	Consequently, the game as a whole feels extremely lightweight, and there isn’t much of a sense of achievement in victory; everything feels like it was handed to you on a silver platter, and the lack of challenge makes a lot of the game feel samey. A few underground tombs add some variety to the feel of the game, and a few of them felt pretty good, but in the end they really more or less boil down to “running along the path and the game trying to make it look impressive”, rather similar to the 3D Sonic games, but without the challenge. The missions can almost all be beaten very quickly, and most of the missions that cannot be beaten extremely quickly are because you have to run back and forth across the city. If you were just running through the main quest line, you could beat the entire game in under 10 hours.	The main side quests in the game are just “collect all the objects in the environment”, and while there are maps to finding the items which you can purchase, actually grabbing all the items is completely unchallenging; it is just tedious. Indeed, almost all of the “challenges” in the game are just tedious time-wasters to make the game feel longer than it really is; there’s only a handful of sidequests, and of them, only two had any real weight to them, and both of them were additional “Explore the ancient tomb” type challenges, much like the ones in the main questline, except in different environments.	As in the previous Assassin’s Creed game, you can recruit a bunch of sidekick assassins and send them on quests to go murder people to level up, or you can have them stick around and murder people for you while you’re going around town, which makes the game even more of a joke. In the end, these sidequests are handled entirely textually and are very dull, just another time management/time waster that the game throws in to make things last longer.Graphics	The game looks decent enough graphically; the graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable enough and the primary characters are all reasonably distinctive. Alas, your sidekick assassins are entirely interchangeable and not terribly interesting looking, and the city itself, while pretty enough at first, quickly becomes a bland backdrop after running across it for the umpteenth time. The hidden assassin key locations break up the monotony a bit, but for most of the game, you see nothing but a bunch of samey buildings.Final Summary	Assassin’s Creed Revelations is a cash-in on the Assassins’s Creed II series of games, and is pretty much entirely worthless; the game does nothing to further the meta-story of the series, and Ezio’s story here is pretty bland. The gameplay is just more of the same from the previous games, with more of the same tedious time wasters to pretend like the game is longer than it is. There’s just not a whole lot here to recommend; it is yet another ACII game, but despite the slight improvements in gameplay it is worth neither your time nor your money. "

												Another great AC title, gameplay stays basically the same from the previous two titles. It started kind of slow storywise but it surely picked up halfway through the game. Devs added a ""tower defense"" mini mode within the game, it's mostly optional quests though. Story is basically about revelations, and gotta say the ending was very ""revealing"". Think a combination of films Wanted (Assassins) and Knowing (The revelation within the game). Very intense.			"

												Buy when it's: $5.00.AC: Revelations didn't reveal much. It featured some flashbacks to Altair, the original assassin, but didn't really explain much about the Templar/Assassin war, their philosophies, or just what's going on in the modern world. It did reveal how depressing Altair's life was. Pretty much his entire family gets killed. He gets disgraced and kicked out of the Assassin's Guild, his son gets killed, his wife gets killed when they go to redeem their dead son, then more people get killed. Everybody goes and dies until eventually Altair himself sits down in a chair to rest and dies. But those are just the flashbacks. The actual storyline is not memorable.Gameplay is very similar to previous games. You have the same 4 groups of allies; assassins, thieves, warriors, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You try to burn enemy outposts and renovate shops in the area. The only difference is the location, which is set in Istanbul/Constantinople. Visually, the game looks nice. It's sharp, crisp, with good character details and animations. Music is beautiful. The main theme is catchy. Voice acting is above-average. Overall, It's a nice game in the style of AC2 and AC:Brotherhood, set in a different town, cast in a gloomier tone. By the end of the game, you feel like an old man waiting to die, without really knowing the answers to your life's questions. Rating: 6/10.			"

												This has some fun things that they took out when they made the newer AC 3: tactical view siege events for area control, and the ability to buy buildings. Overall, this game is better than 3 in a few areas but 3 has better control and combat. But what makes this game so unforgettable and so pleasing to look at is its combination middle eastern/Victorian setting. The graphics are stunning and even more pleasing to look at than AC3. The character models are just as good as both AC3 and 4. The presentation value is astounding and there are a lot more objects and details than there are in AC3. The combination of dulled bright pastels with dusty and sandy overtones give the game a remarkable and unforgettable world. Two things this game does better than AC3: more non-linear in comparison and better presentation (although 3 still looks awesome).There are two main reasons why I like this game over 3. Ezio is imo the best main character yet in a AC game, and this game takes place exclusively in a giant city with limitless parkouring opportunities and is heavily populated by people everywhere. It means you have more paths to complete objectives and to move around the game, or at least much more parkouring opportunities. In 3 you are going to spend some time in the wide-open wilderness and even the cities are much more wide-open than this game. I prefer to have this game's giant tightly quartered city at my disposal.There are a couple of problems that this game has that I wish it could have done much better on. The controls are not as tight as thery are in later games, but they are close because AC controls are sometimes hit and miss. Sometimes you will parkour onto things you did not want to, and sometimes you will jump to or down from places that you did not want to. Combat however is smooth and easy. The other problem is optimization. It is no surprise and is a common issue with all of Ubisoft's games because they are, far and away, the all-time undisputed kings of bad console ports. Their ports are so bad that I stopped buying their games years ago. I have kept following their progress though and they are still making horrible ports. They will probably never learn. Anyway, the problem with this game is that while it runs at a smooth 60fps, there is constant stutter-locking, common in a lot of bad Ubisoft ports.Despite the flaws this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, even despite its age.Game 8.5/10, Port job: 5/10 Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves Ubisoft. Every game you port has p1ss poor performance issues lol.			"

												TL:DR - Even more of the same AC2/Brotherhood gameplay in a much smaller area... The story progresses more, though.Not as much to say about Revelations. After Desmond stabs Lucy after retrieving the Apple in the Colliseum, Desmond goes into shock and his brain activity is highly unstable. He gets hooked into an Animus and is told by Subject 16, who is just a memory echo in the Animus itself, that he needs to complete Ezio's story to leave the Animus and continue the journey. You then find Ezio in Constantinople (or as it was recently christened: Istanbul) and he's trying to find the Masayaf keys that were left behind by Niccolo Polo to open a vault of supreme knowledge. Upon entering Istanbul, Ezio finds himself confronting a conflict between Byzantine insurrectionists and the new Ottoman occupiers of the city. Ezio has to find the keys and discover the last bit of knowledge, not just for his own sake, but for Desmond's as well.While I love Istanbul and its many landmarks (my favorite being the Hagia Sophia), the city felt like it was compressed down to AC2 size (think Venice or Firenze). Since it was the only place you could go (except for one sequence which took place in a small area inside of a cave that you can't go back to) the world just felt small. Istanbul was a shining city of the time as well as being one of the largest cities in the former Roman Empire, so it just felt disappointing to only be moving about a tiny area when you were so used to Rome's open areas and openness. The game was also fairly short compared to AC2 and Brotherhood. I think there were a total of 8 or 9 sequences with only a few missions each. Most of the gameplay was repeated, except they added in bomb crafting (which I didn't use all too much) as well as a Tower-Defense-style minigame for the previous-Borgia towers. Once you conquered a tower, if your notoriety stayed too high for too long, the Templars would try to take it back. You would then have to play the tower defense mini-game to hold it. However, it takes a long time and notoriety can be reduced fairly quickly (and the game decided to try to force the TD mini game by making notoriety reduction harder through only being able to bribe heralds and kill witnesses). After the initial mission that had it, I never did the tower defense game again. I never needed to, so it was pretty useless. There was also no special armor you could get and those puzzles were reserved for when you got the Masayaf keys (you only had to get 4 of them...). All of the mechanics felt really recycled and the new additions didn't seem to really give this game that extra kick that the series really needed. Taking the cities in the Assassin mini-game was new, but then it just became a management sim and if you neglected it for too long, the game forced the city to revert back to Templar control. So it was just forcing you to do the Assassin contract missions for the sake of doing it, rather than achieving any real goal. A lot of the game's new mechanics felt that way. They had you do them just to have you do them, rather than make it an integral part of the story.The story was the saving grace of this game, though. It really advances the Templar vs. Assassin story and it even crosses paths with Altair's story from the past in little sequences left behind in the Masayaf keys. In the end, the game shines a light on why trying to find the artifacts are of vital importance to the world, and it makes the race for the vaults feel more urgent than just a ""we don't want the Templars to have them"" motivation. Ezio truly becomes his own character as a grizzled veteran of the struggle and his temperment is perfect for this game. They even gave him a love interest that worked, and although she was more of a side dish than the main course, it added to the story instead of distracting from it.In the end, I have to give Revelations a slight ""Yes"" recommendation. It's still fun, but I found myself wanting to take more breaks and do something new rather than play through to the end. Thankfully, the end comes fairly quickly so you can push through and move on to the next chapter in the AC series.			"

												TL:DR - Even more of the same AC2/Brotherhood gameplay in a much smaller area... The story progresses more, though.Not as much to say about Revelations. After Desmond stabs Lucy after retrieving the Apple in the Colliseum, Desmond goes into shock and his brain activity is highly unstable. He gets hooked into an Animus and is told by Subject 16, who is just a memory echo in the Animus itself, that he needs to complete Ezio's story to leave the Animus and continue the journey. You then find Ezio in Constantinople (or as it was recently christened: Istanbul) and he's trying to find the Masayaf keys that were left behind by Niccolo Polo to open a vault of supreme knowledge. Upon entering Istanbul, Ezio finds himself confronting a conflict between Byzantine insurrectionists and the new Ottoman occupiers of the city. Ezio has to find the keys and discover the last bit of knowledge, not just for his own sake, but for Desmond's as well.While I love Istanbul and its many landmarks (my favorite being the Hagia Sophia), the city felt like it was compressed down to AC2 size (think Venice or Firenze). Since it was the only place you could go (except for one sequence which took place in a small area inside of a cave that you can't go back to) the world just felt small. Istanbul was a shining city of the time as well as being one of the largest cities in the former Roman Empire, so it just felt disappointing to only be moving about a tiny area when you were so used to Rome's open areas and openness. The game was also fairly short compared to AC2 and Brotherhood. I think there were a total of 8 or 9 sequences with only a few missions each. Most of the gameplay was repeated, except they added in bomb crafting (which I didn't use all too much) as well as a Tower-Defense-style minigame for the previous-Borgia towers. Once you conquered a tower, if your notoriety stayed too high for too long, the Templars would try to take it back. You would then have to play the tower defense mini-game to hold it. However, it takes a long time and notoriety can be reduced fairly quickly (and the game decided to try to force the TD mini game by making notoriety reduction harder through only being able to bribe heralds and kill witnesses). After the initial mission that had it, I never did the tower defense game again. I never needed to, so it was pretty useless. There was also no special armor you could get and those puzzles were reserved for when you got the Masayaf keys (you only had to get 4 of them...). All of the mechanics felt really recycled and the new additions didn't seem to really give this game that extra kick that the series really needed. Taking the cities in the Assassin mini-game was new, but then it just became a management sim and if you neglected it for too long, the game forced the city to revert back to Templar control. So it was just forcing you to do the Assassin contract missions for the sake of doing it, rather than achieving any real goal. A lot of the game's new mechanics felt that way. They had you do them just to have you do them, rather than make it an integral part of the story.The story was the saving grace of this game, though. It really advances the Templar vs. Assassin story and it even crosses paths with Altair's story from the past in little sequences left behind in the Masayaf keys. In the end, the game shines a light on why trying to find the artifacts are of vital importance to the world, and it makes the race for the vaults feel more urgent than just a ""we don't want the Templars to have them"" motivation. Ezio truly becomes his own character as a grizzled veteran of the struggle and his temperment is perfect for this game. They even gave him a love interest that worked, and although she was more of a side dish than the main course, it added to the story instead of distracting from it.In the end, I have to give Revelations a slight ""Yes"" recommendation. It's still fun, but I found myself wanting to take more breaks and do something new rather than play through to the end. Thankfully, the end comes fairly quickly so you can push through and move on to the next chapter in the AC series.			"

												The games content is fantastic. Storyline, game play, everything. But here is the catch, you buy on steam, download third party software, that said software crashes upon startup, if you get it to work and update the launcher, create a third party account. This is exactly like GTA 4. This is completely unneeded amount of crap. Only reason I do not recommend this game is the hassle and amount of hoops you must jump through to play the damn thing. "

												9.8/10 Amazing Sequel, Ezio's story wraps up perfectly, and you even get closure on Altair which was a fantastic touch. The combination of stories flow perfectly together. Ezio is a legend and truly is the most interesting man in the world. AC2 /ACBH/ and ACRev will always be in my top stories of all time.			"

												Was a huge fan of II and Brotherhood. This part of the series did not do it for me. The storyline is very good to be honest. I really liked travelling to Constantinopel and see how things were in the time of the Ottoman empire. The Ezio send-off at the end is worth it and makes way for part III. But the rest of the game felt tedious and boring. I even stopped playing for a while. I had to 'force' myself to continue playing to see how the story would unfold.The bomb system just didn't add anything special to the fighting mechanics and you can easily play the whole game without ever using a bomb.I am usually an achievement and stats horder, but this time I just couldn't be bothered.The number of different fighting styles from enemies could have been cool too, but it didn't add excitement to the game. It brought frustration to the game, which is a shame, because it really could have been cool. The fact is that every enemy has a single strategy to defeat them and that's it.The 'Tower Defense'  minigame doesn't add anything to the game in my opinion and the fact that you had to send your assassins to other cities just felt stupid and worthless. Why would you send them to cities where you don't play yourself? Could easily have worked in the main city (divided in districts where you really have to fight to gain control and keep control). Now it just feels like something that happens way over there and doesn't effect you very much.The shop-ownership system feels like a waste of time too. AC II, where you re-build your mansion and small town around it, felt way more satisfactory in my opinion.In conclusion: if this game is on major sale and you want to see the story progress, do get it and play through it, but otherwise... stay away from this title, read online how the story unfolds (or watch the split scenes on youtube or something) and move on to AC III.

												I was a AC fan before this game. After playing first AC, I bought AC2 and Brotherhood on release day and did not play anything else until I finished them. I had same excitement and motivation for AC:Revelations. Note that I live in area where this game takes place. So, I was looking forward to travel my suburbs with Ezio in Ottoman era.After playing half of the game I suddenly stopped playing. It was just same, same, same...2 days ago I decided to continue just because I wanna complete the game before I delete it.I don't know the story, don't know who is who and don't care indeed. I miss the feeling I had in AC2 but my AC adventures stopped before even finishing this game. Such a pitty.			"

												Definite avoid. Writing: Ubisoft are just pumping the pump here. A convoluted story that at times makes little sense and has you doing farmville type activities to try to bulk out the game. The writing is pretty awful. The first AC game was really interesting but as soon as they revealed this whole templars thing I think it fell flat with players. The animus is lot more interesting than Brotherhood though. Gameplay: Almost entirely unchanged, the game mechanics are so similar that you're spending most of your time bored here. There is a lot of bloat here that is best skipped. If you want to recruit other assassin's or earn money instead of playing the game that's great. I hated the whole direction. Altair is back but it might as well be cutscenes.Graphics: The graphics appear to be an updated theme in an old engine but the bugs are really out in force. Bugs: 4 years on and this game is still heavily bugged. During this game it crashed multiple times requiring CPU affinity to be set to a single core crippling performance. Other bugs include falling into areas that end with you stuck, camera issues that make the game unplayable and a QTE boss fight event doesn't accept the key strokes required, leading to a restart. Focus on stealth is sadly lacking and you can't restore to a checkpoint if you are discovered, you have to restart the entire memory or suicide. It's unlikely I'll put any time into another AC game without stunning reviews.			"

												I'ved always loved the Assasins creed series (yes even 1), but Revelations was just...meh. The bomb mechanic was annoying to use and the story started to go downhill. I've always played Assasins creed to as close to 100% as I possibly could but I can't even finish the story for this game. How disapointing. Sure the assasination mechanics are still mostly there, but stop at Brotherhood if you can unless you just want this for the additional gameplay.			"

												I just can't do this anymore. I'm like 9 hours in and I've only found 3 of the 5 McGuffins. After stepping away for a couple weeks I have no desire to get back in to this. An introduction from some guy you've never heard of and I suspect never will again sets up a repetative mission structure that eventually turns in to a next-gen bomberman. This is broken up only by an awful tower defense mini game that I thankfully only had to do once because I always paid the heralds anytime I passed them. There are also different classes of enemies that attack you based on apparently nothing, which can lead to a pretty frustrating experience just trying to get around. And they still haven't fixed the problem of flashing extremely specific instructions in the corner of the screen while you're being chased down or under a clock. You already have to know what all 20 buttons do plus the combinations you can get by holding one of them down, I don't have time for this. The whole thing felt really underbaked yet needlesly complex. If anything was revealed in the end I'm sure I could find it on Youtube if I bothered to look.			"

												The game was great until it stopped working entirely. I was really looking forward to playing the Assassin's Creeds that I missed (Revelations and AC3) but was really disappointed to find that at a certain point in the game, it stopped working. I was playing as Altiar escaping Masyaf or whatever and it crashes with this error message ""ACRSP.exe has stopped working"". I have a pretty decent gaming computer so I was confused. I launched the game again and played for about 30 seconds before the error message came up again. I tried launching again... and it crashes again. I look online for a solution and apparently it is a problem that alot of people have with this game. After hours of searching and using a cavalcade of different fixes, nothing worked. I have tried my hardest to ask Ubisoft what the problem is but they send me some generic ""update your drivers"" nonsense. Even after I tried the obvious solution of updating every single GD thing on my computer, it still did not work. Well, I have looked on forums to see if people who had this problem have found a solution and the only thing I keep reading is that Ubisoft are ""C***s"". So yeah, GG Ubisoft on your quality control and superb customer service. I hope to god Unity will not be as unstable as this game. If there is a god, I beg of you to keep Unity under control.			"

												2 assassins, one destiny. Another entry in Assassisns Creed series with good innovations and storytelling. Revelations shows us final moments of Ezio Auditore as he travels to Constantinople where he must find keys to sacred chamber in Masyaf where assassisins were born. While gameplay stays same like past 2 games only new thing we get is bomb crafting. You can find various elements to craft different bombs for different situations. Buy new armor upgrades, different weapons,, upgrading shops, training your assassins and sending them to other cities all same from past game but better. As you progress you also can play as Altair to see what happens before and after events of first game. Multiplayer is great in its own way, different missions to play very fun to enjoy with friends. Overall best game of series, but short.			"

												This was my first game in the AC series.It's fun, although I never finished it because I bought AC3 and that was so much better.Still had fun with this game, the combat is more detailed and challenging, it just feelt ""small"", after I picked up AC3.I may still go back to it, after I finish Black Flag.. if I don't pick up Rogue or Unity right after...

												I've always wanted to visit Istanbul; it is a city where many civilizations have converged, and to me it has the most fascinating history of any place in the world. Maybe my expectations for this game were too high, but Revelations really screwed the pooch with Istanbul. Rather than build a compelling environment like Brotherood did, this game just took pictures of a city and made the map bigger, bigger, bigger. Somewhere in this game was an interesting story, but the narrative focused solely on the characters, and did not uniquely tie into Istanbul. Brotherhood's story tied character motivations with facets of the city, making you want to explore Rome. In Revelations, the city is just a backdrop for a well traveled plot.Istanbul feels like a larger version of the AC1 cities in that it has no distinct personality. But I love the cities in AC1. Why? AC1 was new, the climbing was new, so in that game, the cities felt huge. Plus, armed with only your blade, the cities felt like they enabled you to assassinate your target. Add onto this a connecting wilderness and the world felt complete. In this game, you have a thousand tools to get your target, and a billion things to bumble into, and huge travel times to complete needless tasks; the city just feels like an impediment. The ending of this game, where you are hang-gliding around and repeatedly defeating a boss---who finally gets offed in a cut-scene where he gets pushed off a cliff by someone else---is just bad. I mean, nothing about the boss warrants a multi-stage fight. It's just poor design.All of the new moves in this game feature herky-jerky animations. The technique to scale things rapidly also makes no sense from a gravity/momentum/physics perspective. I wouldn't normally complain about this, but the terrible animation compels me.  The game has two great cutscenes: one at the begining of the game, which sets a great tone, and one at the end of the game, which is incredibly satisfying, providing a resolution better than any other in the series. They are really well done. They stand up irrespective of this game. I watched them well before playing Revelations; I watched them when I played Revelations; and I've watched them since playing Revelations, and I wonder why they are tethered to Revelations.If only the rest of the game could have been so compelling. Istanbul is the most interesting city in the world. How could this game make it so bland? Not recommended.			"

												2 assassins, one destiny. Another entry in Assassisns Creed series with good innovations and storytelling. Revelations shows us final moments of Ezio Auditore as he travels to Constantinople where he must find keys to sacred chamber in Masyaf where assassisins were born. While gameplay stays same like past 2 games only new thing we get is bomb crafting. You can find various elements to craft different bombs for different situations. Buy new armor upgrades, different weapons,, upgrading shops, training your assassins and sending them to other cities all same from past game but better. As you progress you also can play as Altair to see what happens before and after events of first game. Multiplayer is great in its own way, different missions to play very fun to enjoy with friends. Overall best game of series, but short.			"

												У новой Assassin’s Creed весьма вызывающий подзаголовок — Revelations. Но вот этих самых откровений мы от игры не ждали вовсе. Слишком противоречивым казался список новоявленных особенностей: бомбы, старый Эцио, Дезмонд в полной $#*&. Конечно, хотелось верить, что все внимание на себя перетянут ответы на вопросы, которые не дают нам покоя вот уже несколько лет. Нужно было узнать, как закончил свою жизнь Альтаир, герой первой части. Определенные надежды возлагались на красивое завершение истории главного героя сиквела и Brotherhood. Нам Revelations представлялась финальным аккордом великой ассасинской эпопеи, эдакой зачисткой плацдарма перед явлением полноценной третьей части. Ну, не то чтобы мы остались с носом и не получили важных ответов, но красивой развязки так и не случилось; свеженькая Revelations действительно оказалась, в общем-то, «старой песней», но только уже с бомбами и крюком. Что до ассасинского дела, разборок семей и паркура, то до них вам совершенно не будет никакого дела. Эцио на протяжении всей игры занимается только тем, что мы уже видели в прошлый раз.Assassin’s Creed: Revelations не вызовет у вас новых эмоций. А старые, наоборот, притупит. Потому что идеи оригинала — и мы не устанем это повторять — беспечно преданы забвению. Получили ли мы все ответы на давно возникшие вопросы? Кажется, да. Но изначально процесс раскрытия основных сюжетных тайн нам представлялся менее растянутым и нудным. В конце концов последнюю часть приключений ассасина как-то не хочется воспринимать как полноценную игру. Основную порцию контента можно было уместить в Brotherhood. Согласитесь, только мыльных опер про средневековых убийц нам не хватало.Плюсы: основные вопросы в сюжете наконец-то получили ответы; улучшенный мультиплеер; по-прежнему красиво поставленные бои.Минусы: бомбы оказались невостребованными; процесс захвата и обороны кусочков территории Константинополя утомляет; малое количество полезных нововведений; полновесная третья часть так и просится — но разработчики неумолимы.

												Great game, great plot, great graphics for a 2011 game. sucks you right in if you have never played AC before. Probably one of the best AC games made, love the open world and the way the you can interact with the NPC characters. Most of all Ezio Auditore. He has the best story-line i think that ive ever seen in AC. Shame that he only has two games thats hes in, and that all the other AC are mostly different Assassin's. A must buy game, worth it.			"

												The best thing about this installment of Assasain's Creed is the setting, art style and the optional mini-game but everything else is very linear and short. This is my least favorite (so far) of the AC series.Everything of AC brotherhood is in Revelations with a different setting and tid bits of Altair's last days. I only wanted to complete Revelations because I was interested in the story and wanted to know how it connected and everything else just was time wasters.If you play AC for the action this is the same of the previous. If you play it for the story, you can skip this one, its very short and can be sumed up in a small video.			"

												Asssassin's Creed Revelations isn't that much of a bad game, however, the graphics do feel outdated and the controls on keyboard+mouse feel terrible. Uplay is one of the most terrible gaming services ever devised by man, making it very difficult to start the game. The game will only launch if I open it as administrator, meaning I have to go into the game's files to open the .exe file. Everything is pretty mediocre in this title, but at least you get multiple playable characters. 7/10			"

												This was quite a disappointing 28 hours all to the very end. This game took everything that Brotherhood established and made it many times worse. The storyline is very disjointed and much of what happens is poorly explained or simply does not make sense. The missions are also far fewer than in Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. There are also only a couple side missions, compared to the dozens I completed in the previous titles. Even the city itself, the only one, is tiny. In a few minutes I am on the other side and there is nothing interesting going on on the way. The ending was the worst, but of course I won't spoil it here. The gameplay is essentially the same as the previous game with the addition of zip lines, which are kinda cool, if you use them; situational events which happened to me only once in the course of the entire game and it was a dude who gave me 500 for moving a couple boxes; different enemies who act the same as in the previous titles, except for Janissaries who you can't kick, shove, hit or even counter as that hardly does anything. Another option is bombs, which is a nice addition but doesn't work for one simple reason. The user interface has stayed the same, with some minor graphical additions. This is a huge problem. Why? Simply becaue there are four hot keys and that isn't even enough for the main weapons. There is a main weapon, a smaller blade, a hidden blade, poisoned hidden blade, fists, crossbow, throwing knives, three types of bombs equipped at once, poison darts, money and I feel like I might still be missing something. This leaves you awkwardly going through your giant selection in the middle of a fight just to choose the right tool. Another issue is that the assassin looks even less like an assassin. Ezio is so loaded with weapons and armour, he can't help but look suspicious. This was not the idea of the original game and as far as I know the stealth aspect is here still.Ah yes graphichs. This is a game from 2011. I have seen absolutely wonderful graphical content in games from that time and two years later Tomb Raider came out which blew my brain out of my skull with how great everything looked at even medium. Revelations makes Constantinople look beautiful, but the characters look like manikins. There is hardly any life to them. They don't breathe, their hair is one blob plastered to their heads, the women's breasts never move, blood looks like a four year old's ketchup dream. I am glad they move somehow when they talk at least.Last category I wanted to touch on was stability. I have encounted numerous bugs. People stuck in roofs, missions needing to be restarted as the essential character disappeared, assassinations through walls, enemies seeing through walls, a permanent target in the south of the city which was some dancing guy. Do you know how annoying it is when you have an arrow pointing to some dancing guy for 20 hours? I tried fixing, it doesn't work. There were also many times when the sound was completely out of sync with the video.I just can't recommend this. I am done here.			"

												Asssassin's Creed Revelations isn't that much of a bad game, however, the graphics do feel outdated and the controls on keyboard+mouse feel terrible. Uplay is one of the most terrible gaming services ever devised by man, making it very difficult to start the game. The game will only launch if I open it as administrator, meaning I have to go into the game's files to open the .exe file. Everything is pretty mediocre in this title, but at least you get multiple playable characters. 7/10			"

												The best thing about this installment of Assasain's Creed is the setting, art style and the optional mini-game but everything else is very linear and short. This is my least favorite (so far) of the AC series.Everything of AC brotherhood is in Revelations with a different setting and tid bits of Altair's last days. I only wanted to complete Revelations because I was interested in the story and wanted to know how it connected and everything else just was time wasters.If you play AC for the action this is the same of the previous. If you play it for the story, you can skip this one, its very short and can be sumed up in a small video.			"

												Great game, great plot, great graphics for a 2011 game. sucks you right in if you have never played AC before. Probably one of the best AC games made, love the open world and the way the you can interact with the NPC characters. Most of all Ezio Auditore. He has the best story-line i think that ive ever seen in AC. Shame that he only has two games thats hes in, and that all the other AC are mostly different Assassin's. A must buy game, worth it.			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations is, in my opinion, the best AC game of all time, the gameplay is extremely fun, and most importantly, you get the high jump back while climbing, one of my biggest problems with Brotherhood was that the high jump, something learned in 2, was removed,But was reintroduced into Revelations along with the extraordinary hookblade, another thing, ziplines, I absolutely loved using them, especially the zip line Assassination. When I finished the game I was extremely disappointed that it was over, I'll defenatly be replaying Revelations, as soon as I finish AC 1 and 3!			"

												This was quite a disappointing 28 hours all to the very end. This game took everything that Brotherhood established and made it many times worse. The storyline is very disjointed and much of what happens is poorly explained or simply does not make sense. The missions are also far fewer than in Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. There are also only a couple side missions, compared to the dozens I completed in the previous titles. Even the city itself, the only one, is tiny. In a few minutes I am on the other side and there is nothing interesting going on on the way. The ending was the worst, but of course I won't spoil it here. The gameplay is essentially the same as the previous game with the addition of zip lines, which are kinda cool, if you use them; situational events which happened to me only once in the course of the entire game and it was a dude who gave me 500 for moving a couple boxes; different enemies who act the same as in the previous titles, except for Janissaries who you can't kick, shove, hit or even counter as that hardly does anything. Another option is bombs, which is a nice addition but doesn't work for one simple reason. The user interface has stayed the same, with some minor graphical additions. This is a huge problem. Why? Simply becaue there are four hot keys and that isn't even enough for the main weapons. There is a main weapon, a smaller blade, a hidden blade, poisoned hidden blade, fists, crossbow, throwing knives, three types of bombs equipped at once, poison darts, money and I feel like I might still be missing something. This leaves you awkwardly going through your giant selection in the middle of a fight just to choose the right tool. Another issue is that the assassin looks even less like an assassin. Ezio is so loaded with weapons and armour, he can't help but look suspicious. This was not the idea of the original game and as far as I know the stealth aspect is here still.Ah yes graphichs. This is a game from 2011. I have seen absolutely wonderful graphical content in games from that time and two years later Tomb Raider came out which blew my brain out of my skull with how great everything looked at even medium. Revelations makes Constantinople look beautiful, but the characters look like manikins. There is hardly any life to them. They don't breathe, their hair is one blob plastered to their heads, the women's breasts never move, blood looks like a four year old's ketchup dream. I am glad they move somehow when they talk at least.Last category I wanted to touch on was stability. I have encounted numerous bugs. People stuck in roofs, missions needing to be restarted as the essential character disappeared, assassinations through walls, enemies seeing through walls, a permanent target in the south of the city which was some dancing guy. Do you know how annoying it is when you have an arrow pointing to some dancing guy for 20 hours? I tried fixing, it doesn't work. There were also many times when the sound was completely out of sync with the video.I just can't recommend this. I am done here.			"

												The original Assassin's Creed sucked balls due to sloppy controls but they fixed EVERYTHING in the 2nd game and made a pretty enjoyable title. Brotherhood, while short, continued the good parts of AC2 and gave us a bit more story. This game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing deceit and lies from Ubisoft. The name of this game makes it sound like the ♥♥♥♥ing final title in the series but instead (like Brotherhood) it is another 50 dollar ♥♥♥♥ing expansion pack that barely advances the story, and adds abunch of stuff to make the game boring and uninteresting.This game is literally just MORE OF THE SAME. It is identical to the previous two titles in everything from controls, feel, and graphics and nothing seems to have advanced. Well, I take that back. The graphics have gotten better as it seems they increased the LOD for the PC version, as well as giving us super sharp textures which are not seen on the console version. This is just a guess, but the game is the best looking in the series and definitely looks better than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console version. The graphics are not even the problem with the game as it is still pretty impressive with the size and detail of the cities that is present in this series. The problem is the same reason that Call of Duty sucks♥♥♥♥♥now. They are running the franchise into the ground by releasing MORE OF THE SAME, especially considering this is the 2nd ♥♥♥♥ing title of AC this year. So I don't have much to say about the gameplay as for the most part it is the same stuff that we have seen before. You mainly play as Ezio (with various Altair scenes) where you run, jump, chase, and assassinate targets based upon where the missions send you. The combat is largely the same with all the same weapons and one enemy attacking you at a time, then with the counter and kill system present. It literally controls exactly the same. The problem here is, there is nothing new that this game offers in terms of missions, combat or anything else. It does add more stuff to the game (like bombs, and the worst tower defense mini-game ever), but none of this really adds to the core gameplay and is really just extra side activities to have fun with (or not). The first major problem with this turd is that the missions have become incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing boring. They either have you doing the same that you did before in the previous two titles (which was the exact problem with the first ♥♥♥♥ing game, i.e. repetition). The missions are literally just the same thing as either following a target, finding an artifact, etc. There is nothing wrong with this as the core game itself is pretty fun especially if you liked the gameplay from the previous titles, the problem is just because we have ♥♥♥♥ing done this so many times before that it is starting to get stale, the game needs to have new ideas and variety in the missions. Something which we all know Ubisoft sucks♥♥♥♥♥at. Now they are also adding in abunch of convoluted♥♥♥♥♥♥that I don't really give two♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and a sack of balls about. The first thing is bombs, and crafting bombs. Ezio now can throw bombs and make different types for different purposes. There is nothing wrong with this element. It could have been a solid addition to the game, but the fact is I simply don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it because the game doesn't make you. It is just another side activity for Ezio to do. The game is getting TOO filled with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now you have buying shops, gaining money from the shops, upgrading armor, buying new weapons, repairing armor, collecting animus fragments, recruiting assassins, sending assassins out on missions, burning down towers to unlock areas, capturing guild dens, side quests, Mediterranean defense, and challenges. Now I'm not complaining that there is a lot of content in the game, the problem is none of it ♥♥♥♥ing matters to the main story in ANYWAY in the slightest. Buying shops and upgrading had a purpose to the story in AC2 as you were improving your hub city and helping yourself and your uncle. None of it has any ♥♥♥♥ing meaning in this game and is just there for the sake of being there, and it really makes it uninteresting and too cramped with♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't matter. I'm happy with most of it as it adds some content to the game, the problem is it didn't need any MORE♥♥♥♥♥♥on top of it, maybe just EVOLVED forms and more interesting forms of what was already there. Now bombs are added on top of this, and worst yet, the single ♥♥♥♥ing WORST tower defense game in the history of games. This game has such a terrible tower defense game that it makes my♥♥♥♥♥♥deflate and shrivel inside of my body. Whoever decided to put this into the game should be hanged in public and peed upon by everyone who purchased this game. After capturing a guild den, they become under conflict and you have to play a tower defense game placing units on the map and blockades to stop the Templar from reaching a certain port. The problem is it is so horrible balanced and utterly boring that it hurts the game rather than helps it. I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this tower defense♥♥♥♥♥♥and it needs to go. ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft. So I have to say just to clarify, the graphics are nice and the game is still the same kind of fun we have had before, just now becoming stale. The problem is, the story doesn't help. Big ♥♥♥♥ing questions were left at the end of AC2 and Brotherhood and they really added a sense to want you to keep playing. The story in this game does not. In fact, this game barely ♥♥♥♥ing advances the story AT ALL. Desmond is now stuck in the Animus for some reason and Ezio is trying to unlock the pieces to some door of Altair. That is it, the story doesn't really evolve beyond this or reveal anything more about the ancient race. All that you find out is that Ezio retires and knows Desmond is watching for some reason (they never explain how) and that some solar flare destroyed Earth and Desmond has to stop a second. A solar flare? That was the big secret? Another point which hurts and does not help the game. This game is fallen victim to what I call the Ubisoft Curse (can I trademark that♥♥♥♥♥♥). AC1 was moderately successful so Ubisoft put more work into and made AC2 which was a great game and it sold well. Now Ubisoft is putting the curse on the franchise and milking it ♥♥♥♥ing dry like they have done with all their series. They milked Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, and every other ♥♥♥♥ing series with 500 mediocre games that they rushed out the door simply to generate a quick buck. This was their LAST good series that they owned. AC2 was a damn good game, brotherhood continued the trend, but this one has fallen victim to the curse where they simply rushed another title with the AC name on it to make a quick ♥♥♥♥ing buck. It sucks because they are now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their last good series and we, the customers, are the ones getting ♥♥♥♥ed up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because we paid 50 bucks for this. Assassin's Creed 2 felt epic because you traveled all over Italy to multiple cities, and had a hub city from which you operated. It made the game feel large and epic in scale, as well as being the longest game in the series. Brotherhood and Revelations have begun killing this by only containing one city which stabs that feeling right in the back and confines you in a smaller area which is obviously faster to develop so they shove out more titles. The Ubisoft Curse begins.The series needs more time between sequels and more innovation as this title does not keep the fun and large scale feeling that AC2 has had and instead feels like a rushed title to make more money of the franchise by offering the exact same♥♥♥♥♥♥as before with a few new elements thrown on top. 6.5/10			"

												For experienced AC players.Good one.But it seems that this one has not been tested sufficiently for some new features not interesting enough,like the hookblade,without which those effects it takes can also be reached through other methods.Bomb part is a bit of unreasonable and boring for the uneasy aiming and occupation of the secondary weapon key,however there's a too large challenge system and glitches in data records of the bombs(I've contact UBI service executives,without an answers of correcting but suggesting that replaying).Some people may say that using bombs we can quickly deal with a big group of janissaries.But I prefer bare hands melee.Assassin recruit system are not improved but more inconvenient,recruits' weapon types are ""predictable“,but sometimes not,another glitch,maybe.The UI or maneuver system of Mediterranean arrangement of recruits are not easy to be used or noticed,for many players did not ""notice"" it and did not know of that there can be more than 12 recruits.Tower defense is a game,as a lone one.In the real gameplay,the tower defense comes to disturb the experiance of the players' in the beginning part of the game walkthrough.People are firstly annoyed with it.But after most of the game features experianced and completed,players really want to play more about the tower defense,but was told that:your assassin dens are managed by master assassin recruits,the templars can never get the chance to attack.If they really improve the tower defense system,I suggest that adding one option of it in some menu,like the Tyranny of King Washington in Assassin's Creed 3,with a gameplay like Plants vs. Zombies.

												The original Assassin's Creed sucked balls due to sloppy controls but they fixed EVERYTHING in the 2nd game and made a pretty enjoyable title. Brotherhood, while short, continued the good parts of AC2 and gave us a bit more story. This game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing deceit and lies from Ubisoft. The name of this game makes it sound like the ♥♥♥♥ing final title in the series but instead (like Brotherhood) it is another 50 dollar ♥♥♥♥ing expansion pack that barely advances the story, and adds abunch of stuff to make the game boring and uninteresting.This game is literally just MORE OF THE SAME. It is identical to the previous two titles in everything from controls, feel, and graphics and nothing seems to have advanced. Well, I take that back. The graphics have gotten better as it seems they increased the LOD for the PC version, as well as giving us super sharp textures which are not seen on the console version. This is just a guess, but the game is the best looking in the series and definitely looks better than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console version. The graphics are not even the problem with the game as it is still pretty impressive with the size and detail of the cities that is present in this series. The problem is the same reason that Call of Duty sucks♥♥♥♥♥now. They are running the franchise into the ground by releasing MORE OF THE SAME, especially considering this is the 2nd ♥♥♥♥ing title of AC this year. So I don't have much to say about the gameplay as for the most part it is the same stuff that we have seen before. You mainly play as Ezio (with various Altair scenes) where you run, jump, chase, and assassinate targets based upon where the missions send you. The combat is largely the same with all the same weapons and one enemy attacking you at a time, then with the counter and kill system present. It literally controls exactly the same. The problem here is, there is nothing new that this game offers in terms of missions, combat or anything else. It does add more stuff to the game (like bombs, and the worst tower defense mini-game ever), but none of this really adds to the core gameplay and is really just extra side activities to have fun with (or not). The first major problem with this turd is that the missions have become incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing boring. They either have you doing the same that you did before in the previous two titles (which was the exact problem with the first ♥♥♥♥ing game, i.e. repetition). The missions are literally just the same thing as either following a target, finding an artifact, etc. There is nothing wrong with this as the core game itself is pretty fun especially if you liked the gameplay from the previous titles, the problem is just because we have ♥♥♥♥ing done this so many times before that it is starting to get stale, the game needs to have new ideas and variety in the missions. Something which we all know Ubisoft sucks♥♥♥♥♥at. Now they are also adding in abunch of convoluted♥♥♥♥♥♥that I don't really give two♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and a sack of balls about. The first thing is bombs, and crafting bombs. Ezio now can throw bombs and make different types for different purposes. There is nothing wrong with this element. It could have been a solid addition to the game, but the fact is I simply don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it because the game doesn't make you. It is just another side activity for Ezio to do. The game is getting TOO filled with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now you have buying shops, gaining money from the shops, upgrading armor, buying new weapons, repairing armor, collecting animus fragments, recruiting assassins, sending assassins out on missions, burning down towers to unlock areas, capturing guild dens, side quests, Mediterranean defense, and challenges. Now I'm not complaining that there is a lot of content in the game, the problem is none of it ♥♥♥♥ing matters to the main story in ANYWAY in the slightest. Buying shops and upgrading had a purpose to the story in AC2 as you were improving your hub city and helping yourself and your uncle. None of it has any ♥♥♥♥ing meaning in this game and is just there for the sake of being there, and it really makes it uninteresting and too cramped with♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't matter. I'm happy with most of it as it adds some content to the game, the problem is it didn't need any MORE♥♥♥♥♥♥on top of it, maybe just EVOLVED forms and more interesting forms of what was already there. Now bombs are added on top of this, and worst yet, the single ♥♥♥♥ing WORST tower defense game in the history of games. This game has such a terrible tower defense game that it makes my♥♥♥♥♥♥deflate and shrivel inside of my body. Whoever decided to put this into the game should be hanged in public and peed upon by everyone who purchased this game. After capturing a guild den, they become under conflict and you have to play a tower defense game placing units on the map and blockades to stop the Templar from reaching a certain port. The problem is it is so horrible balanced and utterly boring that it hurts the game rather than helps it. I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this tower defense♥♥♥♥♥♥and it needs to go. ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft. So I have to say just to clarify, the graphics are nice and the game is still the same kind of fun we have had before, just now becoming stale. The problem is, the story doesn't help. Big ♥♥♥♥ing questions were left at the end of AC2 and Brotherhood and they really added a sense to want you to keep playing. The story in this game does not. In fact, this game barely ♥♥♥♥ing advances the story AT ALL. Desmond is now stuck in the Animus for some reason and Ezio is trying to unlock the pieces to some door of Altair. That is it, the story doesn't really evolve beyond this or reveal anything more about the ancient race. All that you find out is that Ezio retires and knows Desmond is watching for some reason (they never explain how) and that some solar flare destroyed Earth and Desmond has to stop a second. A solar flare? That was the big secret? Another point which hurts and does not help the game. This game is fallen victim to what I call the Ubisoft Curse (can I trademark that♥♥♥♥♥♥). AC1 was moderately successful so Ubisoft put more work into and made AC2 which was a great game and it sold well. Now Ubisoft is putting the curse on the franchise and milking it ♥♥♥♥ing dry like they have done with all their series. They milked Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, and every other ♥♥♥♥ing series with 500 mediocre games that they rushed out the door simply to generate a quick buck. This was their LAST good series that they owned. AC2 was a damn good game, brotherhood continued the trend, but this one has fallen victim to the curse where they simply rushed another title with the AC name on it to make a quick ♥♥♥♥ing buck. It sucks because they are now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their last good series and we, the customers, are the ones getting ♥♥♥♥ed up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because we paid 50 bucks for this. Assassin's Creed 2 felt epic because you traveled all over Italy to multiple cities, and had a hub city from which you operated. It made the game feel large and epic in scale, as well as being the longest game in the series. Brotherhood and Revelations have begun killing this by only containing one city which stabs that feeling right in the back and confines you in a smaller area which is obviously faster to develop so they shove out more titles. The Ubisoft Curse begins.The series needs more time between sequels and more innovation as this title does not keep the fun and large scale feeling that AC2 has had and instead feels like a rushed title to make more money of the franchise by offering the exact same♥♥♥♥♥♥as before with a few new elements thrown on top. 6.5/10			"

												I really LOVED AC2 and Brotherhood. I spent hours just watching the cities and landmarks, enjoying the cutscenes like a movie. Revelations had some big shoes to fill and I wasn t dissapointed. PROS- Istambul is as beautiful as Firenze, Rome or Venice, but in its own way so it does not get old.- Gameplay is already very proved and polished. Not too much to say about it, same old with a few tweaks.- Solid story and interesting NPCs help make some proved mechanics still fun to play. Even sidequests usually are connected with the main story. Ezzio is getting old. He gets tired, his back hurts and the young ladies don´t pay him the attention they used to. But even that is something he does with charm.- Tower Defense minigames are fun to play, but dont happen often (finished the game with two)CONS- A few too many weapons and tools that aren´t really useful: The crossbow made the knives obsolete; crafting bombs can be fun, but make no real difference; no real use for parachutes, handgun or poison.- Desmond missions are not fun at all.

												When I learned that we are going to play as Ezio again, I was confused – I thought, we had enough of him during two games. But, it concluded the game just perfectly (along with Embers it concludes Ezio’s story – from birth to death – what game character can boast such attention to his life?)So, everything good that was improved compared to the previous game(s):Bombs actually add more fun, the only bad thing is that because of them they had to change the puppeteering controls, which can be confusing a little bit. Several bombs are useful, but some of them were added just for the sake of having more possible variants. I do not get blood, skunk and money bomb. Used them only for completing challenges.Remembering Ezio’s words from the corresponding book, hookblade is exactly what he needed. It really helps traversing the city faster. Of course, it is unrealistic, but please... we are talking about the game where you land in a haystack.Mediterranean defence system was a major improvement from the previous part – adding the possibility of installing bureaus in occupied cities.Multiplayer got my favourite feature – Deathmatch. Nearly 95% of my playtime is played on small maps. But, there is also a degradation point – now all the characters have the same weapons, no more unique ones. It is axe, sword, mace, etc. Not like previous game (razor, prosthetic claw, compass, etc.). At least, in high profile they have unique animations.What I definitely didn’t like is that challenges didn’t change a bit since Brotherhood. I understand that not too many core gameplay elements were added, but some are practically identical.By all means, recommending this game. You must know how Ezio’s history concludes.			"

												Unnecessary cash-grab filler sequel. The good bits are an exact carbon copy of Brotherhood set in a slightly different but samey city. The few added mechanics are not worth it, sure now you can customize your own smoke poison bombs in a game that already has like 150 ways and weapons to kill things.The bad additions are a crappy tower defense mode which is just not fun, but fittingly the game treats it as a punishment. ""Hey, you've done too many bad things, now go and endure this horrible chore!"" The previous conspiracy puzzle bits have been replaced by annoying first-person puzzle platformer sections that try to be Portal but fail. They reward you with bits of Desmond mumbling throwaway facts about his childhood, yaay.The plot isn't meaningful at all, nothing really happens and I'm fairly sure you can just skip this game completely and none of the events will even be mentioned in the next one. There are some okayish flashbacks about Altaïr's time but if you're one of the few who are interested in the silly overarching plot (I am) just check them on Youtube and save like 15 hours of tedium.If for some reason after spending 60+ hours in the previous titles and having 100% completed them you are still not fed up with Ezio, sure, maybe then you can grab this one to do all of it again. Most people should really not bother. This would've been okay as an added DLC to Brotherhood that lasts a maximum of 5 hours, not a full game.			"

												Unless you care about Ezio, skip this game. Like AC: Brotherhood, this was Ubisoft's quick cash-in before AC3. Pros:+Same old AC+Combat is brutal and thoroughly enjoyable+Bomb crafting+Multiplayer is always fun!+Brings (some sort of) closure on Ezio's and Altair's story+Beautiful and gorgeous city of Galata+Plenty of collectables to keep you playing for a few more hoursCons:-Same old AC-The story....the ending sets up the story for AC3 but its ridiculous.-Ezio's story comes to an abrupt end and doesn't really feel like they finished anything unlike Atair's story where you find how he ended up.-The same bugs that have been plaguing the series are STILL here! Ezio will jump to his death or enemies will spawn right in front of you for cheap deaths.-Combat feels repetitive with no real depth. The kills aren't all that different for each weapon either.-The best part of the game is when you go to find the Masyaf keys in the crypts BUT there are only 5. That's way too few compared to AC: Brotherhood.-Desmond's Journey side missions are so boring. It's a nice puzzle mission but it is way too simple.My overall opinion: While this is a decent addition to the franchise, this game was an obvious attempt to milk money out of loyal fans. You can go into AC3 skipping both Brotherhood and Revelations as both aren't important to the story. If you wanted more AC and want to try this out then go ahead. Just don't expect the next best thing. I give this game 7 Masyaf Keys out of 10.			"

												The finisher to Ezio's era of Assassin's Creed, Revealations is a step backwards from previous games. It is clear that the developers are out of ideas and have no idea how to progress the series foward after switching to the CoD style yearly release.Whereas in the previous games, Brotherhood, factions such as the mercenaries or thieves would have multiple side quest missions with their own rewards, Revelations only has 1 mission for the mercenaries and the Romani. The story itself lacks any clear enemy in your search for 5 keys that contains a diary from Altair, and the main quest line (really, the only quest line) can be completed within 20 hours. There are insights to what happens to Altair after the first game but it's better to save your money and look up spoilers of the game than to play through this snoozer.			"

The begining is ok, an old Ezio, a new city, new assassin friends, a new hook blade, more parkour skills, it sounds good. Then I reach the mission ""ON THE DEFENSE"" and I hate this f*** tower defense part of the game with all of my forces. WTF how they put this in the game? It sucks a lot, boring a lot, frustating a lot. If they put it as optional missions, even that I like to do all the missions in the game, it could be ok for me if its possible to skip these f***** parts, but not, it is part of main history, I can't skip this. It sucks a lot.I definitively hate this tower defense part of the game, thinking about stop playing and go play other game. "

												I'm not sure if I should recommend this game. This game has some major advantages: the combat system is intact, additionally you get the (absolutely amazing) hook blade and bomb making system. Some characters are very interesting, like Prince Suleiman and Sofia. Music is brilliant, especially the main AC Theme that plays in the main menu. Also, Istanbul and Cappadocia are marvelous locations and are fun to explore. Unfortunately, the drawbacks are probably too big. Storyline starts interesting, but then gets very predictible and not very... revealing. And if you like Altair, then you would probably not like scenes with him and ending at all. The whole ending sequence is just very dull and unimaginative. The whole game just feels like it was built on something great, but actually managed to turn it into something boring. Also, just a warning: Ezio's face looks very very very old and Desmond's face looks nothing like Desmond. I also played AC3 and I must say, both those games have issues with faces, which just look very altered and unfamiliar. In the end, though the game has some great points, I would not recommend playing it, nor AC3 and not even AC4. If you really love this franchise, like I do, and not have a major let-down, I would strongly suggest to finish it with AC:Brotherhood.			"

												This is by far the worst game made for the assassins creed series in my opinion. I don't know what made this game so boring for me but the game was painful to finish ( I finished the game only because I bought it and wanted to see the end of the ezio storyline ).The game is boring in two aspects : the soundtrack and the story - every time I played this game I almost fall asleep from boredom - speaking seriously here.Your character is old in this game and thats also makes the game feel old and boring.The combat and sneak system is good but still not worth playing this game.In addition I didn't like the cities in this game and how they looked in contrary to all the other games.Would recommend this for people with problems at sleeping, you can just play this game for an hour and you are good to go.My score: 5/10P.S :Buy this if you are one of the people who want to know how ezio story ends but you should probably wait for sale.

												I've had terrible problems with this game that I blame on Ubisoft's online DRM.  Initially I couldn't play the game for a week because I couldn't get the launcher to work.  Eventually I got it working and it was fun for a while.Now after 20+ hours of gameplay, the game crashed no problem usually right, just load the latest save point.  Not this time... the game doesn't see any of my save files anymore.  It just offers to create a new game when I try to start single player.  I've tried restoring the files from a backup to no avail.  Ubisoft's online save sync service doesn't seem to do anything either; it makes no difference if I turn it on or off still can't find my saves.For this (and all Ubi games), make sure you turn off their save-sync system.

												I would recommend not purchasing Revelations it provides meagre improvements over Brotherhood and only exists to milk customers for their money. There is no big reveal as the title implies and the storyline is barely continued but only for altair, Desmond gets his own filler arc and Ezio's storyline actually ends up being a waste of time as nothing Ezio did has any importance for his storyline but is only used to introduce the parallel Altair storyline. Even worse Brotherhood ends in a major cliffhanger which is promptly mentioned sometime in the beginning for a minute and promptly ignored for the rest of the game. I feel as though Ubisoft ripped me off with this title and acted unfatithfully and unethically towards customers, I was deeply entrenched with the storyline of all the Assassin creed games up unitl this point.

*sigh* Where do I start? Short story: Just go replay Brotherhood and watch the important cutscenes for Revelations online.Long story: This game adds nothing new or worthwhile to the franchise. Sure there are a few new mechanics, like assassin training and custom bomb creation, but I feel like those are just minor tweaks to the Brotherhood formula. Even though those were somewhat useful, they still added a bunch stuff that wasn't, like the tower defense sequences, don't even get me started on the tower defense sequences. It's like ordering an ice cream sundae, something you know and love, and the server tells you that you're getting the ""new and improved"" sundae that's totally better then the regular old sundae. So you give it a shot and from the outside it looks like they just added a couple sprinkles on top and called it ""new"", but then you dig in and realize there's Brussels sprouts in it. Now don't get me wrong, some people like Brussels sprouts(including me), it can be good if it's prepared properly. but they do not belong in ice cream, let alone a sundae.Revelations also drags out Ezio's story making it longer than it needed to be, and they left out one of his most memorable and important moments, his death. No, no, no, they reserved that for an animated short for a spin-off game. I love Ezio's character, he's a badass, but let's be honest, we all know he needs to die at some point in order for Desmond's story to exist. Revelations could've had a beautiful beginning and end; as we followed his beginnings, we also see his end. I feel like that was stolen from us.I had high hopes for Revelations, but unfortunately it did not deliver. What it did deliver is a boring and mediocre addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise. I want to restore hope in the franchise, hopefully it's not too late for me. I heard 3 wasn't that bad, and the spin-off games have pretty decent reviews. Who knows. One thing I do know, is that I won't be replaying this installment anytime soon. SKIP IT. "

												The game itself is a blast. I played Brotherhood and AC2 and those were some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game. This continues the trend; parkour, thrilling swordfights, a dashing Italian protagonist: What more could you ask for? Well. The reason I'm giving this a downvote, and the reason I deleted it from my hard drive, is because the game will not run unless you create an account on Ubisoft's own app, Uplay. Aside from the fact that Uplay has so far proven to be clunky, buggy, and unappealing, I resent on general principle having to register AGAIN to prove ownership of a game I have ALREADY LEGALLY PURCHASED from Steam. In the age of ever-increasing piracy, companies can either place trust in their user base or not, treat them like customers or potential criminals. Ubisoft seems to prefer to treat players as potential pirates, and insists that I place this useless bloatware on my computer. So if you really want to play Assassin's Creed: Revelations, go ahead; it's a great game and it might well be worth it to play all the way through. I wouldn't know. I unfortunately also bought other Assassin's Creed titles during the same Steam sale where I purchased this one--however, I will not be buying another one, and I will urge others to do the same. Because I shouldn't have to spend an hour wrestling with a third-party app to play a game I already own.  "

												would not recommend. If you are an altair fan, DEFINITELY would not recommend. Very very poor story. Chapter 8 shouldn't even be there, feels like a space filler. The ending is crap (if you actually buy this nonsense be prepared for something similar to the end of assassins creed 2). The worst part of the game to me was the 5 gates where you could get to see desmonds past. Utter crap. Really boring, really badly told. This has got to be the smallest city they've ever made, too. It's rediculously small. You spend most of the time as Ezio, by the way, and only get to see altair 6 times for around 5 - 10 minutes each. Shortest game so far in the series, yet for some reason more expensive then the games before it, which were much better. In short, don't play this game. For those who wish to skip this game and go to 3, here is the story line in a nutshell. Spoilers. the world will end soon and you have to find out how to stop it. Yes, that's the whole thing. Yes, that was all in the last 5 minutes of gameplay. Yes, this game has a terrible story (find 5 keys. Whoopie!!).			"

Ubisoft ringing out the last few pennies it could from Ezio's character.If you're a die hard fan of the series and want all the AssCreed action you can get your mits on, then you owe it to yourself to check it out of course. But if you're looking for an introduction to the series, try one of the other instalations instead.			"

												Definitely the worst since the first.  The gameplay is essentially the same as ""Brotherhood,"" except for a few mini-games here or there which seem more like diversions than anything meaty (the new tower defense game is especially half-baked).  It's nice to see the conclusions to Altair's and Ezio's stories, I guess, but I was never that attached to them in the first place and the new plotlines involving political intrigue in Constantinople really aren't that interesting.  What's left, I guess, are the promised ""revelations,"" which are nil and mostly just reiterate stuff we already know about the game's silly, convoluted, sci-fi/templar/apocalyptic mythology.So why do I keep playing these games if I obviously complain them so much?  I don't know, honestly, as it's certainly not the plot.  I think the core game element of free-running through beautifully designed historic cities is novel enough that it keeps me coming back.  It's like causing havoc in a digital museum.  Plus, I don't think it's pointed out enough, but these games have unusually gorgeous costume design for a video game.  I could just wander around staring at the clothes extras are wearing for hours.Honestly, though, you could probably skip both ""Brotherhood"" and ""Revelations"" and not miss much.  Here's hoping AC3 is the shot of adrenaline this once good series desperately needs.			"

												The fact that as many as 7 Ubisoft Studios have been working on this game, makes the fact that this is the worst game in the series even harder to bear.The story is great, but the game has been dumped down in every other way. The Virtual Trainings has been replaced by short tutorials on how to throw a knife or a bomb... The horses are completely non-existent, except for some horses pulling carriages in specific interactive cutscenes. The right hand hidden blade has been replaced by a so called ""Hook Blade"" that replaces the Leap Jump. Basically, the Hook Blade works like Leap Jump, but allows you to reach longer. However, you can only do it where the Hook Blade is able to reach, and no longer whereever you want. This removes the ability to jump straight up, and then reach your arms to a side to grab a ledge.They've added a new type of enemy that cannot be killed, except with counters. And they attack once in ten years, so you become extremely frustrated fast.Continued in comments			"

												Not a very memorable Assassin's Creed addition...In my opinion, the series started to fall apart with Brotherhood, and has only declined since then, with minor improvements. The story is relatively dumbed down and a lot less interesting than the first one or especially 2 (even Brotherhood managed to resurrect some of the interest of the first two). Considering all of that, it's still relatively fun, but there's nothing new here besides the lackluster battle sequences where you basically play tower defense with Templar Dota 2 Creeps...I will be honest that I haven't played the whole thing, but it really lost me when I saw how the story has really declined into Assassin's = good and Templars = bad, oh and Ezio is tougher than Chuck Norris on stilts and steroids. 6/10.

												I didn't like this game. The whole Assassins Creed series seems more and more pointless to me. The story has really turned for a worse since the ending of Assassins Creed II, now it's just ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" kind of crap. In other words: they nuked the fridge in the past and they try to do it again and again. The micro story (Ezio in Istanbul) is really flat, the meta story (Desmond and the connections of it all) is waaaay to silly/boring/meh.But the overall game could be good nonetheless IF the game weren't that incredibly easy. I mean Assassins Creed 1 was easy (counter killing most enemies, ...), Assassins Creed 2 was easy BUT had some fiercer enemies (with polearms and♥♥♥♥♥♥, Assassins Creed Brotherhood took a turn for the worse (""If you hit me, I'm gonna call my AC brothers to whoop you♥♥♥♥♥"") and in this game, you have this and that and bombs and superior armor and many healing potions, and even when you get down to zero health, you only get a warning ""You might die, heal quickly!"", but you don't die: you still can take 2 more swings by a blade before you really get desynched. And rifles... you get shot, and you only lose 2 to 3 health points? After that amount of time the AI rifleman needs to aim and really shoot at you it should take at least 50% of your health. There are even some pistol wielding guards who ""want"" to shoot you in close combat/melee range: they aim at least 3 seconds before they shoot... they could touch you with their pistol tip but hey, better aim that thing before popping it!The easiness isn't all: that game has only one real assassination, where you have to sneak up onto your target. All the other missions are run there, go there, get that, buy that, pick some flowers or climb a tower to look for a book... very meaningless, boring tasks, oddly disconnected from the story line. There was only one missions which I found to be enjoyable. And I enjoyed a lot of the missions / riddles in AC 1 and 2.			"

												As the title suggests, it's reviling the stories of the 3 protagonists we had since the beginning: Desmond Miles, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad & Ezio Auditore da Firenze, now in his 50s… It’s mainly continuing from where things left off in AC Brotherhood, but they added bomb crafting and a hook blade. Should be all right then right?Not so much: I use a controller and the command which used to be for calling your followers is now the same as the one for lowering yourself from a ledge. Long answer short: What the ****! Who thought that was a good idea?! Most bombs are useless, so you’ll find what really works for you and you’ll stick with it. The parachutes are a nice addition, but why are they deleted on random when picking up Altäir’s story? Horse cart sections are frustrating, I really don't have a clue why they are there. Desmond’s story is by far the most frustrating: First person platforming with generating walkways. Enough said. The story mode is still good I’ll give it that, but the Janissaries are too unbalanced, they will stun lock you with attacks when you are combatting them, and that isn’t fun.In all, the game Ubisoft sold is still unfinished… There are far more glitches in this game then in the others with some being quite major. How it had not got patched in 2 years ever since it was released and when I got it idk…If you really, really need to get it for the story mode: sure; the multiplayer I haven’t touched. But if I have to have an opinion: if you wanted a good way to end Ezio’s and Altäir’s story, this isn’t it.			"

												This was my least favorite of the Assassin's Creed titles. After the cliff hanger ending in the proceeding title, we should have recieved a better payoff in this installment. All of the other installments had an awesome back and forth between present day and the past... with two story lines moving forward in ways that amazingly come togehter. By contrast this game takes place pretty much entirely within Desmond's unconcious mind and the past. Sure, we still go back in time, Ezzio's story is unnecessarily extended, but very little happens to advance Desmond's story or move it beyond the previous installment. To put it another way, this games moved the Assassin Creed storyline about as far as the second Matrix movie moved that series along - which is to say, more of the same damn thing and a big to be continued at the end. If anything, the storyline was cheapened considerably by a backstory presented on these terrible surreal levels where you only hear people from Desmond's past talking while you try to get from one point on a surreal map to another.Desmond storyline changes from being young bartender kidnapped off the street by an evil corporation who he knows nothing about and forced into a machine that transports him back into a war between his ancestors and their sworn enemy - a war he knew nothing about and did not know he would become part of - to a guy who really, really should have seen all this coming and not been so confused or surprised when the templars eventually abducted him to use him for their evil purposes. Way to completely ruin the storyline of the first few titles. Unless I missed something when playing the first few titles, Desmond didn't know who Abstergo was initially, why they wanted him, knew nothing about the Assassins and temlpars, had no idea he was born into this war. In Revelations, we learn he grew up on a farm run by the modern day Assassins, was forced to train every day, and was told, repeatedly by his parents how he would oneday become a part of this battle. His parents even told him all about Abstergo and how evil and corrupt they were. He knew who they were, knew they were after him, and he was trained for 16 years by assassins... why did he even need the bleeding effect to gain the skills of an assassin... he was raised by assassins... and told he was an assassin... Is this not a gigantic plot hole?Moving along, there are unnecessary changes to the gameplay, again, which means you have to learn all over, again, the best way to fight. For me, this was the worst port to PC in terms of gameplay mechanics. In the preceeding titles, fighting was very fluid and natural whereas Revelations felt almost clumsy by comparison. There are several new components to the game, including a tower defense mode, which didn't really advance the game or make you feel like an assassin, as well mentoring and overseeing many new assasins. I actually enjoyed recruiting new assassins, but once you have them all you do with them is send them on missions to level them up and make you money and influence- missions you never really see or get to play - and they either succeed or fail which gives you more or less influence over cities you never really visit in person in the game... Victory can be ensured for each mission as long as you send your best recruits, which just makes this component of the game boring and tedious.Revelations took me less than 10 hours to complete the storyline and unltimately stop playing (and I like to take my time - compare this to the 39 hours I spent on AC:II, the 32 hours I spend on AC:Brotherhood, and the 22 hours I spent on AC. In terms keeping my attention and keeping me interested, this game just paled by comparison to the other games in the series. Add the awful backstory for Desmond and the sort of far fetched ""time to save the planet from solar destruction (not templars)"" and we end up with a dissapointing addition to the overally story.Even a bad assassins creed is still a good game, but I can't really say I recommend this one.

I give all assassins creed games a fair shot because I absolutely love the story and the game. But this one did feel like it was ripping off the first two and the story wasn't engaging for me.

Assassin's Creed: Revelations - Meeting Halfway Note that this review has spoilers for the Assassin's Creed series up to Assassin's Creed: Revelations, so read with caution and with a knowledge of the series up to this pointAssassin's Creed: Revelations, the 4th (not counting handheld spinoffs) title in the annual Killing History Simulator Simulator, promised two things: More Assassin's Creed gameplay in a different setting and the conclusion to the stories of both Ezio Auditore and Altair ibn-La'Ahad. While both of these things are factual things the game actually delievers on, ultimately the entry comes up short in many other aspects.The story picks up many years after the events of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, with the fall of the Cesare Borgias and with Assassin Master/Superspy Ezio Auditore hiding the Apple of Eden for Desmond to find in the future.  Four years later, Ezio finds one of five keys needed to unlock Altar's Library, sending him on a search for the rest in a tumultuous and violent Constantinople. While a solid (and very video gamey) set-up, what follows is unfortuantely shapeless and uninteresting, often hitting similar story and character beats from the previous two Assassin's Creed II games. Not to mention the Desmond timeline, which is padded out and only serves to set up conflict for the third game, without really saying much about Desmond or the supporting cast at all. The gameplay is bog standard Assassin's Creed. If one is unfamiliar with that, imagine trying to climb slowly up similar looking buildings and running around on rooftops avoiding guards with an increasingly convoluted and bloated set up moves that requires holding down one button in order access half of your movement abilities. One should also not expect stealth mechanics, becaue they are practically nonexistant. One must hide in shrubs and wagons and wells in order to avoid guard detection, but outside of a few areas in the game (in which a forced reset on being spot is used), combat is generally the best option. However, if one is expecting a deep weapons based combat system, prepare to be dissapointed by a system that is designed entirely around countering your enemies attacks. That's it. One simply counters attacks in order to be successful at combat.Revelations (as generic a subtitle as one can think of) is a victim of publishing tactic called Annual Release, in which a successful franchise is produced on a yearly schedule, often using the same art assists and minor gameplay additions, often leading to contrived plots and half baked gameplay mechanics. In this case there are two new mechanics: the first are through the form of bombs, in which Ezio can craft a multitude of them, only a handful of which are of any good use. The second is through a rather annoying tower defense mini game which appears if you're in too high of alert for too long of time. Fortunately, it's rather easy to avoid this mini game and a player only has to ever do it once, unless they don't pay enough attention to their alert status. It's also telling that neither of these mechanics or minigames found themselves in sequels.Unfortunately the game does end in a rather satisfying way, so if you have played every Assassin's Creed up to Revelations, it is worth playing through on that merit (but only if it's heavily discounted). Otherwise, one could easily skip this installment and jump straight from Brotherhood and on to Assassin's Creed III.Note that my playtime for the game is actually 10 hours longer, due to uplay not closing and counting my playtime. Note that this game also uses uplay. "

												Assassin's Creed was ambitious but boring as hell. Assassin's Creed II was a great game that fixed everything that was wrong with the first episode. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was ACII +. Now, what is AC: Revelations?First and foremost, it's the conclusion of Ezio's personnal adventures. I guess it is a matter of opinion, but 50-something Ezio neither has the charisma nor the appeal of the young italian annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he used to be. Oh, to be sure, he still slices and hammers moronic templars guards like there's no tomorrow. He stops a conspiracy that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever (what happened to the whole ""the Templars work for a precise objective"" from AC I?). But he's old, and feels old.That's probably also because the game feels old too: there's really nothing exciting in ACR. Sure, Constantinople is a nice city (though it's got nothing over Rome, in my humble opinion), but that's pretty much the only positive thing about ACR.The new gimmicks are either tedious (mediterranean defense is a more annoying version of ACB missions that requires you to spend dozens of minutes dispatching assassins to cities in Europe) or boring as hell (who came up with that tower defense idea? really?).Previous episodes tried to build upon Assassin's Creed's original foundations, and kept improving the game. ACR does no such thing. It's just a less-successful reskin of ACB. I haven't played the later AC games, but I suspect ACR is when Ubisoft got lazy, and decided their game was good enough to milk fans of the series once a year.			"

												If you want the exact same game just in a different time setting and one new feature then look no further, Assassin's Creed: Revelation is not only the same damn thing as Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood, but it's also an introduction to one of the worst multiplayer games you'll ever see! For the third ♥♥♥♥ing time, you play as Ezio Italianoli, a cunning old man who somehow can still fight flawlessley, the guy has gray hair and is jumping all over the damn place, tell me how that makes sense, Ubisoft. Another thing is the bomb crafting, spend countless numbers of hours searching for seemingly impossible brand named gunpowder to mix in to make some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥torm.

												After rating AC II and hoping for improvement over that desaster I realize my hopes were placed wrongly.1) ACR controls still suck (even if they are a little smoother) because Ezio still jumps illogically crazy or does not respond accordingly to the direction you're facing at; another thing is that there only is ONE freaking button for EVERY action move (talk, loot, grab, hide weapon, etc) which makes it difficult to pick the action you actually want to perform.2) The story is nothing special.3) ACR includes new features (e.g. Templars Dens) which can be nice but there are so many details which make one furious: since the aiming system does not work because it has not been ported adequately for PC you will have a tough time killing guys in the sheds. Also: Why the hell would you need to buy every single shop additionally after freeing a certain area of the Templars? Makes no sense to me. The list goes on and on but in the end I can't recommend this game either -.-			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelation adalah kisah Desmond yang pingsan & terjebak di dalam animus dan harus menyelesaikan ingatan Ezio untuk kembali sadar.Cerita (9/10)AC Revelation adalah penghubung akhir petualangan Ezio & Altair di masa tua mereka. Ezio pergi ke Masyaf untuk mencari rahasia Altair yang tersimpan dalam perpustakaan yang membutuhkan artifak untuk membukanya. Artifak tersebut ternyata disembunyikan Nicolo Polo (ayah Marco Polo) di Konstantinopel. AC Revelation juga menceritakan kisah Altair lebih detail dari AC I melalui artifak yang ditemukan Ezio. Cerita terbaik sepanjang seri AC menurut ane pribadi.Gameplay (8/10)Tidak ada perbedaan besar dari AC sebelumnya kecuali gaya melompat dalam parkour yang lebih luwes dan mudah. Selain itu ada trik menggunakan bom untuk membunuh dan mengalihkan perhatian.Grafis (8/10)Sisi grafis pun nyaris sama dengan AC Brotherhood, tidak ada efek baru yang ditambahkan. Ini menunjukkan kalau pembuatan AC Revelation benar2 berfokus pada cerita.			"

												Do not reccomend this game, for a couple reasons. This game was kinda pointless, seeing that Ezio was just searching and learning about Altaïr, which could have just been left as backstory/lore. Also quite boring, got very tired of it very quick, and I usually like the Assassin's Creed games.			"

												Assassin Creed that you are used to by now, but this is the point of the series that makes me mad. If you only like Assassin Creed for it's gameplay and dont care about the story, I would say you should pick this game up. I enjoyed the beginings of the series, where the first game had promise but was repetive and the second game (and brotherhood full price dlc) showed how this series can be interesting with continueing the ideas of the first game. Revelations is where I started to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the Assassin creed series as a whole. What really made me mad was retconning Altair as some Moses, deemed by an almight power to lead the Assassins completely undermind the whole purpose of the first game. Besides changing his voice to some typical low pitch grawl that is typical in all games today, Altair completely loses any sort of humbleness as everything he deems is now the spoken word of God. Any missions with him pained me the most, and I really wished they just kept it with Ezio. Ezio isnt as charming in this game like how he is in ACII but I can't hate Ezio, even if he didnt do anything too interesting in this game.			"

												Can't say I really cared for this game, you could not pay me any less than $1,000 to play it again(I am a college student, so my dignity is lower than usual). I was dragging my feet through the entire game, but I spent money on it so I made myself finish it. Don't bother with this one, but you should read up on the story line online. It does have a somewhat interesting story line, but the game is not worth the time and money.The one thing I did like that this game added was the hook, so you can jump farther and hook onto ziplines.

Ezio Auditore must leave his life behind in search of answers, In search of the truth.In Assassin’s Creed® Revelations, master assassin Ezio Auditore walks in the footsteps of the legendary mentor Altair, on a journey of discovery and revelation. It is a perilous path – one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region.In addition to Ezio’s award-winning story, a refined and expanded online multiplayer experience returns with more modes, more maps and more characters, allowing you to test your assassin skills against others from around the world.

												Almost as bad as Assassin's Creed 1.Now, I'm not saying it's like complete trash, there's still a storyline with this game, but as I have mentioned in Assassin's Creed 1 Review, I'd rather have watched a Synopsis video than waste my time with Ezio's end. I was hoping for an epic adventure, a big bang per say when I ended, I did not in any way, shape, or form, thought that this was the case with Revelations. (Hell I don't understand why the 7 people that downvoted this review got anything out of this game O.o)The only cool thing was the hook, amirite? I'm sure everyone (the higher population of people thinking this game blew, when I'm saying everyone) can all agree that this was the only redeeming factor, other than that, you wished you could just watch like a 1 hour movie and hoped that you could train the Chinese girl for DLC like AC Freedom Cry, but it'd be of course a name related to the Chinese Era in which Shao Jun is the main character.Sure, there was a Tower Defense like mini-game but I didn't feel... Assassiny? I mean, a group of men are REALLY going to keep going down the same road seeing countless of their own men dead knowing there's been Assassin's roaming around the area, I don't think so.

												Revelations is one of the worst titles in the series. The area control aspect is extremely repetitive and uninspired compared to what Brotherhood had to offer. Every ""tower"" can be tackled with the same strategy (they lack design) and the areas are extremely similar. They removed the brilliant stealth missions on separate maps, which were one of the best things in Brotherhood. Optional mission objectives (""full sync"") were added arbitrarily without much sense of design. Istanbul was a large city I guess, but it seemed too flat and uneventful compared with Rome.			"

												Like all the past versions of Assassins Creed on PC, this one suffers from dropped support, leaving the game broken in some ways, glitched in others.   This game is abandonware, no more updates with no further support on PC.  There is a news crawl on the bottom that is so out of date there is even a tip that reminds us to preorder AC3 and get all the great preorder bonuses!!!!  This game started out good by giving players a hook to reach higher places, then it went downhill fast.  This is by far the WORST assassins creed game EVER made.  Many of the buildings in the game you cant climb there is nothing there, just a big blank space.  While the controls are as bad as every other PC version, making it so buildings are harder to climb while making the average building much taller this time around 4 stories is a huge pain for navigating the city, especially the fact its broken up into 2 parts.  Taking place in a third world country it has no horses for whatever reason even though there are multiple scenes with carriage chases.  Some of the challenges are almost broken, the Bomb Challenge set 2, rather than get fixed in the last patch got all bugged up.  The bomb challenges are completable by making bombs at the quick station then making them in your inventory.  Took like twenty times of doing it for it to pop, but just keep doing it one by one, and you will get past that menace of a problem.  For a story you have the end of the Enzio trilogy, so sad to see him go.  There is even a wonderful romance including a picnic for the two lovers in a graveyard.  The time trials are crap, just mirrors edge wannabe clones.  Other parts where you play as Desmond they actually found a way to make more annoying by making it an fps platforming part where you move blocks around, as dumb as that sounds its that stupid to play.Rating:  0/10  Value:  4.99			"

												Nobody plays multiplayer anymore but the level 50 players, making it unfair to anyone who just bought the game, the single player campaign is bugged beyond playability, a convoluted storyline that tries too hard to confuse you, and it's nearly impossible to get the multiplayer to work due to the Ubisoft server issues. Not to mention the god-awful Uplay stuff that comes with it. Honestly, if you've played the first two Assassin's Creed games, you aren't missing anything in any of the recent ones.			"

Only thing I had an issue with, the controls, they were so well laid out on the last game, in this one everything was configured in an odd manner for a keyboard and mouse layout, I had to reconfigure everything, to match the last game, and there were still a few controls that used to cover a couple of actions, that were separated for some reason.

												See my previous Assassin's Creed reccomendations.  Combat is boring less bosses (targets) than previous iterations, bosses are no different than normal soldiers, many pointless sidequests, more options but no real reason to use one over another.  Less interesting dungeon zones in this one, some minor perks to doing challenges, but really this game is no different than any of the previous games, mechanics wise.  Climbing is less frustrating but that's just polish of the mechanic present in the last three games.The story was never all that amazing in these games, and this one reveals essentially nothing towards the overall arching story in the name of making more sequels.  Overall, pretty much nothing interesting happened here and everything was forgettable.  Considering its supposed to be the end of Ezio's story, they could've done better  Again, welcome to sequels.Multiplayer is enjoyable with some caveats, but it will probably die now that AC3 has been released.

Almost immediately, I began to miss the beauty and majesty of italy; I even missed the underground sections in the Followers of Romulus sections. I slowly lost the desire to touch the game again, and it will probably never be touched a second time. It is condemned to an enternal purgatory, from which I shall never lift it.Cheers!-Camolot			"

												Hardly any improvement over the previous games. The awesome parkour and climbing mechanics are still there, and so is the horrible combat system. Controls are still a bit clunky (i.e. shift picks up a body instead of climbing down, daaaamn).What's new and sucks:Bombs. Complicated and useless. Haven't used them, my silent assassin is no terrorist :)Pointless assassin management and their missions. About as much fun as a football management simulator. A bad one.Tower defense missions. Again, it's a bad minigame that adds nothing to the main game.Too many collectibles. I'm a completionist who likes collecting these things but in this game there are so many of them I've lost all interest.Loot. Virtually everything you find or buy (except meds and ammo) is completely useless. What's new and good:Desmond's first person platforming missions. Yes I said that! Everyone hated them, I loved them. Original mechanics, good controls and nice atmosphere.The last three chapters. The story was wrapped up for both Ezio and Altair in a satisfying way. "

												This game is basically more of the same. This is what I said about Brotherhood, but even more so. The game was entertaining and I damn enjoyed my time with it. The bit where the underground city lights on fire was awesome, but I'm left thinking that the game was pretty standard. It didn't seem like a sequel to Assassin's Creed II. It seemed more like a continuation of Brotherhood. The name is dumb too. Hollywood and the AAA video game industry thinks that putting some dumb word on the end makes it sound cooler. NO! NO! Brotherhood made sense, because of the brotherhood of assassins. Black Flag makes sense on account of it being a pirate adventure. Revelations is dumb. Of course there's a revelation. Almost every story has revelations!Anyway, this one takes place in Constantinople, not Italy (among other places) and adds some new weapons. The renovation and customization elements are lessened thankfully, but they are replaced with other stupid sh*t. Thankfully all of it was optional, so I took the option of not doing it. I have not played Unity yet, but within the Assassin's Creed games I have played (1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3 and 4) this one is probably the weakest. Ezio at this point is kind of tired. On account of his old age and the fact that we've spend 90 hours with him at this point. It's alright if you're a fan of the series, such as myself (shocking I know), but if you're not following it closely this is one to miss. If you are then you should pick it up to keep up on the story. It's OK.			"

They have tried to make the game more fresh with different mechanics but it doesn't work. This game is just an excuse to tie up loose ends in a story people are becomming disintrested with.I only bought it for the story, Game play is ok, and this is CLEARLY a console port.And WTH is with Desmonds little ""Tetris"" adventure.And as for the Multiplayer I quote: ""'I've got nothing against multiplayer as a concept, but you shouldn't try to make it carry a game because there are logistical problems.""

It has very good qualities that don't appear in Assassin's Creed III (yes i played it in the wrong order)I won't spoil the revelation to those who read this and didn't play yet but it is a beautiful feature to the storyline and i think it completes the game very well. As I said the storyline is very interesting and beautiful if you think about it.My opinion on games is story > gameplay > graphics and i think this game fits really wel in this category.			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations is the 3rd entry into the Ezio saga and again sees Ezio, an exiled Florentine noble thrust into a world of deep intrigue, this time in Istanbul/Constantinople with a plot between Sultan and Basileus with a helping hand from his Eastern assassin brothers.The plot is of course split between present day Desmond Miles and the fun portions of the game. Yes, Desmond is a silly mechanic but they've gone this far so they may as well finish it.The Turk assassins teach Ezio the ways of the Hook-Blade, allowing him to rapidly climb tall structures and use ziplines seamlessly. This contributed to the traversal in Revelations being the best in the series at the time of release.The in-animus story is good, the gameplay is the same fantastic beast that the series always delivers and the Hook-Blade really introduces a fun kick to the formula, would I recommend this game to a friend? Absolutely.			"

												This is what I was expecting when I played Brotherhood. A call back to the first game, a decent look at the theme of aging with relation to the protagonist, and a sense of progress for the series. Unfortunately since Brotherhood was lacking these important qualities but brought everything else to the table, Revelations comes across as a retread which is a shame.Thankfully, this game puts the story of Ezio and Altair to a satisfying conclusion and even manages to develop the character of Desmond Miles somewhat. At the very least, the game has set itself up for a solid arc in the third game.Multiplayer here is...hard to discuss. On one hand, significant improvements have been made to the mechanics of how abilities and movement works in this game but  the game glitches a worrying amount of time. Additionally, the contract system is poorly designed, for example: I once recieved the 1st place player (I was his only pursuer) but I recieved three pursuers while I was ranked 4th or 6th.			"

												7 out of 10 Another Assassins Creed episode.  This one sees Etzio Auditore travel to Istanbul to recover keys.  The keys will unlock Altair's library.  As always you are Desmond Miles reliving history captured in his genes. In short if you liked previous Assassins Creed episodes then you will like this one.  There is a lot to like but also a lot to hate intensely.  It really feels like this game could have been so much better. The good: 1. For the first time I actually liked Etzio as character.  In fact all characters are quite likeable except Desmond who continues to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2. In general stuff to do, unlock, collect and missions. The bad: 3. Istanbul is a sad destination compared to colorful Italy before. 4. You constantly have to send your assassin allies to take on missions in foreign cities.  It becomes quite a pain to constantly search for a pigeon loft. 5. Control training is not available on command.  If you are lucky you can catch a specific type of training while the game loads. 6. Very little about the story behind the story.  Also no Abstergo puzzles, a highlight for me in previous games. 7. The game was too long to keep my attention. The ugly: 8. Unfortunately like previous Assassins Creed episodes, combat is pathetic.  I attack a highlighted enemy however Etzio/Altair would rather attack my ally next to the enemy.  Also if an ally stands next to an enemy when you passionate him your ally will be caught in a double assignation.  9. The new ""history"" garbage played out in 1st person mode.  What twaddle is this?  Only for masochists. 10. Screen flashing the PC desktop.			"

The ending is absolutely perfect, creative and touching!Game runs smoothly of my PC and looks better than AC3 and Black Flag withot high tech requirement!MINUS: The game doesn't improve anything nor does it add fresh things, but it doesn't have to. It continues the saga and give a perfect finish to the story of previous AC games. "

												Despite enjoying the franchise up to now (especially 2 and Brotherhood), I came into AC:R with low expectations due to a lot the media claiming it was probably the worst in the series so far. That might actually be true, but this is still a good Assassin's Creed game that should satisfy fans of the series. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to be the high mark of the series, because it's not. It also doesn't really live up to its name, as the story is still every bit as convoluted as it was before this entry. That said, if you've enjoyed all the AC offerings up to this point, you'll likely enjoy this one as well.			"

												Its AC. Recruit, assinate. lead, fight. Whats not to like. It has its flaws but combat is satisfying and fun. Start a fight, take their weapon and beat them to death with it,drop it, then on to the next. Oddly satisfying listening to the crowds OOOOOO's and AWWWWW""s when you get the good shot in.The game doesnt have the annoying climb/jump puzzles of AC2Looks great. Runs smooth on my 7yr old system with a GTX650 1gb card.  If you are an AC fan definatly pick this one up. Got mine on sale at a  bargin price. Even better. Only one question. WTF is the Animus for? Its my third AC game 2,3 and revelations and i still dont know WTF its for. Accessing memories I know. What happened someone loose their car keys? Something about Templars and a shiney apple. Yada yada yada. Why cant it just be a game about Assanins fighting the Templars. Why add silly conspiricy stuff that absolutely impossible. Templars today? Running the World? Impossible. "

												They improved the keyboard controls. The chosen country is less enchanting than Italy, but the storyline counterbalance well enough.They wonderfully threaded the stories of Desmond and Ezio. I've played twice because it's so good.

												First of all I just want to say one thing. THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN THE SERIES, it's way to short and not as nearly as good brotherhood and 2 but if you really love assassin's creed and played 2 and brotherhood  and want to finish ezio's story then by all means get it and play it (my favorite thing about the game is the hookblade how didn't it carry over into the rest of the series.

												I can't recommend this game. The story is good and all, but the combat makes it next to impossible to to anything significant outside of the main story. Not all the fighting was bad, but the inability to dodge or counter the attacks of certain enemies, combined with not being able to run or climb during combat (making it next to impossible to escape), ruined it.The control sceme was shifty. Some of the actions the game says you can do with certain keys are not possible. Furthermore, the jumping and climbing as weird. Sometimes when you are trying to climb up a wall, you will just jump backwards. And when trying to jump off roofs, Ezio will stumble at the edge several times before you actually jump. This makes getting down to the ground in a hurry pretty much undoableYou would probably enjoy this game if the freerome and free combat (meaning you can pick a reasonable fight with most guards) and the combat-oriented side activities of the other titles in the franchise were not something you found yourself enjoying, unlike me.

												I want to like this game but I simply cannot because the controls are an absolute horrible mess.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Fantastic story and cutscenes- Great voice actingCons:- The controls are an absolute nightmare. I try to climb something and end up doing a jump off it instead (a shove) which either severely hurts me or I fall to my death- Weapon selection is unintuitive. It took me awhile to figure out how to assign a secondary weapon - shouldn't be that difficult- There's no real storyline per se and sometimes you're left standing there with no clue of what to do next as the instructions are either lacking or unclear- Too many cutscenes and character narration- Can't skip cutscenes- UPLAYBottom line - It seems like the developers spent more time on looks than gameplay. Even if you can get this dirt cheap on sale I would avoid it. It's not enjoyable if you can't bloody play it properly, despite how amazing it looks. "

												Mixed feelings here. This title brings some of the problems of its predecessors, like camera issues. Many times the camera turns to angles that causes more trouble than solutions. This makes the game boring.Besides that, this is the least challenging AC until it. Things only go wrong when flaws happen (like npcs making wrong moves or getting stuck and game controls or camera angles changing at wrong times).However, they did very nice in the game new content, like the ""tower defense"" mini game.But not everything that was added is meaningful. Like the bombs. Even though they may be cool, I simply did not find proper use for them in the game (used only when the game obliged me). At the same time, the chests (already strange in the past game) got even more odd. Well, why there are chests around the city and no one cares?. I know, every game has this kind of things, but it just seemed to me too out of context.In the end, the history is nice, and it fills an important gap in the series. I liked the lore and I think they did well in adding more facts and topics in the extra anymus mode.7/10			"

												It has a good story line, and closes the chapter involving Ezio (which I think is a shame, since it doesn't show what happened to the rest of the family), it was kind of short though compared to brotherhood.  Only thing I had an issue with, the controls, they were so well laid out on the last game, in this one everything was configured in an odd manner for a keyboard and mouse layout, I had to reconfigure everything, to match the last game, and there were still a few controls that used to cover a couple of actions, that were separated for some reason.

												Pretty much Brotherhood with more bombs.I got it on sale for five bucks so I don't really mind.  The combat is more or less the same but with more gory killmoves. Overall, I find the game way too easy and there's all this extra stuff thrown in but I never wound up using any of it because it's always easier to just stab everyone than to attempt any stealth or diversion tactics.The story kinda straight up sucks. It's over before it really begins and I didn't really even care when (no spoilers) one of the plot essential characters died near the end of the game because he only appeared for like a half hour of screentime total. It was also somewhat hard to follow, and I didn't feel like any of it really mattered to Ezio's goal. On the bright side, Altair's story (what little of it there was) was great, though I was somewhat let down by the fact that Altair never wears the armor he made (the invincible armor from AC2).The map is very bland as well. It's nothing but building after building with a river separating 1/5 of the map from everything else.I'd recommend this game only if it's on sale, your first assassin's creed, or if you just want to finish Ezio's and/or Altair's story. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.			"

Campy story, glitchy cutscenes, self-indulgent grandeur... it's all here along with the classic stealth and free-running action. Some big plot arcs finally get wrapped up, but for the most part the plot seems to crawl, and the game ends on yet another cliffhanger. The new bomb system is actually well implemented and surprisingly useful, but otherwise combat is pretty much the same.

												Assassins Creed Revelations review!HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ What an awesome game. I went straight from AC:Brotherhood to revelations and was dying to know how it all wraps up. Ezio's journey from first becoming an assassin in ACII all the way to the end is incredible. He's a phenomenal character in gaming and should be up there with some of the greats. His character and personality shines through unwavering till the end. I felt like I was actually Ezio in all the various locations in which this game is set, having to follow his tale through to completion. If you have ACII - AC:Revelations, I highly suggest putting away some time to play this great trilogy. Whatever your thoughts on Ubisoft are, they nail these three games and should have just stopped there. (More on that later.)SO, combat is obviously a major part of the gameplay here, and since AC:B they refined it even more. The combos are even more satisfying when dealing with multiple enemies, the executions are even more gratuitous, and the connectivity between between targets is so much smoother. It really feels like you're total badass. It's awesome. With different weapons there's a big difference in how combos and executions are... executed. Timing is key, as heavy weapons vs daggers vs hidden blades vs bombs vs projectiles are all extremely varied in how one must play, and win a fight. Ezio's style also comes into play since introduction in ACII, as he's now an experienced killing machine in AC:Revelations. His smooth, graceful style from ACII by the end becomes an unstoppable force of blades and death dealing in his later years. As usual, the voice acting is killer as well as the dialogue itself. These games, especially AC:R are so meticulously scripted it actually feels like these are real people behaving as people do. 10/10 for all that. Also the random NPC's interactions while running through the streets or climbing buildings are spot on and really ad to the overall ambiance of the game.OK, on to the annoying stuff. Every time you renovate a shop, you're stuck there for about 10-15 seconds while the building animation happens. Since there are about 150 shops, there's a lot of renovating to be had. There's also a LOT of unnecessary animations just to press ESC or TAB to view the map. I'd say a good 2 hours from my play time in AC:R is just animations from renovating a shop or viewing the map animations. Also every time you interact with pretty much anything there's some kind of cut scene. Even if it's just a few seconds can be annoying after you've seen it 30+ times. Such as: using a pidgeon coop, bomb box, ANY shop, storyline door, ANY door, loot chest, loot body, picking up a body, fast travel, assassin dens and a quite a few others. There's also no option to skip actual cutscenes, so that makes replaying certain memories for 100% sync really annoying when there's a two minute cut scene with randoms. Overall, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome trilogy and should be played by everyone. If you have the 60+ hours, (and I think most of us do) play these games! The story alone could be a movie someday. Besides the minor animation delays, these games are great. I'd highly recommend these three games to anyone that wants to play an immersive game that takes you to a different time and place.

												Where to start? This is one of the laziest slap dashes for money I've seen in my life. If this game were any more similar to the ones before it you'd honestly start to think it was a mod someone had made for the game, while it would be good for a mod it is unnaceptable as a full priced game with little change from AC2 and ACB, those new features being the ""bombs"" and the real ♥♥♥♥ing good TD mode, wow the hours of fun you'll have with avoiding growing your brotherhood only to have it ♥♥♥♥ing wasted by the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who come along and try and take your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new tower.To sum all of that rage up don't waste your money on this game, if you're that into the story google it, you'll be saving yourself a lot of pain: 2/10. Core mechanics are the same but too little change to warrant a new game. Ubisoft = EA			"

												This game crashs quite a bit, I had it crash 3 times in less then 3 hours, It just closes. Also Uplay randomly losses connection though it isn't a abit deal for SP.I have read a a lot of reviews about this game and peple are having issues and keeps saying that game runs like crap, even them with a CPU that supirior then mine. I have never dropped below 80FPS but it will use my FX8320 8 core at 5ghz at a round 80% at times. More then BF4.Once in game though, the guards when you kill them, their bodies freak out, or if you assassinate a guard that you knocked down, you will assassinate him like as if hes standing up. Their are deffenitly glitching AI in this version of AC.			"

												ACR picks off right after the events of Brotherhood. While the gameplay and mechanics are the same, Ubisoft have brought in several new things to this title. You can now recruit dozens of Assassin's and place them in cities (a strategy type mini-game whereby you can control cities and ensure they do not fall under templar control), access to bombs and new city-defence mini-games. All in all, the storyline is as smart as ever as you play as Ezio but this time it takes place in Istanbul, Turkey. The music needs no introduction: it's ace! While you may feel that this feels like ACB, the Multiplayer is as fun as ever and overall I had an amazing time attempting to unlock and complete the whole Singleplayer campaign with 100%; which I later managed after many many hours. A must buy. 8/10!			"

												While being the shortest Assassin's Creed title in the Ezio trilogy, it has the strongest writing involving Ezio's personal journy to Constantinople/Istanbul while also revealing more about Altair. The main campaign is only about ten to twelve hours, but there's an additional ten hours of content from exploring and rebuilding the city, rebuying landmarks, guarding your Assassin towers as well as training apprentices to masters. The conclusion of Ezio's story was satisfying as we also got to see the conclusion of Altair's life. I don't really know what else to add about the gameplay, besides Istanbul being gorgeous. 9.1/10			"

I spent more time watching than playing between loading and parts of the game that were happening whether I was participating or not.  I removed this game after only a couple of hours.  :(  I will try another low cost assassins creed to see if I can find a better one.			"

												Good game, about 20 hrs worth of content. I was very pleased with how it tied and in my opinion how it closed off the intertwining histories of Ezio and Altair. No matter how bizzare the main story line with Desmond is getting, the gameplay of AC and story telling is still rich. However, this forced Ubisoft Uplay running alongside the story mode is annoying and buggy. 9/10 due to occasional random crash with DRM.			"

												This is definitely the worst game in the Ezio trilogy.Pros: Constantinople is very nice and atmospheric. So is Cappadocia. There are a bunch of side missions and collectibles, as always.Cons: The main story missions are extremely scripted/cinematic/""epic"" and give you almost no freedom, which makes them very boring. There are many quick time events (""press this button to not fail the mission"") and other types of fake difficulty. No rideable horses. No interesting characters. Few explorable locations. You don't get outside of the animus. The Demond story is told in a mediocre platforming puzzle game which you unlock by collecting things in Constantinople. The DLC is more of that, and not worth it in my opinion. Everything gives you notoriety now, and you have to find a herald to bribe, leave the area and come back to bribe him again up to three times if you've killed too many soldiers or renovated a few shops. The janissaries, which are everywhere, have guns and resist counter kills, which makes swordfighting tedious (but not challenging) unless you use bombs or assassins. There is too much focus on the new mechanic which is bomb crafting. Jumping off a building with a parachute almost never works, because Ezio invariably finds a bale of hay to jump into, even if you tell him to jump in another direction. Unnecessary delay when you open the map and menu. The money is unbalanced; you can't buy many useful things until far into the game, except for the crossbow. Atrocious DRM which downloads megabytes worth of advertisements instead of just starting the game, and doesn't work in offline mode. There are some bugs. My DLC didn't work, and I had to make a separate account to ask Ubisoft to fix it, which took them a week. 16 minutes of unskippable credits before you can continue playing after beating the game. The game crashes when starting two Desmond sequences in one play session.Overall, there are just lots of bad decisions which made this game worse than AC:Brotherhood. If you like the series, it's still fun enough at 75% discount or something. If you want to play one game out of the series, don't play this one.			"

												This is what I was expecting when I played Brotherhood. A call back to the first game, a decent look at the theme of aging with relation to the protagonist, and a sense of progress for the series. Unfortunately since Brotherhood was lacking these important qualities but brought everything else to the table, Revelations comes across as a retread which is a shame.Thankfully, this game puts the story of Ezio and Altair to a satisfying conclusion and even manages to develop the character of Desmond Miles somewhat. At the very least, the game has set itself up for a solid arc in the third game.Multiplayer here is...hard to discuss. On one hand, significant improvements have been made to the mechanics of how abilities and movement works in this game but  the game glitches a worrying amount of time. Additionally, the contract system is poorly designed, for example: I once recieved the 1st place player (I was his only pursuer) but I recieved three pursuers while I was ranked 4th or 6th.			"

												This game would be worth it simply for its unique setting, and how beautifully it is realized. Constantinople and Byzantine history are personal favorites of mine, so being able to explore the city as it was at the turn of the 16th century is a real treat. Completing Ezio and Altair's stories was a poignent and satisfying experience that began with the original Assassin's Creed years prior. The Desmond stuff is tolerable, like usual, but not obnoxious or particularly in the way, not like usual. If you played AC2, and maybe Brotherhood, and then lost steam for the franchise, go ahead and finish Ezio's story with Revelations. It's a great ending. I wish I could say the same for Desmond's story concluion in AC3, but that's a review for another game!			"

												Another great entry in the Assassin's Creed series, Revelations begins right where Brotherhood left off and has you controlling an aging Ezio Auditore through 16th century Constantinople and exploring memories throughout the life of Altair. The story is mostly focused around wrapping up the tales of Ezio and Altair's lives but Desmond's story continues to move forward as well, and as usual there is a cliffhanger ending that leaves you in heavy anticipation for the next game.

An Assassin's Story RevealedThe story continues from both ACII and Brotherhood, but this time Ezio has to travel far to find answers. Ezio is on a quest at Constantinople in order to open Altair's vault. The story reaches its peak when many things are revealed about Ezio and his ancestors. This interation of the game brings many new things to the table. There are many new different types of mission that keeps the player entertained. The many new toys that are given to the assassin makes each encounter different. My personal favorite is my trusty crossbow, but the grenades do a fabulous job when area damage is needed for a swarm of enemies. The combat system is a bit more refined with a few new cues and animations that makes it enjoyable. The sense of assassin clan being prevalent in other cities makes the clan feel stronger. I really enjoyed the tower defense that was included.The city design was well thought out because the overall world was not too vast and dense enough so that it did not feel cluttered. The hook blade was a nice addition that made Revelations feel special. I really enjoyed the culture aspect of this game because it gave everything a different feel. Replayability was greatly increased with the addition of synchronization objectives, clan challenges, city economy, and collectables. Revelations was a pleasant surprise that not only looks different and feels different, but is different in its own way. An excellent game to experience.The StrengthsThat vast variety of weapons to choose from is always welcome. The feel of the environment is different and genuine. Being able to train assassins and grow your influence in the city was rewarding. The way the story is revealed was well done and entertaining. There is a great sense of epicness, especially towards the ending of the game. There was plenty of action and the game was well paced.The LimitationsGroup combat could always use some improvement. There were some bugs that broke the income system. Opening a lot of chests and buying stores became slow and repetitive with the same animations.			"

												After about an hour of finding fixes for Uplay online (It really is a stupid idea, but there is a fix, I forgot it.), I got into the game rather quickly. Its captivating and the characters are better then I expected. There are a few things I would like to change, such as the fact that the climbing mechanics are VERY easy. A few other things I can't name right now also popped into my mind, but overall is a pretty fun game. Now, let me tell you, IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO FIND A FIX ONLINE (Its pretty annoying), DO NOT BUY. Uplay sucks at startup so it probably won't work first try. But once you fix it, its an awesome game. So, would I reccomend it? Yes, its fun, as long as you're willing to work a little to get there. And once Uplay is fixed, its an awesome system that I enjoy. Its just that initial startup. Awesome game, I reccomend it. I might update this in the future, but so far, its good. 8.5/10.			"

												In this game you play Desmond who continues to play out the role of an aging Assassin who is still trying to meet girls, outsource killing, expand his wealth and commercial intersts.  Inevitably neither the Assassin or Desmond get the girl in the end which I believe is the revelation or maybe I missed the point. :)			"

												The next entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise after Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is okay. The story (present and past) follows after the one of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. It's the finale to the Ezio trilogy and offers some good elements. The main city of Istanbul is very good, it is fun parcour around. The story is somewhat interesting, it's not the series's best by far. However, the story would be the only ""fresh"" thing in this game, as everything is like previously. The combat is the same since the first game: Assassin's Creed, with some minor changes making the game easier. The stealth is the same as Assassin's Creed II. The visual/graphics really is the same as AC II/B. It doesn't have much content compared to the previous games, and is priced at the same price as the others.If you like the Assassin's Creed franchise, then I recomend this game. If you're just curious about the series and want to get into it, I would recomend either Assassin's Creed II or IV.			"

I hadn't played it since I had my PS3 (I became PC-exclusive a couple of months ago), and even then it was visually impressive.  Definitely the most beautiful of the last gen games in my opinion.  I love the the art style of Animus Island, and the dark, purgatory-like feel of the ""Safe Mode"" and ""Black room.""Also, great story and fantastic voice acting by Nolan North.   "

												Assassin's Creed Revelations is the perfect closure for Ezio's trilogy, with nice flashbacks into Altair's memories. However, it does not offer something completely new and if you were getting tired by Brotherhood's mechanisms, Revelations will definitely not change your mind.  But the beauty of Constantinople (Istanbul) and the desire to see the end of such a charismatic character like Ezio will prevail on imperfections.Highly recommended! 10/10			"

												I'll keep this short. It's a good game. Your last real chance to play the series as Ezio. I don't personally think it's as strong as the older ones but it's still very solid. It plays fine and I have not had any significant issues with UPlay. I really like the online but, being an older game, it's not played very much really. The graphics are good. The story is good. The environment is good. I don't think it's quite as immersive as the older games set in Italy but it's still good. I'm not a fan of the mini-game at all but I do like the game they carried over where you train and recruit assassins.			"

												All the good and bad parts of the rest of the series made it into AC:R. Campy story, glitchy cutscenes, self-indulgent grandeur... it's all here along with the classic stealth and free-running action. Some big plot arcs finally get wrapped up, but for the most part the plot seems to crawl, and the game ends on yet another cliffhanger. The new bomb system is actually well implemented and surprisingly useful, but otherwise combat is pretty much the same. Points deducted for Ubisoft's terrible proprietary Uplay launcher, and the mind-numbingly awful Desmond side-quests.  B-			"

												Another Assassin's Creed game!I will never stop fawning about the masterpiece that is Assassin's Creed 2, and Brotherhood was a nice touchdown celebration/victory lap for all the fans of AC2. However, Revelations is the third game on the same character who already did all his most important stuff in AC2, and the pilot of that character who is now trapped in a recursive stack overflow and has to do unneccesary tasks to regain his body. Gameplay is unchanged from AC2 and Brotherhood, with the exception of some horrible first person platformers that you can more or less ignore, and a tower defense game that you really only have to do once. Istanbul/Constantinople in the 16th century was an exciting place where cool stuff happened but you really don't get much of a feeling of that. The open sprawling area of rome where you can ride horses into battle in the streets is gone, the main characters have little to add and the ending that the entire game builds to from the end of the tutorial is little more than a rambling introspection.In short, the game is good but is a pile of wasted potential.

												What brotherhood did wrong, Revelations does right. the boring minigames are less boring, the overworld is more interesting and the villens and writing are on par with the first. as well as seeing the main character being a well seasoned veteren of an assassin and watching him be tired of his life. fallowing a single man through his life as an assassin and watching how it affects him as he goes from a young gigalo to a jaded gray hair was the most enjoyable part of this game set for me. and with all this game DOES improve over Brotherhood does make this worth a purchase.

An Assassin's Story RevealedThe story continues from both ACII and Brotherhood, but this time Ezio has to travel far to find answers. Ezio is on a quest at Constantinople in order to open Altair's vault. The story reaches its peak when many things are revealed about Ezio and his ancestors. This interation of the game brings many new things to the table. There are many new different types of mission that keeps the player entertained. The many new toys that are given to the assassin makes each encounter different. My personal favorite is my trusty crossbow, but the grenades do a fabulous job when area damage is needed for a swarm of enemies. The combat system is a bit more refined with a few new cues and animations that makes it enjoyable. The sense of assassin clan being prevalent in other cities makes the clan feel stronger. I really enjoyed the tower defense that was included.The city design was well thought out because the overall world was not too vast and dense enough so that it did not feel cluttered. The hook blade was a nice addition that made Revelations feel special. I really enjoyed the culture aspect of this game because it gave everything a different feel. Replayability was greatly increased with the addition of synchronization objectives, clan challenges, city economy, and collectables. Revelations was a pleasant surprise that not only looks different and feels different, but is different in its own way. An excellent game to experience.The StrengthsThat vast variety of weapons to choose from is always welcome. The feel of the environment is different and genuine. Being able to train assassins and grow your influence in the city was rewarding. The way the story is revealed was well done and entertaining. There is a great sense of epicness, especially towards the ending of the game. There was plenty of action and the game was well paced.The LimitationsGroup combat could always use some improvement. There were some bugs that broke the income system. Opening a lot of chests and buying stores became slow and repetitive with the same animations.			"

												Assassins Creed Revelations review!HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ What an awesome game. I went straight from AC:Brotherhood to revelations and was dying to know how it all wraps up. Ezio's journey from first becoming an assassin in ACII all the way to the end is incredible. He's a phenomenal character in gaming and should be up there with some of the greats. His character and personality shines through unwavering till the end. I felt like I was actually Ezio in all the various locations in which this game is set, having to follow his tale through to completion. If you have ACII - AC:Revelations, I highly suggest putting away some time to play this great trilogy. Whatever your thoughts on Ubisoft are, they nail these three games and should have just stopped there. (More on that later.)SO, combat is obviously a major part of the gameplay here, and since AC:B they refined it even more. The combos are even more satisfying when dealing with multiple enemies, the executions are even more gratuitous, and the connectivity between between targets is so much smoother. It really feels like you're total badass. It's awesome. With different weapons there's a big difference in how combos and executions are... executed. Timing is key, as heavy weapons vs daggers vs hidden blades vs bombs vs projectiles are all extremely varied in how one must play, and win a fight. Ezio's style also comes into play since introduction in ACII, as he's now an experienced killing machine in AC:Revelations. His smooth, graceful style from ACII by the end becomes an unstoppable force of blades and death dealing in his later years. As usual, the voice acting is killer as well as the dialogue itself. These games, especially AC:R are so meticulously scripted it actually feels like these are real people behaving as people do. 10/10 for all that. Also the random NPC's interactions while running through the streets or climbing buildings are spot on and really ad to the overall ambiance of the game.OK, on to the annoying stuff. Every time you renovate a shop, you're stuck there for about 10-15 seconds while the building animation happens. Since there are about 150 shops, there's a lot of renovating to be had. There's also a LOT of unnecessary animations just to press ESC or TAB to view the map. I'd say a good 2 hours from my play time in AC:R is just animations from renovating a shop or viewing the map animations. Also every time you interact with pretty much anything there's some kind of cut scene. Even if it's just a few seconds can be annoying after you've seen it 30+ times. Such as: using a pidgeon coop, bomb box, ANY shop, storyline door, ANY door, loot chest, loot body, picking up a body, fast travel, assassin dens and a quite a few others. There's also no option to skip actual cutscenes, so that makes replaying certain memories for 100% sync really annoying when there's a two minute cut scene with randoms. Overall, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome trilogy and should be played by everyone. If you have the 60+ hours, (and I think most of us do) play these games! The story alone could be a movie someday. Besides the minor animation delays, these games are great. I'd highly recommend these three games to anyone that wants to play an immersive game that takes you to a different time and place.

												If you enjoyed all the AC games, it's likely that you will enjoy this as well. But if you enjoyed only some of them, maybe you will not enjoy this game.AC: Revelations takes some elements of AC: Brotherhood, remove some of them (like the horse, or Da Vinci's War Machines) and add some new elements (tower defense mini-game, creating bombs with different properties and a hook).I miss some of the removed elements, the new elements didn't translate very well into gameplay and overall, I felt this game very boring and repetitive, it's one of the few games that mades me yawn (the first AC also ""accomplished"" that).I think the reason it's because all the game has the same aesthetic and it's on the same city. Brotherhood was a great game and it was mostly in a single city, but in brotherhood had the Bruto's Lairs that had very different aesthetics and gameplay, same with Da Vinci's War Machines, and many missions of the main plot, and also, some parts of Rome felts very different.

												After about an hour of finding fixes for Uplay online (It really is a stupid idea, but there is a fix, I forgot it.), I got into the game rather quickly. Its captivating and the characters are better then I expected. There are a few things I would like to change, such as the fact that the climbing mechanics are VERY easy. A few other things I can't name right now also popped into my mind, but overall is a pretty fun game. Now, let me tell you, IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO FIND A FIX ONLINE (Its pretty annoying), DO NOT BUY. Uplay sucks at startup so it probably won't work first try. But once you fix it, its an awesome game. So, would I reccomend it? Yes, its fun, as long as you're willing to work a little to get there. And once Uplay is fixed, its an awesome system that I enjoy. Its just that initial startup. Awesome game, I reccomend it. I might update this in the future, but so far, its good. 8.5/10.			"

												I think Revelations was the most underwhelming game of the series in my opinion. Apart from the shift back to an oriental setting (Constantinopole) which is as excellently designed as always, the game is largely forgettable in terms of substance. There are a few great sequences where you get to play as an aging Altair rather than an aging Ezio but it almost feels as if the developers ran out of story for Ezio before they ran out of game time.Revelations was not great, in my opinion, but still good if by this point you're still with the series. It's more of the same, but mostly in a good way.			"

Lots of cool new moves, new game modes, MP, good story.  Cool new locations, friendlier Ezio. Play as Altair game in updated graphics, whoo! Though Assassin's Creed 2 is still the best in the 2 series. AC1 and 2 are the best. 8.5/10. Great AC game! Fun.			"

												Revelations ties up the loose ends around Ezio and provides a transition into future settings. Constantinople looks and sounds fantastic and is one of my favorite recreated cities over the landscapes of Italy. While ACII and Brotherhood felt much the same, this game introduced much better sound and updated graphics so it feels and plays better. The den defense game was a fun addition and I wish they had kept that in later games.			"

												WARNING: If you see reviews telling you UPlay is annoying, or horrible, or that it sucks the life out of everything, believe them. As for Assassin's Creed: Revelations, if I could get UPlay to connect and let me on at least once, I would know what the game is actually like. However, since I can't even get the game to play (the 4.4 hours it says I have on the game are the hours I spent trying to get past UPlay's login screen), I can't give it a positive review. I had no idea if it's as fun as others claim, because after paying for my game on Steam, I have to log in to UPlay for who knows what reason. And unfortanately for me, UPlay has no idea what an internet connection is. I looked up what other people did about this problem (and lots of people have this problem), tried various fixes, but ultimately was denied access. Opening ports, rebooting my computer in safe mode, closing all other applications... nothing worked. If I can fix it in the future, after my frustration has died down and I reinstall the game, I will likely change my review to a positive one. Until then, remember that UPlay is horrible.EDIT: A friend recommened I use my iPhone's hotspot to login to UPlay, and it worked! I have finally been able to start playing the game. If you haven't been able to get through UPlay, try using a hotspot. I hope this helps someone!			"

This game is somewhat nearly from the 2nd game but with new more advance mechanics and also you need to play the other previous games to understand the story of the game.  Fighting style still the same though.Good atmosphere. Best environment. Techniques. Stealth. and much more, I can't remember already XDAnd also. *SPOILER* You work hard enough and leave your family and friends behind to fight those keys only to see a skeleton sitting right behind the door HAHA.

I hadn't played it since I had my PS3 (I became PC-exclusive a couple of months ago), and even then it was visually impressive.  Definitely the most beautiful of the last gen games in my opinion.  I love the the art style of Animus Island, and the dark, purgatory-like feel of the ""Safe Mode"" and ""Black room.""Also, great story and fantastic voice acting by Nolan North.   "

												There are parts of this game that suck, such as having to defend some area where they introduce a whole new type of gameplay, it's like a game in a game if you ask me, and there are parts of the game that are really nice, such as the hook to the gauntlet, which allows you to zip across buildings and such (which they brought back in Syndicate). I like they moved onto another geographical area with the story, to Istanbul, which gives it a different atmosphere, roaming through the streets and the bazaars is really nice, gives you a nice exploration of the city. I don't like the crafting part, and haven't used it much in the game. Overall it's worth it as it is still a quality continuation to the previous AC games, and (spoiler alert) it ends the storyline for Ezio (yes, sniff, this is the last game you'll see him in). Def worth buying as a sale.			"

												7 out of 10 Another Assassins Creed episode.  This one sees Etzio Auditore travel to Istanbul to recover keys.  The keys will unlock Altair's library.  As always you are Desmond Miles reliving history captured in his genes. In short if you liked previous Assassins Creed episodes then you will like this one.  There is a lot to like but also a lot to hate intensely.  It really feels like this game could have been so much better. The good: 1. For the first time I actually liked Etzio as character.  In fact all characters are quite likeable except Desmond who continues to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2. In general stuff to do, unlock, collect and missions. The bad: 3. Istanbul is a sad destination compared to colorful Italy before. 4. You constantly have to send your assassin allies to take on missions in foreign cities.  It becomes quite a pain to constantly search for a pigeon loft. 5. Control training is not available on command.  If you are lucky you can catch a specific type of training while the game loads. 6. Very little about the story behind the story.  Also no Abstergo puzzles, a highlight for me in previous games. 7. The game was too long to keep my attention. The ugly: 8. Unfortunately like previous Assassins Creed episodes, combat is pathetic.  I attack a highlighted enemy however Etzio/Altair would rather attack my ally next to the enemy.  Also if an ally stands next to an enemy when you passionate him your ally will be caught in a double assignation.  9. The new ""history"" garbage played out in 1st person mode.  What twaddle is this?  Only for masochists. 10. Screen flashing the PC desktop.			"

												10/10PLUS: Great ending to the saga of Altair and Ezio. Beautiful graphics of Istanbul, amazing characters and very cool missions. The ending is absolutely perfect, creative and touching!Game runs smoothly of my PC and looks better than AC3 and Black Flag withot high tech requirement!MINUS: The game doesn't improve anything nor does it add fresh things, but it doesn't have to. It continues the saga and give a perfect finish to the story of previous AC games. "

												Another Assassin's Creed game!I will never stop fawning about the masterpiece that is Assassin's Creed 2, and Brotherhood was a nice touchdown celebration/victory lap for all the fans of AC2. However, Revelations is the third game on the same character who already did all his most important stuff in AC2, and the pilot of that character who is now trapped in a recursive stack overflow and has to do unneccesary tasks to regain his body. Gameplay is unchanged from AC2 and Brotherhood, with the exception of some horrible first person platformers that you can more or less ignore, and a tower defense game that you really only have to do once. Istanbul/Constantinople in the 16th century was an exciting place where cool stuff happened but you really don't get much of a feeling of that. The open sprawling area of rome where you can ride horses into battle in the streets is gone, the main characters have little to add and the ending that the entire game builds to from the end of the tutorial is little more than a rambling introspection.In short, the game is good but is a pile of wasted potential.

												Another incremental refinement on the Assassin's Creed formula. The dispatch quests and clan recruitment features return from AC: Brotherhood, and now there's ne ""Tower Defense"" style Hideout Defense segments, for better or worse.Multiplayer is similarly expanded on, with more and better gamemodes, new maps and custimazation options, and better post-match voting and party continuation options. Unfortunately, the multiplayer still follows a Call of Duty style leveling and perks system, and the EXP curve can be frustratingly low - meaning you're not going to get to use the toys you see everyone else with until you've put a decent amount of time into the game.Basically, it's another yealry AC release, and it manages to add just enough to the experience to stave off boredom for maybe one more year. Just in time to leave behind Ezio's story for AC III.			"

												For some reason, this game has gotten alot of♥♥♥♥♥♥from alot of users. I have played the first 5 games in the AC series and this one is right up there.I love the fact that is focuses on ONE CITY, which was one of the things I did not like about other AC games. The fact that there is also a big focus on the Assasins vs. Templar is a big bonus for me. Lots of players prefer games in the series with bigger focus on other aspects but for me the story of assasins vs templars is the reason I fell in love with the series to begin with.There are many inprovements to the AC brotherhood firstly the fighting sequences and climbing are alot smoother and the fact that they added Meditterrean Defense is something I really liked as well. The characters are very likeable and the way they tie the story of Altair Ezio and Desmond is F******* awesome imo.If you are a fan of a great story, awesome setting and crazy good characters I would say go for it! You won't regret it.			"

												This game is a must have if you have played the last two, also if you want to continue onto AC3. But it isn't that good of a game, so don't put you're expectations high. Or average, for that matter. Instead of continuing the awesomeness of Renaissance Italy, and adventuring, killing guards, retrieving medieval artifacts... Nope! Ezio's last expedition as an Assassin takes place in... Constanople? WHY? Lame additions to this game include some hook thing that lets you jump an extra 2 inches away, and making bombs. In this game you also get a dumb den defense metagame that makes you feel like you're playing a $1.99 mobile game from the app store instead of an AC game. Basically, Ezio learns how to make bombs in the middle east, and learns how to magically place troops in front of some wooden spikes to defend a building. This game was painful to play. If Ubi wanted to make a cool game with Ottomans and Saracens, by all means they should've, but with Ezio? This game is undeserving of Ezio. This game feels like it should be a $6 DLC for the first Assassin's Creed game. By far the best part of this game is the cutscenes, and I don't mean this jokingly. This game reveals so much... hence ""revelations"", literally revealing the missing scenarios of Altair's life, including his death (not a spoiler, come on. we knew it was coming). We also see Ezio retire in this game. Sorry. But at least it's a happy ending, which I'll let you discover.			"

												Another great entry in the Assassin's Creed series, Revelations begins right where Brotherhood left off and has you controlling an aging Ezio Auditore through 16th century Constantinople and exploring memories throughout the life of Altair. The story is mostly focused around wrapping up the tales of Ezio and Altair's lives but Desmond's story continues to move forward as well, and as usual there is a cliffhanger ending that leaves you in heavy anticipation for the next game.

												This game would be worth it simply for its unique setting, and how beautifully it is realized. Constantinople and Byzantine history are personal favorites of mine, so being able to explore the city as it was at the turn of the 16th century is a real treat. Completing Ezio and Altair's stories was a poignent and satisfying experience that began with the original Assassin's Creed years prior. The Desmond stuff is tolerable, like usual, but not obnoxious or particularly in the way, not like usual. If you played AC2, and maybe Brotherhood, and then lost steam for the franchise, go ahead and finish Ezio's story with Revelations. It's a great ending. I wish I could say the same for Desmond's story concluion in AC3, but that's a review for another game!			"

												Assassin's Creed: Revelations is a step up from the previous Assassin's Creed games. It includes new climbing and freerunning movements and new equipment such as the hook blade and parachutes. The game is well written and is a perfect and climatic end to Ezio's story. The customization aspect of the game is still in the opening stages compared to the more recent AC games but grasps the concepts that you want in customization with upgrades as well as visual improvments such as different colour sets to choose from.Alongside Ezio's journey there is also the continuation of Desmond's with added and explained lore and more truths about the Animus, Templars and Assassins, as there has been with the previous AC games.

												7 out of 10 Another Assassins Creed episode.  This one sees Etzio Auditore travel to Istanbul to recover keys.  The keys will unlock Altair's library.  As always you are Desmond Miles reliving history captured in his genes. In short if you liked previous Assassins Creed episodes then you will like this one.  There is a lot to like but also a lot to hate intensely.  It really feels like this game could have been so much better. The good: 1. For the first time I actually liked Etzio as character.  In fact all characters are quite likeable except Desmond who continues to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2. In general stuff to do, unlock, collect and missions. The bad: 3. Istanbul is a sad destination compared to colorful Italy before. 4. You constantly have to send your assassin allies to take on missions in foreign cities.  It becomes quite a pain to constantly search for a pigeon loft. 5. Control training is not available on command.  If you are lucky you can catch a specific type of training while the game loads. 6. Very little about the story behind the story.  Also no Abstergo puzzles, a highlight for me in previous games. 7. The game was too long to keep my attention. The ugly: 8.

No matter how bizzare the main story line with Desmond is getting, the gameplay of AC and story telling is still rich. However, this forced Ubisoft Uplay running alongside the story mode is annoying and buggy. 9/10 due to occasional random crash with DRM.			"

												16 minutes of Credits - all those people and not one of them in charge enough to say this game has too many of the not-fun mini-games and way too much running around the not-fun city.  Boy you can really tell this one was put together by too many teams and the final product was really missing a master chef to throw out the bad ingrediants and stick with the good ones.  Yes, I actually finished the game twice, once on the PS3 and now again on the PC.  Everything worked great technically on this PC port - no complaints there.  Just way too many unfun things you are forced to do to complete the game.  Whoever came up with the concept of doing one thing wrong and having to restart the mission is an idiot - those really ruin the whole flow of the game!  Also the city design itself was just not fun to run and jump around in like the previous games.  BUt I still liked it enough to finish it so I guess I can recommend it, it's not as bad as everyone says.  Just way too many people with no leadership it seems putting it together.			"

Almost immediately, I began to miss the beauty and majesty of italy; I even missed the underground sections in the Followers of Romulus sections. I slowly lost the desire to touch the game again, and it will probably never be touched a second time. It is condemned to an enternal purgatory, from which I shall never lift it.Cheers!-Camolot			"

												I really want to like the Assassin's Creed series, but with Revelations being the b*tch slap in the face it is, I find myself unable to find any excuses to justify the existance of this game. It is mediocre in almost every way. That's why I wrote this message to you. To warn you of this game. Let's take the environment for example. In ACII and Brotherhood we spent the game in Italy during the Rennaissance. There were unique environments, several factions that all offered different side-quests, quite a questlines, and on top of that a few assassination targets (because, you know, it's called Assassin's Creed). Revelations practically removed all of those things. The game takes place in Istanbul in the 1510's, and apparently back then it was normal for an entire city to look completely the same, without any variety at all. The buildings are copy-pasted, there were exactly 3 side quests (one for each faction: Thieves, Mercenaries and Romanies) and there were very, very few assassination targets, with most of them being introduced only minutes before you get to stab their precious little necks. Instead, the game likes to expand on something that had been introduced in Brotherhood: micro-management. I will only say 3 words on this matter: Waste. Of. Time. I wish that was the only bad thing there was to say about this game, but unfortunately, it isn't. The characters seem to lack any kind of personality. For example, they practically turned Ezio in another Desmond. Extremely boring. And it's not just Ezio, but ALL characters you meet in this game. They lack any kind of personality and do not possess any real characteristics. Speaking of characters, they also seem keen on introducing Ezio's new 30 year younger love interest. And how do they do it? By practically shoving her down the player's throath. With a few small additions to the plot, she could have been skipped completely. Which would be a good thing, since the dialogue between her and Ezio is especially cringe-worthy.Speaking of the plot, the entire game just feels completely unnecessary. The overhanging plot consists of fetching special keys to open the library in Masyaf, which you might know from the first AC game. The whole situation with the Templars and the Ottoman political intrigue feels like it was added later to make the game feel longer. There is no good reason for Ezio to go to Istanbul. Other than that, it's mostly copied of Brotherhood: capture the towers, build the brotherhood and blah blah blah. Also, a word of warning, if you want to buy this game because it has Altaïr in it, don't even bother spending your hard-earned cash. Altaïr only shows up for a few short moments, with time jumps as large as 20 years. And even he seems to lack any kind of personality. As for Desmond... He's still Desmond. 'Nuff said.""But wait!"", some of you may say, ""They added several new elements! Like grenades, the hook-blade and the tower defense minigame!"" Yes, they did add them and yes, they removed all challenge and make the game even easier and more boring. Grenades are overpowered, the hook-blade is overpowered (and unrealistic) and the tower defense minigame is a complete waste of time.As for the multi-player, maybe you will enjoy it, maybe you won't. I didn't bother playing it. So, with this list of complaints I finally rest my case. Sorry for the extremely long wall of text, but people need to know that they should NOT buy this game. You're better off re-playing ACII.			"

												Possibly the best game of the ""Ezio Saga"", because of the evolution of the main character. The game doesn't bring big changes like Assasin's Creed 2, but it improves on it and Constantinople is a very interesting city to develop the final chapter of ezio. It is especially recommended after playing the two previous games to be able to enjoy it on it's fullest.			"

												Esse foi o Assassin's Creed da trilogia do Ezio q eu menos joguei e terminei mais rapido, sem completar as side quests - talvez pq fossem desinteressantes. Mas a história principal é muito, muito boa. O jogo não é nenhum pouco ruim do q eu imaginava q fosse. Ele fecha com chave de ouro a trilogia. Comparado com os outros, ainda prefiro muito o 2 e o Brotherhood. Mas recomendo sim o jogo.			"

This review does not analyze the multiplayer experience.This is it… Ezio’s last chapter, one final adventure on a quest that’s been long, full of pain, death, frustration and many epic moments that we will remember forever, Il Mentore deserves at least, a time for himself.StoryIt is 1511, some years have passed after the events of AC: Brotherhood and Ezio travels to Masyaf, where a castle, which once served as a base of operations for the Assassin Order during the High Middle Ages, is located, guided by some of his father’s letters stating that some wisdom of great value is hidden inside a library, Ezio begins a new adventure. Unfortunately, upon arrival Ezio is attacked by Byzantines, who have taken possession of the old fortress. On his little adventure Ezio learns something regarding the existence of some artifacts that will help him open this old library, the Templars have one of the keys, but 4 others remain hidden, on his journey, he learns about Niccolò Polo's journal, which will help Ezio to locate the rest of the keys, thus a new voyage takes him to the great city of Constantinople. New historical characters appear on this journey, such as Piri Reis, Manuel Palaeologos and Prince Suleiman, as for new characters that will help Ezio on his adventures, such Yusuf Tazim and Sofia Sartor, the latest being some sort of love interest in the beginning of the game and future wife of our hero. But that is not all, we can also play as Altaïr once more, by re-experiencing some episodes on his life every time we find a key, this aspect is great, it really takes you back in time to relive part of his story, his life as an Assassin, his family and what drove him to take over a weak and fractured order and revitalizing it and finally becoming a legend. GameplayI must say that Assassin’s Creed has always been solid when it comes to game mechanics, just some small details that do not overshadow the whole experience, on AC: Revelations everything feels smoother and fast paced, controls have changed a little, but it is nothing serious, fighting feels more fluid and cohesive, we have multiple swords and small weapons at our disposal, as well as the gun and poison and the crossbow, with a new design. On this instalment, a set of bombs is introduced, bombs with various characteristics that would help us getting rid of enemies or just distracting them to fulfil our missions, but the shining star here is a new tool called hook blade, which will help us to free-run faster throughout the city, as well as to climb buildings and towers in a matter of seconds. Definitely, some minor aspects have changed and some other have been refined, kill streaks are easy to perform and you can kill enemies in seconds with no problems at all.We are also introduced to a new system, which is some sort of tower defense action, at some point on the game, you will have to face attacks on different zones of the city you have liberated, and this means the enemy will attack at random moments, even during missions, and you must act quickly or the place you have captured will be lost, consequently retaking it is part of the job, but if you play your cards well this new mechanic would not be a problem at all. The recruitment has also changed a bit, now every time you recruit a new member some sort of mini mission is triggered or sometimes is just defending citizens who will gladly join your cause, after you have some new members you can send them on various missions to defend or retake different cities, the assassins will now level up faster so once they reach the title of Assassin you can make them leaders of the different dens you have all over the city, by doing this a new mission or activity is triggered.GraphicsThe AC franchise has always delivered beautiful depicted cities and locations, this is not the exception, Constantinople is beautiful, massive and full of details, every building and tower show little elements which highlight the depth of the religion and cultural background of the city. Inscriptions are to be found on historical and important building and towers, some other places show the difference of the neighborhoods, weary and old architecture is present everywhere. Outstanding.On the other hand, the population and trading is massive, multiple stores and NPC’s crowd the city with life, and side activities, one small detail is the NPC design, it is notorious that many of them repeated themselves, many characters looked the same, which makes you think that maybe somebody was lazy regarding this aspect, it’s nothing grave nonetheless.Sound and musicAC: Revelations is great when it comes to sound effects, the sound of blades, the fire arms, all of the crowd’s conversations, everything is masterfully done, the voice acting is as always, superb, nothing bad to say about it, Ezio sounds mature and wise and all other voice actors have done a tremendous job on their roles, everyone is believable, top notch acting.The music has always been important for these games, this is why I have to say that the soundtrack for this game is splendid, it really captures the atmosphere of the city and every secret, from action-oriented music to more ambient sounds, all of it is perfect. At some points it really makes you feel the inevitable is about to come, the end of our journey along with Ezio, but at the same time a new beginning in his life, the music itself truly delivers a great impression.The badThere is always something negative with these games, unfortunately, there are some new ideas that are a little rough around the edges, as mentioned before the tower defense system is really not the best, it feels unfinished and rushed, like out of place, not only due to the fact that is presented briefly but also for the way it decides to show up from time to time, there are points on the game which you are far away and it urges you to defend a certain den, it happens you are on the other side of the map and by the time you struggle to come back and defend it, the place is already lost or sometimes the systems triggers these new tasks while you are in the middle of another mission, of course the main missions are more important, so to speak you don’t care much about the dens and continue with the story. I am sure it looks good on paper, but the idea was not implemented in the best way.Another new characteristic that seems like a new add on but tends to be forgettable after a couple of times is the bombs system, yes, it really looks great, all sort of bombs with different applications, but rarely practical, you can collect the ingredients or just buy them but in the end the tedious system is easily replaceable by the poison darts that far better than any kind of bomb, and also more fun and faster, overall, the bombs looked like a new great addition, however it was extremely overshadowed by the simplicity of other tools we can use to kill or distract enemies.   ConclusionAC: Revelations is a great game with a fair ending to Ezio’s adventures, and a memorable travel back in time to relive some of Altaïr’s experiences, it is sad, yes, we have seen how Il Mentore was born, turned assassin, we have witnessed how he lost part of his family to treacherous enemies, we have seen how he has become a wiser man, how he has learnt to deal with his past and face the present and how all the suffering, nonetheless, has paid off.I must highlight the love interest for Ezio, his future wife was a great addition to the story, it feels like Sofia is an important part of the whole story, but at the same time she is not more essential than the story itself, it is subtle, yet significant and a likeable character.Assassin's Creed: Revelations is a must for every fan of the franchise!

												After 20 hours I beat the main quest, this games main story is incredibly short.  I did many other things in those 20 hours besides the main quest, it just feels so short and almost like it was suppose to be part of the previous brotherhood game.  Same assassins dens, saving villagers, cities needing conquering, etc.  with the addition of bomb making. The bomb making can be fun, but you normal figure out which ones you always want in you pocket and keep those around. I say it's worth a few bucks, but nothing more.  It's a good step in the story, but nothing more, it's the equivalent of a half-life episode we have all been hoping for in terms of length.  Good, but I wanted a little more.			"

												Assassin's Creed Revelations was one of my most anticipated games of 2011. At that point in the franchise's lifespan, I couldn't get enough of AC games.After a solid first entry with Altair, we were introduced to young Italian assassin Ezio Auditore in AC 2 back in '09. Two games later, Ezio is older, much wiser, and ready to embark on his biggest adventure yet.Ezio left Italy in order to find the meaning of the assassin brotherhood. The journey finds him in Constantinople, where he meets fantastic new allies and enemies. Besides Ezio and Desmond, we take control of Altair for couple of instances that further explain the story. Combat was improved, some good new features are added (like bomb crafting and hookblade), and some not so good gameplay features (like the flawed den defense system). Assassin's Creed Revelations is a fantastic closure to Ezio's trilogy. It has extremely satisfying and emotional ending and it shouldn't be missed. Final score: 9.8/10 "

												TL;DR: If you're a die hard fan of the franchise, this is a great game to get on sale. With an average completion time of 12 hours (based on howlongtobeat.com) and lots of collectibles for you completionist junkies, you should have a great time. The level design is on point, and the cities are anything but boring. But I found myself lost in the plot (in a not-great way).---I must a cardinal sin - I never played the first Assassin's Creed. Because of this, I felt as if the Altair storyline felt shoehorned  and out of place. I found that they tied up Ezio's storyline quite well, but it would have been even nicer if they should have somehow made a transition into their third installment into the franchise. Desmond's line was also too short and not memorable. Characters were also nothing of the ordinary, but it was neat to see a grizzled Ezio well into his 50s-60s leaping towers like a Parkour Youtuber. Without stepping on spoiler territory, the storylines and objectives were a bit muddled. However, I found myself forgetting less about my objectives and more into the rich map design. It's showcased in its entirety by lengthy and enjoyable missions. One quip from a design standpoint - both stealth and assault are favoured, though there are missions that are stealth only. For the most part, the designers respected these divergent playstyles. The most common criticism in the game would be its wonky minigames (tower defence missions were painfully slow and poorly choreographed). I'm inclined to agree. Though the campaign alone is worth the price of admission, stealth-loving players that favour the covert stylings of Splinter Cell multiplayer games will sink some hours into it (despite a poor userbase because of age).

												Muss sich ein Spiel immer wieder neu erfinden, um Spaß zu machen? Nein, denn auch spürbare Tradition kann sehr gut unterhalten. Revelations zeigt, dass nicht nur große Innovationen, sondern auch kleine Änderungen vollkommen ausreichen können, um zu fesseln. Man dem Ende der Ezio-Trilogie vorwerfen, dass es mit Ausnahme der zu selten erforderlichen Bomben oder der Den Defense inhaltlich zu wenig Neues geboten wird. Doch das Abenteuer wirkt spielerisch noch runder und hinsichtlicher der Story reifer, weshalb man Ubisoft diese Stagnation nicht übel nehmen kann. Zum anderen ist Revelations für mich das erzählerisch bislang stärkste AC. Der Multiplayer ist auch sehr gut.			"

												My personal No. One in Assassin's Creed franchise. And even if any of its components isn't best comparing to others parts of this saga, Revelations is most  solid game about Desmond & friends. And only one I didn't get bored with before reaching credits.			"

												While I have some mixed feelings about the game, It's a kind of a closure to the Ezio trilogy.In terms of gameplay, rip-off with minor changes.In terms of plotline, the game had an unexpected plotline, for the good and for the bad.In terms of Graphics, the game is colourful (in contrast to previous games, and even following games)			"

												I recommend this game mostly because it has a very good storyline, and it's needed to understand all the things that happened to Ezio Audiotore after becoming the mentor of the assassins in Rome, as well as Desmond before getting caught by Abstergo in AC1 and between games. It is also a very interesting approach to the way the Animus works, how Desmond could keep conscious thanks to the Animus despite being comatose, and how Subject 16 conscience remained alive in the Animus even after his body died. Definetely a good plot. Now, the game has a few issues too. In my experience playing it, I had some troubles with the commands, because some of them are different from previous games, although after a few minutes (hours, to be honest) I could get used to them. There are some troubles in some missions too, specially when one wants to get the 100% syncronization. But in general, it's been a rather good experience.			"

												Assassins creed revelations, the bon voyage of the series two greatest protagonists.Join, Ezio and Altair for the very last time as their paths cross again when Ezio goes seeking purpose.It plays and feels no different to brotherhood but is i feel a step down in total package.If youve already travelled with Altair and Eizo then you need this if you seek resolve but if you started with AC rogue or syndicate say, then you might want to consider how much of the famed creeds history you actually want to know.I liked it, its saddening to see the two greatest assassins ever to grace the creed for the last time.

												*Bangs head against desk until I recieve a concussion* Let me tell you a story children, about a pointless game system called Uplay! The creators of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft, decided it'd be a great idea to add Uplay to their games. We'll, just like Gallipoli, it was a ****-up from the beggining, and yes, I used a historical event to describe a system that's more out of date to anyone of this century. The game itself is good, a few glitches to be dealt with, but Uplay really makes me want to go empty handed into a crowd of a few hundred templars just to get the enjoyment of beating the crap outta them.Honestly, you should try it, it feels great!Apart from that, 11/10 Uplay again - Ubisoft			"

												Best Assassin's Creed ever!First of all its the best one because it is the ending of the previous 2 beautiful games(Assassin's Creed 2 + Assassin's Creed Brotherhood which i really enjoy playing).Also in Assassin's Creed Revelations you can play as Altair which means that youalso get to see the first Assassin's Creed and in addition with this memories and Ezio'syou finally complete the puzzle of that awesome and wonderful ""trilogy"" story.Furthermore this game has many gameplay characteristics of the an old game of ubisoftwhich is Prince of Persia, you can see the similarity in the temples that you try to find the keysfor the apple's location.In addition the story of the 2 presequel games is not the only feature that this game hasbut also the beauty of having your own assassin's crew which was introduced in the Brotherhoodand also the awesome mechanics of combat that, although there are easy to learn like the previous games, there are so beautiful when you master them.In conclusion, this is the best Assassin's Creed and for me, now that i have played all of them i believe that not only the Assassin's Creed series after Revelations does not have that many new and  good features but the new ones have lost the old and good featues like having your own assassin's crew that this game and the Brotherhood had.I rate this game 10/10 :DP.S. This game is also one of the biggest games not only from the series but from many other open-world games.P.P.S. Also this game has one of the best trailers that i have ever seen!			"

												Overall i think the game was a great improvement from its predecessor (Brotherhood). One of the features that i like about this game is how you are able to travel to places much quicker than before, due to the fact that you can glide over rooftops, fast travel, etc.The graphic details improved a lot as well, where the textures and models are more detailed than before. Like all games, this should always happen where every year the game improves in graphic quality and this game fulfilled it.The new features of weapons/items makes it more easier to play. One of these items would be a grenade that you throw to wipe out a crowd of enemies. There are more features, that you should find that out yourself. The story line is also as good as older Assassins Creed series, bring rich and full fulling experience. This is a game that should be played, but if you haven't played any Assassins Creed, i suggest you to start from AC2.			"

												For some reason, this game has gotten alot of♥♥♥♥♥♥from alot of users. I have played the first 5 games in the AC series and this one is right up there.I love the fact that is focuses on ONE CITY, which was one of the things I did not like about other AC games. The fact that there is also a big focus on the Assasins vs. Templar is a big bonus for me. Lots of players prefer games in the series with bigger focus on other aspects but for me the story of assasins vs templars is the reason I fell in love with the series to begin with.There are many inprovements to the AC brotherhood firstly the fighting sequences and climbing are alot smoother and the fact that they added Meditterrean Defense is something I really liked as well. The characters are very likeable and the way they tie the story of Altair Ezio and Desmond is F******* awesome imo.If you are a fan of a great story, awesome setting and crazy good characters I would say go for it! You won't regret it.			"

												Revelations is not as good as AC 2 or Brotherhood but I still love this game mainly because of how well it closes Ezio and Altair’s story. This game has a lot of great moments, some of the best in the whole franchise. These very well done character moments with both Ezio and Altair as well as great action set pieces such as the first hour of the game or the tombs of the Masyaf keys make this game very memorable.  A lot of the story missions and side plots feel like filler and it is not very interesting which brings this game back a lot as well as the additions that the series didn’t need like the tower defense and bomb crafting. Even though Constantinople is a great setting for this game it’s not as interesting or memorable as the previous games settings. These problems stop this game from being amazing but I still consider it to be a great game and it closes off the Ezio trilogy perfectly. 8/10 (Great)			"

												See my previous Assassin's Creed reccomendations.  Combat is boring less bosses (targets) than previous iterations, bosses are no different than normal soldiers, many pointless sidequests, more options but no real reason to use one over another.  Less interesting dungeon zones in this one, some minor perks to doing challenges, but really this game is no different than any of the previous games, mechanics wise.  Climbing is less frustrating but that's just polish of the mechanic present in the last three games.The story was never all that amazing in these games, and this one reveals essentially nothing towards the overall arching story in the name of making more sequels.  Overall, pretty much nothing interesting happened here and everything was forgettable.  Considering its supposed to be the end of Ezio's story, they could've done better  Again, welcome to sequels.Multiplayer is enjoyable with some caveats, but it will probably die now that AC3 has been released.  C'est la vie.			"

												Even though this is the most irrelevant Assassin's Creed entirely (main title wise), the gameplay is still fun as the previous titles. The Tower Defense is my favorite part. As one of the biggest fans of Assassin's Creed and one of the most in-depth about it's lore, and being an ex-Moderator on the AC wiki, I only recommend this game to someone who plays AC for the fun of it, even though it's fetch quest simulator in a nutshell. The story is pretty bland, and the only thing we really find out is Ezio's future. That's it. You can literally play all the games except this one and not miss a thing except Desmond waking from his coma.			"

												The controls on this game are useless for playing on a PC. Often I've got locked into combat or I've just had times when any command is completely ignored. I've killed citizens and I've no idea why, I've died becuase all the suggested commands for breaking combat are useless and don't work. To be honest I'm not even sure I have a clue what the ulitmate point of this game is I seem to get randam missions that didn't seem to fit any real coherent plan. Before anyone asks I have played this for quite some time, or rather I've tried to, I've saved the Sultan's son (or whatever he is) and am currently on some silly mission chasing down a beggar women who even when I catch ON HER OWN WITH NO ONE NEARBY any attempt to hit her results in me killing some randam citizen who suddenly appears in reach.

												Heeelllo to everyone. We're with one of the AC game which has perfect graphics for the date of this game.If you have a question about Is it worthing for paying, yeah. Answer is yes.I lost a lot of time in Revelations. I was playing it in internet cafe. But after i found it in black friday, i didn't miss the chance to get it. You can see a lot of Greek&Turkish action in Constantinople. And if you're in with Ottomans or Byzantines, you're welcome !Herkese merhabalar.Tarihine göre mükemmel grafikleri olan bir AC oyunu ile beraberiz.Eğer kafanızda ödemeye değer mi gibi sorular var ise, cevap evet.Çok fazla süre harcadım Revelations'un içinde. İnternet kafede oynuyordum ama kara cumada indirimdeyken bulduğumda alma fırsatını kaçırmadım. Oyunun içinde aşırı derecede Yunan&Türk aksiyonları hareketlerini Konstantiniyye'de görebilirsiniz. Ve Osmanlılarla ya da Bizanslılarla içli dışlıysanız, hoşgeldiniz.			"

												This game is a must have if you have played the last two, also if you want to continue onto AC3. But it isn't that good of a game, so don't put you're expectations high. Or average, for that matter. Instead of continuing the awesomeness of Renaissance Italy, and adventuring, killing guards, retrieving medieval artifacts... Nope! Ezio's last expedition as an Assassin takes place in... Constanople? WHY? Lame additions to this game include some hook thing that lets you jump an extra 2 inches away, and making bombs. In this game you also get a dumb den defense metagame that makes you feel like you're playing a $1.99 mobile game from the app store instead of an AC game. Basically, Ezio learns how to make bombs in the middle east, and learns how to magically place troops in front of some wooden spikes to defend a building. This game was painful to play. If Ubi wanted to make a cool game with Ottomans and Saracens, by all means they should've, but with Ezio? This game is undeserving of Ezio. This game feels like it should be a $6 DLC for the first Assassin's Creed game. By far the best part of this game is the cutscenes, and I don't mean this jokingly. This game reveals so much... hence ""revelations"", literally revealing the missing scenarios of Altair's life, including his death (not a spoiler, come on. we knew it was coming). We also see Ezio retire in this game. Sorry. But at least it's a happy ending, which I'll let you discover.			"

												I've always dreamed of being an Assassin whose charms rivals that of Casanova and that  comes true in Assassin's Creed Revelations.

												I can't recommend this game. The story is good and all, but the combat makes it next to impossible to to anything significant outside of the main story. Not all the fighting was bad, but the inability to dodge or counter the attacks of certain enemies, combined with not being able to run or climb during combat (making it next to impossible to escape), ruined it.The control sceme was shifty. Some of the actions the game says you can do with certain keys are not possible. Furthermore, the jumping and climbing as weird. Sometimes when you are trying to climb up a wall, you will just jump backwards. And when trying to jump off roofs, Ezio will stumble at the edge several times before you actually jump. This makes getting down to the ground in a hurry pretty much undoableYou would probably enjoy this game if the freerome and free combat (meaning you can pick a reasonable fight with most guards) and the combat-oriented side activities of the other titles in the franchise were not something you found yourself enjoying, unlike me.

												Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood were amazing.  Revelations had much of the same gameplay and content, and yet completely fell short on the story (very literally; it was significantly shorter than the previous games).  With such a short story, the game just felt bloated with all the ultimately unnecessary side stuff, which was largely just collecting. I think actual side missions through the factions (more than the one per faction you get) would have helped balance things. The tower defense mini game they tried to include just didn't cut it.Outside of the main story, learning about Desmond's past was interesting, although the choice of telling it through first-person jumping puzzles was odd.  Again, why ditch the 3rd-person parkour?It's still worth playing, but feels kind of incomplete.			"

Constantinople is absolutely beautiful and the story remains interesting. If you liked the previous AC games, you'll like this one as well.			"
