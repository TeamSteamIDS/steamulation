												4 sniper rifles in a sniper game. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.4 pistols. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.4 secondary weapons. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.2 horde maps. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.9 missions. Do you want more? Buy the DLCs.And so on, i guess you get it, right? Buy at your own risk. It lacks A LOT of content. In fact for 40 bucks it has a very low value.Just feel free to join our discussion on the comments section. There you can see different points of view from various people.Edit 2.0 aka ""short story long"" :)SE3 cuts both ways, it is pretty much SE V2 with bigger maps (don't expect more than 2 multiple paths per map though), they got rid off cheap mechanics like health regeneration but broken stealth mechanics, a few missions, not even more than 2 horde maps to expand the duration of the game (or any kind of content, it has 0 replayability), irregular AI, mediocre/unnecessary MP and details like historical inaccuracy make this game the worse of the series by far imo. I'm not saying that SE1 or 2 are more replayable or have better AI, but at least from SE1 to SE2 we saw a change, and felt like a new game for good or bad. In other words, it was a step in a different direction in some features and in others a step forward or backwards but a step nonetheless. Here it's  a lazy move. This is the best they could come up with after 2 years? Pathetic.Not just that but it doesn't offer enough content to justify full price, and overall feels more like an expansion/dlc for SE V2. And of course this ""game"" already has 12 DLCs which add what Rebellion cut off the final game to be sold separately for extra cash. The perfect money grab.The game is a shell of its former self. If you still interested i would recommend you to wait till sales and get the complete package cheap as chips. After all, is your choice.			"

Note: If you are using a 120hz or 144hz monitor be aware that you may need to add either ""-Hz=120"" or ""-Hz=144"" to launch properties or else you will be stuck at 60hz and it will be noticeable. For the longest time I thought I was just getting low fps and that the game just wasn't running well. It finally dawned on me to check the refresh rate and voila my problem was fixed and the game ran great.Sniper Elite 3 is a fun game and an improvement on its predecessor in almost every way. Levels are a lot bigger and more open, campaign is longer, graphics are better, stealth is improved and feels more viable, rifle customization has been added, and everything you do gives you xp so that you gain ranks regardless of if you touch multiplayer or not.If you're looking for an amazing story with great writing and voice acting you will want to look elsewhere. Enemy AI can be questionable as well. I never had a problem with bugs and glitches, but people have reported them so that may be something to keep in mind. There is a lack of weapons in this one compared to the previous entry, but especially with the addition of weapon customization that isn't something that bothered me much. These games have never really been about weapon variety anyway.Ranking up gives you unlocks and basically just adds a sense of progression beyond that of completing a mission. This is not some earth-shattering addition, but it is welcomed.The new difficulty, Authentic, is highly punishing. Not only is it very hard, but if you die, you restart the level from the beginning. And these levels are not short. If you crave a challenge, you will not be disappointed. On the other end of the spectrum you have Cadet difficulty which is almost too easy. Bullet drop and wind is removed and enemy AI is considerably dumbed down. If you feel like Call of Duty-ing your way through the game then this is the difficulty for you.The game is optimized well and the controls are pretty much unchanged from Elite V2, which is not a bad thing. This is definitely not some lame console port.The abundant dlc is something to be aware of as well. The game felt fine enough to me without any of it, but it is there.I don't know that the game is worth paying full price for, but if you can get it on sale for a good price I doubt you will regret it.

												------- Its not that I dont recommend it , its that it is not finished --------What I mean by what I said above , is that its disgraceful to release day 1 DLCs with so little content inside of the actual game. This is Rebellion wanting to be EA , which makes me sad beyond words. Let me elaborate :Pros : - Bigger Maps , 3 - 4 levels of elevation making for some interesting gameplay.- Kill Cam , Graphics and Game Overall looking and feeling better- Hardest difficulty AI is really insane , making it immence pleasure at least to me to fail against it.Cons : - Overall 4 Sniper rifles and 4 Subguns with 3 Pistols , and some rather lazy customisation options.- Day 1 DLCs which hold the weapons that could have been placed in the game, if they werent so ♥♥♥♥ing greedy.- Lack of maps is honestly horrible. There are like 6 maps overall , only 2 you can do in Challenges ( Co-op ).- Lack of multyplayer modes , being only Distance King  and Deathmach , and their Team equivalents.Overall , I enjoy playing the game , but in less then 2 hours I`ve played every map and tried out every weapon , which made it just ... a horrible dissapointment to me. If DLCs get on Sales , or they decide we are ,,Customers`` and not sheep , this game might become something.			"

												Realistic physics with wind and gravity turned on in the more challenging modes. Once you get to know your rifle you will be able to shoot accurately. Unlike most games, you do not run endlessly. You character gets tired at 80bpm and your shots become less accurate. Move slowly, crouch, and stay prone to keep your heart rate low.In single player mode you can be a silent assassin with your knife. Hit multiple targets from the snipers nests throughout the map. Opportunities to hit targets at long distances. Setup mines for vehicles and enemies. Or blow up explosives to tear them to pieces. In multiplayer mode you get lots of free maps. Many different modes are possible (co-op, team games, and deathmatches). Stay hidden as much as you can, in the shadows and away from trigger happy team mates.Overall, it is an impressive game. The graphics are spectacular. High definition textures, human-like characters, and particles such as dust and bugs make it all the more realistic.			"

												Sniper Elite 3? More like Sniper Elite 2.01. Seriously 8 missions for the campaign Rebellion?! Ultra short game, no way that's worth the asking price.The same stuff that's wrong with Sniper Elite 2 is pretty much also wrong in this game.Enemies still have magic bullets with super killer sniper aim. Come on Rebellion the AI is just as bad as Sniper Elite 1! You've done nothing to improve the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI.And DLC already ? That stuff should be in the release. I'd expect this from someone like EA, but you guys really topped it this time. Sorry but I cannot recommend this game.Conclusion: DO NOT BUY			"

												Though the developer's promised to have 'learned from the mistakes in Sniper Elite 2, this is sadly not the case. Actually the game is very much like the 2nd part has been. There is no sand-box-like environment, though in theory the levels are huge and feature long distances, one cannot make use of it. The level design restricts the player's movement in mutliple ways. Not being able to step over he smalles stone in your path means that one need to stick to the few predetermined paths. The enemies are popping up in a certain distance. For example one can observe a tower on the other side of a lake, seeing no enemies at it - when moving closer the enemies are created there out fo nothingness. The average distance of a firefight is about 30-80 meters, to get a long shot you need to crawl to the target to make it appear, then crawl all the way back to give it a shot. Even worse, at long ranges the collision is not working correctly. Though the target is presented in clear view the tactical assistance shows the target as 'obscured' effectively the shot is blocked by something invisible. Longest shot i did take in the normal game was at 130 meters. Same goes for corners, windows and doors. Often your shots will hit the frame, though your crosshair is dead on target. If you like the sniper series stick to the 2nd part, this one is just a bit more flashy. Oh and the customizing is utterly useless. From their ads:-Expansive new environments – Stalk huge multi-route levels with multiple primary and secondary objectives than can be tackled in any order. Never play the same way twice. -> Though there is no order given, the level design claerly dictates a certain order, 2nd part is true, one surly will not play a level a second time as it's just to boring.-Real tactical choice – Adapt to any situation. Use stealth, distraction, traps and sound masking . If things go hot, use the new Relocate mechanic to slip into the shadows and start the hunt again on your own terms. --> means that one can get away with the most stupid moves, as long as one is fast enuff with relocating, this takes the edge off totally.-Revamped human X-Ray Kill cam – The acclaimed X-Ray kill-cam is back and bolder than ever, including a detailed muscle layers, 3D mesh particles and the complete human circulatory system. -->probably the only thing that works, bloody, gruesome and detailed. Not much different from the old bulet cam though-New X-Ray vehicle takedowns – See vehicles disintegrate in intricate detail with X-Ray vehicle takedowns. Multi-stage destruction allows you to take out armoured cars, trucks and Tiger tanks piece-by-piece.--> exaggerated, basically a bullet cam for vehicles, nothing we haven't seen here before I recommend to get the 2nd part of the series for little money, Sniper Elite 3 is not worth the amount of money as it's not delivering on the developers promises. If you like CoD-style shooters with some sneaking and sniping this here might be for you. If you like tactical choices and a sandbox-level design with you deciding the course of action and real tactical posibilities  stay away from this one.Addendum:Now i have been playing some more hours, I admit there are some levels that are better then others - so one get'S a glimpse of what the game could be! Those rare levels are really nice, maybe they will deliver some better DLC. I'd change my recommendation in sofar, that I would give it a try when it's been out some time, has received maybe some DLCs and is available for a reduced price.			"

												I have played all 3 Sniper Elite's in the series and was excited to learn they are working on a 4th. I have also played the Zombie versions of the game (which I didn't like NEAR as much). Overall, this is my favorite in the series and it seems as each release gets more and more polished than the last. While I play single player 99% of the time, I have dabbled in the co-op multiplayer and it is fun but I do wish it allowed multiple snipers instead of the sniper/spotter setup currently. I realize this is technically more correct, we, as players, want to play as the sniper and when we are playing as spotter it feels we are just playing nice until our turn.I really only have a few gripes with the game that I can think of right now. First: (And this is a big one) you can't set your elevation on your scope. Every person that shoots firearms knows you can set your ""zero"" on your scope so that it is ""dead-on"" at a certain distance. Then, you can hold over or under depending on whether the target it closer or further. Second: This whole series has suffered from what I refer to as the ""trigger effect"" where enemies don't appear, or certain things happen until you hit a certain trigger. Usually the trigger is reaching a certain place on the map, or killing a certain person, or percentage of enemies. While not as pronounced as it was on the 2nd in the series, nothing like carefully scouting your approach, then moving forward and hitting a trigger point, and have enemies all around you. Often, once I figured out where that trigger point was, I moved forward until I triggered it, then ran back to my sniper nest and clear a path. Third: Enemies in vehicles see WAY to well. If you have ever been in an armored vehicle or tank, you will know that visibility is NOT their strong point. They should have excellent defense and firepower like they do in real life and do in the game but shouldn't be able to see you near as well unless near an enemy patrol. Fourth: Inconsistant mechanics regarding long range shooting alarming enemies. I have played the game 250+ hours, and still can't determine whether an enemy will hear my shots at a given place or distance except around broken generators and such. Incidentally, it seems logical that if backfiring generators at your location mask your sounds, you should be able to shoot a generator near the enemy and make it back firing then you could shoot towards him even if you are not by a generator any longer. (does that make sense?)A few more ""mentions"" of other things about the game I wish were different. Why can't we jump in the game?I wish you could turn off the wind, without turning off elevation. It is harder to ""feel"" the wind in a game. I had some occasional issues with the game doing a red flicker when SLI was enabled. This was the only game that ever did that. Normally, just changing the resolution and restarting it fixed it. Ironically, I could alternate between two resolutions and they both worked; AFTER the other one messed up. Every time you reload your side arm, it goes through the ""chambering"" animation. Just because you drop the magazine, and put in a full one, doesn't mean the chamber will be empty. Yes, there are a FEW firearms that the magazine is loaded from the top, usually with a ""stripper clip"" where you would potentially cycle it like that, but aside from the M1 Garand rifle and the Mauser C96 (which I don't remember any in the game), nothing should load like that. For a game that obviously desires for accuracy and realism, it seems like an odd oversight.Snipers don't fall for thrown rocks, no way to get them to move short of killing them.			"

												This game fell far from what made Sniper Elite V2 fun, while at the same time fixing a lot on Sniper Elite V2's problems.How does that work? Well in my normal, befuddled, complicated review style I'll do my best to explain.The whole Sniper Elite series revolves around popping a bullet from your rifle of choice into the head of filthy degenerate Nazis (sometimes Russians), hey that's fun right? Yea it is! Except in Sniper Elite 3 you're more likely to be using the Welrod than you are sniping, also likewise using new silent close combat kills which actually do have some pretty wicked kill animations, and while nothings wrong with using CQC executions and the welrod to get into position for sniping, the problem is you're gonna be mostly using the Welrod and CQC to get through the level, there's rarely a place to get into position for sniping effectively making that sniper rifle of your choice on your back more of an optional weapon of choice in a game where the name happens to be SNIPER Elite.Normally in Sniper Elite V2 and Sniper Elite you got from point A to point B, point B being the place where you pull off a sniper shot and take out the target, throughout the game you can find areas where the noise blocks out your shots and you can pick off any soldier with a bit of patience. Now that returns in Sniper Elite 3, but my one big problem is that it feels...placed. Whereas in V2 something like mortars hitting the ground were a boon for pulling off a shot, the fact you use what feels like conveniently placed generators or noise making sources to mask your shot just feels off. It feels less like a perfect chance and more like a part of the game where you just sit, wait for the generator to make noise and pick off the enemy until everything is swiss cheese.Now that's not the ENTIRE case, of course sound masking sources like planes flying overhead return, as do artillery shots of course, but these are strung out so that it feels like you either use the generator or you don't, and if you don't and pull  a sick headshot off in total silence then instead of everyone in a 5 mile radius combing the entire place for you you just gotta relocate.Relocting! Making the consequences of pulling off an unmasked shot null and void. Honestly its not that bad (in the context of Sniper Elite 3), in a game where you can't snipe anything and you gotta get around with the Welrod or the pay2win silenced semi auto; there has to be some kind of leeway that lets you wipe the dust off your rifle and tell someone they can♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in Hell.So why does it feel so bad to me at least? Simple: Shoot someone, relocate, rinse and repeat.And speaking of getting from Point A to Point B, lets talk about the maps! Now, these maps are more open world, meaning you can persue any objective in total silence or loud as♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing wrong with that, I like open maps! Except for the bit where at the end of each level in V2, Point B was the place you gunned down your target, in Sniper Elite 3 you can go through most of the level or the entire level without firing a shot from your rifle. Hell you can take down most of your targets through means that don't involve sniping, that makes the game feel less like Sniper Elite 3, and more of a Stealth Elite 3.But I think the thing that bites me the most is that rifles that were originally part of the base game in V2 are being sold as DLC, I mean yea it's odd to find a Mosin Nagant in Africa, but getting a KAR 98 wouldn't be difficult, instead you get that from DLC as well. It feels like Sniper Elite 3 has fallen to one of the biggest pitfalls the gaming industry is doing nowadays cutting out parts of the game, reselling as DLC.In the end Sniper Elite 3 feels weird, off, it's not what I expected, despite some of the highpoints, honestly I had fun for the first few hours, then the whole DLC bits happened and I noticed this game wasn't as good as I thought it to be, in fact I'd go as far to say that Sniper Elite V2 is the better game, the fact you can actually stealth for once is really nice but the fact that it takes away from sniping hurts on more deeper level, if you really want Sniper Elite 3 I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a price drop.

												Sniper Elite 3 is a third person tactical shooter developed by Rebellion Developments and published by 505 Games. This game was released on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One in June 2014. It is a prequel to Sniper Elite V2 and the third game in the sniper series. The gameplay in Sniper 3 is based heavily on being slow and steady with your approach to completing objectives, with an also strong focus on sniper gun play much like the previous games. What I really liked about Sniper 3 is that the stealthy approach is pretty much the only viable way to go on most missions otherwise you'll just be pinned down in a firefight and outnumbered. The stealth aspect of the game is done extremely well, you probably will be detected by the enemies whilst taking down the guards, but it is all about cleaning up after yourself by dragging bodies to the long grass, or how you escape and hide away until the enemies give up searching for you. You can use various methods to distract enemies such as throwing rocks and laying traps. Before each level you get to choose your load out, you get the choice of a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, side arm, and various other items such as grenades, medi-packs and traps. As you level up between stages you also unlock further rewards and items. Of course, a Sniper game wouldn't be complete without the stunning slow motion graphics of your bullet soaring through the air and them piercing through your foes scrotum, this my friends is the pinnacle of slow motion gaming. Granted after a while you'll be skipping them because they will grow tiresome as they play after every kill with your sniper, but still, this gives you a chance to get some brilliant cinematic screenshots to show off your sniping skills. Graphically, Sniper Elite 3 is gorgeous, I wasn't able to push out full graphic settings on 4k resolution, but even on the lower resolutions (1080p), it still looks stunning. There is a wide array of setting to choose from which is always good to see. The visuals are amazing though, the night time levels really show of the games truly stunning lighting effects as well. I was a little disappointed to see the lens flare effect being used a bit too much, but everything else is truly stellar. The game is fully voice acted, with the enemy soldiers speaking in German too, so subtitles are recommended for that. The sound effects really add an extra level of immersion to the gameplay. A nice feature which is added is that you can disguise your bullet shots underneath the sound of loud sounds in game too, which really helps you in your efforts to complete levels as stealthy as possible. I have to admit, this game is quite difficult, even on the easiest settings; you really do need to take each level with a sense of slow and steady. There is really no point in running in all guns blazing because you will just get gunned down within seconds of being spotted. You will need to backtrack plenty of times in order to escape being detected, you'll be needing to hide in rooms, crawl under buildings, anything which you can imagine you doing in the situation you are in, you can do. The latter levels of the game also ramp up the difficulty significantly as well, as each level slowly introduces more and more enemies for you to deal with. Each level in Sniper Elite 3 is massive. Each level will have its own main objective, but as you progress and reach new areas of the zone, you'll also unlock optional objectives, which can be things such as destroying some trucks, cutting off communication or something searching for secret plans. These optional objectives reward you with additional experience at the end of the level and also add an extra element of immersion to the game as well.  The size of each level really means that you can get stuck in, and explore to your hearts content. There are countless amounts of collectable items for you to find if that is your thing too. Each of the games objectives, whether it be main or optional, will have more than one way of you being able to complete them, which will really add some replay ability to the game on your second run through. I was a little let down by the fact that I finished the game's single player in about five hours, granted I was playing on the easiest difficulty, but for a big  release like this, I was expecting something more to be honest. I can see there being an essence of replay ability due to the nature of the levels being able to be completed in more ways than one, but I would say that there is no real need for playing through the game more than twice at least. There is a multiplayer side to the game, which I tried out, but it seems to be a little on the low side of players, and struggled to actually get into any proper gameplay, because given that it is a sniper based game, most people are camping in well-hidden places just picking people off when they try and complete objectives, for me I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer. Technically, I had a one major problem with Sniper Elite 3, and that was that the game kept crashing on launching the title, it would reach the title screen, but then just crash to desktop. This actually turned out to be an issue with Malwarebytes closing it, so it would be highly recommended that you add the Sniper Elite 3 folder into the exception settings for Malwarebytes if you run that AV. Granted that it wasn't actually Sniper Elite causing the crash, you would still expect the game to have been tested with various popular AVs like this to see if they caused any compatibility problems. My conclusion of Sniper Elite 3 would be that I would only recommend the game as a single player title; because the multiplayer just didn't do it for me. Given that the single player side of the game can be completed in almost five hours, the full price tag of £39, 99 is absolutely absurd, and is actually fairly offensive that they can charge that amount of money for such little content. I would only say this game is worth picking up when it is below the £10 mark, yes the gameplay is top class, and the graphics are stunning, but you can pick up any of the other Sniper games for the same experience in both of those departments for cheaper. Actually saying that, it looks like all of the games in this series are expensive. Definitely wait for sale season to start before adding Sniper Elite 3 to your library. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Excellent game I played the other 2, the game gets better and better with each new version. V3 being the most fun I had in a game in a long time. Played on realistic mode you have to pay attention to wind and bullet drop. Stealth is a must in certain areas, while accuracy is a must every shot. Taking out tanks by shooting the gas tank is far from realistic. All in all the game is far from realistic, but a very enjoyable play none the less. Multiplayer is very fun especially with a group of guys/gals you know. In multiplayer some maps have a CoD feel while others are strickly for sniping. If I was you I wouldn't pass this one up			"

												Horrible stealth gameplay...Not a very good start when the majority of the game is based around being quiet...Let's start with some examples.I threw a rock in a canyon to distract someone.Krauts for miles heard the rock hitting the ground and went to high alert.Welrod rounds can bounce off of garrison/field caps.This will get you killed quite a few times.[At this point, I should mention that you can't save on the hardest difficulty].30-06 rounds also bounce off soft caps and helments...Nice.Germans drink a lot of milk, that's why they don't go down when I shoot them in the spine with the aught-six. Most of the time it takes 2-3 rounds to the chest to kill someone with it. (When in actual combat, not ""sniping"")^extremely realisticMonty fed the commonwealth fruit-gushers, that's why their teeth are purple.Tropical.The multiplayer coop syncing is horrible, germans will slide around and go into t-pose trying to load the correct animations.Your character gives wonderful clues as to when the Korps are going to act on you.""Hmmm...I think I better lay some traps here..."" he blurts out while sneaking down a path.When the♥♥♥♥♥♥does hit the fan, don't try using the melee feature. 100% death. The player's animation goes too long, giving the enemy time to clear leather and kill you before you regain control.I don't know how many of you are big into history...but in all the books I've read and all the documentaries I've watched...Never seen a ""German"" officer's cap like this. I know it's an Italian cap, but I have no idea why it has two stars on it and is being worn by a German.

To the gentleman in the comments.Let's be realistic here, the game gave me an M1 Garand (A weapon with heavy and slow rounds) to be used for sniping. If the developers wanted me to sit there and ""snipe"" they'd have given me something that wasn't semi-automatic and held 8 rounds. They also wouldn't have given me an SMG or grenades. You can hear the character mention that I should lay traps, the player is CLEARLY meant to proceed that way. Sorry that I don't like going to the ""Sniper Nests"" the game marks on my map and attempt to play the game in a sandbox style, like the store page highlights.Furthermore, regardless of how I play the game, the bullet damage still remains the same. In the video you can see me empty rounds into enemies at close range and nothing happens.Perhaps you were distracted by some of the related videos, I'll provide you with a still frame of where I shoot the enemy.http://i.imgur.com/SzW7U4j.pngIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that getting a rifle round through the chest is going to kill you, especially if it's lined up at your spine.I'm curious if you've even played the game. At that part in the level, I am required to go and ""search"" the bodies of the officers I kill. What is the point of me climbing up to some pre-made ""nest"" to kill the officers if I only have to go down there and rub my fingers on their uniforms? It's pointless and a waste of time. The main appeal to the game is a ""sandbox"" approach the missions...			"

 Main game ✓ Good story✓ Sound effects are good.✓ Great graphics especially 	 X Ray Cam	.✓ Gameplay is great when shooting with a sniper in distance will never get you borring.✓ Co op is fun , the whole single player Campaign can be played with a friend and apart from that there are others missions to play with friends too. This is great!✓ Game set location is great(Africa), Large maps and side missions within the map ✓ Multiplayer is hard , but as you get used to it is fun.✖ Short game play time compared to Sniper Elite 2. It feels like the game is smaller that Sniper elite 2. How ever its only a small flaw since the maps are big and side missions are fun. DLC Target Hitler: Hunt the Grey Wolf : Its short but in a large map there are several sub missions and there are several ways you can kill Hitler. This DLC is not bad for the price. Plus if you are achievement hunter you should buy.Save Churchill Part 1 Save Churchill Part 2Save Churchill Part 3The story continues in 3 DLC. For part 2 and 3 there is a new map. Price is high compared to the play time but if you are achievement hunter its for you. Rifles DLC are okay it will come in handy in single player , co op and multiplayer. Skin DLC is only useful in multiplayer. If you are not looking forward to play multiplayer much no use of buying .If you like stealth games its a great game for you.  8/10  "

												A solid entry into the Sniper Elite franchise, Sniper Elite 3 takes the mechanics from Sniper Elite V2 and uses them in better ways.  You play the role of a sniper working with the British military in North Africa during the Second World War.  Really, you're equal parts sniper and spy as your missions have you single-handedly infiltrating enemy camps and bases as you try to find an infamous German general and piece together a plot involving Nazi superweapons.Unlike Sniper Elite V2, the maps in SE3 are much more open and this benefits the game immensely.  Where, in V2, I often felt as though I spent half the game playing run 'n gun with my submachine gun, in SE3 I probably used my SMG less than five times.  Your silenced pistol will still get a firm workout as you move into positions unseen where you can begin to death upon your foes with your rifle.  This isn't a modern era setting shooter though with super-scopes and giant silencers to turn your shots into whispers.  If you want to avoid a straight up firefight, you'll need to time your shots against background noise from low-flying aircraft or sabotaged generators to prevent the enemy from knowing where you're at.  The game manages a good balance by forcing you to be patient as you line up your shots without making the whole ordeal tedious.  There are some stealth mechanics as well including sight indicators, the ability to hide in shadows, guards locating you via sound, etc.  Much of the game is spent creeping around and avoiding conflict until you're ready to bring swift vengeance from your perch. The famous Sniper Elite X-Ray Kill Cam makes its return, now updated to show your bullet tearing into muscle and severing arteries as well as bone and organs.  Curiously, for all the effort into showing me in graphic detail the damage I'm inflicting, every hit in SE3 is a fatal blow.  Shooting someone in the foot was as fatal as expertly putting a round through an enemy sniper's scope and into his brain [Edit: Higher levels introduce much more frequent ""incapacitating"" or wounding shots versus clean kills].  For those feeling squeamish or just bored watching bullet cams, this feature can be easily adjusted or turned off.  I only played through the campaign on the default difficulty [Edit: I've since played through on more difficult settings] which used light ballistics modeling but my understanding is that ballistics on the higher levels remain well done, requiring players to account for bullet drop and wind direction and making rifle characteristics such as scope sway and bullet velocity more important.  It is unfortunate that there are only four weapons in each class (pistol, rifle, SMG) included in the base game.  A wealth of others are available via DLC which, while something of a cash grab, the game redeems itself slightly by including a firing range where you can test fire all the available guns and see which you like before purchasing a weapons pack.The story is nothing special and you won't feel invested in the plot or making sure that you succeed.  The end in particular felt very weak.  However, from a mechanics point of view the game shines and the story is just a contrivance to line up 200m shots and put a bullet through someone's temple as artillery fires in the distance, hiding your presence.  If you enjoyed V2 (or disliked it mainly for its enclosed maps) or if you find yourself playing the sniper in shooters, you'll probably enjoy your run through this title.			"

												I am a HUGE Fan of S.E. V2 and the following zombie games, but this SE3 is just crud. Get it at 10 bucks, not worth more.-1 why is moving so changed, I mean in V2, where you're mouse moved is where you were pointed, so you could walk sideways and all that, this one, the camera is locked to the mouse while you are not, so Good Luck getting into place to snipe through holes and windows.-2 Where the hell did 'Q-get into cover' go? Now I have to fight with getting too close to objects and suddenly poping out into plain view when I draw my gun?? I can't even shallow snipe over boxes without standing right up, might as well yell ""GO JOE"" while I'm at it.-3 You even ruined stealth kills, I'm all sneak sneak sneak, get into range, press E and I Punch the AI, PUNCH THE AI. where the hell did that come from? and Punching won't even kill them, I'm stuck there in a punch battle, trying to kill him quietly cause I'm out of silencer ammo and he's just yelling away, alerting all the AI and while I await my impending doom to restart a long long save ago, I'm just gonna keep punching the AI and imagining its Rebellion.-4 we're gonna make it more authentic by removing subtitles but we're gonna put GIANT Yellow and Red Circles over the AI's, What happened to 'flying by the seat of your pants' and wondering if that AI spotted you and is now looking for you or is on his normal random path, Oh wait, they don't have random paths eithers, they just walk back and forth doing Exactly the same thing over and over, Even in V2, they would do unexpected things, get called over by others after so long, Change. I shouldn't beable to leave my player in an area, come back an hour later and it still be the same stuff happening.-5 I played on Sniper Elite, first thing, so why all the hints and tips and OH theres a grenade right here, hissing just two meters from your foot, be a good lad and Run Away, Come on? seriously? if someones lucky enough to get a grenade in your sniper nest, why are the creators of this game ruining that little bit of fun letting the player notice it coming into the window or not seeing it and dieing.-6 This was going to be a short list but I'm just too annoyed at buying this crud at even just 30 bucks with the 20% discount, but oh wait, theres' DLC's out right now, and Oh look, better weapons in Multiplayer! Lets throw more money at Rebellion for another BUY TO WIN game. I want to throw up, what happened to Earning your upgrades? unlocking and finding secrets?-7 Not only is the menu and loadout setup nothing like SE V2, or SE:NZA or SE:NZA2, its utterely confusing, you now have slots and carry limits, Oh I can only have two of these, but they are each one in each slot, so I'll change this to that and now I can only have one of these from loadout? Oh you can have more if you pick it up, but if you don't have it in a slot, then you don't get to have it at all.-8 Hold your breath is supposed to Stop gun wobbling, NOPE, not here, its worse wobbling than that song.-9 I could play V2 for days, no end, it was pure fun, can't really think of any complaints other than odd AI's, WHY on gods green earth would you 'improve' Everything, If it ain't broke, DON""T FIX IT. This game I could only stand a few hours before I was too ticked off and plant leaves deflecting my bullets and bullets hitting on the right side of my scope when E-hold your breath was putting the little red dot on the left side of my scope, Oh and don't scope snipe while too close to a box, even though you're standing up in plain view, you're gonna shoot the box thats only two feet high.-10 I don't know if I can stand this game long enough to finish it, going by reviews, thats just a few hours if that, worth of 8 maps, I'm pretty sure they are adding in all the 'chapters' too, Like in V2, you'd get to have like four 'chapters' per map, where places you just cleared would get new inforcements placed back so you'd have to fight your way back through alerted AI cause we all know, even though you cleared all the dead, a whole platoon can't just disappear and not get noticed.-11 If someone asks me if I want to play SE3 or SEV2, I'm gonna play SE:V2 Everytime, sequels in games are supposed to be better than the ones before, unlike movies, though with all the money put into the films, Oh wait, they just used blurred drawings for that, guess they broke the budget on making A&P science class worthy bones and guts, Oh wait, those look worse than they do in V2.-12 Random AI-""Hmm, that generator sounds like gun shots now, and this car just blew up beside me, Oh well, I guess that sun is pretty hot, it must be 2789 bazillion degrees or -15q, I think my code will break If I try to think about that too much, maybe I'll rank up, imagine me *code broken, game crashed, you saved over an hour ago without running into any autosave events even though you killed an entire platoon, 20 trucks and 2 generators*-13 it was much better when you marked someone in V2 where they'd just get a white or red V overhead, now you get glowing white shadows showing you Exactly what someone is doing behind a wall, why not just let someone shoot them in the eye through a flag, drapes, and while they are standing infront of another guy you can't see and alert the whole town, Oh wait, that happened too, Tanks mister gen for masking my sound, even though the guy saw his friends head explode, he knows Exactly where I am cause he was out of range of the sound of the gen, but somehow heard my gun go off and pin pointed my location??-14 If I bought this for a gamestation of any type, I'd be at the store returning this right now. I really dont' know if I can stand to put another hour of fighting to stay behind a box and wondering how they saw me when theres a low brick missing from the middle of the wall and they saw my foots shadow and come running, even though I can throw a grenade infront of them under a truck, blow everything to heck and they won't even go on the alert. Whose got two thumbs and isn't buying anything early from Rebellion again? This Guy!-15 If I want to walk sideways while keeping my eye on this guy, then I want to Walk Sideways and not have my player turn his back to the guy so that when I draw my gun I have to find the Guy in question Again, by which time he's already alerted the town cause he saw my shadow in the shadow I was in.-16 When you pick up a body and run to hide it, thats right, You Run, slowly, but Loudly, so you alert EVERYONE, Unless you hold down the Walk button, L alt for me, but theres no hint or guide for that, You just have to figure out you're running slowing and wondering why everyone can hear you Walk Hard.-17 When you find two AI's in each others body, no not that way. Don't shoot them in the head, my bullet headshoted one, but completely missed the other, even though their heads took up the Exact same space! no two for one here, Like shooting fish in a barrel but noone said the barrel was a bottomless well.-18 I really dislike this game, I'm only writing all this out Because of how Great SE:V2 is and will always be, Reb didn't even try to stick to what worked in V2, I can only guess that some new guys were at the water hole and were all ""Dude, lets change EVERYTHING so peps know this game is fresh and hip and made by different peps that know the public are just sheep that'll buy anything with a following"", I seriously hope this was a different team than SE:V2, I'll be seriously disappoint if its the same team.-19 Daylight Happens, its a new challenge to work with, but why not have spent a little and made options for day and/or night maps, Have trucks running in and out during the day and heavy patrols at night? why was 'fixing' V2 or 'starting anew' even considered? Halo and Soul Reaver went 3+ games and each better than the last, because they listened to the public, found and fixed bugs, and made more and more story with each one while keeping to the lore they started.

												My first Sniper Elite game and the experience was pretty good.Thanks to the bullet cam the sniping feels really satisfying, even if, looking at it from the outside, it's a pretty gruesome part of the game.There are ""only"" 8 missions in the game but completing them all while looking for every War diary, Cards and secondary objectives took me 48 hours. Now, I did go a bit too far at times, reloading over and over when something didn't play out exactly like I wanted it to, like that time I wanted to kill 4 circling soldiers back to back with the silenced gun without getting found out or the corpses spotted, but I found that part of the game satisfying as well, since it helped teaching things about the enemies' behavior and the game's behavior.I spent the whole game either sniping, or using the silenced gun/backstab kills so I don't really know how the gunblazing approach works, but I never felt the need to go in gun blazing as crouching down, sniping some and moving out to relocate somewhere else in case a corpse was found/my gunshot was heard was the most enjoyable part of the game.Another nice aspect about Sniper Elite 3 is in the looks department. I found the game to look really well and perform just as well, even on my old 570 and on my 970 now it looks even better.I played it with the Italian VA and I thought it was pretty good, both in the acting part as well as the sound of the voice.All in all, a great sniping game that feels enjoyable where it counts and looks/performs well.

												Sniper Elite III is one of the most controversial games I've played in a past few years. With some people glorifying it's sniping mechanics and the others saying that the game is totally boring. To be honest, I don't know to which side I belong.So let's begin! The story (Spoiler-free) The game is a prequel to Rebellion's 2012 game Sniper Elite V2, and is the third installment in the Sniper Elite series. Sniper Elite III is set several years prior to the events of V2, following the exploits of Office of Strategic Services officer Karl Fairburne as he participates in the North African conflict during World War II, in which he learns of a secret wonder weapon programmed by the Nazi forces. Our main objective is to destory the Nazi super-weapon known as the Ratte and kill the General Franz Vahlen. This surely doesn't sound too interesting, does it? If your answer is yes then you'll be majorly disappointed with storyline of this game as the game's ending leaves no feel of satisfaction or that you've achieved something. The plot is simply not interesting to follow and it's just there to set different locations that you'll travel to. Also the game is only 6 hours long if you try to sneak and play smart (as I did) but if you're going for a fast playthrough than you're risking to spend money on a 4 hour shooting range, rather than a sniper game.  The gameplay The game retains and builds on the mechanics of Sniper Elite V2. Players go through large battlefield maps based on the North African conflict.The sniper rifle is the player's primary weapon, though additional side arms including submachine guns and pistols, silenced or not depending on the situation, are available. In addition to hand grenades, the player can deploy tripwire booby traps, land mines and dynamite. Binoculars can be used to tag enemies in view, displaying their position and movements. The player-character must hold their breath to properly line up the shot. A red icon appears in the scope, marking the projected point of impact (Not always though, it just depends on your difficulty). There are weapon parts spread out all over the game, found when looting dead enemies, allowing players to customize their weapons in the predeployment menu; the menu also allows equipment loadouts.Stealth mechanics have been reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers will also have a circle meter over their heads to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position and the enemy will search a wider area. As in the previous game, loud sounds may be used to mask sniper shots. Though devs claimed that this new stealth is a much more acceptable to stealthy players - it really is not. It still feels clumsy and rushed, just to be there. You'll find yourself shooting your way through most of the game rather than sneaking.A points system is instituted for actions such as stealth close-combat or sniper kills, with the points accumulating towards promotion to higher ranks. Players can go around the map to collect special reward items such as collectors' cards and unlock sniper nests. Journal pages also provide further backstory into the events of the game.V2‍ '​s X-Ray kill cam system is retained as well. Where the previous game only shows the body's internal structure at point of impact, the new game expands to visualize the rest of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and muscular systems. The player can still target vehicles, but now has a chance to shoot the engines and disable the vehicle. Optimization An important point to all of us PC gamers. I'm happy to report - this game is optimized very well and runs extremely smoothly. I had only two major FPS drops through the game which is a great result. The textures look great and the sound quality is really good, I can give only a big thumbs up to Rebellion for their work on the PC version. The verdict Though a lot of negative things have been said - I really liked this game and enjoyed every bit of it, the gameplay and it's variety of approaches to a single objetive and the ability of playing together with a friend only rises the score for me. This game has one of the best sniping mechanics in combination with one of the most boring storylines in the video game industry. Is this 4-6 hours of pure sniping worth it? It's only up to you and your taste if all you care is gameplay - yes, it's gonna be loads of fun (also, you can play with a friend !) . But if you're here for a dramatical and epic World War II story full of historical events, then you're better off with other WW2 games, as I've mentioned - the writing is really boring and not interesting.  I rate this game 6/10 - a worthy 10$ pick up, but nothing more. PS: A big shout out to Chef José, a friend of mine for pointing out a big flaw of this review!			"

												This version is very poor in terms of maps and weapons!in terms of graphs is not too bad but not worth 39.99 poundsand I think you are thinking of doing more DLC for this game and REBILLION will then try to cash out more money from customersthis is very sad on your part to fool customers and say (we sry for fake serials keys) loolSo in my opinion I see only one thing you REBILLION will lose customers!

												I was sniped by a man named ****Snipers. I asked him to explain his hypocrisy. So he said ""He who snipes snipers, runs the risk of becoming a sniper himself. If you gaze into the scope, the scope gazes back"". Did not expect this level of philosophy in a video game.			"

												My game is broken. My bullets come from my forehead, knees and just about eveywhere else except the barrel. The kill cam also seems broken - glitchy and just plain borked. The game is also lacking in content - 4 rifles? 2 coop maps? Stuff that should have been included is now DLC. This whole DLC thing is getting out of control. Pretty soon games will come with one gun, one map and everything else will be DLC. I'm taking a stand from this point forward and not supporting this kind of development process any longer.			"

												Perfect optimalisation, option to complete almost whole game on stealth with melee-only, and satisfying ballistics.They finally added a levelling system with unlocks, and tons of collectibles.The maps are HUGE, and there are lots of hidden passages and intel pieces, also side-missions.The whole game can be played on CO-OP.It's better than SE V2 in every aspect, especially stealth and level design, so if you liked SE V2 there is no reason not to play this game too, unless you hate deserts.If you like stealth games OR sharpshooting games, get this immidiatelly.

												This game just didnt quite do it for me. I enjoyed Sniper Elite 2 but this game almost felt like a step backwards. For one the game tries to push you towards a stealthy approach a lot of the time and sniping takes a backseat. Given sniping is the main draw of this game its an odd development. Another feature is relocating after taking a shot which involves moving a certain distance from where you took your last shot. But its a very exploitable mechanic because you can just shoot an enemy, move away till the rest stop searching and then return to that spot to shoot again. The AI is also really dumb as you can shoot one of them and as long as they dont find you for a couple of minutes will go back to patrolling normally again as if nothing happened. All these negatives add up to a pretty disappointing game.Good Points:- when you are sniping its the most enjoyable part of the game with slow-mo killcams that show the damage your bullet does on an x-ray view of the enemy. It's the most satisfying killcam of any game out there.- Levels are more open now giving you more options in how you approach the levelBad points:- being almost pushed towards stealth instead of going all out with your sniper rifle especially when non-sniping combat in this game is terrible- terrible AI with enemies who'll resuming walking around normally even though there mate was shot through the head before their eyes just a few minutes before- dull story and predictable levels. -relocation mechanic is a nice idea but can be exploited too easilyOverall i can't really recommend this game. Play the better Sniper Elite 2 instead if you want a sniping fix and which will be cheaper as well.			"

												I suppose gameplay is interesting enough, with fun stealth and FPS done reasonably well. But in summary the reason I can't stand this game is that they heavily advertise the ""realistic ballistics"" in the sniping, when, in fact, this game has the worst ballistics I have ever seen. It not only ruins the gameplay, but also puts them squarely under the category of blatantly lying. So if you don't care about reallistic ballistics, then you might have fun. But this was certainly a game ruiner for me.Now for the details. It's time for a quick physics lesson. The bullet from an M1 Garand travels at about 850m/s. Over a shot distance of 70m, that results in a time of flight of 0.082 seconds. In that time, the bullet should drop a grand total of 3.2cm. So if I aim for the back of his head, I should hit a 3.2cm lower spot on the back of his head. In this game, I aim for the back of the guy's head 70m away, and I hit his kidney. After some rough estimates, I find that this requires a time of flight right around .35 seconds, giving a muzzle velocity a bit over 200m/s. Realistic ballistics?It gets better, cause I then went to long range and did some time of flight estimates. I ended up with a bullet velocity of ~750m/s. So their muzzle velocity isn't off, it's their gravity. A quick calculation later shows that their gravity strength is roughly 13*g, well above the point at which everyone would black out. Also, I would weight 2,500lbs. So in short, when they say ""realistic ballistics,"" they are simply lying.Add to that, 100m shots are not sniper shots. Their entire maps aren't big enough from one end to the other for decent sniper shots. So they've compressed the distances and increased bullet drop to the point where even close range shots are practically impossible without using their cheating help reticle.And if your entire game is stealth based, don't make it easier for me just to run through the whole map shooting up the place. Punish the player for not being sneaky.			"

												I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun, short sniper experience.Pro'sAwesome looking bullet camera, where you get to see how you hit your target including x-ray vision.Pretty action packedYou can't just camp and win. There's a system where you need to keep switching places after firing your rifle. It's really cool, but has some downsides to it.Really manages to set the tone with the whole desert theme they have going on. I look forward to what they can do with other themes in their future games of the series!A small detail worthy of praise: they didn't use swastikas, rather something they made up themselves. I thought that it was a good solution to not offend anyone and still create an authentic atmosphere (with the different icon showing up in various places).ConsEven on the hardest difficulty, this game proves little challenge. It really boils down to sniping someone, moving out of the 30 (or 50) meter range, and then moving back to get the next target. You have to move, because else the enemy ""figures out"" where you are because of sound. I really liked that (hence it's noted as a pro), but what I really disliked is that you could move back to exactly the same spot as before. It'd be a far greater challenge if you wouldn't be able to use the spot anymore where you last fired. They made the AI seem intelligent... but actually not once you figure out how it works.The sidequests during missons and unlockables mean too little to actually add to the game. There's a silent pistol (the welrod) that you get from the start, but all of the other pistols aren't silent so I ended up never switching pistols for example. At least give the other pistols their own special things too! I also would've loved some cool new outfits, perhaps even different characters (as this person is totally not worked out story-wise out it could've really been any john doe in the main role)Campaign mode is a little short. They really nailed the whole sniper feeling, but the game offers nothing more than that so it's over quickly. I would've liked it better if it wouldn't be all these missions leading up to killing one big guy (minor spoiler: not even with a sniper rifle, that's kind of.. odd wouldn't you say?). I really would've liked it better if each map would have one key figure of the enemy army with their own little backstory and base.The bullet camera for every. single. kill. After seeing it over a hundred times, I ended up turning it off as far as I could via the options. It's definitely cool and all but gets stale quickly if it's used so many times (literally for every single sniper rifle kill)The game often bugs out. This ranges from your screen freezing (but the game still plays, for example i can hear myself shooting), tabbing out by itself without being able to tab back in (also the game still plays), savegames loading a slightly different situation than before, the game just completely quitting to desktop, et cetera. I've played quite a few steam games now, but this one must've been the most buggy of them all. I've had at least one ""game ending bug"" happening per level.  "

												What a massive let down, after playing sniper v2 for 18 hours, I would have thought that the problems from that game would be fixed in this one, not only have they not been fixed but some more problems has arisen. firstly with The AI, somehow they are even more stupid in this game than the ones in v2, when a shot was fired in v2, the AI would become aware and stay aware, they would not settle down until they found you, with this one, if a solder simply cannot find you in the area where the shot came from, he will go about his normal business, i understand that it would make the game more challenging, but all I ask is for this to be an option.Another more obvious problem is a lack of content, only 4 sniper rifles in the entire game? really? but little did I know that there was DLC, if you wanted more sniper rifles, then you had to cough up some cash, £2.99 for a weapon pack, that includes a sniper rifle, a side arm and a machine gun or trench gun, but lets face it, all your really buying is the sniper rifle, as this is the weapon you will use 80% of the game.Apart from better textures, animations and slighly bigger maps, the game itself is just lazily put together, many people are saying it is at least better than v2, but I would disagree, with a setting like Africa, fighting along side the british and common wealth, you would exept a different, maybe more interesting character to play as, but NOPE, boring american stereotype it is then, could have played as a british sniper, or a french legionaire♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the nazi's for invading his home land, or an australian sniper fighting in the common wealth army, imagine how fun the game would be if you got to play the sniper from tf2, but as usual, we are given the same boring, american 'badass'. In some games the american stereo type works, such as star craft 2, tf2, uncharted, etc.My final thoughts on the game is that it is definetly not worth the 39.99 price they have put on it, I bought it for 26.76 in a steam sale and I still feel robbed, with the lack of content and bug fixes, I do not consider this a game worth buying.3/10 :(			"

												Is it better than V2? Yes, definitely. So, what's changed in Sniper Elite 3? Here's a random list of improvements:- Maps are now more open, with multiple paths and multiple sniping positions.- Stealth works as it should, you can stealth though most of the game if you so desire. And every mission can be completed without raising any alarms.- You can hide dead bodies.- You can use foliage to hide yourself.- Relocation mechanics - move often to confuse the enemy.- Health regen is gone. That's right, medkits and bandages are back.- The highest difficulty setting is pretty much free of any handholding. No minimap, no more color-coded vehicle weak spots. Now you have to figure it out by yourself.- Sound masking now works as it should. Everything loud enough can be used to mask your shots, even grenade explosions.			"

												I dont know if they fired everyone from the studio after Sniper elite v2 but this game feels like it wasnt even developed by the same team.-Still buggy, like there are times when your rifle simply wont fire.-Repetitive as ♥♥♥♥-Story is as generic as a story can be. Prob took 2 min. to write.-I dont even know why this game is called sniper elite, this is more like a ♥♥♥♥ed up splinter cell. You only use your rifle about 30% of the time, the rest is the welrod. You spend most of your playtime in close quarters, sneaking around meleeing enemies. The game is just ISNT set up to play as an actual sniping game. If you want to go realistic and turn off tactical assistance, you will realize the game wasnt made to work like that. It is barely possible to play it that way. A lot of the time I got so frustrated and bored I whipped out the ♥♥♥♥ing mp4 and mowed down the nazies, and running around the map liek some cod multiplayer match, and it GOT THE JOB DONE FASTER AND BETTER THAN IF I HAD TOOK THE STEALTH APPROACH. In a sniping game that should NOT happen!A waste of 10 euros....			"

												Kind of disappointing-- 'think I like V2 more. SE 3; very short campaign, moronic in some ways, not a fan of 'veggie' environments... However. Nice graphics, lots of PC options; controls, drop-down console, etc.  In addition, the challenge mode makes no sense whatsoever. It's unclear where to go, doesn't seem to have a ranking system, just a shooting range ...This game seems to be overly DLC driven. I think this would be fine if purchasing a season pass on sale. In the end, I'll shelve this game for now. "

												I was hoping that this game would be similar to the Sniper Elite V2 but it ended up being a disappointment. At least for me, it seemed to be Sneaker Elite Welrod Edition rather than Sniper Elite because of the relocate indicator and I didn't feel like running trough half of the map in order to make another shot undetected.  And when you actually had a chance to make silent shots, you didn't really want to use them because they felt so scripted. For instance, in V2 you shot during mortars to hide your shots but in Sniper Elite 3 you masked them by breaking a conviently placed generator. It felt rather strange that they made it be a stealthier game without adding more effective ways of doing it that way.And this gets me to the second point which is that the atmosphere was flat. Nothing really seemed to matter and surroundings didn't feel like they belonged in a Sniper Elite game. Also the story was extremely vague and the ending was anticlimatic. You were just given some orders and then you went on to complete them. It actually seemed more like a group of separate missions than a game with a story. Then there were a lot of issues while playing the campaign with a friend. It kept on disconnecting from the game even though both had no connection issues whatsoever. And what's worse, it made you go through the same mission from the start everytime it did this. Also the price of 45,99 € is waaaay too much for this game, I wouldn't buy it for more than 10 € especially since it takes you about 7-8 hours to finish the game. All in all, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Quite a few improvements over the previous game. Improved Stealth mechanics, maps are much larger and wide open which is great for you long range marksman ;).One of the major downsides though is how dependant on DLC it is. If you want to unlock more than the 3-4 rifles they give you you're gonna have to shell out some cash.Multiplayer isn't very crowded, but that's not too much of an issue for me as Ive always been in it for the single player and coop.Would I suggest buying this game at it's current price? Hell no.If it ever goes on sale for 50-75% off then it's definetley worth looking into, but as it currently stands it's nto worth the 50 dollar price tag.			"

												Well I have been playing the game for a while now and there is some things that I like and things that I don't like.The graphics look really nice and so does the maps, all the effects are amazing too, the game can be played completely using only stealth (silenced pistol, stealth takedowns) and the AI is actually smart and the game seems to have a very interesting story. I also really like the menu that you can open by pressing Q, it makes getting different equipment a lot easier.The rifle customization is also a really nice feature, you can change the scope, barrel, stock & action on your rifle in the Loadout menu.However, they haven't added any new weapons to the game or that much new equipment (if I remember correctly SEV2 didn't have med packs & bandages) but I'd say those are pretty small things compared to how much good things there are in this game.It's a really great game and I really recommend getting it!

												What's not to like .  Enjoyed all 119 hours of game play from the missions ,multiplayer ,Co-Op ,weapons  upgrades and storyline . Everything I thought it would be for stealth and sniping  .Bought it on sale for $24.00 including all DLC's  and worth very dollar  .  From the time I started playing never stopped and put all my Steam time into this game to reach 100% completion.  I consider myself a sniper in battle games by trade and would recommend this to anyone  who is fanatic about stealth, sniping and sniper rifles. The X-ray cam is awesome and settings can be adjusted to limit the amount of gore you want to see to  none if desired. Four skill levels makes it nice for the novice to expert.The 'Authentic' skill will be challenging as there are no save points ,saving games, loading or checkpoints. So any time you die you start the mission over from the beginning no matter how close to the end you are. Did I mention how much I loved playing this game !!?			"

												Game does not live up to the hype, the price, or the title. Should be called ""Pistol Elite III"", because you are going to spend most of your time with that beautifully modelled sniper rifle slung on your back, while you sneak around with a silenced pistol shooting drone AI in the back of the head from 20 feet. Alternately, you can have even less fun with the ""takedown"" mechanic, aka sneak up on the guy and stab him. How sneaking around head-shotting people with a pistol and stabbing guys in the back came to be the dominant mechanics in a ""sniper"" game is rather beyond my ability to comprehend, but there it is, for what it's worth, which is approximately nothing. I've only played on authentic level so I don't know about all the aids, but I will say that the developers have made a decent attempt at recreating real-world ballistic physics. It is not perfect, by any means, and seems to incorporate some random elements that are difficult to explain and rather puzzling. I can see that weapon ranges, bullet drop etc have had to be scaled to fit the rather puny maps, because consoles could never handle the size of maps that would be necessary in order to accomodate realistic weapon ranges. Yes, it's very DLC heavy. I bought it on some super sale and got the whole works relatively cheaply, and still feel ripped off. Either way, you shouldnt be paying extra to get a few decent rifles in what is trying to pass itself off as a sniper game. Smells like a money grab when content that should have shipped with the game comes out as day one DLC.There are other oddities that make this game much less than it appears to be. I've often shot guys square in the chest with a high-powered sniper rifle, seen the blood fly, and a few seconds later, they shake it off like a wet dog and they are good to go. I'm not sure what that's all about, but you'd think getting shot in the chest would actually hurt at least a little bit, or at least knock the wind out of a guy. Also questionable are such things as knocking out a Tiger tank by shooting it in the muffler with a rifle, but whatever.The developer appears to have abandoned this game already, probably out of embarrassment, so don't count on any tech support or answers to your emails. ( see forum post Random Crashing) In summary, it's a great looking game, the weapons are beautifully modelled, the story and main character are bland, generic, uninspired and totally cheesy, the ""open-world"" consists of two-or-three rails instead of just one, the maps are tiny and constricted, I could go on. The bottom line is that this game fails absolutely in delivering the goods as far as being a sniper game. It's a generic rail stealth shooter where you get to use a sniper rifle once in a while, and then run away, oh I mean ""relocate"". Entirely underwhelming game experience, major disappointment, regret buying.I give it one star, based on the very detailed graphics. If ReBillion would like more stars for this game additonal stars can be purchased on my store page for $9.99 each.			"

												This review is limited to the single-player campaign. There isn't much of a multiplayer community left. I enjoyed Sniper Elite 3. The game looks great and it's fun sneaking around and sniping people. There are only 8 missions in the single-player campaign, but each map is very large and will take a while to complete. I wouldn't pay the full $50 sticker price for just 8 missions, but if you buy the game on sale it's fine. The level design is a bit uneven. Maps 1-5 are ok, 6-7 are very good, and the final map is awesome. The game also gets more fun as you go along. At first you're just dealing with rifleman, but by the final mission there are enemies wileding rocket launchers, enemies riding tanks, and enemy snipers in ghilli suits. SE3 is more limited than other war-themed shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield. There are no vehicles to ride and every stage is set in North Africa, but with only 8 missions it doesn't overstay it's welcome.In terms of DLC, definitely buy Saving Churchill. The Hunt for the Gray Wolf is not nearly as fun and can be skipped. Weapons packs aren't really necessary (in fact they kind of detract from the fun of earning the non-DLC weapons during the campaign, as whatever DLC weapons you buy become available immediately). But if you must, the best packs are the Axis weapons (which gives the Type 99 sniper rifle) and the Camo weapons pack (which gives a semi-automatic suppressed pistol).8/10			"

												So, after completing the story over 40 times (atleast), reaching lvl50 ingame and getting every single achievement on the game I can savely say that this game is probably the best follow up after Sniper Elite 2 that a gamer could've hoped for. Although the game has some issues of it's own, which haven't been fixed even though the game has been ""live"" for almost 2 years now. The controls are smooth and easy to understand and remember and the story gives you a good allround vision on where the story is leading to. I sincerely do think the ending was superb and interesting, since well let's be honest... no one expected the Ratte to be real right? Also  a plus was the co-op options for both co-op missions and campain itself, this makes for a very fun time with friends and ads to the game value. Although I do think the game is slightly overpriced at the moment (€45,99) I would say buy it if you can. But remember you need to have the season pass to have the full experience. Otherwise you'll struggle alot stealthing the game on higher difficulties. Beside that the season pass offers you extra missions and alot of new weapons. Which is totally worth it.Well that's it I guess, I recommend this game for any lover of 3th person shooters with awesome bullet mechanics (slow-motion) and great overall gameplay & experience.I'm sorry if my english isn't perfect, I'm not a native english speaker.

												I don't support  Rebellion studios anymore for what they are to trying to do to the studio which created Sins of a Solar Empire:Rebellion. Go read about it. Their monsters, basically known as trademark hawkinghttp://www.pcgamer.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-studio-speaks-out-against-new-rebellion-legal-action/*Edit* I've been getting some comments about them just trying to protect their trademark. Let me clarify: This is not what their doing. Their trying to trademark the english WORD rebellion, and then going out of their way to sue any other company using the word rebellion in their game title. So with sins of a solar empire:rebellion, Rebellion studios ordered the studio who created(SINS) to retract all sold copies and rectify them/change the lore, based on the fact that the smaller studio was trying to trick customers into buying their product by welching off the name of a bigger company (short and sweet). Rebellion studios and the two brothers who own it knew full well (as became apparent in the ensuing court case) that this was simply not true, and Ironclad tried to civilly sort things out at first, but Rebellion went ahead and immediately sued, with the goal of sinking Ironclad into bankruptcy. Ironclad managed to win the case (And Rebellion had to recompense Ironclad for the legal costs of a clearly ridiculous case) and in a good spirit did not publicly ostracize Rebellion for it. But now Rebellion are launching new cases against Ironclad the world over, despite there being no threat on their trademark, and making their intentions clear...*deep breath* All I can say is, do some research into trademark hawking, what it is, clear cut cases of it, and what it's doing to the games industry (Particularly indy developers)...otherwise:Haters gonna hate.As for this game, well, let me put it this way...You won't be doing a whole lotta sniping. The best part of the game is the multiplayer, but here goes:The sniping (and ballistics): Roughly 3/4 of the game you will spend in close quarter combat (within 30m), and most of your kills will be with your smg. You can take the initiative to locate a good sniping spot, but to get there usually requires eliminating most of the guards (or spending a good half hour 'sneaking around', which sounds fun and tactiful, but becomes incredibly monotonous and repetitive. As for the actual shooting, it's almost laughable. Even firing at a target 50m away can be difficult, as a moderate wind can displace the bullet by up to half a metre (Note I said moderate wind, not even strong. But apparently they think moderate winds are so powerful they'd blow you off a CLIFF, which is how strong they'd have to be to affect a bullet like they do in this game), leading to some incredibly frustrating moments when you miss a perfectly easy shot (To anyone whose fired a gun before, you know just how stupid the shooting mechanic is). Long story short, I was hoping for an excellent sniping shooter with the as-advertised highly advanced, realistic bullet mechanics. This is not what Sniper Elite is.Instead, you have a mediocre shooter which has a majority of close quarter combat and some ranged, incredibly exaggerated bullet balistics. Upping the difficulty doesn't make the a.i. more intelligent, or change the scenarios or patrols. Rebellion were lazy and rather than making more difficult scenarios simply changed the 'wind' factor to ridiculous levels...Once you fire, most enemies within several hundred metres instantly know where you are and swarm to your location, nullifying all your hard work anyway. At which point, the game stagnates into a run-and-gun, duck and cover shooter, like for example, Gears of War. It's at this point most players figure out the best thing to do is ditch your sniper and just start shooting everything that moves with your smg. And it's a much more consistent shooter (Also, turns out a full auto smg hits stuff better than the rifles at 50m, who knew, eh?)Stealth is an option, it's just not fun to play (Even with the traps), or tactfully sound. It's just plain frustrating because of the BAD game mechanics.			"

												So, I bought this game years ago.. *crash*.... and played the first couple mission.  *crash*  Came back to it recently, hoping to fin..*crash*.. ish it up.  Imagine my *crash* surprise when it will no longer work as it did.  *crash*  It now has a really annoying problem of crashing.  Repeatedly.  Endlessly.  I've scoured the internet, tried every 'this worked for me'.  None of them have worked for me.  Completely, and utterly frustrated with it.  Love the game... when you can get it to work.  Story is.. okay, whatever.  We are only here for the sniping, the stealth, and the abstract thinking of how best to take out this latest base set before us.  It sucks that it's no longer stable... and with Sniper Elite 4 out... does anyone really expect them to come back, and patch this?  Course... I had thoughts of buying 4, but with 3 not working, I'm leery of spending cash on a game that might not work in 3 years.  I mean... god... how old is Mass Effect?  It still works fine on my system... but a 3 year old game crashes more than a drunk redneck in a demolishion derby?  Until I see some posts about a patch.... don't recommend.  Keep your money.  I'll be keeping mine.			"

												I can only recommend it for LAN Parties, as the multiplayer deathmatch is a phenomenal vertical slice of what Sniper Elite should be. Cautious, tactical, and satisfying sniping against human opponents. Against friends, it's amazingly fun and engaging.The online multiplayer is basically dead, so I would pass on that.As a single player game, it jolts up and down between boring and frustrating. If you want a good single player sniping game, go play Sniper Elite 2. This experience is plagued by issues with AI and hit detection.The world of Sniper Elite 3 wants you to take it seriously. Bushes provide extra cover, loud noises cover your shots, dark areas provide extra concealment, and enemies react to nearby sounds to determine your location. It favors realism.However, at the same time, enemies will occasionally see you through solid brick walls, hear you walking while you are 50ft underground in a concrete bunker, and can somehow distinguish when nearby footstep noises are American versus Nazi. I can kill a squad of enemies with a grenade, setting off a chain reaction explosion that looks like fireworks against the quiet night sky. No one is alerted by that. I can trip on some stairs 3 stories up inside a solid brick building during a thunderstorm, and everyone outside the building heard me.If you are spotted on higher difficulties, the AI will plug your coordinates into their Nazi GPS locators, making it nearly impossible for you to escape. You can duck into an underground tunnel and sprint half way across the level, yet somehow they still know exactly where you are. You'll spend the majority of your time in stealth, and mostly using your silenced sidearm rather than your rifle. The few moments where you are allowed use of your rifle via sound masking almost feel like the game is patronizing me. Some levels forego use of the rifle entirely, as there are rarely any good shots available that won't blow your cover.This begs the question, why is this not called Spy Elite? You spend most of your time stealing documents and infiltrating quiet compounds. Getting discovered is a death sentence. It almost seems counter-intuitive to send a sniper with a loud offensive weapon, when the actual goal is to be quiet and stealthy.Right, getting off track. TL;DR the AI bugs destroy immersion pretty fast. Get it only for the LAN multiplayer if that floats your boat. Everything else is a bit of a wash.			"

												Every Sniper Elite game is better than the last, they always get improved with better gameplay and graphics. However it has quite a few flaws and broken mechanics.  The Stealth : The enemies have the eye-sight of moles and the hearing of a whale. An example on how poor the stealth can be is on one of the levels your in a bunker underground and enemies are above you, yet if you run down there they get curious and go down there. The Story : As usual with every Sniper Elite game they have the creativity of a potato and are sadly far too short! Gameplay : It is decent and fun but can become repetitive quickly but I still enjoyed it all the way through.All in all it isn't a bad game but none of the Sniper Elite games are worth their full price, wait for a sale.

Its no Crysis but looks great to me.They added med kits and stealth is a little easier since now since the AI checks out where you were last spotted instead of instantly knowing where you are.Story makes no sense, but who gives a ♥♥♥♥, you're the sniping god.

												This game does so much WORSE than its forerunner Sniper Elite V2.- The killcam is a mess with its bad camera angle and freakingly slow speed.- The KI is even more dumb and hyper-sensitive to blind angles.- The animations (eg for an exploding gas tank) are not as detailled.- You get stuck on invisible walls (eg in the last level on EVERY FUDGING lamp you come across).- The story is even more off.- You fu**ing can't shoot through FLAGS but enemies can! WOW!- The levels are all the same.- Turn the killcam off and headshots don't seem to count as headshots (I mean they flinch but don't die on the first shot).- Just open fire and kill everyone on the battlefield - no biggy.- Leveling for single player is unnecessary! Just a way to anger you 'cause you're not able to upgrade your rifle!- Every rifle feels alike!- You've gotten fat and so you make too much noise ""climbing"" (rather stumbling) downhill.Here's some positive stuff:+ You are able to relocate.+ Objectives are much clearer.+ Tanks/Trucks are more difficult to destroy.+ More options in noise covering.+ Your actions (reloading, searching bodies, etc) take time which is displayed.Those few pluses do not weigh in comparasion to what the game actually destined to be. A cheap sequel to the 2nd part which the devs did not improve at all. There's just too many negative aspects that I can't recommend this game anymore. Stay with Sniper Elite V2 if you don't want to get disappointed: ""The war was over but a new one had begun: The Cold War!"" That's what I had wished for, not Africa... shame :\			"

												Controls are very loose. It feels like you're 90 and are trying to control your bowel.Sounds assets are poor. You somehow make less noise while sprinting. And your rifle shots sound like you're firing pak 88.Models of some walls and fences are bigger than the actual textures therefore you sometimes shoot and think you should hit the target but the bullet goes into the wall in front of you.Camera is simply horrible and often won't allow you to shoot not to mention that it's behind your right shoulder which means that you can't peek corner left without taking damage.Cooperative is unstable - you suffer from desync, delay and disconnects.Buying a game without season pass means that you'll be stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rifle during the whole campaign and chances are - even after finishing it still won't have anything decent.Campaign missions are poorly made and you will suffer from enemies spawning right in front of you and behind your back. Allied AI in the one of the missions literally makes you wait three times for several minutes just standing still and not progressing while nothing happens.Every single SMG in the game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥with insane spread and non existing damage rendering a secondary weapon effectively useless and turning it into just a decoration on your back. SMG spread in this game is so huge, you need to name it Dumbo.Apparently shooting someone in the balls is a good thing in this game. You get an achievement for that. That's just not cool. It's simply wrong.P.S.: I played through the whole thing. If you look at my achievements you can see that. Have no clue why it says that I played only 32 minutes.			"

												This game isn't great. Good, but not great. I feel like the 2nd one had more work put into it. The Zombie ones are by far the best. The Good	+Graphics aren't bad+X-ray is pretty cool+Killin' Nazi's The Bad -The AI isn't very smart at all-Too many times I find out that I can't shoot though invisible walls-Gun customization seems almost pointless. I.E. Why upgrade my gun for better damage but lose accuracy and gain recoil when I'm getting 1 shot headshots to begin with?-Pretty short game.-Ending was incredibly underwhelming. Overall Rating	I'd give it a 6/10. Worth buying on a Steam sale. Not worth $49.99 new.			"

												After playing and absolutely loving Sniper Elite V2, I decided to purchase the 3rd installment in the series only to be disappointed by the fact that all of the maps have been scaled down to CoD esque sizes with ballistics that make me feel like I'm shooting at nazis with a slingshot. The cover system works fine, the pistols are going to be your main weapons, and there's a giant pay wall just for some guns that you could just unlock in V2. It's called SNIPER Elite 3, but considering any distance beyond 100m is going to be blocked off by countless walls and weak AI, you can't even treat the game with any careful marksmanship. Overall I find this a very bland experience that just sucks the money out of your wallet rather than creating an enjoyable experience that you'd actually want to play through.			"

												This is a very fun game, but for me I have a particular issue with it consistently locking up at the most inconvinent times.  I play it for 3 hours with no problem, I save the game, and I properly exit the game.  The next time I play, I will play for 10 minutes and it freezes up on me; I proceed to go back into the game, and it does the same thing.  It has gotten to the point where I will play for three 3 to 5 minutes at a time before it locks up on me again... I am no computer genius, but I am technically capable enough to be able to tell you that there are no corrupted save files nor are there any corrupted game files; additionally, I am playing on a gaming desktop computer, so I do know that there is no way that the issue is with my platform...  The little bit of the game that I am able to play before it locks up is thouroughly entertaining, however, it is impossible for me to play Sniper Elite 3 at this time.			"

												Urgh. I gave up on this game after like level 3 - the one where I couldn't see a direct route to my next waypoint, so I literally murdered an entire Crusades-era citadel full of dudes one nazi at a time by timing my shots to coincide with planes flying overhead so nobody would hear my rifle shots.Then I went to collect the piece of intel I was sent in for, which tripped off a cutscene and three officers show up and proceed to wander aimlessly around this totally abandoned citadel, picking their noses and absentmindedly walking past abandoned guardhouses, checkpoints, destroyed AAA batteries and, oh yeah, piles and piles of dead soldiers. All with me crouch-walking about 25 meters behind them in my fetching Allied Forces uniform, because when the enemy is this stupid, even snipers can't be arsed trying to blend in.This was all on the difficulty mode for 'masochists and sniping experts'.Quite honestly, Hitman: Blood Money got the balance between difficulty and realism for a stealth game right about 10 years ago and it didn't need to make pretentious claims about ""realism"" doing it.Screw this game. It's fun to ask that grown adult who collects the supermarket trolleys from the carpark how much change I should have gotten from $10 for a $9.85 shopping bill just to see what he'll do, but even when I know these guys were responsible for the the holocaust it isn't enough to drown out the guilt I feel for picking on the intellectually handicapped to this extent.I hope I haven't wasted my money with Styx too.

												I was so ready to love Rebellions sequel to what was possibly the greatest underdog of the decade. More than just an unexpected success, Sniper Elite V2 was a game that promised to really blossom and overcome its kinks the second time around.Instead what I'm left with is a game that apparently got so drunk on victory champagne it ended up vomiting all over the lessons it should've learned about itself and its audience after that initial success.From the start of the game you have charts popping up left and right, telling you absolutely nothing the interface hasn't already spelled out for you with caps lock clarity, and that is not a compliment. The interface, once subtle and functional, is now glaring and overreaching, robbing you of any immersion in a game world so many decades from producing its first tamagochi, let alone its first hamfisted digital overlay.Deserts are quite possibly the worst place to set your game if you're building a corridor shooter, and Rebellion does it with all the psychopathic unease of a neatly composed Ikea sales display. It won't take René Magritte to tell you that you aren't looking at a desert, though I'm amazed the game didn't have a chart spelling that out for you.Of course the self-inflicted wounds don't stop there.The killcam has devolved from a rewarding, finely tuned mechanic to a creepy disruptive anatomy class, and removing the previous games awkward cover function would be a great decision if only the game allowed you to shoot over low walls while crouched. A much needed save function inexplicably extends into Sniper Elite difficulty offering unlimited saves, eliminating any real tension lest you sabotage yourself, which won't ever be a realistic expectation on a player.But that is Sniper Elite III in a nutshell. A game that caters to everyone, equally poorly.More than an evolution, it's a flashy overproduced lobotomy of the original. It's an empty ghillie suit that has had its brain as well as its heart gouged from it in slow motion with a .308 caliber spoon, leaving the rest of the world to wonder why something that was rough but in no way broken had to be so violently and carelessly ""fixed"".

												for £40 i would not say thats a good price at all.pro: graphics are much better than in v2.more open areas across maps for different play styles. xray kill cam cons: AI are worse than they are in v2 in terms of detection and in general intelligence. you have to use the focus ability on nearly every shot you take because there is no way to steady you're aim without using it so you scope sways like mad no matter you're stance unlike in v2 you could do so.alot of guns and content that should be in the game you have to buy for DLC to use them.customizing options are very lazy and limited. stealth gameplay is very boring, limited, lazy and repetitive with no uniqueness throughout the game just the same all the way through and felt more encourged just to go in gun's blazing or just sniping not being bothered about being detected.main character is boring and underdeveloped.combat I.E the sniping is ineffective at time Example shooting an enemy in areas like the spine or other large areas can sometimes kill them in one go but more often than not it will take 2-3 shoot to kill one bloke.very few maps and levels in campiagn and multipalyer which has very few game modes.to sum up the game: V2 was better in alot of ways game feels unfinished and Ill thought out either they released it to early or they just chucked it all together not really trying or taking there time with it to make more fair and better decisions.

												Sniper Elite 3: Now with less sniping! Now, in order to snipe, there has to be something silencing your shots, which never happens so every time you want to snipe, your position is blown and you have to move around for 5 minutes, wait for the alarm to stop and then take another shot, wait another 5 minutes. Lather, rinse, repeat. As far as I can see, there is no silencer for any of the sniper rifles so now they punish you for using your sniper rifle. I like the level progression system and everything, but the fact that I cannot use my sniper without feeling like I'm being penalized means that Sniper Elite 3 is more like Gunner Elite 3.			"

												Well what can i say ive bought the rifles and bought the DLCs and at the moment away to buy more sniper rifles,i love this game i like everything about it only if i had some friends who play it to would be better for the co-op levels not tryed them yet.So the game well if you just want to have fun play it on easy half time you can just take them out with hand to hand combat and a knife.You see am a gamer i dont moan about the normal things. I like a game for its fun and enjoyment and that i get lots of in this game.Survival mode is just fun,but like any game if you want to ramp up the levels and make it harder and believe me it does get harder then your levels take longer to play and you have to use more stealth and tactics.On a closing note i bought this game when it first came out 30 odd pound for it,if you want this game and you get it on STEAM sale grab it.Ive found nothing on this game that makes me think god that rubbish or OH YEY I DONT THINK SO,some of the sniper shots you make during the game you will think are awesum and ive not seen so much blood for a long time,shoot the grenade on there waist belts and watch then exsplode,or exsplosives and take out a group of soldiers.If this is a game you want and watch gameplay and video of it and think god i so want this game,you will not be dissapointed.90 hours gameplay on this game and still going.

												Sniper Elite 3 is a very arcadish take on being a sniper/marksman.pros:-runs well -levels more open ended then previous sniper elites-cool bullet camcons:-AI is comparable to 2002 AI-main character is a pro-sniper, yet somehow has trouble firing a SMG at ranges of 5 meters-no ability to manually lean-camera can sometimes be horrible-no weapon resting-over-exaggerated bullet drop-no weapon sway/ almost none-online is dead, couple servers online but the admins on them are horrible-branded as a game with open levels, while this is true it's no where near as open as games such as crysis(from 2007!)-the collision on some meshes are horrible, making you hit a hidden wall from time to time. -the stealth gameplay is a total joke, often you walk in on german/ italian soldiers all watching the same direction, no one seems to think it's a smart idea to cover their rear-historic accuracy is also something this game seems to lack a ton ofthe only time i will ever recommend this game is if it's on sale for less than 10 bucks or if you're a big fan of extremely arcadish sniping, and even then battlefield has more in-depth sniping than this.

												Hey Rebellion, perhaps you should put out a DLC to fix the terrible crashes every 15 minutes that you're blaming on Nvidia drivers (except when you roll back to version 376.33 which you say should fix it, it doesn't). Because apparently you don't really care about fixing your game, you just want that sweet sweet DLC money. Fifty dollars so I can restart the game every 15 minutes and constantly hit F5 because I don't know when it'll crash - no thanks. What a crock of♥♥♥♥♥♥ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, at least until they decide to fix their bugs.			"

												Going to be completely honest.  I was super hyped for the game, waited a long while for it to go on sale to buy.  It plays in the style of a one-man-army, you're an elite sniper who infiltrates enemy lines and completes various tasks.  My first issue is with the Sniping mechanics. They're sort of only halfway there.  For example, when sniping, you need to take into account bullet drop. Fine.  But you don't need to lead your bullet whatsoever, if someone is sprinting a mile away and you are able to click on them then it is a guarenteed kill. All weapons in the game are hit-scan, meaning the bullets hit their target the instant you click.My second issue are the in-game hints.  There are vaious things in the game that can mask your gunfire.  One of which is  some sort of little generator that is sprinkled throughout the game.   But literally every time I see one, even super late game, my character says ""I bet I can mask my shots if I wait for that thing to make noise"", even if I walk away from it and come back 30 seconds later.The final nail in the coffin is Stability.  I have modern hardware, everything up to date, supported OS ect. But within the first 3 hours of gameplay, I crashed 3 times, losing progress each time.  I've had save files corrupt, Objectives get stuck so that I can't continue with the story. Just seems to have too many problems to be at it's normal pricepoint of $40			"

												I wish Steam would give you the opportunity to give star ratings. This game wasn't bad. But I decided to not recommend it because it's not what I expected it to be.There is a great deal of  third-person, tactical shooter, stealth video games out there but when watching the ads I thought ""Hey this game looks intelligent enough, maybe it's what I'm looking for"". I should have read the description on the back of the cover, which puts it pretty bluntly:""Stalk the shadows or go loud"".Yup, that's pretty much this ""stealth"" video game in a nutshell. It doesn't matter how you play it. Wanna sneak around headshotting people with a video-game-level-silenced Welrod and choking people? Or do you just wanna run around shooting people? It's your choice, and it doesn't make a difference.Video game developers are putting so much focus on cheesy gameplay mechanics (in this game, you can choose to time your shot to coincide with the sputtering noise from a misfiring electricity generator to ""mask"" the gunshot.. oh my goodness), cheesy one-dimensional hero characters (and trust me, the hero doesn't get anymore boring than Sniper Elite) instead of focussing on what should be at the very core of development of this type of video game: the AI!The bumbling nazi soldiers in this game are an embarassment to history. It is literally the same stupid AI that you got in 1998 with Metal Gear Solid. Granted, the AI was epochal for that time with MGS, but people this is almost 20 years later and soldiers are still getting back to standing around staring into a random direction 60 seconds after being fired upon from a distance of very few meters (though in this game, all you need to do is ""relocate"" a few dozen yards away from your initial position without being seen). The thing is, you don't even have to relocate or wait. You can just take apart an entire nazi base from a good vantage position as long as you make sure all enemy snipers are dealt with first. The enemy snipers are literally the only threat in this game, save for maybe tanks (that can easily be stopped with the massive amount of explosives lying around waiting to be found). You can pick off enemy stormtroopers like you're at a fun shooting range. Sometimes I would cover my exit with a tripwire mine to make sure I didn't get surprised from behind, but the sad fact is most of the time, the nazi soldiers were too stupid to even get close to my position and if they did, I just relocated.. In the year 2017, I expect a game like this to have an intelligent AI with enemy soldiers that effectively communicate, coordinate attacks, use routes to advance on my position that make it hard or impossible for me to see them, and don't just constantly stick their head up over a box looking around as if wondering what the hell is going on. When I fire upon enemy targets hiding behind a box, I expect them to scramble for new cover. I expect enemies to deploy smoke grenades to be able to advance on my position. I want a game like this to be a damn challenge.			"

												First of all- Though I don't recommend this game, I'm not saying that it's BAD. It's just that it's inferior to the game that came before it (Sniper Elite V2). Only get this game if you've already cleared all of V2 and enjoyed it a lot. Otherwise just get V2.Sniper Elite 3 takes the fantastic formula of V2 and adds in a whole load of new features that, frankly, and very unfortunately, ruin it. A whole host of arbitrary features, most of all the thing in which you're given a metre to show how suspicious enemy soldiers are of you, detract from the realism and turn it into a more video game-like experience, and yet at the same time somehow manage to make the game LESS FUN TO PLAY. The stages being larger and more sprawling starts off sounding like a good idea since this is a sniper game and all, but despite this being in The Middle of Nowhere, Africa, they consist mostly of what boils down to a bunch of intersecting corridors with the occasional large hall, and the only thing this manages to accomplish is turning stages into a boring, dull drag, due to how they lack any focus on a proper ultimate objective (case in point: The first real stage has you run around doing the exact same thing- Killing officers and checking their bodies- FOUR TIMES IN A ROW, while springing two surprise objectives that are each done in about a minute or two midway through. But none of the assassinations you have to carry out are at all interesting except for the very last surprise objective which isn't even feasible via sniping. The stage doesn't feel like one stage where you go through a checklist of objectives working towards an ultimate goal, but like a series of disjointed objectives sprung on you seemingly at random, as if it were some badly-made open world game). Letting you save wherever you want is nice and all but I would've like checkpoints in addition to that. Also I'm mostly clueless when it comes to hardware stuff so I can't figure out the fine details here, but I ran V2 totally fine with relatively high settings, while this game as a whole performs much less well than V2 (frame skipping and such) even on the lower settings. Also the kill cams don't seem to be as good as V2's, especially in the headshots, where the bone fragments seem to freeze in place connected to enemies' bodies so that they all move frozen together when the enemies twist around in slow motion. Oh, and do note that when it comes to weapons and such they actually cut down on the amount of content compared to V2, and turned it all into paid DLC. I reiterate, as I cannot stress this enough; Only get this game if you've cleared V2 and were still left craving for more, and don't mind if that ""more"" isn't ANYWHERE as good as what you just had. Otherwise just get V2, which is actually a good game.			"

Sniper Elite is a fantastic WW2 stealth shooter, where you play as OSS officer Karl Fairburne (known from the previous SE games) set on a special mission to hunt down the German general Vahlen. The game takes place on the North African front. You fight both Italian and German armed forces. As you progress trough eight missions, you gradually reveal Vahlen's plans to build a superweapon and, of course, face himself at the end of the game.Sniper Elite is also a tactical shooter, which means that, first, you explore your surroundings, and then you plan your attack. You can play stealthy or just rush through the maps. Stealthy gameplay is recommended. Not only it's safer, but it's where this game shines the most.You can sneak behind enemies and take down them with a knife, you can set traps, you can distract and isolate enemies to kill them in a quiet spot, you can blow a vehicle or explosives near the enemies, you can set up a chain reaction, you can snipe them both with and without sound masking, you can shoot them with a silenced pistol - the options are, indeed, many and all of them are fun.As to the weapons, it's almost all WW2 arsenal (American, Brittish, Soviet, Polish, Japanese. German, Italian), including Panzerfaust, a special rocket launcher in the DLC mission ""Belly of the Beast"", dynamites, trip-mines, s-mines, hand grenades and land-mines. Not all weapons are available in the base version of the game, though. And, you'll need to unlock some weapons and weapon parts, as you progress through the campaign and ranks. The equipement consists of a sniper rifle, an assault rifle/shotgun/panzerfaust, a pistol and 5 items (explosives/anti-armor ammo or medkits).Each mission is unique, each level is unique, it's really fun to explore the surrounding, not knowing what's behind the corner, when you play for the first time. The level design is one of the greatest that I have seen. I don't know who is the senior level designer, but, apparently, Rebellion has the right team for the job, because the level design is always excellent in the SE games.The graphics are beautiful, as well. I did find the colours a bit too saturated, but, nevertheless, graphic quality is high and you do need a pretty solid system to run this game on highest settings. Also, the fact that North Africa is not that common setting in videogames makes SE3 to stand out. It adds a bit of extra fun.Finally, this game has a CoOp mode and it's a ""real"" CoOp, you can play all campaign missions with your friends.The other modes are survival challenges (solo or MP) and PvP. I did not try PvP, but I tried 10 waves in the Survival mode. I found it boring. Luckily, with the campaign and DLCs missions, there is enough content, so that you don't feel like you've wasted money on nothing.The DLC packs Target Hitler: Hunt the Gray Wolf and Save Churchill are highly recommended. As to the weapon packs, see for yourself, how much money you want to spend. The default M1 Garand + Welrod are pretty much the only weapons you need. I also used: Lee Enfield, T99 (Axis Weapon Pack) and Springfield rifles (Patriot Weapon Pack). But, if you play stealthy and aim for the head, there is not much difference, which sniper rifle you use. I got all the DLC packs with the Season Pass. From secondary weapons, I also recommend: Panzerfaust and Semi-Auto HDM. MP40 comes handy, if you don't choose to play stealthy, as MP40 magazines are always available behind the enemy lines.My overall rating: 9/10 "

												It's okay, I guess. I mean, I wasn't expecting much from a game with little to no plot. I rather felt like this game could use more weapons, but it's not so much about the DLC nor the lack of said weapons, it's more of the story that does it in for me. I couldn't feel connected to... I don't even remeber the guy's name- adding to my point and or lack of memory- but I couldn't feel like I could like him persay. Perhaps I'm needing to read his lore myself on some article or something, but I feel as though if this game had cutscenes that intertwined the protagonist more and perhaps even adding more side characters that we could feel connected to, then perhaps this game would be able to compete with major titles. The cutscenes wouldn't even have to be cinematic per se, they're fine how they are. In fact, the art work reminds me of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker a bit... Maybe that's a bit too generous, but overall it's fine. The gameplay is alright, like I said, what's to expect from a game that comprises itself on the sole purpose of being a multiplayer? Maybe that's my beef with this game, its focus is on multiplayer, which is fine, but aren't their enough out there already? Why pay fifty dollars for a buggy game? Well's that's my opinion over all. I just wish this game could be more stealth based and more story based.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DRDon't buy this game if you're expecting hours of riveting story and gameplay.

												The Sniper Elite franchise has had a rocky start but, with the adventure of the pretty decent Sniper Elite V2 and the campy yet fun Nazi Zombie Army spinoffs, the series made by Rebellion is looking to establish itself as an important niche first-person shooter catering to those who like to plan their firefights instead of going in guns-blazing.Sniper Elite 3 takes the action to the African front, while retaining the World War 2 setting. Players take control once again of Karl Fairburne, showing off a new portion of his adventures set between 1 and 2. Players must navigate the harsh environments and try to sabotage the plans of the Axis armies in the northern part of Africa. Expect to shoot quite a lot of Nazis, not to mention a few Italians, along the way.Players once again follow the adventures of Karl Fairburne, an American sniper who, after a pretty great performance in the tutorial mission, is tasked by the Allied forces with going deep behind enemy lines in order to disrupt the Axis plans in Northern Africa. What follows is a not so engaging story largely due to the simplicity of the missions that make players infiltrate different enemy camps, steal information, plant bombs, or cause other types of disruptions, and then escape.The protagonist isn't fleshed out at all and, due to the lone wolf nature of snipers, he barely gets to interact with other characters. Lots of historical events and locations are name-checked but the game doesn't offer any other details or background info about them.As such, don't expect to be blown away by the plot of Sniper Elite 3, as it's mostly on par with those from previous installments.While the missions in Sniper Elite 3 may not be filled with story elements, they represent a great improvement over previous entries in the series. Instead of linear environments and corridors through bombed out cities, you're now tasked with completing missions in wide open areas in Africa. What's more, the way in which you reach your goals is completely up to the player. You can steal information by sniping Axis generals from hundreds of meters away or you can go in with your silenced pistol and attempt cover takedowns.The level design is much more open, encouraging players to explore the level and take note of enemy behavior, patrol patterns, and other such things. The presence of collectibles and hidden treasures should prove great incentives to keep rummaging about.Each of the main eight missions contains different bonus objectives, such as blowing trucks, and adds to your XP score. However, they're not mandatory and you can focus just on completing the main objectives as fast as possible.In terms of actual shooting, Sniper Elite 3 doesn't mess all that much with the formula that made its predecessors so powerful. The main emphasis is, of course, on using the sniper rifle, and this time around holding your breath also produces a small red rectangle showing where the bullet will hit the target, after taking into consideration wind, distance, and other such things. Of course, purists can once again turn off all assists so that they feel like they're real snipers. However, the lack of a training area or shooting gallery, so that you come to grips with your sniper rifles, is going to mean lots of trial and error.The trademark killcam system is once again present, showing off kills in all their gory glory, particularly when your bullets hit the heads or vital organs of your enemies. However, if you play for extended periods of time, you might want to turn them off as they get a bit tedious, even if their violence is still enjoyable.There are a few new mechanics at play with Sniper Elite 3, such as special noise distractions caused by generators, large engines, mortar fire, or even passing planes. These can mask your sniper shots and make disposing of foes undetected much easier.The stealth system in Sniper Elite 3 has been somewhat refined, as now it has a big focus on relocation in case you get spotted. Enemy soldiers will converge on your last known location and, if you manage to sneak away to a certain distance, they'll just go back to their regular patrol routes.AI in general isn't that sharp and player detection is erratic, to say the least. Often soldiers would spot me while I was behind cover and at quite a distance, while other times they'd ignore me even if I was sprinting near their location.Another rather annoying problem is that enemy chatter can be heard from quite far away. This means that you might think an enemy is right near you but they're actually much further away.Sniper Elite 3 allows players to save anywhere and at any point in time, in addition to the checkpoints, so don't worry about messing up, as you can easily go back to load a save and once again try your luck or a different strategy.Sniper Elite 3's multiplayer includes both a cooperative mode, as you can work alongside a friend to complete the story experience, but also a competitive one.The co-op is pretty fun and serves to disperse some of the boredom that you might feel when going through the main missions, but the lack of a matchmaking system means you need to manually find and add people to play with.The competitive experience features some rather standard shooter game types but there are a few interesting ones like the No Cross one, which erects a barrier between the two teams, meaning you must snipe enemies from afar instead of trying to go in for brawls in close quarters.Sniper Elite 3 takes place in the harsh environment of Northern Africa and this means a pretty novel color palette dominated not just by brown but also by yellow, green, or sometimes blue when reaching different oasis areas. The animations on some enemies are a bit stiff and, while the textures look relatively good, there is a fair bit of pop-in when zooming into new areas with your sniper or binoculars.The soundtrack is relatively good but doesn't stand out all that much. Voice acting is certainly varied, with enemies talking in German or Italian, but protagonist Karl Fairburne retains his somewhat boring, rough voice.Sniper Elite 3 is a relatively fun niche shooter experience that improves some of the faults seen in its predecessors, particularly in regards to mission design and the open nature of levels. It's still weighed down by bugs, erratic AI, and a shoddy story, but it will certainly entertain fans of the franchise and those looking for a thinking man's shooter experience.			"

												Ok, so I started playing this game the day it came out, sadly I only have 12 hours today since I have been quite distracted. But, I have had a chance to complete the campaign mode and give multiplayer a shot, both just as enjoying as the other, with a different set of skills requires for each.First off, I would like to go over the campaign mode. When I first loaded the game I imediately noticed a great improvement from Sniper Elite v2 - the graphics were clearer with amazingly detailed shadows and characters. After a few minutes of playing it was very apparent that this was a completely different game to Sniper Elite v2, the world is extremely open with different ways to complete every task; this is in contrast to Sniper Elite v2's linear story line with very limited options complete a task. I think the implementation of optional objectives and collectables greatly enhanced the overall experience. Moving on to multiplayer, once again, a whole new take on the v2 multiplayer mode. You can actually talk to people and the maps are much more expansive allowing for more sniping and less traps and MP 40's. also, the introduction of more multiplayer objectives has really caused the game to be more playable, in an effort to discover and play them all.On to the negatives, of which there are very few, my first would be some of the co-op mechanics. When playing co-op destroying a tiger tank is a matter of standing on either side as it spins around in circles undecided on who to shoot at. And then only having one of the two-four players in cutscenes. Overall, I would definitely recommended this game to friends, and have actually done so already! The positives of this game greatly outweigh my list of negatives with a vast improvement from Sniper Elite v2 which I imensely enjoyed.Campaign Rating: 9/10Co-Op Rating: 8/10Multiplayer Rating 9.5/10Overall Rating: 9/10 "

												The game as for now riddled with bugs and crashes. The coop is literally unplayable on certain missions, three maps out of six me and my friend didn't stood a chance to finish. Memory leaks, random crashes and scripts aren't working.One time I just fell out of the map in a middle of playthrough. And no checkpoint selection in coop whatsoever of course.Looking at all positive reviews.. Makes me think the game wasn't so broken as it now.That is extremely unfortunate 'cause the game brings a lot of fun when it works as supposed to.			"

												Just got this game and I love it. It urges you to act covertly rather than the run and gun style of most games today. I also quite enjoy the xray cam whenever you fire a kill shot.  The only two complaints I have is a couple of times I have had shots miss their target for reasons I can't figure out and how the ""upgrades"" affect the performance of the weapon makes no sense and seem to provide no real advantage.

												If you're looking for an objective review, don't read this. Coming from a die-hard fan of the Sniper Elite series, this is what is outstanding in this one. - Wide-open maps, with side-objectives on the way through - Lots of collectables for the lurking treasure hunter in you- Health system, need bandages and medkits to heal (in V2 it was CoD style)- Weapons now have stats- Immense amount of DLC, but it's worth every penny- Lots of tactical assistance to help you being stealthy- Really challenging Authentic Difficulty- Overwatch and Survival mode are back, coop or solo. - You can play Coop on the DLC missions now (not possible in V2)- Dedicated servers for multiplayer, gameplays are enjoyable and hard- You can customize your weapons to your taste- Up to 4 loadouts for you to customize, being ready for every situation- Bullet Cam shows broken scope with successfull shot on enemy snipers (needs surgical accuracy). - EXPLOSIONSAND the immensely satisfying bullet cam, revamped for vehicles and explosives as well.Oh, did I forget to mention that Hitler only has one ball ? Awesome is it ? That is IF you can make the difference between the real Hitler and his double...			"

												I'll keep it short and sweet.The graphics are amazing, the gameplay (killcam, stealth, noise masking etc.) is/are brilliant touch ups but I think that the game is not worth £40. They are 8 missions, for me that was OK because I got bored of the repetitive gameplay after the 2nd mission but when I played the game again after a couple of weeks, I got into the game and smashed through it (I thought the difficulty got easier towards the end of the game). There is little choice of weapons, 4 snipers virtually all the same, I used the silenced pistol all the to the end because it's stealthy and no other gun has a suppressor and I unlocked the thompson near enough straight away. Now, the sniper upgrades are useful but in a way pointless because unless you have the patience to loot every single body you kill you will not find all the upgrades, I found 4 binoculars upgrades and around 4-6 sniper rifle upgrades 2 on the third sniper and a few on the first sniper (cant remember how many exactly).Overall, I would not buy this game again if I had the option to and would not recommend it to anyone I know.

												Note: Before reading, just know I'm basically trying to clear up some of the negative reviews on this game. This is purely an opinion from a person who has played this game. If you feel differently, then that's fine.--Reading a lot of the reviews, people say Sinper Elite V2 was better than Sniper Elite 3, Personally, I've never played Sniper Elite V2, and nor do I wanna get a game that is that old, as the multiplayer might be taken off soon (not worth the money spent server side) or other reasons. That's why I went for the more recent game in the franchise, Sniper Elite 3.Since I've gotten it, I love it. I don't see any issues with it, and since I don't know how ""great"" Sniper Elite V2 was, I'm really not missing out on anything, if there's anything to even miss.Another concern people have expressed is that this game is less... sniping? Looking at some gameplay videos from both games, then actually playing Sniper Elite 3, I don't see why this is a concern. Sure you sometimes have to rely on your secondary, or performing stealth kills, but you sure as heck can go around and snipe. What's stopping you from doing that? Personally, I love the mix of stealth kills, sniping kills, and sometimes having to switch to a secondary or pistol when in a rough situation. Isn't that a step in the right direction? I more realistic approach on combat? I see no problems with what the company did, and I support the new approach.People also have said that Sniper Elite 3 is just Sinper Elite V2 but with bug fixes. If that's the case, then that is a good point. They could have just fixed the old game BUT you have to take into account this is a company, and they need to make money. However they do that isn't your decision to say. They felt it would be better to spend their efforts into a new game as opposed to fixing an old game, which is fair. Sure they could've saved their customers some money by upgrading the old game, but in turn they would lose money. Doesn't make sense in their eyes.--Overall, I think this game is a great game if you want to snipe, play stealth and take your time to think out the best plan of attack. If you want to just jump in guns blazing, you might want to reconsider which game franchise you want to play. This game is one of the best, and most realistic, sniper/stealth games out there, and I don't think you'll find much better.If you find this game on sale, then it's a steal. I can see people justifying a $55 price point, so anything lower is a great deal.--Again, this is just MY opinion on the game, and I hope it helps some people out when/if they are deciding to get this game.Have a great day!

												The game is ok. Graphics are improved and better than in SEv2, though there are still several bugs and glitches that need to be fixed. Some controls in the game have been changed and are quite annoying. Now your character can't move back in the normal way anymore, but turns around instead which is often very annoying. Climbing a ladder is also very annoying because you really need to be on the right spot to be able to climb otherwise your character starts turning around. Annoying as hell!!!You need to play alot to ""earn"" all the special things to customize your rifle which is pretty much the same as in most other massive online games.The maps are bigger than in SEv2 but not really as open as you think (or hoped) they would be.There are not as many Multiplayer and Co-op modes as in SEv2 and Co-op players might feel themselves a bit left out in the cold because in this game there is even less to do in Co-op than in SEv2. Inviting a friend to join the game has been made a bit easier, but unlike in SEv2 random players can't join a Co-op game anymore. So looking for a game is gone... This is a big downer for the Co-op players.The tagging in Multiplay is also a bit different, but at least you can't be shot through a wall or door or whatever anymore like in SEv2, when you're tagged.Explosives don't have the same blast radius anymore as in SEv2; now they have the blast radius of a fire cracker.The trenchgun is pretty much useless in Multi; can't hit a thing unless your opponent is 1-2 yards away from you.If the enemy is shooting, especially from close range, you can't shoot until he stops firing. This should really be fixed very quickly.So in all, for Multiplay the game is fun (but not really) with several new features; for Co-op it's a big bummer and for Singleplay it's pretty much the same as in any other game.Although the game looks like a beta version, because of the bugs and glitches that still need some fixing, I still like the game but I must say that I was more enthousiastic with SEv2 than with this one. Personally I find SEv2 better in alot of ways especially concerning controls.I think I don't like this game as much as the previous version because it's starting to look like other similar shooter games. Maybe I would like the game more when they've fixed all the bugs and glitches and change some controls and put back ""the missing weapons"" from SEv2.In short, the game really needs to be fixed in alot of ways or people will loose their interest in this game which is a pitty because it could have been a very good game.

												Sniper elite? More like Sneak around with your silenced pistol elite in my opinion... It's extremely slow paced and there are stupid bugs like for example when you go prone near the edge of a cliff to snipe, you will slowly slide foward and you will fall down, which will kill you or at least leave you exposed. This game felt like I was playing the older Splinter Cell games but without the fun gadgets, the good story and Sam's personality. Do not buy this game full price, wait for a steam sale and buy it for 5$ or 10$ at most.			"

												I got this game at release, and despite my main interest being the co-op mode, I started by playing through it alone. I loved it. Its relocation mechanic makes for a very different kind of stealth, which really comes into its own with the wide open levels that are full of alternative paths, places to hide, and elevated sniper positions. The controls are responsive and the weapons are satisfying.Unfortunately the net code is atrocious. I have been unable to finish most of the levels in co-op because it randomly kicks me or my partner. Not even necessarily when something interesting happens, we'll be in the middle of doing something and the game kicks us both back to the main menu. In very long missions this can be a tremendous waste of time, as we can sometimes play for half an hour before we get kicked, and it won't let us wait for our partner to rejoin or even just load a savegame. ""Maybe it's your connection"", I hear you say. Nope, we were on Skype the whole time and the call never dropped.There are other issues in multiplayer. Sometimes when I start a game in co-op, I have no scope reticle (making sniping somewhat difficult). On one occasion, I was playing the Survival mode and we'd made it to the last round - my friend went down, and when I revived him, he got stuck in spectator mode. His character was just lying there uselessly looking around.If you want to play this game in singleplayer, buy it. It's a fairly long game - 9 missions including the tutorial, but each is easily an hour long, probably more. Worth the asking price for sure. If you're buying it for co-op, give it a miss. You probably won't be able to.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is yet another installment of Sniper Elite series, a third person shooter about sniper. Which also attempts to look like action-stealth game. Which it kept failing at. But the third time is the charm and it seems that they finally delivered this promise in this one. Came out in 2014, made by Rebellion.It also came out on PS3, PS4, X360 and Xbox One. I don't think that they have anything over PC version, so stick with this one.Multiplayer community is small but living.For 2-player cooperative modes I would get a partner after around 10 minutes of waiting. For competetive part there is always at least 4 full servers of players, which say that it will not die for a while. They play gamemodes that are Team Deathmatch, No Cross and occasional Deathmatch. Sorry, no CTF, Distance King. Just take a note, people seem to play on servers with rules which promote campign sniping hiding style: Any rifle shot instakills, bullets don't drop off (like in easiest setting in single-player) and they often don't allow secondary weapons. I couldn't find any server with players which have full vanilla rules. What a shame, at least I could find some in SEv2.And everybody wears Ghillie Suit, yep.Technically, I had no trouble with game running, though it sometimes would sometimes would stop recognising my mouse at all after alt-tab'ing around.However it does have a few bugs. It seems like AI sometimes is able to see you through the walls or floor. Like, sometimes in level 7, airfield, after I made some mess on the ground and then successfully hid in underground tunnels, I would sometimes hear explosion and then suddenly my location would be found out. Perhaps some glitchy tank still shooting at me, I don't know.Plus, collision of level assets. It's unrefined. Different from the way that object look. Sometimes I was able to pass through an end part of a ruined wall, through bricks. Other times you wonder why your bullets don't pass through above some rock.Checkpoints also sometimes glitch out. Sometimes, after loading, I would see two soldiers inside each other. Yep.And overwatch is wacky, when you reload. Sometimes the sniper player will be back to original spawn and sometimes it will have objective in map that you have already done.Also, yes, this game has some nice customization for difficulty. Don't forget to check game options. You can disable the aim reticle which predict where your shot will land and zoom on empty lung. That, and you can reduce the frequency of X-Ray kill scenes, which happen way too much by default.It's also nice of them that they kept updating game for a while. Gave us one overwatch map, six multiplayer maps and even shooting range where you can also check out DLC weapons!The plot of this game follows our Desert Ghost sniper in his adventures in the desert, being a prequel. Which means all the lush landscape of Africa, warm orange at day and cold blue at night. It sure looks nice, even though it may get old by the end of it. But hey, it's not often used setting.But the plot itself is nothing exciting this time around. It's much less cinematic than SEv2, which will put people off. This game kinda takes itself as just a game. It doesn't try to do much exciting. For most part it's ""ok, here is a map, bai"" and then you move on through it. Ok, maybe there is occasional situation, a tank boss even. But still, most people got dissapointed. Even music doesn't feel as epic. Or at least the awesome music is barely used.And yes, at least this time around developers decided to make it a proper action-stealth. The levels in which you play are sandboxy. The progression thrugh it is still linear, but it's ""wide"", if you get what I mean. So you can do it at your own pace, for most times. Another thing is that whole stealth gameplay was improved and AI changed around to fit into stealth ideas, so not whole map wants to kill you as soon as you make a single shot into air.Now, while you still have various engines spread all over the map which you can kick and then shoot everybody during the loud noise, you got a relocation system. When you make the first noticed shot most enemies will freak, will hide behind cover and start to peek out, not sure where it came from. If you make another shot, then they will figure out your location and launch a group attack. It's not exactly threatening on middle difficulty, but on high it looks pretty coordinated, one group in front of you hiding away while flanking group of soldiers will start to advance to your position from behind. All while throwing grenades sometimes.The thing that you are supposed to do after the first shot is to relocate. That means that you are supposed to move out of your sweet spot outside of the big circle where enemy belives where you are and then you are safe and the whole thing resets. You can still see enemy searching your original destination. The problem is, you can just return to the same original position once you get out of relocation radius. Maybe it could be more interesting if they wouldn't forget previous location, so it wouldn't feel like you exploit the system. Maybe even be interesting how you get less and less space to work at. But oh well.At least with you don't feel restricted when you want to snipe and stay fairly stealthly. Stealthly as in having tactical advantage of enemy not knowing where exactly you are or isn't close enough to do damage before you move away. And yea, nothing stops you form just having fun sniping everything you see, so it's strange that people complain about this. Still free to go full action. Or rather, full sniping with no care.Though you still want to keep Welrod pistol around in single-player while using Luger and revolver in multiplayer, like in SEv2.And dont' forget about multiplayer. First, the whole campaign can be beaten in cooperative mode with a single friend. Enemies are more likely to notice you, but you are more likely to overcome them all. And it's fun and doesn't cut cutscenes out. So awesome.It also still has survival mode, both solo and coop, which is similar to Tally Kill in SEv2. Though there are only two maps, aw. But your objective is to overcome 15 waves of enemies. The fun stuff is that unlike SEv2 this one has action-stealth gameplay working on SE3 standard, which means that relocations still work. I actually think that it showcases the system the best, along with awesome music. Enemies don't even immeditly know where you are, they just randomly and aggresively patrol and storm random buildings before finding you, so you can first tag them up with binocular and then choose the best moment to attack.And it kept the nice overwatch coop, where one person doesn't have sniper rifle, only having pistol, secondary and binoculaur and is the one doing objectives, while player with sniper rifle is providing cover. At least it's the way it does in SEv2 in small maps where the spotter is being ambushed all time. Sadly, it's a gamemode where SE3 system doesn't work well. Maps are sandboxy, you don't get pressured much and sniper is sometimes allowed to move freely, only sometimes being locked. As a result Sniper is easily the main hero, who does the action at effective range, while Spotter can just hide somewhere and only come out once it's all clear to do whatever objective asked, then repeat.Yep, too much freedom there. Also, only three maps too.And then there is competetive multiplayer. It actually feels more like what sniper players want. Well, okay, it's not different from SEv2, and it's mostly because players play on servers with rules that only let you have sniper rifle that kills on shot to any body part, with no bullet gravity drops or such. That, and then again, most maps seems to be designed better. I can't say much, but I enjoyed being careful, under constant paranoia of that somebody noticed my movement.Overall, not strong, but it's good.			"

												The game looks nice and may work properly in singleplayer, but the coop feels like an afterthought. When you shoot someone and get a kill animation the victim dies AFTER the animation, so your coop-partner is shooting him and wondering why his bullets won't hit. And no, you can't turn the animations off.Other annoyances:bullet penetration is weird (you can shoot through some walls, but not through flags)the secondary weapons are completely useless (except for the panzerschreck), even with every bullet hitting you still need about 10 hitseven the hardest difficulty level ""authentic"" is not that hard (you even get a sound when someone detects you)the positional audio of people speaking is useless, since it is almost always wrong and you hear people nearby who are at the other end of the mapwind feels like it's just some random number and direction, the sorroundings don't have anything to do with itConclusion:If you can get it for cheap and don't care about it coop, it may be some fun otherwise I would recommend against buying it.

												Completely unrealistic linear rail shooter hiding under the pretense of being a realistic sniper simulation. Ridiculous gameplay that give players extreme accuracy and time-slowing superpowers, ludicrously small maps and engagement distances for a game supposedly about sniping, and marginally different customization options make this an unenjoyable experience. Story has been done a million times and is completely laughable, the oh-so-holy Allied protagonist supposedly liberating the world from the Axis menace, all the while single-handedly massacring entire brigades of undisciplined Wehrmacht troops. Neither realistic nor fun, the only redeeming factor in this waste of 20 gigabytes is the bullet cam, which nevertheless gets old quickly.			"

												While i would love to write a good review of this game (since i liked the previous 2 games in the series), I simply can't. The game it's self looks very nice but since it will not run for more than 5 minutes, I have no idea how well the game actually plays. I have tried to deal with support but i either get the same few responses and then just ignored or I just get ignored straight away. I honestly wish i could play the game but at this point it seems unlikely.If you're lucky, this game will work for you and it might be very enjoyable but if not, it's a total waste of money. I also have to say that after dealing with this company's entirely useless support team, I will most likely never purchase anymore of their products as i would judge it a waste of money. If I did have a problem they wouldn't even bother to help.Edit: I recently got this game to work and can now say the game it's self is not too bad. I still wouldn't recomend it due to the companys lack of help. For those that are having trouble getting this to run, Windows 10 seems to have fixed whatever was the issue in 7.			"

												I did apreciate the gameplay and for other players will certainly enjoy it too. But for my concern, I find the game not really challenging even at high difficulty and since I do real long range shooting in real I find the (shooting system) quite poorly made. And you dont get much for your money on game content so I do suggest to wait for a deal to buy this game.			"

												Let's get something straight first: don't buy this game, unless it is cheap, like 80% off. The price is WAY too high for a game that has maybe 12 hours of gameplay.With 12 hours of gameplay i mean it is intense, fun and you really fit your role as a sniper. Taking down enemy snipers, preparing ambushes, you have dozen ways to get the job done. I played the game with no rush, basically sneaking all the time, making sure i was on a low profile the entire playthrough.The complete game is made around you: the ways of completing your objective are already planned, that there would be no surprise to you, which means this game is REALLY easy. It can be a bad or a good thing.I finished the game on the second most hardest difficulty, and i still don't know why it is called 'Sniper Elite'. It's all as easy as the lowest difficulty, if you are playing sneaky.The stealth system works like a clock; you kill, hide, sneak, kill. And adding the 'melee takedown' to your arsenal of skills, means that you don't have to carry a suppresed sidearm with you, unlikely to Sniper Elite V2. This means you can FINALLY use different pistols.Buying the Season Pass with this game is highly recomended. Giving you new snipers, and even camouflages, it also adds in new singleplayer maps.I recommend this game if you want to check out the singleplayer. Play this game thoroughly, there are many places where you might not come if you don't explore.There is nothing wrong with this game, really a basic fun game where even i was hooked to the stroyline.

												Not many graphical improvements over Sniper Elite 2 if any at all, controls are clunky and camera is shoddy at best. The only notable changes are the ""slightly"" improved kill cam and the introduction of some tightened shooting mechanics. With a sparse amount of features this seems more and more like a rushed, rehashed product. Definitely not worth the price tag.			"

												I ask of you, please, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Even at a discounted price:I'm surprised by how many positive reviews this game has received, I guess the people who play has no standard anymore.The game is more or less Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V. Its identical to Sniper Elite V2, except that it now is in Africa and you get to blow a lot of vehicles on the process* The campaign is boring as hell, same American-hero stereotype that is the same boring badass... uninteresting storyline, blah blah, find him, kill him, take his notes, oh a tank is going to kill you, blow them, escape. rinse & repeat, rinse & repeat, rinse & repeat.* Unrealistic ballistics, those who think it's realistic, must be ♥♥♥♥ed in the head. Also most of the shots happen from 40-150meters, should atleast be more like +700meters. ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ with that little distance I could urinate my enemies to death.* Very few weapons to choose from, unless you want to spend extra money for the DLC's. Like they're not stealing money from you by just buying this game.* AI is probably the dullest I've seen in a long time: Enemies don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if their comrades who lay dead beside them (even at hardest difficulty). One minute they hunt you, and suddenly all the enemies gets memory loss, goes back and patrolling as usual, even if you shot them. Friendly AI is a disaster aswell: In a level, he will wait for ~5 minutes without doing a damn thing. And ofcourse you must wait for the ♥♥♥♥er.This game has so many bugs...As I said, this game is like V2, though worse. Kill-Cams look exactly the same, even the same sound and music. I've got this game for free when I bought my PC, and yet I am ashamed to have it in my Steam Library.Do yourself a favor, go play something else.			"

Rating: 70/100 I think you could describe this WW2 shooter as a 'Medal of Honor' type of game (without the cutscenes), but then with sniping as the main gameplay feature. I personally expected this game to be a bit more realistic when I bought it... reading about 'bullet drop' and 'bullet travel time'. However, the game is very arcade like (like MoH). Overall this is a (fairly) solid game that offers fun (casual) gameplay with decent enough graphics, controls and UI. There are however a lot of small (and some obvious) things that are lacking (or plain dumb) in the game and a large part of that is due to the AI and general game design.  The bad:One game mechanic in the game is that you have to 'reposition' every time you fire your sniper rifle and the AI have heard your shot. The game always tells you to move 30 meters way from your previous location. 90% of the time it is totally not needed to reposition as the AI does nothing then go into a crouch position at the same spot they already were (you at your current position is not in danger). There is a tagging feature that you can use with your binocular. In itslef it is a nice feature, but it takes away any possible challenge or surprise out of the game as you can even watch the enemies behind rocks and walls (it belongs in Deus Ex, not in a WW2 sniper game). Even if you do not use that feature the AI will still get a tag above their heads when they are alerted (at least in normal difficulty). There is clipping with some objects. Stairs railings have no collision and I had some logs/covers and rocks that I could walk through.AI is pretty much blind. You can stand 30 meters away on a road in front of a heavy machinegunner and he is totally oblivious to your pressence, making thus the stealth aspect pretty minimal. Lots of places where you can just run or even sprint without alerting enemies. I even sprinted into enemies that I overlooked and still could do close quarter melee kills without alerting surrounding AI.  There is also sometimes an issue with multiple AI standing at the same place where it looks like just one AI standing there, but there are several of them inside each other.The environment sounds are lacking, it's Afrika, but I don't hear any nature at all (not even crickets) while walking through the environment. [EDIT] the later levels (airport) do have decent environment sounds, I wonder why they left it so empty in the early levels.[] The neutral:  Graphics. With maxed out settings it looks good thanks to the AA and stuff, but the 3D modeling of the environment is not much better then a 'Far Cry 2' from 5+ years ago, though the texturing is nice and of decent quality. The game is advertized as having 'huge' levels/maps, but it's nothing like that. The maps are for a large part corridor roads with overwatch positions and some open squares with houses/ruins. Don't expect an open world like environment it is still basically 'on rails' and linear, but with areas that allows different approaches. [edit] Playing through the game a second time now and noticed that there quite some objects and rocks that have to big hitboxes. Meaning that you can freely look at a target in your crosshair, but when you shoot the bullet gets stopped by an invisible box around the object/rock.[] The good:Even with all the bad and cheesy aspects the overall gameplay is an enjoyable experience. The maps still give you enough freedom to do different aproaches and different tactics and playstyles and the game feels immersive enough to keep you interested. The bullet camera is not a new feature of the game, but it is still nice to watch how your preciely aimed shot landed right in between the eyes of the enemy AI dude.I recommend to play it on the setting 'sniper elite', because lower difficulty ruins the potential fun this game has to offer. Even the 2nd harderst difficulty is a walk in the park, but the AI seems to behave a bit better on harder difficulty specially after they are allerted.			"

												I've only played 2 and 3 to this point, and very much enjoyed the mechanics of 3 more.  I definitely enjoyed the classic feel of SE2, but the quick keys and other controls on this game made it very enjoyable.  The storyline was great, and I felt a little cheated once I finally made it through the end.  I was surprised how much easier the end of this game was compared to the end of SE2, but I also replayed the level so many times for the accomplishments I think I just memorized it :)  It's just that good! Enjoy, it's a keeper I'll play again.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is the evolved version of Sniper Elite V2 with enhanced graphics and is probably one of the best sniper games available today. This time you're deployed to North Africa on a mission to uncover the secret plans of Nazi general Vahlen, which, amongst others, leads you to Tobruk and Kasserine Pass.There are only eight single-players missions but each of them is huge. It took me hours for each of the levels to scout my surroundings, plan my approach and reach my target. But this widely depends on your play style. If you select to play on low difficulty and simply aim for the main target Rambo style, you can probably finish this game much faster. But if you want to remain stealthy, complete all side missions and play on a serious difficulty, 'Sniper Elite 3' offers a lot of content for your dime.Pros:- awesome graphics- great sound effects- refreshing setting, Africa looks great- good music- interesting story- wide open, very spacious single player missions- freedom to choose your personal play style- different tactical options and possibilities to reach your goals- bullet cam- good voice acting- thrilling atmosphere- high replay value- coop- very good multi-playerCompared to Sniper Elite V2- new multi-player mode (sniper vs sniper)- challenge mode (horde mode)- new motivating level system- rifles can be modified- graphics and x-ray improvements- selection of cross hairsNeutral:- AI is not the best but this also depends on the level of difficulty.Cons:- cheaters in multi-player- rare lags in multi-player, but that's probably not a fault of the game but of players with slow connections- many weapons only available as DLC- bugs! But that might be related to Microsoft. The game crashed on me dozens of times, especially after the latest Windows 10 update. I had to reinstall the direct-X drivers and fully remove and reinstall the graphic drivers in order to make the game work again.			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  It does a great job at making you feel both challenged and rewarded.I enjoyed the campaign quite a bit, and got 16 hours out of it.  I really liked how customizable the difficulty was, letting you pick parts of each difficulty setting that you like/dislike.My one qualm with this game is that the X and Y axis sensitivity are not equal even when set to the same amount.  Fortunately, this does not seem to affect sensitivity while scoped.			"

												SINGLEPLAYER:The best part of the game is the singleplayer campaign, the missions are huge and funny, some of them are difficult and you have to think what you are going to do next. Almost all missions have different ways of making the objectives, you can use stealth or fire in everything that moves, I prefer the second option because I have more fun, but it's a little bit more difficult but this is only my personal preference.Another positive point is the variety of missions, each mission is different. The X-Ray cam is one of the best things in the game, and it's very detailed.But there isn't a game without problems in the campaign: there are very few missions and you can make all of them really fast. If you want more missions you have to buy the DLCs. Another problem is the weapons available, just 3 rifles, 3 submachines, the panzershreck and 3 pistols, if you want more, you need to buy the DLCs.MULTIPLAYER:The multiplayer mode is good for sometime, but after some hours of gameplay the multiplayer becames sickening. The problem in particular for me is that most of the servers don't allow you to play with the secundary weapons, with this you have to play onlt with rifles and pistols, which led to the match became boring, because you have to wait someone to move or make a wrong decision, but there are one or two servers that allow you to use secundary weapons (even though it doesn't make the game with more movement), allows you to have a little more fun, like ignore everything and just go firing the panzerchreck until the ammo get over, this is funny, but I think is probably because of the risk of someone make this, that most of the servers don't allow you to use secundary weapons.V2X3:If you are wandering what of the two sniper elites you should buy (I am ignoring the first, because that one is terrible!) you have to consider this: even though the 3 have less missions it have more time of gameplay, and is more difficult, but I recommend you to wait a good sale and buy both of them.CONCLUSION:I recommend you to buy this game, but only if it's on sale, because if don't, you are going to waste your money, not because the game isn't good, but because it's just a few hours of gameplay.

												Sniper elite 3 is ok but has too many problems to recommend full priceSniper nests are useless for stealth because none of them have any sort of sound masking except for the one in the second levelAI is better but still kinda dinkySome missions are dull (like kasserine pass)Way too short (only 8 missions)Ending is lame as hell compared to V2sone DLC gun is OP in single player (the Semi auto silenced) and makes the welrod obsoleteTaking guns that were already programmed in the game before release (look at the screen shots) and releasing them as DLC (10/10)stealth is very tedious and annoying bullets can sometimes bounce off of helmets, which plays into stealth being annoyingenemies load in only when you get close (100-200 meters) so long range sniping involves you running up to the building then running backbut there are some good thingstanks are more challenging which is nice because in V2 they were pitiful.Sniping is still fun as hell and going loud is 10x more fun than stealthWeapon customization is awesome, though you cant do too much with itMissions are very open and non linear (some missons dont do much with this openess though)but overall, cool enviorment, fun sniping, weapons are cool, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth, not much improvement over V2 (but where they improve its done well), BS DLC,  too shortwould recommend if 75% off "

												While Sniper Elite 3 isn't a bad game, it feels largely unfinished, especially for a game that sells with a season pass / DLC.  Animations on enemies are bugged in that some enemies will appear to be walking but they don't actually move The reticle/aim assist dot bugs out sometimes when on enemy heads Kill cam animations don't always sync with the sound Sometimes the camera can be extremely finnicky, especially with kill cams Enemies are extremely dumbMy biggest gripe with this game is it's unwillingness to reward players for playing the game completely stealthy. I've done missions where I've never alerted a guard, stayed completely hidden, slowly taking out enemies without arousing suspicion only to not be rewarded in a manner that fits the time spent playing the game that way. I feel like this would have added tremendously to the game had they rewarded players more for stealth play.The killcams can be amusing but they can also be a bit much sometimes. Around the 3rd mission I found myself skipping a lot of them unless there was a real good kill that was worth watching.The game does a good job at letting you plot ways to take out enemies. I honestly really enjoyed that a lot about this game. For instance, I could set a trap on the road for a truck to drive over, thus exploding the truck. The enemies nearby will be alerted and go to investigate and slowly walk into a tripmine, blowing up 2 enemies. Another enemy notices (in a particular area I don't have a clear shot in) and will approach the explosion in an area where I have a clear shot.Overall, the game isn't bad but it's not worth more than maybe $10 with the bugs currently in the game.

												I remember having plenty of fun playing the first two games. I am just not enjoying this game. It takes a lot of patience and still does not run well on my PC, even after many patches. It still feels buggy as it was at launch. The controls are still unresponsive and seem far too random. Half of the time when I pull the trigger, nothing happens. Yet I have plenty of ammo. It just doesn't fire. Sniper shots are best taken from scripted locations, sucking most fun out of planning good shots. I waited many months for patches to clean up the launch mess, and I swear it runs worse now than it did at launch. A hopeless mess of a game that I paid way too much for.			"

												I played V2 and had a good time though I found the stealth options limited and the maps constrictive or even theme park as it forced me down rails towards the area predetermined by the game where things would come to a head. It wasn't a bad game and in fact in coop it was rather enjoyable.So much so I got a copy of SN3 and even purchased a copy for a friend so we could happily coop play our way through it. This version is much more open and that near open world (or at least as close as they were going to come) allowed all kinds of tactical options. It really did change up the way the game was played and I mean that in a good way. If you want to play sniper/spotter killing from long range and repositioning then the game has it. If you wish for a sniper to cover the high ground while you stealth kill your way in close then it has it as well. If you are just in it for some laughs and go rocket launcher, shotgun and all things loud and destructive then it can be that as well. I've played the game, the dlc and I have no regrets about my copy or the one I purchased for a friend. My only complaint? More missions or at least simulate an open world and allow us to walk/run/drive our way around a map to the actual mission areas.			"

The first two took well over 30 hours to complete, I was expecting this to be the same but nope.  The game was fairly poorly made, there are huge bugs that didn't seem to get fixed before release.

												TLDR: don't buy yet, only if it's around 5bucks. bugged, still a console game with small closed totally linear maps, huge open maps and new tactical gameplay is a blatant lie, shooting feel got worse, missions are sometimes annoying, relocation mechanics ruin the immersion and are very annoying, AI is worse then V2, the sound masking finally makes some sense and works, game looks better and real pretty, pre-scripted chain reaction explosions are fun to trigger and watch.Just like others said before me, this is in almost no way better then v2 was.The most basic problem with the previous game was, that it was a console game, which made it play more like an on-rails shooter than an open world game. Small enviroments, a maximum of 2-3 paths to take on each map. It is still the case.The pros:- it looks better- more stealth options, like hiding in bushes, and now most things that go bang loud enough will hide your shots, like broken generators or explosions- chain explosions: you don't have to place bombs to take out every hard target you come across. This is the one and only freedom of choice you get during the missions. Place explosives/throw grenades, or find the right ""explosive tank of gas/ammo"" and shoot it, thus starting a chain explosion that takes out the target.The cons:- you are forced to move after every third shot you take, it doesn't matter that the nearest enemy is over 300 meters away, or 20. They will always instantly pinpoint your exact location, and start attacking you. So you must use the ""innovative, awesome, super new Relocation system"". It's a cheap and blatantly stupid way to save time and money on coding a proper AI, which in this case is worse than it was in the 90's. This means you cannot use any sniper hidout in the game for more than two shots, regardless of concealment, distance, and so on.- again this relocation system means, that if you run far enough without being spotted, which is like 30 meters, they stop searching for you. At least the game sais that it's all clear after about 30 seconds pass. This is a fail in itself. There is no pressure, you just need to have a rock a couple of meters back the way to hide behind.- But, when the game tells you it's all clear, sometimes it doesn't tell the AI this. A random soldier out of the dozens that was after you, stays in pursuit and keeps running towards your now supposedly unknown location, will find you no matter what, and will try to gun you down. So its a total fail.- There are a bunch of unlocks and upgrades in the game, they are all 100% useless and doesn't worth your time. They may change the scope wobble a bit, but lose the zoom on the scope, and such trade-offs make every choice a bad choice. Get another rifle, although all 4 works about the same, some are just more annoying to aim with than the others.- ""Sniper's Nests"" are thrown around the maps, basically telling you where to go and shoot from. You are encuraged by the game every time to visit and use these. The problem is, that these spots are totally useless, as you cannot shoot more than twice from them, because relocation...- first day DLC (I own it I think, because I was stupid enough to pre-purchase. I would not do it again though)- AI is as bad as it was, magic aim with machine pistols from a 100 meters, more accurate than your sniper rifle. It's really just a way to force you to ""use more stealth"". To put it bluntly, all the ""features"" in this game are there to make you play the game in the exact way the creators want you to.  So that you wouldn't notice the abyssmal AI, the total lack of open world and freedom of choice they promised. See, that's the deffiniton of an ""on-rails shooter"". The exact opposite of open world/multiple choice.-  the missions are a mess. For example, the very first mission after the tutorials. SPOILER ALERT: You are supposed to kill 4 officers, loot them, then a fifth a one pops up out of nowhere on a halftrack and you must blow it up. You are in the worst possible place, but the mission text and your character tells you that no worries, you have time to prepare. That is, actually, about 15 seconds, before the halftrack turns the corner and spots you. Once you are spotted, it's mission failed. If you hide, the truck simply leaves through the gates which takes about another 15 mintues. It's a quicktime event, which you can only solve if you have prepared for it, before you knew it existed. Clever, ehh? So after you figure it out, that the game autosaved before! you looted the last officer and started the event, you make the ""open world"" decision to use the mines and dynamite you found right before the autosave, to blow the hell out of the truck. It's no challange at all once you know that you need to place a single, otherwise useless, mine on the one and only road. See, that's the complex tactical and strategic ""decision"" you are allowed to make.The LIES:- Large open maps: The maps may be a little bit bigger, but this is still a last-gen console game. Everything is cramped into small valleys or obscured by hills and fog so you may not see farther than your avarage console shooter. And they are most certainly far from open. Every map is made out of ""zones"" like the city squares in v2. You have these small, little bit ""open spaces"", connected by valleys formed by walls of sand, rock, buildings... - Tactical gameplay: See mission example above. Where there is some more open space, the enemys won't load up, until you get close enough. This makes it impossible to properly plan an attack, because they will pop up in places where you wouldn't expect them. It's like we are back in 2000. At least in V2 it wasn't as annoying, because the narrow streets kept the pop-in hidden, and by the time you turned the corner onto the next street, most of them were in position, ready to receive their headshots. This time around, even when they load in, their hitboxes are bugged. Sometimes, although you should most definetly hit them according to the built-in ""aim bot diamond"", it still won't register as a hit on the target, because it's too far away for the game to handle. The hitboxes of enemies are generally bugged. You can only perform heart shots by aiming at the middle of their backs. A seemingly perfect hearth shot from the front will never kill.The Simply Disappointing:- New X-ray stuff: Now this is almost true. The fact is that you get almost the same effects as in V2, but now they painted in some muscles and veins. These do not interract with the bullet in any way, its just a second layer of ""skin"". - vehicles go boom and xray and such: It is vey very stupid. Not as much as previously, but almost. Unlike in V2 where you had to shoot the ""gas cap"" on a Tiger Tanks rear (those are air filters irl, nothing that contains fuel), in this game, to blow up a smaller Pz.III. you need 3-5 good shots. Two through the rear grills (there is no such thing on the real one in those places), and one through the window slit of the driver (you coudln't so it irl, its a ""periscope"" with mirrors, not a direct hole) It is True, that now you get kill cams of vehicles as well, but they are destroyed in the most stupid ways possible. Nothing historical, accurate, or fun. If you want to go a little more easy on tanks, use a Panershreck, there's always one around when you need it.- small number of maps, although because it's bugged, it takes a long time to finish.- shooting doesn't feel as satisfyingThe game is riddled with bugs. From dead enemys with blue tongues, through tanks that spin in a circle when they get hit by a rock, to the odd guard who can't be killed with bullets, only with meleé, your well planned stealthy approach can turn into a mess in seconds. I would not buy it again, and I certainly won't pre-purchase the next one, if there will be any. Buy this during the holiday season when it's like 5bucks, not worth more.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is a good but repetitive sequal to sniper elite v2. there are a couple of new things maps are a lot more open then the second one and vehicle take downs add a new way to take out your enemy and also makes tanks a harder opponent then the second one. The Ai can be easy or hard, when they are alert they are good flanking you and forceing you out of cover with grenades but when they are not they are fairly stupid with narrow cones of vision. the relocation machanic is nice helping you try to make the first shot count so that the enemy dont find you before you can relocate.this is offset by most snipeing spots that i have seen having some sort of noise generation nearby meaning that all you need is some patiance and you can snipe from one spot untill you need to move on to the next objectitive. all in all if you liked the second one then you should enjoy this as it is more of the same but improved. the reason i am not recomending this game is the price to content value. now if you are into the multiplayer this part of the review may not apply for those that prefer the single player you should know that there seems to be eight missions according to the achivements list not counting the target hitler DLC.Now while the missions do have secondary objectitves that you can complete that would padd out the game time i am on mission 6 after 4 hours of play according to steam. For 40 pounds i do not think that is good value to be honest and therefore am not recomending the game at full price. wait for a deep discount i belive that 20 would be a good price to start considering it but had i known what i know now i would have waited for it go for 10 or under not becuase its a bad game but becuase for me there is not a good ammount of content value here and it is very similar to the second. i should also note that the xray cam on normal happens on 99% of all sniper shots so you may want to turn it down a little but maybe my aim is better than i think it is.

												Sniper Elite 3 Review----------------------------Sniper Elite 3 has great graphics and mechanics.It has great features as the slow motion + X-ray when killing a enemy with a sniper, these features makes the game addicting and make you want to kill more enemies.The story is great and the missions takes alot of time to finish, and every missions map is huge.In Sniper Elite 3 you can choose the way you want to complete every mission so you can your own plans in the game, and in co-op you can plan ambushes and stuff like that.I don't like the multiplayer deathmatch but it doesn't bothers me.RATING: 9/10.I took one point off because of the price, but if you are a Sniper Elite fans / get it free with AMD graphics cards you should take it.

												Pros:- Better looking than SE 2- Great new enemy alertness / relocation system- Blow up more types of vehicles / armor piercing rounds- Loadout is far better looking / understandable and a bit more diverse.- Large maps that lets you do many of the objectives in an order of your choosing with many different tactics.Cons:- Less co-op / survival / overwatch maps than in SE 2 (hopefully this will improve)- Some odd animation bugs like standing while laying prone.- Some bugs with the alert system where many times they won't notice you shooting with your rifle at all.Overall I find the experience considerably better than SE 2 (which I also enjoyed)  so I would give it an 8 / 10.I made a video review and cover a few more things here: http://www.twitch.tv/penguinpowered/c/4563831 "

												Adventurous gameplay but the the story is kinda easy to predict, sometimes it feels like the villain's monologues come from movies like: ""We are the same, you and I. We are both soldiers, workers of war. We love our work.""But if you don't mind every detail of the game, then I guess you can give it a shot especially if you like killing Nazis and seeing their inner human parts during your sniper shots.

												I'm going to keep it short, this exactly what you've come to expect from the series. It plays great and feels great, but I also believe it's a little less demanding than the previous instalment...even though it looks better.It's nothing ground breaking, the gun sounds and headshots definitely feel powerful and intense, but the game is easier to play. Even playing on second hardest difficulty when you go into slow motion shot it actually high lights where your bullet will go so you can take a perfect shot. This is perfect for gamers like me that don't have time to master the game, but a little less perfect for those that would like a real challenge.That being said I haven't tried the hardest difficulty because you can't save and frankly I just don't have the time for that.So a quick summary in + and -s :+ Great graphics+ Rewarding gameplay and kill shots (enhanced kill cam)+ Easy controls (but quickly seen to be catered to console players with the weapon wheel)+ Satisfying X-ray kills+ Story Coop+ A little ""free roam"" to it, I mean it feels like it but the game just gives you a little more option as how to complete a level it's not as linear. So I would say it's the illusion of free roam, but it's just a big map with several waypoints- Really more of the same thing- Graphics are great but no visual leap forward- Controls take a slight step back in terms of cover, at least I have yet to find the cover button (edit, cover is simply being up against a wall and he chooses when to cover...a little tedious)- Game breaking bugs in some cases (Target glitches and you can't kill him). (edit seems to have patched a lot in latest release)Will update this as I complete the game, but it's def an 8/10 for me. It's nothing ground breaking but you will definitely enjoy it no matter what.That being said I would compare this game to any series, it's ok to have the same game play for a couple of releases but eventually they will need to try something new.I don't want the same game for Sniper 4.

												After very unpolished Nazi Zombie Army I shouldn't be expecting much. But somehow I was. I counted on a very improved Sniper V2 with new features and finally fixed multiplayer issues, but Rebellion doesn't learn from their own mistakes. So let's list down the pros and cons and see for yourself:- no server browser or even matchmaking for coop/survival- if your buddy quits, you go back to lobby, no option to continue alone- if your partner loses connection for a second it's also over- problems with bullet collision. For some reason if you go prone you risk missing. Maybe sth invisible stands in your bullet's way, no idea.- stupid collectibles (war logs, playing cards) that can only be picked up if you play on a lower difficulty level as on the higher ones you tend to avoid enemies. I think I don't have to mention that you won't collect them all with enemies around.- unreliable checkpoint system. It sometimes saves often, sometimes almost never (e.g reaching the fortress in mission 4)- ridiculously overpriced DLC content that should actually be free to be honest+ you can customize your loadout+ improved graphicsAll in all, it's a definite no-no. This games also ultimately confirms multiplayer is beyond Rebellion's capabilities.			"

												Pros: The missions are very long and involved and you generally have an unlimited way to approach them within the bounds of the game. A single mission can last a couple of hours. The sniper kill graphics are pretty cool but tire after the first 10 times or so. You can easily skip the slowmo by hitting space bar to get back in the game. The player AI is pretty good and the NPCs generally work to seek you out if they are aware of your presence. Cons: There are still significant bugs and restrictions in the game. Clipping errors and bounding regions that are too restrictive are a big issue. Areas that you should be able to fit through in the game are often frustratingly blocked. Also, the 'open world' is not as open as it could be. This really limits the immersiveness of the game by forcing you to stick within the walled bounds of the playfield and restricts your ability to move around. Areas where you should be able to climb or walk or crawl are restricted which makes the game play frustrating at times.It's a decent game but not worth the $54.99 regular price. Even at the sale price of $10.99 I'm not sure it's worth it.6/10 "

												Set during World War II players take on the role of elite OSS sniper Karl Fairburne across a selection of missions. Despite some fairly poor enemy AI (enemies will quite often just run straight into your crosshairs) the gameplay is solid and enjoyable with a good variety of objectives and interesting settings. As an added bonus the whole campaign can be played co-op which makes the game even more tactical, although the lack of an option to save mid-mission is an oversight seeing as they generally last for well over an hour. There are also a selection of co-op only ‘overwatch’ missions that focus on teamwork by tasking one player with using their sniper rifle to protect the other whilst they complete evolving objectives.  It has its flaws, and some of the slow motion kills may be a bit to gruesome for some, but overall Sniper Elite 3 is a good game, particularly if played with a co-op partner.ProsBig open mapstons of ways to complete the taskCoop with friend makes it betterGraphicsX-ray is niceConsStory is kinda plain Game is shortAi dunb at times			"

												Did you like FarCry3 and 4?  Was your favorite part of FarCry3 and 4 the sandboxy sneaking into outposts, tagging enemies so you could see them through walls, tossing rocks to divert their attention and hiding bodies?  Then this is the game for you!  It's like that but with much bigger outposts.  The one big difference is this game does not have FarCry's alarm disabling system; so far as I can tell.  I am currently on the 4th mission and having a great time.The missions are big, sprawling and take a long time to complete.  Fun stuff!My biggest gripe is the DLC.  Nickel & diming us for weapon selections.  Instead of earning them in the game by completing objectives, they are pay-to-unlock.  Not as fun, but more profitable for the publisher.Another minor negative is the character you play, Gristled Snipermen.  I think that is his name.  His voice sounds like the baddest of bad-asses in the most generic way possible.  It's almost cartoonish how bad♥♥♥♥♥he sounds.  It would have been nice if the character was given some more nuance.  A flaw, maybe even a touch of a sense of humor.  It doesn't detract from the game, but his performances can cause minor eye-rolling.			"

												It's a fairly good game, the graphics are rather nice, the levels are fairly well designed, there are some good sniping features; like being able to cover your shot sounds. The bad parts; the base part of the game is short in my opinion not worth the £40 price tag. There is a very limited range of base rifles, the new upgrades to them make an interesting feature however no modifications massively alter the rifles, one is decent enough, but there is a clear focus on making you pay for any other gear.There are some bugs, I encountered several crashes, an issue with collectables resetting the count, skipping bullet time causing lost shots, and afair few more minor bugs that were more of a nusance than majorr issue. I found myself more often than not ""going loud"" and sniping or using my rifles in a less than elite sniper manner due to bordum or frustration. Over all it is a good game if you could pick it up and all the DLC's for around £20 the lot.Oh and one of my major irritations was for all the attempted realism, being able to wipe out half a base, have people search for you and then give up ignoring the dead bodies littered around simply to go back on sentry duty, sometimes even patroling over an area of corpses, just seemed so basically wrong.

												Don't buy it now.  It is not worth the current asking price.  Wait for it to go on sale.  I agree with all of the other negative reviews given here.  All of their complaints are valid.  I saw the same things and feel the same way, cheated.  I will skip over complaining about the same things others have documented here and add even more.  I honestly don't see much difference between V3 and V2.  The small amount of content and lack of real enhancements to the environment don't merit the cost.  If it was $19.99 it would be worth it.  In fact, even if it included all the currently available DLC it wouldn't be worth $49.99.  Don't let the words "" ...huge, open levels and the exotic terrain... "" fool you.  They are larger maps but you can't go wherever you want like you can in say BF4 or Borderlands 2.  You can not jump.  You can only climb where and when they allow you to.  So you really are restricted in where you can go.  The X-ray vision of shooting people and vehicles only goes so far and becomes meh after the 10th or 15th time of seeing it.  The AI quite often will see you and shoot you through walls and other obsticles.  In game the voice over recommends you move dead bodies to avoid suspicion, but as soon as you pickup the dead body the enemy sees you and comes running.  Even if they don't have line of sight, if they are within a certain range they will come running.  After about the 10th time of trying to hide bodies I gave up.  I could be inside a building picking up a body and AI outside would come running in to catch me carrying the body.  I guess they heard me grunting and groaning while picking up the dead weight?  The bullet drop-off due to gravity is not consistent and the reticles on the scopes do not appear to be calibrated at all.  So you are almost always guessing when it comes to aiming.  The windage meter does not seem to be coordinated with the reticle either.  When it shows a 2 tick wind left to right and you adjust your aim with the reticle by 2 ticks you are completely off.  Sometimes that two ticks is only a-half on the reticle other times it 1 or 1.5 but it is never the same.  Guess work again.  All of the zoom levels of all the rifles, and all the scopes appear to be exactly the same despite the in game GUI telling you there are differences.  For example: according to the comparison feature of the GUI the Gewehr zoom level should be at least twice that of the Garand but it appears to be exactly the same when you are using it.  As a result of the lack of zoom, and poor windage and elevation implementations, long distance shots are extremely hard to make on the fourth or fifth shot, let along the first.  In a game where stealth and aim are key more work should have been done in this area.  None of my Long Shots were ever registered in my stats.  I got points for the the shot (they are detailed with each kill) but didn't get credit for completing a long shot at the end of the map. Several other stats are not accurately kept and credit for goals reached is not given at the end of the map. I can not help but feel the game was rushed to market.  It can not possibly be complete.  Like I said, even if they included all of the current DLC it wouldn't be worth $49.99.  Wait for it to go on sale to avoid the feeling of having been cheated.  Use the $49.99 to buy 4 or 5 other games that are now on sale for $9.99.  I guarantee that by the time you finish them you'll be able to get this game and all the DLC at half the price. Pops			"

												Feels like a flashback to Sniper Elite V2, which also was not that great.They even used the same lines of text again for the Germans, which is sad and not that meaningfull either or good or extensive or ... Sneaking/stealth is also not really optimized. In v2 you had a few maps with a background sound that would cover up your shot. Now they repeat it a bit more often... In some ridiculous ways actually. In the end you don't need it either, if you fire a shot you will have to move 40 somewhat meters and they will not be able to find you. Wait, wut?! And 20 seconds later everything is normal again, with only a corpse lying around there.... Want stealth? Buy Hitman: Blood Money or Absolution for example.Storywise it's... Never mind.The only thing it has going for it is the x-ray killcam, which after 10 shots will feel old and not that special.Maybe the co-op is fun, haven't tried it yet. All I know is, it will be damn hard to finish this game, just like v2 was and that is not because of the difficulty level...UPDATE:It's way to hard.... to keep going and finish this.			"

												One review....can change history.Nah, just kidding. There are of course some pros and cons, and I'll start with the pros:- Real stealth this time. Previous game had ''stealth'' but could never draw away from the enemy attention.- Customization. Can have different loadouts (Alpha - Delta). You can also change your rifle with different scopes, stocks, actions etc. These have different advantages and disadvantages.- Better graphics. Graphics are not really ''next-gen'', but are definitely better than the previous game.- More open maps. More variety in maps so you can choose different approaches.- Improved killcam. More layers when in x-ray killcam such as muscle layers etc.Cons:- AI. Yes, the Ai has been improved, but are still a bit stupid even when on hardest difficulty.- Variety of weapons. MUCH less weapons than previous game.- Ranking system. I personally think this system is a bit useless in SP, because you get xp for EVERTHING.- Experience gain. I also think this is wrong, because you get more XP for killing with your silenced pistol than for a stealth takedown with your hands.Despite all these things, I still think is a very good game, even for the not so Sniper Elite Vets. So, I suggest you give it a try.			"

This Game was Funnnn!I did not enjoy a game like this in a loooooong time.-Nice original story, true to historical fact.-3rd person play.-AAA+ Graphics.-The HUD is improved on previous games.I want another Sniper Elite game to follow this. Karl Fairburne is the perfect protagonist, I do feel like replaying Sniper Elite V2 after finishing this.The game has 8 chapters, the loadout is expanded compared to previous games, unfortunately it's WW2 here and the rifle is not silenced :-)  Dev's day riding on a horse in a knight's armor[www.eurogamer.net]I recommend this game, and all in the series, I own SNIPER ELITE 1, but wish a dev would see this and REMASTER IT.I finished the playable DLC; & cannot stop asking for another game in the series or total re-master to the quality of SNIPER ELITE V2 or SNIPER ELITE 3 (SNIPER ELITE1).DLC-4 playable chaptersIf you're feeling bored......,& want to play something because you completed SNIPER ELITE 4,3 & 2,

												This game is probably the best sniper simulator ever. Part surgeon simulator, part booby-trap simulator, part shooty-person simulator, and part elite simulator. So the story is pretty basic, you are suuuch an elite sniper that they send you to Africa to die with the f***in French and British soldiers who cannot hold their own against the nazis. You go on 8 limited sandbox-like missions where you snipe a few nazis, hide, and booby trap stuff in a small map. The game is so great that you can get FOUR different sniper rifles, and THREE different pistols. Oh by the way you get to kill Hitler so that was kinda cool i guess. I give this game four out of five sniper elites, because this game is so elite that you better not delete.			"

												Unfortunately the Sniper Elite series is becoming a disappointment quite fast. The new game mechanics, like forcing you to relocate, become repetitive really fast since you just have to run back 30 meters and then go back in order to the same damn place in order to keep shooting the same enemies. I get it, relocation is important as a sniper, but I can really keep shooting from the same place by doing a little field workout? That's just plain stupid.The same goes for sound sources. It's predictable and repetitive. You can stand next to a broken generator and keep shooting enemies like clay pidgeons.  Also, the story evens, such as appearing reinforcements are sooooo predictable. Lay down a couple of mines and watch your enemies explode and the mission finish itself. I have to say, Sniper Elite 1 did WAY better in that regard.As if that wasn't enough, you routinely encounter enemy snipers who have WAY better rifles than you, which again, doesn't make any sense, neither from a gameplay perspective, nor from a historic one.As a summary, I get it that the developers wanted the game to be more appealing to the masses, but it's been dumbed down too far for my taste.

Recommended: With a powerful stealth system, great sniping mechanics, and expansive well-designed levels, there's  a lot of stealth fun to be had in Sniper Elite 3, and the run-and-gun gameplay also feels pretty decent. The levels are a bit long and the objectives a bit repetitive, and the story is fairly generic, but the core of the game in that sniping is strong and excellently-implemented and make the game a lot of fun to play.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Finished the campaign in 14 hours exploring as much as i can and collecting some random♥♥♥♥♥♥What i liked:- bigger maps compared to V2 and more stealth options, more ways to approach an objective- improved X-ray killcam (now for vehicles too), sometimes it can get buggy, sad- weapon customisation (although every rifle has the same, wtf)- optional objectives+more collectibles- rank system keeps you occupied for a whileWhat i didn't like so much:- as i mentioned the maps are bigger and open, but it is far from sandbox, i ran into so many invisible barriers that it's not even funny- the AI is still stupid, only a bit more challenging on harder difficulties- only 8 levels, can be completed in 30-60 minutes, depending on how you want to play it, how much you want to explore, collect things- 4 snipers to begin with, this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most, i mean this is a sniper game (4 DLC-s already available to download though (just some random weapons), i'm sure there are plenty more to come; ty Rebellion)- very weak story imo, and that ending is so....so typical- only 2 maps for Survival and Owerwatch (i'm sure DLC-s will solve this problem :)- have i mentioned the awful AI? Will do it againHaven't tried multi yet, heard it's a campfest, no thank you. If you can get over with it's flaws i say that Sniper Elite 3 is an improvement to V2, but not by much, those who liked V2, will like this too, i had my fun with it. Recommend it to fans only, but not with it's current price, wait for at least a half price sale.			"

												My stats might say 1hour but I played offline outside Steam and the hours did not add up from my save, so yeah.I played some decent hours in this game, online and singleplayer so lets start there.The graphics are a little updated from Sniper Elite V2 and they look a little better, ish and I mean ish not much more.The audio is the same with explosions in the background, talking AI etcThe controls are all the same with no real changes apart from a few new keys.The game has some nice new features, like medikits which is nice and now you can heal yourself instead of auto healing.  I am like half way through already and never played anymore of the singleplayer.  It is not open world but the maps are big enough for you to enjoy and have a little.. little wonder around with a multiple route towards a mission which is good.The multiplayer has some really nice parts of the game.  If you enjoyed Sniper Elite V2, then you will enjoy this too.  The maps are bigger in portion and offer some nice visuals on the side and up close with many many ways around over, through and under something.  Really good fun.  Then you notice the game itself is the same as Sniper Elite V2 and becomes very boring. Once you been there and done that you play this and you realise the game is like a big addon.  It's like what Call of Duty do with their games, they copy paste everything and just release new campaign for a £39.99 price tag, this is kinda the same but the story is a lot shorter and the graphics are improved.The new bullet cam is improved, with added detail to when your bullet hits your mark, you get more detail ontop of crushing bone, exploding limbs etc  Really good step up but still the same game.If you enjoy the entire franchise then you will most likely enjoy this game too, really it has some good stuff added to the game but it is more or less the same and for the £39.99 price tag, it kinda steers you away.Personally the game is worth the time to play and enjoy.  Once you done the campaign you might get enjoyment from another repeat but I would not, luckily the game has multiplayer and you will benefit from this sniper each other and setting traps with good unlocks to help play the game.Wait for the price to drop below £29.99 and maybe £26.99 and the game will be worth the time and money then. Would I recommend it? Yes because it is a good game but not the price wanted.			"

												Arcade. Don´t buy this game if you expect some realism. Examples: I shot PzKpfw III with Panzerschreck to its back armor, and i only destroyed its tracks. Another thing is that African campaign ended 13. 5. 1943 and here every fifth guy uses fraking Panzerschreck (it was introduced in 1943, but here it look like they bought them in humblebundle. And they all use updated version  introduced in october 1943). Best part was when we (in coop campaign) saw position with flak 36 guarded  by only 2 men, and you guessed it, they both had Panzerschrecks. And they won´t hesitate, and will use HEAT round against single man. Bullet drop is awful (but Panzerschreck flies completely straight), and you cant hit anything with submachinegun,if it is more than 10 m away. And you have problem to hit person 5 m away with longer burst. Even MG 42 on tripod has bigger reticle than Opel blitz (truck) 20 m away, no joke, i tested it. In mission where you have to destroy that PZ III it has normal coaxial 2x mg 34, but when they hit something, there are bigger explosions than from 20 cannon. And you can run thru entire levels only with mp 40 on a highest difficulty.			"

Sniper Elite 3 - Simple ReviewGreat game, graphics are awesome and game-play is fun yet challenging. AI is great. Level design is very good. There are many different ways to play each mission which gives hours of replay ability. However, game-play is a hell of a lot more fun in the Co-op mode. Yet to try the 'Multiplayer' section of the game. Quite a lot of weapon DLC but this doesn't bother me as it's pretty standard for games of the current generation, and I'm happy to help support a decent game.Buy if you're a fan of 3rd person shooters with elements of stealth, and give the co-op campaign a go with a friend for maximum enjoyment!

Sniper Elite 3 ReviewSniper Elite 3 is a rich, deeply entertaining third-person shooter that is sure to please even the most demanding gamers. Unlike many franchises, Sniper Elite continues to get better with each sequel while expanding on its original recipe for success. Naturally the graphics are much improved, but overall gameplay and concepts core to the game have also received major upgrades.The much-loved ""Kill Cam"" is back and better than ever, giving gamers a rush of adrenaline and satisfaction after a successful target elimination in true sniper fashion. The stealth component of the game is also better than either of its predecessors and can play a vital role in a mission's success depending on the gamer's style of play. Replay value is extremely high for this game with the inclusion of steam achievements, co-op play and several options for multiplayer.I thoroughly enjoyed this game personally and while I do recommend this game to those who enjoy action/adventure games,  I feel it is important to inform you that the game is not without its flaws and let-downs. as well. The awesome graphics come at a price. Those who are running older systems may experience lag or crashes due to the high CPU and RAM usage. I would strongly suggest passing on this game if your system does not meet the minimum system requirements listed by the publisher. Also, expect a few minor bugs, typically associated with troop ai and steam achievements. And most disappointing of all, while claiming to be a ""sniper"" game and containing some aspects that suggest that it is, most often you will find yourself armed with a silenced pistol or sneaking up behind enemies for hand-to-hand kills if you choose to play missions in a stealthy manner.Overall, this is a very fun game and will give you many hours of enjoyment, especially if you pick up the extra DLC missions as well. However, I would only recommend picking this game up when it is on sale due to the reasons listed above and knowing that the base game only comes with eight missions for the single player campaign. In my opinion it is way over-priced ($49.99 USD) for a game that is over 8 months old on Steam and is also available on XBox 360, PS3, and PS4 which means finding a used copy for a console at a much cheaper price can easily be done.The Good:========+  Quality base campaign with an interesting storyline+  Smooth controls and mechanics/Controller compatible+  Multiplayer and Co-op missions+  Detailed maps and graphics+  Blood and gore+  Versatile gameplay+  Quality DLC content+  Steam achievements+  High replay valueThe Bad:=======-  Bugs and glitches (minor & not game-breaking)-  Too expensive at full price-   Single player campaign is short-  While much-improved, some elements still need work (ie. stealth, sniper, camoflauge, etc)Final Thoughts:===========The Sniper Elite series continues to improve and its success and popularity are growing. This is definitely one to keep an eye on and I hope to see a Sniper Elite 4 in the near future> For an action/stealth war game it is still only average in my opinion. It is dressed up nicely and a lot of fun but let's face it, there is still a lot that can be done to enrich the quality of this game. Camoflauge serves absolutely no purpose, enemies all have eagle eyes and can instantly spot you from several hundred yards away when even slightly out of cover, and for a game who's own namesake emphasizes the ""sniper"" concept, this game falls way short in actually delivering upon that in much of the mission objectives. It plays out as more of a commando or special forces type of game than an actual sniper game. All of that being said, I still recommend this game to all those who enjoy third-person shooters. Its that good!If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												My prayers have been answered! As per my review of this game's predecessor, I was looking for similar gameplay with more of a jungle-like setting. Way to deliver REBELLION! Visuals are very much improved. Gameplay is much the same as before. Perhaps a little smoother even. I very much enjoy the new sneak attacks and stealth kills. I love how you can mask your rifle fire with other loud sounds. Keep em coming!The multiplayer community while small, is so far very decent and friendly. I enjoy the paranoia that envelops me when I peek out in search of a target ripe for the killing whilst being completely aware that I'm just as easily susceptible to having my own brains obliterated by another players bullet in a deathmatch round!

												This has to be the DEFINITIVE Marksman's simulation... While I personally feel the Bullet pointer shouldn't have been on the 'Elite' Setting  - hey, that's what the 'Authentic' setting's for... The ambient 'scapes are the best I've ever seen and having played From the First game, its been a blast... While I thoroughly Enjoyed the other Sniper Trilogy, this somehow elevates that experience and makes the bar that much higher - while clinching the Sniper game Crown. This is the benchmark every sharpshooting simulation will have to beat -for more than just Projectile dynamics... you feel the purpose behind each squeeze of the trigger... the DLC's are a must to get and I only wish the game was longer. In its genre, 9/10 A must buy for marksmen wannabes.			"

												I decided to buy this game because it was supposed to be more open and give you choices. That is not the case. Bullet drop matters for you but still not the computer. Just FYI .. A panzerfaust will bullseye you from over 200 meters. which is pretty amazing as it is outside of the range of the actual weapon. You spend most of the game unable to use your rifle and they flat out tell you your SMG is not a primary weapon ... true. You are left sneaking about with a silenced pistol most of the game or trying to sneak up behind for a stealth kill. (funnier still he basically poses for stealth kills)  You can only climb up and over designated places and items. It is a decent stealth game BUT ultimately a let down as the open environment boils down to still horribly linear. I got it on the 75% sale so just calling it a bad decidion and moving on to other games.			"

												Sniper Elite v2 was much better. The rifles where much better and if you are shooting without any assist on, good rifles with good reticles are a must. In SE3, because of the customization things and all that, the rifles don't synergize with the reticles that much well. It also seems that the rifles zoom much less. In V2, the springfield is supposed to have 4x zoom, the mosin 6x and the gewehr 8x, but in SE3, the values seem to be halved and everything looks tiny. The scope wobble is super exaggerated and this makes shooting a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ as well as having to use the empty lung feature that messes up the aim due to it's zoom in feature. good thing is that some of the new maps are pretty cool.

												Very solidly built with a fair bit of space to work with, as opposed to corridors.  There are only a few missions but they take some time to complete if you pace yourself - people who ignore bonus objectives and speed run & gun will probably find it a bit short.  If you take your time and play it like Metal Gear Solid: WWII Edition it's quite fun though.Customisation options are a nice step, but they seem rather arbitrary and I couldn't find any clear indication on how to unlock weapon parts/sight reticles other than just randomly looting them off bodies.  In addition, there's only a handful of weapons (compared to Nazi Zombie Army 2's arsenal - still more expansive than V2 however) and you'll probably never bother with any pistol besides the Welrod simply because of the massive stealth advantage it gives you.The ending is a little anti-climatic too, and it feels like there should have been a bit more to it, but outside of these minor nitpicks it's a fun and well done game.  Definitely recommended.			"

Hoping 4 will be the glory that is sniping in this game without ""realistic"" mode AI that can Keep locked onto your position even if you're 100% sure you broke line of sight and picked a non obvious direction. With better variation in modes so I don't end up jumping from easily doable to ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t even by changing the custom settings. The ability to do some of the CORE GAME MECHANICS on the highest mode rather than the game teaching you how to so something you're not allowed to do on the hardest mode (ie marking targets). And most importantly IF I KILL THE GENERAL ON THE SECOND MISSION DONT ♥♥♥♥ING FAIL ME FOR THE OTHER TO WORTHLESS GRUNTS DRIVING AWAY. THE MISSION OBJECTIVE WAS NOT TO DESTROY THE GENERAL'S VEHICLE, IT WAS TO KILL HIM AND IF I HEADSHOT HIM FROM ABOVE AND GET A MISSION COMPLETE............. THEN WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD I FAIL THE MISSION FOR THE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥GUNNER AND DRIVER GETTING AWAY??????????????????? 0/10 should be 10/10 if it wasn't chalked full of mediocre, easy-to-fix ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Excited to see if Sniper Elite 4 lets me enjoy the hardest difficulty without straight-up ♥♥♥♥ing me out of the rest of the game.			"

												Sniper Elite v2 was much better. The rifles where much better and if you are shooting without any assist on, good rifles with good reticles are a must. In SE3, because of the customization things and all that, the rifles don't synergize with the reticles that much well. It also seems that the rifles zoom much less. In V2, the springfield is supposed to have 4x zoom, the mosin 6x and the gewehr 8x, but in SE3, the values seem to be halved and everything looks tiny. The scope wobble is super exaggerated and this makes shooting a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ as well as having to use the empty lung feature that messes up the aim due to it's zoom in feature. good thing is that some of the new maps are pretty cool. I would like the old weapons with the new maps			"

												This game disappointed me, it has all the elements that could make a good sniper game like setting up ambushes, scoring headshots and even the cool kill-cam, but it's hampered by the other limitations this game has starting with the AI. The AI goes beyond the typical moronic stealth soldiers if that were even possible. A common tactic you would employ is to kill an entire squad run away from where they last see you and they completely forget you even exist. The AI wouldn't have been a problem if they took splinter cells' alarm system. As for the actual stealth it's what you would expect you sneak around and shoot people with a silenced pistol. You can also kick generators to cover up the sound of your sniper rifle, how this muffles the sound of a mosin-nagant I have no idea. All in all it was a dull and boring game to play through, it did run great though I guess that's a plus.			"

												Its like they read my review for v2 (which I was on the fence about, but ultimately couldn't recommend).  Its no longer a grindfesty turkey shoot.  It now has a fully realized stealth and relocate system.  Also, a melee takedown.  Finally.  I had a blast playing this game.  Its designed more like the older Hitman games.  Open levels, kill everyone, or kill the target only, go undetected, or go guns blazing.  My only gripe is the ""realistic"" bullet physics are less realistic, and more just to make the game harder.  A .306 round is not going to drop a entire yard at a hundred yards out.  Which is pretty much a CS gripe.  So, this is a recommend.			"

												Sniper Elite III is set several years prior to the events of V2, following the exploits of Office of Strategic Services officer Karl Fairburne as he participates in the North African conflict during World War II, in which he learns of a secret wonder weapon programmed by the Nazi forces (The Ratte).Gameplay reminds me of a rail shooter (with alternate rails at times) similar to Spec Ops The Line, Tomb Raider etc...A really enjoyable game and storyline. If I had to make recommendations for V4 it would be an open world environment.Rating: 8/10			"

												Let's face it: the only good part of this game is the X-RAY bullet cams.The enemies are incompetent and have♥♥♥♥♥♥AI even at the highest difficulty. Especially enemy vehicles.Stealthing is literally pointless unless you want to crawl around the map with your welrod for the entire game. It's easier and more satisfying just to point and click with your rifle.The story is very poor... why even bother making a story if you're going to make it that uninspired and cold? Don't even get me started on the cliches and voice acting.You do get a little more flexibility in regards to routes to objectives and in which order you do them, which is nice, but it's not really a massive step up from the previous game. On the graphical side of things, its nothing incredible, but it certainly isn't bad by any means.Verdict: It's fun for a while then loses novelty. Do not pay full price for this game. Wait until it's on sale. "

												Inferior to V2 in almost every way other than the graphics.  -Half a game with a thousand DLC addons. -8 crappy levels, 3 guns.-Why force me to sneak around all the time?  I want to slaughter 100s of Nazis with Xray sniper shots, this is why I bought the game.  If I wanted to sneak around, then I would play games without the word ""sniper"" in their title.-Bought the game for co-op, except it was obviously designed for a single player only.  Players are basically on top of each other inside sniper nests.-No Xray shots when playing co-op after the first level.  Ever.-Crashes/Disconnects all the time in co-op.  Couldn't even complete the last level because it kept crashing in the same spot. Took what was an awesome game and ruined it.			"

												How was this game so boring.Seriously, it felt like a chore to complete. With the bugs in the enemy AI, clipping into each other, having invisible ""bulletproof"" barriers around some objects, repetative gameplay, pointless customization, uninteresting 2-dimensional character, obnoxious auto-saves that could potentially screw up a playthrough of a level, a complete lack of swastikas (for a game about shooting nazis), and a bland generic story; there was little to enjoy about this game. The novelty of shooting someone in slow motion wore off quickly, and it ultimately became best to just fire a few rounds into the air at the beginning of the level and pick off all the nazis as they bumbled into each other a-la-3 stooges in a single file line towards you.I didn't try the multiplayer, maybe it was good, I wouldn't know. The single player campaign sucked.			"

												I just finished playing the main campaign, I dragged it out several hours mainly by my poor play,  rushing over the maps instead of being a bit more stealthy.  I was also only playing for short periods so sometimes it took me a while to finish a map. Its not the sort of game that you can't leave I was more than happy when killed just to switch it off.  Its not a bad game overall if you are looking for an arcade game. The graphics are OK but early COD looking. The sniper simulation seems poor to me. The difficulty level I played on was a step down from the top level and the bullet physics should have on been ""real"" but it seemed very poor & quirky. The maps are quite small so there are few opportunities for very long distance shots where maybe weather would have an efffect. There are no weather effects to indicate wind direction for example. The environmental effects are static.  A few bug fixes have come out and I'm not sure my game was patched unlike other steam games where its automatic.I bought the discounted game with an included DLC which I can't find and quite honestly I don't want to waste any more time playing it. This game had the worse publicity I've seen for a game and its full list price was too much for the content provided.  I'm going to give it a negative review since I don't want to suggest people spend money on this, not at the moment. Maybe when its in a heavily discounted sale and you want to while a way a few tired hours with not very taxing gameplay, give it ago.			"

												It's a fun co-op game. It's a really crappy and painful experience to play co-op in, though, since it very easily disconnects the peer and does not have any function to resume playing without restarting.But try LAN play instead, you may think, it usually works better, right? Yeah, probably, except there is no LAN game for the simple reason that the game could then be pirated.I sincerely regret supporting this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I will never again buy a Sniper Elite game.

The old and new mechanics are refined and are brilliant, much better than previous game.AI has improved from previous game. However they are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but are so fun to kill.There is also a lot more customisation with rifles, loadout and lots more.Multiplayer is great, however needs more people and some touches.Only problem is some glitches it has like invisible Ammo Boxes ad bodies spazzing everywhere.What else can I say?All I can say is.....

I started the single player and it wasn't that bad. Surely the theater wasn't that nice as in bombed Berlin but still the new improved technics of the game made it quite fun. But after ending the single player version I started to play MP. Oh my god, what is this?? Many, many, many errors, unbelievable and how to get around in these huge playing rooms without a map? Why cancelling this option? In V2 you had a map. V2 and then in particular the coast map was so much fun but sadly this isn't.			"

Open levels you can take on your own way.The X-Ray cam is now much more satisfying, adding an extra layer and making the previous much more realistic.The AI are actually somewhat more intelligent than the previous game, they can now hear you and everything around them and search for you, not just run aimlessly where to you were hiding.The Multiplayer mode is great too, ""No Cross"" mode allows for actual sniping, teams separated by buildings and blockades meaning no XX360nOxSC0p3zXX to be seen for miles.

												It's got the same shooting mechanics as Sniper Elite V2, but the level design, health, and stealth mechanics are changed such that instead of being a cover shooter, it's more of a tactical and strategic, somewhat open-ended combat stealth game. Overall, I think I like V2 slightly more because 3 distracts from the excellent shooting with merely good strategic considerations, but this one is still quite fun.			"

												Well, I can't say that I am ""all happy"" with the game - so I'll try to give you some of the pro's and con's. I also have to say that I have only played ""campaign"" on intermediate difficulty level up to mission 6 so far:Pros:- good graphics, good physical effects (wind, noise etc)- good choice of contemporary weapons with even more choice from DLCsCon:- it's not an open world. You can't climb rocks or get on top of some ridges/roofs if it's not ""planned"" by the producers.- the enemies are very predictable e.g. the guards follow their routine tracks, only leave them when alert. There is no backup of enemies - if you kill all in an area, you can walk openly across the squares and guards from another area will stay in their designated places (as long they don't see you). And if you are used to other games like BF3 and use your weapons well (booby traps aso) - it's not too hard do kill! NOTE: that goes at least for intermediate difficulty!- the game in this difficulty is very predictable in general: if you find e.g. an anti tank weapon - you can be sure you will need it quite soon!Conclusion: if you like sniper games AND the WW2 flair - you will appreciate the graphics. If you need a real challenge, you may be rather disappointed by above limitations.DUKE			"

Beautiful graphics, good mechanics, mediocre map design, weak story and characters, bad AI. It seems the developer want this game to be stealth game, but the map design and the bad AI ruined the stealth aspect of the game. Once you get caught by an enemy (and trust me, you will get caught since your Sniper Rifle is not suppressed and the map is not big enough to snipe enemy from more than 1 km away), all other enemy in the map can spot you and hunts you down with deadly accuracy shot. In short, the single player campaign missions is a disaster. Fortunately the campaign co-op and multiplayer match is fun enough to redeem it.CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.   "

												Why this game gets so much Steam community praise in spite of what Rebellion did to Ironclad perplexes me (I thought the community loved to hate ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers?). Having said that, I genuinely did think find this game to be pretty crap, not just because of who made it. I immediately lost interest in it by the second nighttime mission, whereby I realised that the only good feature about the game was the gimmick of it being set in a bright African WW2 environment. Third person games are usually just that because they have an interesting character which the developer wants you to see throughout the game. Well the character in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and also American (the US weren't even in the war when the fighting was going strong in Africa!). It should be first person so the environments have a bigger impact.The final mission was absolutely horrid and seems to abandon the stealth focus that the game has leading up to it. I had to grit my teeth to finish it and only did so because I paid for the game.			"

It's probably no worse than what passes for an average fps campaign these days (even better than some I could mention) but it wasn't good enough to get me to consider dlc or a season pass. At $30 I'd say this game is worthwhile. At $50...... not so much.			"

From 15-20 years ago. I still have it and play it. Those games are better than this. Graphics are better but that is all they did with Sniper3. Give you more distant targets to shoot and sureal death seans. This game gets a 4/10 paying full price.  Tedious after the 2nd playthrough. There is not enough content to justify full price. The DLC cost more then the game does. Wait for a sale to play this you will not be missing a thing. Compared to BF the first one, Sniper3 is like only having a sniper to play with.Have run into 5 glitches 3 of which prevented me from finishing my paythrough and had to start over. If you didn't save at the right time you will have to start all over from scratch. Save often			"

												My opinion of this game is really straightforward; It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It's not perfect, by any means, as many mechanics are frustrating not only to people who have just started playing sniper elite, but also long running fans. V2 stands as my favourite game in the series, however many parts of this game are also an improvement. It is THE most fun sniper series to date, and with the 4th one coming soon, I found it important to voice my opinion on this. Pick this up if you haven't already. Its such a fun experience "

												There are just things that you'll love and hate about Sniper Elite 3The Love: The game itselfYou gotta give it to Rebellion, for reinvigorating Sniper Elite series and giving it a fresh look on SE3.The Graphic, notch it up to the highest setting your GPU can handle, and you'll see how well Rebellion texturize, placing the obscurence field for the far-distance draw and giving it the 'Dx11 feel' (aka Tesselation). Aside a few graphical bug and glitches I found, the graphic for this game is superb.The Sound/Music/Ambience, the music on this game also act as a cue whether you're being seen, found out, and engaged in a combat. Any sound generated from any object in the game are well made. And the ambience on every level, like when in night mission, you can hear the cricket and the dullness of night, is just adding more to how immersive the game is offering.The Gameplay, 3 major things on this one. The Relocate strategy, The Map, and The AI. The Relocate strategy works to make the sniper-play work more believable (like, when you do something that gives yourself out, you must leave the location a few distance, cause enemy will come to investigate that location), and also it works in tandem with how big the map is.It's 3x bigger than SEV2 map, and designed also with multiple entry and approaches in mind. You can do an objective in many ways, silently taking the enemy out, or herd them to 1 place, and blow a planted explosive at their feet. The AI also is getting more smarter on this game. The AXON AI, the new AI logic on SE3, will not giving your location to the enemy when you're found out (like in SEV2), instead, when an enemy hear/see something strange on a location, they will go to that place to check it out. If things got more heated, they will also not just swarming you out from your cover. If there is a high-ranking officer in the area, he will direct the lower rank soldier and told them to move in group, stay in cover, and taking turn firing at you or stay hidden in cover until you're going into their firing range, giving yourself more hard time to deal with the now-directed enemies.That way, every game you play could have different result based on how you want it to play out, instead with the linear map play the SEV2 offer.Now what's the Hate? The pricing of the gameI find the price of this game is quite exaggerated, considering much of its content of the game are now in DLC.Things like more weapon, more challenge mission, more multiplayer maps are being placed on priced DLC.The fact that this game is priced on $50, and to get all the game's content to extend this game playtime, you must buy another DLC, is just not right with me (and maybe most gamer out there). Maybe if this game are on the $30 range, the DLC is quite the right move for the developer (they need money, making game is awfully expensive).That said, I say it's a good choice for getting Sniper Elite 3, it's the best semi-realistic sniper-simulation game out there (outclasssing it's own predecessor). But if you have something that made you hesitate to buy this game (like the one explained on the Hate section), wait for a discount, then grab the game and also all the DLC if you can. "

												I never completed the singleplayer because i found it boring with a huge lack of story.Sniper Elite 3 is more interesting as a bullet hit simulator than the actual gameplay. The developers put so much time making Sniper Elite 3 look good without making it good at all.I thought maybe it's a multiplayer based game and the singleplayer is just to attract people to buy the game.Oh boy I was wrong. A sniper purpose is to be unseen and kill unspsecting enemies of their presense. Putting 8 sniper vs 8 snipers isn't a great idea specially in a relatively small map for 16 snipers.Gameplay is campy and unrewarding.Also it feels like Sniper Elite developers tried to make it feel like a COD game they kind of succeeded and also failed. It's feels like one but it ain't because of the odd gameplay style of the game.overall won't be worthing your money I would say if you want to be a sniper try battlefield bad company 2 it has a rewarding system with snipers.sniper elite rating 4/10			"

Posted: June 28, 2014
												It's safe to say that this game will be one of my top candidates for game of the year.Let me first say that I am a fan of this series. Sniper Elite V2 despite it's flaws is one of my favorite games of the last ""generation"". I love the idea of being a sniper and going behind enemy lines to kill Nazis. The moment Sniper Elite 3 was announced I was immediately excited and I pre-ordered it the first day it was made available on Steam.With that caveat out of the way, Sniper Elite 3 is essentially a beefed up V2 in a brand new setting. Like V2, you're not playing this game because of the story. This game is all about fun, sneaking around, and killing Nazis as effortlessly as possible. What makes Sniper Elite 3 superior to its predecessor is how it takes the mechanics I was first introduced to in V2 and ramps it up and improves the gameplay in almost every respect.Let's start with the basic improvements. For me, there are two absolute standouts. The first that comes to mind is AI. While it's not perfect, it's much more fine tuned. It's now possible to kill in a variety of ways, from up close an personal melee kills, sneaking around with a silenced pistol, and of course the core of the game, sniping. In V2, once you took a shot the enemy was aware of your presence, where you were, and they don't let up until they're dead or you're dead. Now, relocating is imperative and allow to ""reset"" should you be discovered to go back to playing stealthily. I do think the AI could be further improved on even more, but I find that I have that gripe in a lot of games.  In SE3, it's now possible to use sound to your advantage which presents itself in a variety of ways including a howitzer being fired, a faulty generator, and even the weather + there are others. A prompt at the top of the screen comes up when the sound is masking your shot. This allows the player to stealth large portions of, if not the entire level. The second massive improvement comes with the way you approach each mission. One of the biggest knocks on V2 is that it was very linear, and you were forced to play a certain way. Not anymore. The maps in SE3 are humongous and allow the player to approach a mission anyway they choose. Earlier today, I was on the 3rd mission and by the time I completed it, I realized I had spent well over 90 minutes exploring, trying to find the collectibles (still missed some) and killing Nazis on this one map alone. This improvement alone increases the re-playability of the game.The improved and more detailed Kill Cam is also a welcome inclusion as nothing beats an enemies head exploding after a perfectly placed head shot.Technically, I think the game is very tight. The Africa setting is rendered extremely well and the graphics are very strong. I also find that the sound design is good and it's nice to hear the German army actually speak German. I've encountered very minimal bugs which undoubtedly will be patched before long.There are a variety of different game modes right out of the box including the return of Survival (a horde mode) which can be played solo or with a friend only for now (hope they allow randoms again like in V2), and the return of co-op modes like Overwatch, which allow one player to be the spotter and one player to be the sniper. There's also the addition of multiplayer modes including the requisite team deathmatch. I have yet to explore most of the other modes at the time of this review, and will return once I have gotten a feel for them. I did however spend an hour trying Solo Survival, and I know that will add to the replay value the further along that I go.I feel that this game is exactly what a sequel should be. Change locations, improve the technical details of the game, and add some new, and very welcome elements that truly make it unique. I would love to see V2 patched with a lot of the SE3 additions, which is obviously a pipe dream, but the changes are so well done that it would be awesome to see.All in all this is an excellent game that I'm excited to play even more. I know that I will still be playing Sniper Elite 3 for the foreseeable future and eagerly am anticipating what else is coming down the pipe that will add to the game even further.8/10			"

												Something with this is off - it's just not fun.Graphics are pretty but the story is so trash with its cookie cutter yank with gravel stuck down his gullet. The whole bullet camera thing gets old really fast and you'll find yourself turning it off in options (which is handy to be fair). COOP is boring and usually ends up in the two of you sat on some rock or roof picking the stupid AI off as the run in walls and bales of hay. The whole lighting dynamite with flint is just fiddly for the sake of it as well.TL;DR: Utterly boring due to the stupid AI, terrible story and forgetful characters and repetitve mechanics. I didn't even bother to waste my time trying to finish it.			"

												Stealth, long range precision distance kills and deadly melee takedowns. A major improvement from the 1st and 2nd iterations of the series. This truly defines what a stealth sniping game is all about. Graphics: 10/10Outstanding by any means. The level of detail is something to behold, I have not seen this much level in detail in a game for so long. This one looks absolutely gorgeous even at low-medium settings. There are also a lot of graphics options to choose from to suit your needs and to maximise your experience.Storyline: 7/10You have to stop Germany from building a Super Tank that could potentially be used to change the tide of war. Other than that, that is the only ‘story’ you will get from this game as it isn’t really a story heavy game and it wasn’t made to be one. You’re buying this for the sniping experience, not much for the story. Sound: 9/10They nailed it. The sound of the rifle, the enemies around you and even your own footsteps can be heard in great detail. Nothing more can be said of how this game sounds. You hear what you’re supposed to hear, nothing else. Gameplay: 9/10This goes without saying but, you can snipe your enemies with skill and precision from a distance or get up close and personal and perform melee takedowns. Setting up traps and distractions can also be very fun if carefully planned and laid out. Oh, and I almost forgot...there are “sounds” in the game which can mask rifle shots which makes for quiet long distance shots; pretty impressive if you ask me. The overall game performed nice and smooth with no significant frame drops to report. Price: 5/10Priced at £39.99 for the base game, it is a little too much for the amount of gameplay hours you’re probably going to have. So, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to pick it up.  "

EVERY SHOT. its a game about waiting for hours and then having to pull out your unaccurate MP40 because of a tiny tiny mistake. oh and you die in 1.5 seconds, which renders your last 45 minutes of sneaking and careful shooting useless.

If you want wide open levels,many different types of weaponry and equipment,a good variety in mission goals and a 2 player coop, this is the perfect game for you.Probably the series most famous feature are the killcams.The killcam in the first part was a cinematic killcam, which showed the point of impact very detailed.The Killcam in the second part took it one step further, now you could watch the bullet ripping it's way through the targets flesh, bones and organs.In the third  part they added the muscle tissue,veins and all that stuff. This make's Sniper Elite 3  one of the most graphic games out there.Just buy it and see for yourself.PS:  Hitler only has one ball  "

												(Review made taken in consideration the Authentic difficulty of the game, written upon completing it fully)Pistol Elite 3, you'l spend most of the time killing with your pistol which is the only silenced weapon at your disposal, only to find that when you find good oportunities to make use of your sniper rifle, they are very poor and uninteresting (and sometimes uneffective despite the game flagging it as a good place). At authentic dificulty theres some segments that all you need is luck to go though, if thats not with you, all your 1 hour flawless work is reset cause of something that either doesnt make sense or a lack of NPC build, which by the way, is awful. Finally and personally, you wont find much ""sniper"" content in the game taking out the infiltration and hiding which are the only decent aspects built into this game. After buying this game, check market, theres a lot more that will give you a better experience. personally, this one stands a glorified game series that went from good/decent to a strict fail and is definitly on the bottom of development.

												I felt that this game failed to entertain as much as Sniper Elite 2 did. There was less opportunities to use traps in this game and the best tactic to get the job was to use the silent handgun which wasn't fun at all. Also the snipers in the game were more of a nuisance than anything else.Overall I wouldn't buy this just for the singeplayer because the missions were boring but also because it is also very short.EDIT: Played the coop with my friend and we are very disappointed how bad the maps were in comparison of the Sniper Elite 2 maps. They were much better as in Sniper Elite 3 you just have big maps where you shoot people and that is almost it. They really rushed to just publish this game and grab the money....			"

												If There's anything ive learned from the Sniper Elite Franchise is that sniper's in WW2 had amazing stories. Not having really any knowledge or interest in the past Sniper Elite games *Cough* Sniper Elite V2 *Cough* I was convinced by my friend to pick it up and it was on sale so I decided to pick it up and so far it's amazing. The graphics are beyond beautiful, And the gameplay get's better and better as I play, I just absolutly love this  new feature where loud noises and destractions will mask your shots. You play as Karl Fairburne, a sniper working for the British Intellegence. As you play you will unlock new sniper's, machine gun's, pistol's, and more items to arm yourself with. How the maps are designed are incredable and fun to play on. Coop is the icing on the cake. Playing this with friends is so much fun. There are 8 maps  (Not including DLC) but are so much fun and long. The only downsides are the Assassinate Hitler mission is a DLC, and multiplayer is not that good. So overall this game deserves a 9.5/10			"

												Got this game for free with a promotion when I bought my new GPU, and I was not disappointed.A worthy sequel of Sniper Elite V2, the game is set in the North African Campaign, from June 1940 to May 1943 between Libyan and Egyptian deserts.Nothing to say about the bullet balistics that are, as always, perfectly made: if you want to place a long shot you'll need to take account of wind, gravity and also your own heartbeat.The locations are really well made, with lots of tactical opportunities: need to hide that body? Try tossing it in that well.Before every mission, you can customize your loadout with custom parts for your rifle, anti-personal and anti-tank landmines, tripmines, TNT charges, bandages, medkits, grenades and more. You can also customize your crosshairs.The enemy is not really smart, even at maximum difficulty: if they spot a body, they'll start searching, but I think they give up the searches too easily. They also walk too often into your traps; if you want to get rid of a patrol, silent kill one of them and place a landmine/tripmine near them, lure them by tossing a stone to make noise, and bam, you're done.The bad part? TOO. MUCH. DLCs.Seriously.4 rifles, 3 SMGs, 3 pistols. Want more? Buy the DLC!Two horde maps. Want more? Buy the DLC!Rebellion, that's not the way to do.Vote: 8/10, since it's on sale give it a shot (no pun intended).			"

												I've been playing during Free Play but as many reviews have said already, the game is awfully linear. Linear games can be a lot of fun; the Last of Us comes to mind. This one though is very repetative. At 80% off, I'd say it's good value but I couldn't imagine paying any more than that (~$11 CDN). Graphics are nice. Mechanics are so-so. There seem to be some bugs preventing me from shooting when I clearly have a shot without obstruction infront of me, magazine is full, breathing is right, but it just wont shoot. I have to remove my eye from the scope, adjust my position and line-up the shot again before it will allow me to shoot. It's happened on more than a couple of occasions. Slow-mo kill shots become old very quickly and I skip the vast majority of them. The idea that you are to stealth in this game seems silly -perhaps I haven't mastered the mix of run and hide? Replayability seems low but co-op seems to be a good idea (haven't tried it yet). All in all, for 10 bucks, why not? Full price though? Not a chance.[Update]My friends seem to be experiencing the issue with shooting as well. For some reason, there are times where you ""pull the trigger"" and it just won't shoot and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. I've now tried co-op and it is fantastic. I cannot see my self playing single player anymore and just sticking wtih campaign co-op. Full disclosure, I do prefer to play with friends, I play few games single player. At $11 for co-op, I'd say it's a steal. Great co-op game! (Also, didn't receive it for free as I ended up buying it after the Free Play while it was on sale but cannot update that part of the review.)			"

												Having played all the games in the series, I'd have to say the ratings are as follows: 3>1>2. 1 was incredible for the time and a unique playing experience with many huge levels to experiment in. On the highest difficulties it was a demanding experience that rewarded patience, good planning, and accuracy. 2 was a step down from 1 in the level design department,  having far too many close quarter battles in claustrophobic small levels. It's still a great 7/10 game, but it has issues. 3 is where they really hit the sweet spot, combining technical improvements over the last two games and fantastic level design. Although the amount of levels may seem sparse, each level is it's own massive sniper sandbox, allowing many numerous different approaches to each objective. The campaign took me 9 hours to beat on Sniper Elite difficulty and I only really did 50%ish of the secondary objectives, not to mention all the little collectibles scattered about each mission. In short, I highly recommend you check out Sniper Elite 3.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 aka ShootNazisintheBalls 3 is actually a pretty good game, it has everything you want from a good sniper-game. If you want wide open levels,many different types of weaponry and equipment,a good variety in mission goals and a 2 player coop, this is the perfect game for you.Probably the series most famous feature are the killcams.The killcam in the first part was a cinematic killcam, which showed the point of impact very detailed.The Killcam in the second part took it one step further, now you could watch the bullet ripping it's way through the targets flesh, bones and organs.In the third  part they added the muscle tissue,veins and all that stuff. This make's Sniper Elite 3  one of the most graphic games out there.Just buy it and see for yourself.PS:  Hitler only has one ball  "

												A fun stealth-shooter with iconic cinematic gore-porn. Sneak up on enemy bases, study their movements and either eliminate or avoid - your call. Knife or silenced pistol for up close, a variety of scoped rifles for far away, a few other guns for everything in-between, and even some anti-tank stuff.It's military-esque, but don't expect a military simulator - the 3rd person perspective should tip you off to that right away. But it's a fun shooter with lots of achievements and gameplay that you can do however you want. Not too much hand-holding, but was designed primarily for slow and sneaky.Maps/chapters are big, varied, and well-done, but there aren't as many as I thought there would be - in other words, the game feels a bit short and inconclusive. Expect to complete it in 8-10 hours or so. Has some replay value - owing to the huge maps and open gameplay choice. The DLC was obviously left out of the main game at launch so they could squeeze more money out of you for it. Some physics bugs (clipping, invisible walls, etc.) in spots can be annoying, but not game-breaking. Plays very well with keyboard and mouse.			"

												Love this game, the graphics and attention to detail really adds to the immersion of the game for the buildings, terrain ect,., the lighting in this is incredible, with a duel core and decent graphics card good ram i have my game almost maxed out, i dont get any issues with graphics, game runs fine.What would be really cool is if the game is if some things were more destructable.The AI in it are a bit updated vs Sniper Elite V2 but they could use a bit more work in terms of what they do overall their alot better, they could use more dialog tho, better tactics although i am only playing on marksmen so guess i will have to try the other levels and see if there is any difference.I wish the game had a map editor so you can create maps for the challenges, i play the sp challenges alot but find they are limited in terms of where you can go, why? Your talking about sniping here, long range shooting, anyways some other things like the weapon sounds, including the new weapons from the DLC about all sound the same, sometimes when you shoot it sounds like a ...cannon going off, or idk hard to describe not bad just saying.Sound wise for a sniper sim if it were should have the guns sounding close to their real counterparts, They could do alot more for this game to make it more simulated in some areas.The real fun parts and best part is the bullet cam, as well as putting down mines, trip mines, even doing stealth attacks where you either knife the guy or fight with him.I definately recomend this game, if you played V2 which i also reccomend and still play, you'll like this, theres quite a number of achievements to earn too. I find the campaign quite long, and each part in the campaign is huge, its open, with the objectives spread all over, couple of missions I had replayed just because they were fun to play.If you can get on sale do so.

												This game is awful.. just awful..The whole idea of a ""sniper game"" wasn't brought up at the board meeting when pitching for this game.The game is boring as you sneak around giant maps equipped with your trusty sniper rifle. The only problem is, you barely get to use it. But why would you, when you have the astonishing amount of 16 bullets in your Welrod!?Not to mention the enemy soldiers who can spot you even though you're shooting under cover of sometimes functioning masking sounds. But hey, you can't be good at everything, although you made the right decision of adding the panzershrek.It wasn't even worth the 10€ i spend on GeeTwoAaaaye.			"

It had wider open levels, more variation in color and a more distinct visual style, and runs well even on my modest machine.It's also still got the very satisfying sniping mechanics from the previous game without just forcing you from setpiece to setpiece via corridors. You really can choose your postition now and try to come up with a plan on how best to deal with each area.The weapon choice is somewhat limited but really their isn't much they can do with different sniper rifles to make them very distinct.All together it's a very good sequel to the best facist-testicle-sniping game of 2012.

												This game lets you make very important choises that really impact gameplay. well really there's only one ""should I try and use cover?"". Cover, as we all know from other games, is great when you're trying to stealth passed enemies or for soaking up those bullets from them once you finally get seen, but Sniper Elite 3 takes things further then that. The cover even blocks your bullets, despite the fact that when you look through the scope it looks like you have a perfect shot, BUT WAIT there's more. When in cover, say a watch tower designed to be sniped from, the cover will help you decide to go down a more peacful path by not letting you shoot at all. I MEAN HOW GREAT IS THAT?!?! This game is like sex, by that I simply mean it ♥♥♥♥s you.3===D/10 Bite the pillow this game's going dry.Also the dev is sueing a better company for no good reason, simply because they don't want their names attached to a product that actually works.

												The only good thing about this game is the bulletcam. Watching your enemies testicles explode or faces get just destroyed is extremely amusing. You'd think it'd get old fast but I enjoyed it through the entire campaign. Which brings us to the first issue.The campaign is way too short. I completed it in a night.The weapon selection and customization options are lacking, and some rifles that are unlocked at the very start of the game are just better than others in every possible way. It's pointless to have a bunch of unlocked rifles where some of them are just♥♥♥♥♥♥The detection system for enemies is glitchy, especially vehichles and muffled sounds from planes.Any time you damage a vehichle, even if its with a landmine and you are on the other side of the map, it knows exactly where you are instantly and you suddenly get ""attacking"" status and all enemies know where you are. Plus any time it loses sight of you and you come back into it's field of vision it sees you within a fraction of a second, turns the cannon absurdly fast (think like one of those weird garrysmod videos) and fires a shot. All within about one second.Planes fly overhead on most missions periodically providing sound cover for your shots, but while you can hear the plane flying by with the same noise and volume every time, you only get sound cover from it some of the time. Also on at least one of the levels the planes don't seem to fly overhead if you're stationary. Only when moving around the map making them useless to help you snipe which is their entire purpose.The game is full of invisible walls, cliffs that should be easily scalable but are instead impassable AND the terrain is unrealistic. So like, the worst of both worlds.Many of the good sniping points, hell even most of them, are inaccessible by stealth until you've taken out half or more of the enemies that you'd want to be in the sniping point to take out. I don't feel so much like a sniper in this game as a grunt.There are an unrealistic number of explosives EVERYWHERE. EVERYTHING EXPLODES. And yet somehow the explosives are almost never in a useful spot.In the difficulty screen they try to boast that there's a difficulty level for sniping purists. Enemies that work together to root you out and hunt you down, and gravity affecting bullet trajectories. First of all, what about wind? you're gonna put gravity in but not wind? But the real problem is the enemies on the highest difficulty are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The AI is average at best. They don't work together to hunt you down, they occassionally walk in a straight line towards your position, always hitting traps and almost always by themselves.I've never been flanked by enemies trying to trap me, I've never had enemies avoid or disarm my traps after they saw their buddy get blown up by the first one, or despite the fact that the trap is an anti tank mine sitting in plain sight. And much of the time I can sit in one position, pick off two enemies, wait for the detection bar to go down, pick of two more, and repeat till all enemies are dead, even though they heard where my shot came from, they never come to investigate.Overall the game was fun but very disappointing for something that supposedly was aiming to be difficult and realistic. If you're going to buy it, buy it for the gimmick, the bulletcam. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing funny.			"

												After really enjoying Sniper Elite V2 I was excited for this next game in the series. It seemed like more of the same, and that's certainly a good thing...right?In this case some of the same elements were present: the bullet cam, the weapons, the physics, not to mention the awful, forgettable story. But the changes they made resulted in a much worse experience overall.Foremost was the level design. In 2 the levels were admittedly linear, but they had long sight lines to encourage gratiutous sniping, which is the name of the game after all. And they also included a wide variety of objectives. Here in 3 every level follows the same arena-style circular motif with short lines and lots of cramped spaces - presumably to make them easier to re-use as multiplayer maps. The problem is that this pushes the player to use stealth and close range combat as the primary means to engage the enemy. In a game that's supposed to be about sniping this is incredibly annoying.Beyond that, the flow of each level is exactly the same: infiltrate, explore, then take out the vehicles at the end. The fact that every single ""boss"" in the game comes in the form of nearly identical armored vehicles is pretty unforgivable. It's so repetitive that I got bored less than halfway through the campaign. I knew what was coming around every corner my first time through. It reeks of laziness.The campaign also feels more serious, which is not the direction the writers should have gone with this series. And while I appreciate the change of setting to Africa, that combined with the story make the stakes feel like they're not high at all, lacking comic relief to boot. The new setting also forces set pieces that could exist in any time period - there's almost nothing tying the environments to World War II.The one area where the game actually did better was the add-ons. The bonus missions feel much closer to what I want from a Sniper Elite game. And the multiplayer is surprisingly fun and balanced once you get over the learning curve.When the mechanics are identical and the story doesn't matter then the level design becomes paramount, and that's the biggest area they failed in the campaign. Sniper Elite 3 kept enough of the parts from the previous games to feel familiar, but not enough to feel fun.			"

												Coop is broken and that's the reason I bought this. After spending over an hour in a single level, you die and checkpoints don't work. Start the whole level over. In other ways it feels very rushed. Several bugs bother you from the start. Authentic ballistics is a joke, 50 yards from muzzle and the bullet has dropped a couple of feet. Enemies are dummkopfs who forget about you if you bother to move a bit, and don't care about their dead friends after that point. The whole game leaves you to wonder why did they make such a bad sequel to a somewhat good V2.			"

												This game is amazing. The surroundings alone sell the game. Compared to V2 it is a better game. The graphics are smoother and the gun physics seem to be more spot on. The openess of the maps make it feel less linear than V2, you have many more options when coming into a base and several ways you can go in stealth or loud. If you liked v2 I would highly recommend this 3rd installment!!			"

												The game is quite buggy in my opinion.Most of the nice features ""Killcam"" for example, have bugs and isnt displayed properly.The most important feature ""Sound Maskin"" is bugged like hell.It only works if YOU hear the sound not of the enemy hears the sound.So if you are standing next to a generator and shoot the enemy doesnt hear your gunshot.If HE is standing next to a tank or generator, he will hear you shooting.This behavior is quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are some more weird behaving game mechanics ruining the sniper experience.Maybe they will patch it, but meanwhile this dampens the fun at a very high degree.

												This review is based solely on the Multiplayer part of the game, since the Singleplayer part is just generic mediocre entertainment, like a Val Kilmer movie or something like that. And to be perfectly honest.. The only thing I actually enjoy in this game is the ""killcam"" which can be extremely satisfying and rewarding.That said, I don't find much else to praise in this 3rd part of the series. It's as if they solely concentrated on making the killcam more detailed, gory and with slightly ridiculous sounds of bones breaking etc. The models look rushed, the textures are mediocre at best and the shading and lighting is appalling (with some infuriatingly unavoidable big sunglare. Then comes the gameplay.. Which feels as clunky and sad as a rushed B game for the PS2. Annoying ""cover"" mechanics, some very solid shrubbery (not all the vegetation is solid though), insultingly few maps and customization and a clunky and buggy ""aim assist"".So to sum up:For the price of 45.99euros I had expected at least a finished and polished product fit for the PCs of 2014. Not a game I feel could've been made for the PS2 or at the release of the PS3. I honestly feel a bit robbed having paid so much money for a game that Clearly isn't finished. Oh and don't think I intentionally tried to find faults and errors in this release. I actually So wanted it to be good (and I still think it has tremendous potential), and for 2 days I've kept trying to come up with excuses for the glaring faults, be they aesthetic or gameplay, but I find it insulting to the gaming community when they charge 45.99euros for this. Had it been 15eu or something down that line I could've shrugged it off more easily. But no, this is robbery and I do not recommend people to buy this game yet. Maybe in a month or 2 when they hopefully have fixed the bugs and maybe made some extra maps.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is a very enjoyable 3rd person sniper game in which you play as Karl Fairburne. An American sniper. The game takes place throughout Africa from airfields to bases built into mountains.Visually, the game is very well presented. I was able to play it maxed out with a constant 60FPS with v-sync off (It would seem that it’s capped). Although, even with my 1060, the frame rate would sometimes drop into the low 40s and high 30s and given this game is over 2 years old, I would put this down to poor optimisation of what is clearly meant for consoles. Not only did I have frame rate issues, but screen tearing was also rife with basic movements tearing the screen like an angry child ripping up a piece of artwork he made a mistake on. However, the game was still playable and very enjoyable throughout with no crashes after just under 10 hours. Gameplay is also very enjoyable. If you have played any other Sniper Elite game, you understand the ins and outs of it. The sniping is fun and it is always enjoyable to shoot a German or Italian and watch the bullet to travel through the air and shatter their eyeball and penetrate their brain, very satisfying stuff. Missions, of which there are around 4, (wide open maps with optional side missions) are a bit repetitive and you will probably never do the side missions unless you want the 100% complete achievement. Although you will probably expect a sniper game to revolve around sniping, it does get very tiring very quickly and I sometimes found myself getting out my Thompson and gunning down a few Germans just to change it up a bit. The machine guns in this game were obviously meant to be a second thought if you alert the base as you can only carry 2 magazines of ammo unless you carry an MP40 (and even in this case you only get around 2-3 bullets from looting an enemy corpse). If you were to get this game, just keep in mind that you probably won’t be playing it non-stop until you finish as it does get very repetitive and sniping does become boring after gunning down your 50th Nazi. The AI is not too bad, sometimes you can walk right in from of them and they won’t see you, other times they can see you hiding behind a box. A lot more work could’ve been done here that unfortunately wasn’t.  The story is very poor. You basically set out the kill some generic Nazi Commander with your missions being to collect information in order to find out where he is and when he will be there. I didn’t really pay attention to it, I was enjoying sneaking around and shoving knives into a bad guy’s ear (yes that is one of the silent kill animations). But the story in this game is basically non-existent apart from a few lines of dialogue from the main protagonist during loading screens (that’s really the only place you find out what you’re doing and why). Now for the price. At the time of writing this (05/10/2016) the game is £39.99 which is absolutely ridiculous. This game, brand new on release, is only worth about £20 in my opinion. I purchased this game off Ebay for £8 and for that it was very enjoyable. I think this is just a clear example of one of those games that Steam have just forgotten to lower the price but while the game remains at this price, I would find it elsewhere for much cheaper. If you pay any more than £10, you paid too much for this. Overall, it is a very enjoyable if a bit short (10 hours on the hardest difficulty until I got to credits) but way too expensive on steam. You will have a good time watching Germans trip over trip mines or walk into anti-personal mines, failing that, you will also enjoy getting a perfect shot and watching your targets testicles pop so long as you don’t pay too much.

												How do I even review this masterpiece!? Best sniper game on the market for sure and the Kill Hitler DLC is simply...The best...DLC...EVER! Kill Hitler, change history, if only this guy was real. Ha. Well let's get on shall we? I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite v2 like the AI for example has been fixed in SE3. I also like how Stealth is even more important here as it was on SEV2, if you decided to go Rambo, don't. Seriously, don't. You're gonna get ganked and if you're not fast enough, you're dead. I like the Close Quarters takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes, I did notice some bugs where for example the bullet came out of my barrel in reverse, directed at me, but ended up showing where I hit my target, doesn't happen too often but I think this is something Rebellion should look into. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with, you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him, you really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and adjust your aim accordingly. Great game, if you're into sniping, buy this..Immidiately. For me personally, it is the best game I bought this year.			"

												Bought this game at steam summer sale 2k15 with 70% off. For first this is STEALTH based game. So if you dont like to play STEALTH, DONT BUY IT. Otherwise its one of the best stealth game i have ever played. Loud is an option too but when for example: you are fighting with 5 enemies you can die easily, its not like GTA V. So its better to play stealth. I already played this game for like 3 hours so i cant rate the campaign but i like the gameplay mechanics etc..EDIT: After finishing the campaign, i have to say that this game was definetly worth 14€ but sadly not more. I rly enjoyed the story, but for me it was rly short - only like 8/9 missions, thats simply not enough for 30€+ game.. so my advice just wait for next sales then buy it..			"

												Review for single player campaign:I got this game for free when purchasing a new graphics card. I left it a while as I had played the second game a little at a friend's house and wasn't in a rush for it. When the time came to play it I found the start of the game quite exciting and it rapidly gained my interest as I sunk the first few hours into the game. The story line I found kind of generic but interesting enough. No real relatable characters or depth. This however was not the point of the game at least in my opinion. The kill camera for perfectly aimed shots was fun at first but by the time I had reached the half way point in the game I had turned them off completely. The game play however was enthralling throughout the campaign. I spent hours on a mission taking it as slowly as possible and trying to be ""the perfect sniper"", crawling through the grass on my stomach trying to reach the next point of cover to scope out a target area. Making my way around the map working out the best position for attacks and covering my rifle fire with ambient noises. When there were none, sneaking into the area and executing people from behind. I had a lot of fun. Overall if you are looking for a first/third person shooter with stealth aspects and at least some level of control in choosing how you went about your objectives this could be the game for you. If you are looking for a sandbox environment you will be disappointed, while not having a linear game play progression style most areas only give you a couple of options on where to stage an attack from with only a couple of combat styles for those few choices. 7/10Review for co-op and multiplayer:Will be added in the future.

												Edit: i have not totaly reversed my judgment of the game as it still needs bug fixes, but, I have played an awfull lot of it and still keep comming to play it.After all sniping can be fun.So I am recommending it , but with a few caveats.But Still;This game needs to be patched to fix some horrible game ruining featues /glithes /bugs.1) Using Binoculars in this game is a horrible affair.Textures fade in and out from low to high and vice versa.It is the worst depth of field I have ever seen and totaly ruins the gameplay.2) There seem to be invisible walls or something for a lot of shots.Had a lovely shot lined up, scoped to the max, empty lung headshot, Clear view, nothing in my way.My bullet hit ??? about 100m out and that was that. 5 shots, same thing.3) In one level I was spotted through a wall AND Shot dead.another level I was spotted by guys 10m bellow me in a bunker.4) the sound masking works when it wants to work, you can hear the LOUD sound and sometimes it will display the Icon for a masked shot, other times you just have to leg it.5) tanks and other vehicles can see you behind them, Tried sneaking up on a tank from behind. Turret was forward, so no way he can see me. Well all went great till I planted dynamite, then the turret swung around and followed me as I ran around the tank, so close that I could have keyed it. So then I was stuck, move away from the hull and get blasted.6) the Ai is crap / brilliant / accurate and lousy all at the same time.They give up too easily. They don't notice the guy in front just got his head blown off. They hang around in the open searching, etc.7) there is autosave AND a load last save option as well as a Load game option. I have yet to figure out how to access the load game feature as I presumed it was for loading an earlier autosave. nope.8) The controls are a mess, fell off a cliff trying to back my character up, he turned in a circle and fell.you can sprint in straight lines but forget about turning as the sensitivity on the mouse drops way off.Easiest way is sprint, stop,turn sprint.The mouse contols vary between the in game map, the main screen and the character movement and the aiming. Some feel a bit floaty, others sharp. mouse smoothing was off and mouse acceleration was off.The option to reduce mouse lag had no effect at all.9) The campaign missions all follow the same patern.Get to a location, shoot/find something, etc.. and when you think you've finished, enter the boss match, some overwhelming force you must deal with or something to protect.10) The view distances with the scopes is nothing compared to Sniper Elite.If you want to kill at 500m+ range, then good luck.This game thrilled me for 1 hour then just bored / annoyed me for the rest.If you played S.E v2 this is not much of an improvement..If you just want to snipe, then by all means get this.

												The gameplay mostly consists of crawling around with a silenced gun shooting enemies in the head pointblank and when you finally get to a good sniping spot you have to time your shooting so that your enemies don't hear you. sounds interesting at first but gets boring after a while. I really wished this was less of an arcade game and more of a realistic experience. Generators that starts to malfunction seems to be louder than a rifleshot, the ai is dumb as a pile of sticks, It takes about 5 seconds for the enemy to start shooting at you if they detect you so you can just calmly equip your silenced gun, aim and fire, walking is loud as ♥♥♥♥ so you will have to sneak most of the time and people almost always survive a bullet everywhere but the head. Maybe it would still  be an enjoyable experience with nice graphics but they don't seem to manage that either. Everything in this game is done very poorly and im happy that I didn't buy this game for the high price of 45,99€ and got to try while it was free. Maybe the game isn't meant for me but for another audience but im still not going to recommend it.			"

												I'd say it's worse than V2, which was free a month or so ago. The guns are stupid unrealistic, you still can't dial in distances on scopes, the wind blows your bullet a meter off target on a 100m shot (in a canyon, with a gentle breeze), way too much short range (<100m) fighting and way too little real sniping. Read the Wikipedia article, sniping is about shooting from so far away enemies can't return fire or even hear your gunshot. I have a feeling the maps are so small to accomodate consoles. The COD-esque ranks and loadouts suck as well (and Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta in WWII? Have the devs never seen a WWII movie? It should be Able Baker Charlie Dog.) The entire reason sniping games exist is difficult, satisfying kills, not mowing down hundreds of guys. There are plenty of better shooters and better stealth games out there, but no sniping games as good as this could have been.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 (SE3) takes place in Northern Africa, which is a theatre often neglected in WWII games. Usually games focus on the European Theatre (western and/or eastern fronts) and slightly less often, the Pacific Theatre. That's a nice change and presents a locale that hasn't been overused. Something I also like about North Africa is that despite it being mostly a rocky desert, there is still plenty of environmental plant life to make the scenary appear not quite as depressing. I remember in Sniper Elite v2 (SEv2) thinking that the constant use of broken and blasted buildings became quite tiring, despite it being accurate for the location. SE3 brings in slight RPG aspects, in that your equipment has various stats. The rifles in particular are interesting because you can greatly modify them using parts you find as you play. That said, many of the ""better"" rifles and pistols are only available in DLC packages, but it's entirely possible to play through the whole game and do exceptionally well without ever spending a dime on any DLC. The overall game mechanics are similar to SEv2. On easier difficutly levels you don't have to account for gravity (bullet drop) or wind, and pressing the focus button (the default is ""E"") enhances your zoom and slows down time. You have a limited amount of focus and if you expend it before firing, you'll zoom out and time will resume as normal. Fortunately, focus replenishes by itself.Head shots are preferable to body shots, although I've managed to kill enemies after hitting them in the leg. You can perforate major blood vessels and organs (seen through an x-ray view when hitting the enemy), which the game acknowledges, but I don't know if that really makes a difference as far as killing them goes. I believe the game really just takes into account general location damage, so a high velocity shot to the abdomen might result in a kill, regardless of it tearing apart the intestines or kidneys. Remaining undetected is a major part of SE3. You can do this by using your sidearm (assuming you've taken either the Welrod or the HDM, both of which have suppressors attached to them), stabbing an unsuspecting enemy in the back, or using noise to hide your sniper shots. Noise cover can range from artillery fire to PA announcements to sabotaging a generator. Although you have a secondary weapon (which can be anything from a Thompson submachine gun to a Panzerschrek, which is essentially a rocket launcher), using it will undoubtedly cause a ton of noise, thereby attracting scores of enemy soldiers who will overwhelm you on anything except the lowest difficultly level. Even then, it's still fairly easy to die, so it's best to avoid that scenario entirely if at all possible. Unlike SEv2, enemies DO NOT suddenly pop up out of nowhere. Reinforcements can be called in (usually through scripted events), but you won't have to deal with inching forward after clearing an area only to come upon a soldier who materialized out of thin air. The campaign takes place over eight long missions. In contrast to SEv2, which relied entirely on checkpoints, SE3 allows you to save whenever and wherever you wish using manual saves and quicksaves. Some players might find this ""cheap"" or refer to it as ""save scumming,"" but to me it's simply a matter of convenience, which lets me play for as long or as little as I choose.Multiplayer takes the form of PvP and PvE Co-op. In PvP multiplayer, you play on a team and fight other players, whereas in PvE Co-op, its you and your teammate against the AI. In co-op, you have three choices:1. Play through the entire campaign in co-op mode.2. Play specific downloaded missions.3. Play unique asymetric assignments, where one player has a sniper rifle and a pistol, and the other player has a pistol, secondary weapon (such as an MP-40), and binoculars. A shooting range has also been added as an extra single player mode, which lets you practice with all the weapons, including explosives. No matter how good SE3 is, there are some problems. When playing co-op, the campaign missions only use temporary checkpoint saves (as opposed to the ""save anywhere"" method in single player), which can make for some exceptionally long game times. These checkpoints only last for the duration of the session, so if you quit, you'll have to start over the beginning of the mission.This has been a problem for my wife and me, as although we enjoy SE3, we don't always feel like spending four hours or so on one mission. It would be nice if the game at least saved the progress of the mission on the host's machine and allowed the players to continue where they left off.The asymetric missions almost always include a ""horde mode"" component, where you have to defend against waves upon waves of enemies. In a game like SE3, where stealth and not being noticed is generally considered important, this seems very out-of-place and if you're not ready for it, quite jarring as well. Something else that's of general annoyance is the way a weapon's stats are presented. Using a combination of white, yellow, and red bars to denote standard, improved, and reduced stats (when comparing other weapons to your currently armed weapon), understanding the bars can be unclear, at least at first. I would've preferred numbers instead of nondescript bars, but it's not a big deal overall. In the end, would I recommend Sniper Elite 3? Absolutely. If you're the least bit interested in playing a sniper and World War II, there's no reason for me to not recommend this game.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 (SE3) is a big step down from SE2. This game is clearly unfinished & filled with problems. At first I was disappointed that you don't get your shooting percentage but after seeing that at times it can take 3 to 9 shots to kill a guy I understood why.  If you don't press ""E"" when using your scope the shots can bounce off like he's covered from head to toe in metal. One very frustrating problem is when you try to shoot over or in between rails & your shots just hit the rail even if your barrel is past the rail. There are also graphic problems & the only way to resolve them is to exit out of the game then come back in. Trust me that you don't want to pay full price for this game, I think the game is worth about $20.00 so wait until it comes on sale. I expected so much more out of SE3 after playing SE2. It would be nice if you had your shot percentage (after they fix the shooting) & also the amount of head shot kills. I haven't tried the MP but seeing they never did make it work in SE2 I don't expect MP will work very well in SE3 as well.			"

												More technical difficulties than a state school server room. For the want of a new release after V2 for the same reasons, I can't see how there's been any improvement on the first. While the gameplay sets in after a couple of missions, there's a feel for how the Welrod and rifle pair up, but the last save point becomes the most used feature. The list of issues can be accredited to jittery animations, almost like they know you're watching, and the age old know-it-all AI. Take down an alerted enemy, the only of several who know where you are, and the rest come running to your exact position, never having seen you. There also seems to be a bug in the way concealed gunfire works in conjunction with a canon or dodgy stationary motor. Countless times the AI went on alert after shooting during the covering noise, making it confusing to know the outcome of options. AI enjoyed screwing up multiple attempts by detecting my movement through walls, and I don't mean on account of running, but by their mesh sifting through the wall and somehow seeing me. A WTF moment including being shot by a soldier who was shooting me, as he hung suspended in a wall (see screenshots). Other soldiers fired through the corners of buildings, without head-view of my position. A run through the underground/basement tunnel of a hill somehow alerted soldiers on the summit, as they cascaded down to my position. The animations even included unnatural movements making well set up rifling utterly clumsy. Most rifle nests also come with no gunfire cover, so it's game on if you want to use them. The upside of all this bumbling around is cracking the idiodic AI in the melon with a big calibre rifle. After all, they embody the frustrations with clunky algorithms well enough to feel a sense of satisfaction popping a pair of eyes out. It works really well on the level of infuriating the player into enough of a rage to really want to put a thousand pounds of shrapnel into the back of someone's centre mass. The problem is, and many times over, this often won't kill the target, as they fumble forward, about face, and successfully put machine gun bullets in your head from the hip a good 70 metres off. Lovely. :/			"

												The sniping is fun, but there's so much filler crammed inbetween. The stealth is not enjoyable. The animations are weird and not at all organic, and gameplay quirks really ruin the experience, such as not being able to crouch when moving a body. While playing the stealth portioins, I often found myself thinking, ""You know what else I have installed on this computer? Dishonored. Why am I playing this when I could be playing that?"" If you have the money, I reccomend MGSV. It is better in almost every way. 2/5.			"

												Unambitious and far too safe, Sniper Elite 3 is in general a reskin of Sniper Elite V2.Carrying over the same mechanics and realistic ballistics that defined the previous game, Sniper Elite 3 does little to differentiate itself and keeps itself within a safe little boundary that prevents it from being a full-fledged sequel and instead feels like the developers were too frightened to tip-toe out of that proverbial boundary and kept everying generally the same. Primarily the differences between the two games are as follows: A new and exotic setting in North Africa, new weapons and tools to utilize, the ability to customize enemy AI and ballistics to suit your preferred playstyle and a new story. To expand on why these features don't contribute a lot to the game and make it stand out: The setting, while personally I enjoy, is not something to base too much emphasis on, you dedicate DLCs around new locations, not a whole new game, so while the desert setting is pleasant it also fails to accomplish the ultimate goal of making Sniper Elite 3 stand out as it's own title, and it's actually the most notable difference. The new weapons and loadout options I don't care for, because almost every unlockable weapon and/or part are all underwhelming, offering a minor benefit at the cost of what I feel are major costs in damage or stability. So I generally use the same loadout in every mission since the Garand is by far the best option for the game and serves to every need I require, making the loadout customization completely untouched. Difficulty adjustment is actually the factor that has drawn me into the game despite my disappointment at the previous titles, both previous games had some of the most rudimentary and challenge-destroying AI possible and ruined a large portion of both games, I'm glad to say that the AI in Sniper Elite 3 is at least challenging and rewarding to play against. Another new factor in the AI department is a feature called ""Relocate"" in which enemies will discern your location and begin to attack if you continue to fire from the same area, but Relocate gives you the option to move out of the area and begin the hunt anew. While sounding good in theory Relocate can be easily exploited wherein the player fires once or twice from one location before moving out to another, then repeating the process. Finally, the story. Once again you play as Karl Fairburne, the same tired and uninteresting protagonist from the previous games. Karl is the same as before, he's boring, 2-dimensional and leaves no impact on the player, offering nothing to the experience other than to be the guy you play as but immediately forget after beating the game. Which is a huge reason why I'm disappointed with the game, we've got this exotic and beautiful new setting, why do we still have this blank sheet of paper to play as? Tell me it wouldn't be great if we could play as someone new, like a British soldier since a good part of the game's plot involves working for British Intelligence, it would make more sense to have a soldier of British background and provide an opportunity to make Sniper Elite 3 stand out more. But no, the developers I think are trying to make Karl a staple and recognizeable video game protagonist akin to Gordon Freeman or Lara Croft, which with his blank-slate personality is just impossible. The overall story as well is underwhelming and paper-thin, leaves no impact and is entirely forgettable.Now it may sound like I'm saying that Sniper Elite 3 is a bad game, but this is not entirely true. On the contrary actually, I like the game and I do have fun when I'm playing it. If it was released as a stand-alone title or as the first in it's series I'd be praising it without remorse, however as a sequel it falls short and doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the last game. Sniper Elite V2 wasn't a bad game, but it did have a lot of flaws that kept it from gaining alot of recognition, Rebellion had the opportunity to take these issues into account when designing the new game but instead worked on a clone with a different coat of paint. I know it sounds like I'm beating a dead horse when I say that it's practically the same as V2 but I feel that this is a valid and legitimate issue that is holding the series back from its full potential. So to give this review a more positive outlook; Sniper Elite 3's setting is as previously mentioned absolutely gorgeous, unique and alot of fun to explore and observe. This may be a biased viewpoint since I've personally always had a fondness for desert landscapes but it is true, the levels are beautifully rendered and at the same time well optimized, giving me an average of 60 FPS on high settings. Combat interfaces are rewarding and fun to experiment with, rewarding patience and execution with unerring proficiency. Setting up traps to fortify a sniper nest or roaming the battlefield collecting intelligence on enemy patrol routes and locations is a highly rewarding experience with a combat system that gives the player positive feedback. The infamous X-Ray kill cams make a return and add a lot to the satisfying payoff of lining up the perfect shot, but just like the last game the novelty of them gets tiring pretty quickly and I've found myself to lowering them to almost non-existent after a while. Sniper Elite 3 is also host to a large series of experience-breaking bugs. The killcams often don't work as they're supposed to, sometimes cutting out early and others just giving the player a view of a blurry area while the sound effects play. The AI also has it's garbage moments, for example: Vehicles have incredible perception and can pin-point your exact location with little effort, which makes no sense seeing how the operators field of vision is limited by the vehicles armor. And yet when shot it will immediately know exactly where you are in an instant where human enemies take a moment to determine where you are even if they've been physically shot. It's like the vehicles in the game all have a synthetic nervous system that is hardwired to the driver, so he can find you miliseconds after you try and take it out.Now that you've read this far into the review, be advised that the following portion WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ AHEAD AT YOUR OWN RISK.If you have the attention span to actually notice the weak storyline, you'll learn that the game revolves around uncovering intelligence on the construction of a German super tank, the Ratte being built under the ambitious supervision of a high-ranking general named Vahlen. What I feel Rebellion should have done with the story is give more spotlight time on Vahlen throughout the game, establish him more as the biggest threat to the player all the while never giving them the chance to strike at him until the final level. What happened instead was Vahlen being mentioned vaguely throughout the campaign in letters and enemy dialogue, and being thrown in at the last minute of the final level. What's worse is that the player doesn't even get the satisfaction of killing him yourself. He's injured in one cutscene and then shot point-blank in the head in another cutscene, which ultimately leads up to a very disappointing ending where Karl walks off into the horizon giving a bland monologue about killing people. With a terrible and easy-to-forget protagonist, an antagonist that you aren't even given the chance to hate and a forgettable and weak storyline, Sniper Elite 3 leaves so very much to be admired.All things considered: I'm afraid that I'd have to give Sniper Elite 3 a thumbs down, it had potential but failed to live up and expand its horizon beyond the limiting confines of its mediocre predecessors. The gameplay, while fun does gets tiring after a while, the story is quick to be forgotten, the mechanics are unambitious and added nothing new to the series and in all it literally is just a clone of Sniper Elite V2.

But you need to kill like 50 enemies per level), probably one or two Hitler or Churchill related mission.The missions are mostly dull. You just shoot and run all the time. Gets pretty tedious after a few hour's play. I'm probably not gonna even finish this game. Gosh, the last mission I played had a tiny map, but I was asked to run repeating routes to complete the mission. It sucks, feels like forcing me to waste time.The controls are pretty weird sometimes, too.			"

Even on authentic you can start a full-on firefight and the enemies will forget you exist after running away for 15 seconds.-The AI sees trough some of the walls, fences and bushes.-Shot masking breaks every now and then.

												I keep seeing negative reviews for this game, saying that this game shouldn't be played for some reason or another. Granted, there are definitely some flaws, but there are also a lot upsides to this game. I keep seeing negative comments about how this game only has 4 rifles. I personally don't see why this is an issue. Yes, if you want more, you need to buy DLC, but I have never felt the need to. The 4 rifles cover all your bases. A long range, slow firing rifle, a short range, faster firing rifle, a medium range rifle with a better scope and so forth. There is also a good amount of pistols, including the default silenced pistol. I have never felt that this is limiting me in anyway. Maybe if you're used to CoD, or FarCry, you might think there aren't that many guns, but for this game, mainly being a sniping based game, I feel like it works. The other negative comment I see a lot is that there are several DLCs already out for it. I can see why that might be a little bit annoying, but I wouldn't let it turn you away from this game. As stated prior, I have never felt the need to buy any other guns, so that already opts out the gun DLCs. As far as other DLCs, I havn't played them. I have not needed to. The campaign has kept me quite sated, and the other modes, as well as competetive online, also keep you busy.Everything in the game works well as well. I have not encountered anything game breaking or that unappealing. If the game is too easy, there is a mode that makes all bullet ballistics and physics 100% realistic, which believe me, makes the game MUCH harder. The AI wasn't anything spectacular, but nothing horrible either; it got the job done. I feel like there was a good mix of sniping and stealth, combined with ""going loud"" action. Voice acting was a little cheesy, but it fits the theme and time of the game. I have had a blast playing through this campaign with friends co-op, and doing the spotter/sniper missions co-op. Decent replay value with all the modes and online, plus it's fun to try and play at higher difficulties. Overall I'd give this game a 7/10. Worth the money, and I still come back to it often enough.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is the highly anticipated entry in the Sniper Elite franchise. I am a big fan of this series, and I even enjoyed the somewhat repetitive Zombie Army titles. I was hoping for an enjoyable romp through a slightly larger world with improvements to the stealth and sniping mechanics. Rebellion certainly doesn't disappoint.You play as Karl Fairburne, a US Sniper dropped into Africa during World War II to combat the Afrika Korps stationed there. You'll navigate through gorgeous rendered canyons, valleys and deserts to complete your objectives, and Rebellion has done an excellent job in the graphics department. I was never once disappointed by the visuals in this game, and was wowed at every opportunity.The levels are also quite large, and there are also optional objectives to complete during a main mission. These include tasks such as assassinating a visiting colonel, sabotaging a German fuel depot and eliminating enemy tanks. While not particularly original, these objectives are fun to complete and provide a nice XP boost.Gameplay has a number of mechanics designed to create a good sniper game. You have items such as stones and flint that you can use to distract enemy soldiers, as well as a silenced pistol to kill enemies discreetly. You can loot these corpses for items before moving their corpse to another location, which is a relatively unseen feature in modern shooters. Another stealth mechanic is the ability to create noise with other items so you can fire your rifle without being detected.On the subject of sniper mechanics, this game excels. The gory x-ray kills are back, and you can witness your bullet shattering bones and puncturing organs in fantastic HD glory. Bullet drop and wind speeds are an added factor to sniping, which makes each kill that more satisfying.Despite being a solid game overrall, Sniper Elite 3 has a number of flaws. Enemy AI is fairly inconsistent, and will go from spotting you easily to being blind to your movements and visible corpses. The amount of bugs in this game is quite baffling, but most have been fixed due to frequent patches. Not a game breaker, but definitely frustrating if you're not a fan of bugs and glitches.Overall, Sniper Elite 3 is a solid entry in a solid series. It improves over its predecessor, but still has the dull story and characters retained in the series. Despite this, I'd recommend this game for the huge levels and enjoyable mechanics. 8 / 10			"

												The actual sniping in the game is pretty good. Its fun and somewhat accurate to real world ballistics. Everything else isn't. Movement is awkward as is most other facets of gameplay. The stealth mechanics are relentlessly shoved down the players throat and aren't really fun.			"

												A joyous PC port that runs at a stable framerate with all the options you would want. The game turns sniping from the chore it is in most games into a kickass good time with a few great mechanics and that amazing bullet cam to let you know EXACTLY where you hit your targer. A steal at $15, worth full price easily.			"

All of the other content I guess is DLC, and it's frankly a little annoying when so are most of the weapons. That is, annoying in the context where the reward for doing well in the shooting range is getting to look at and use the DLC weapons but only in that range, nowhere else.Gameplays okay I guess.

												Sniper elite 3 is one of the most intricately designed games I’ve played it is just simply amazing from gameplay to graphics through and through. However I have only minor concerns here’s what I like and what I concern (keep in mind I have only played the game on sniper elite difficulty and easier difficulties tampers with AI intelligence and bullet physics also I haven’t finished the game yet I’m about maybe halfway through)•	Realistic bullet physics very well done also all snipers are completely different in stats and it can be very fun experimenting which one suits your play style and sniping skill (sniper elite / authentic difficulties) •	Extremely smart AI (sniper elite / authentic difficulties)•	Huge maps exploring is a must and just feels right very fruitful as well  •	Many different ways to handle objectives (however on sniper elite difficulty  going in guns blazing partially suicidal its possible but very hard, authentic difficulty you might as well just shoot yourself) •	wide-ranging  modifications and upgrades for each rifle •	well-designed all maps are unique from one another and a pass or bridge could have another hidden 5 different ways to cross for either a stealthy approach or a ambush point to gain an upper hand in a firefight•	gunplay is great if any then minor unnoticed problems•	bullet time allows you to see were your bullet hit and the damage it is doing its gruesomely attractive and extremely satisfying to watch for example your bullet ripping through the eye and peeling off the top of the skull of a Nazi officer or castrating a Nazi, yes there are testicle shots ashamed their no achievement for getting one   Concerns o	not many weapons only 4 snipers 4 submachine guns 3 pistols and the first pistol “welrod” is the best pistol the other 2 are trash o	the story and some voice acting is skeletal (:my opinion: but who f*ck cares gameplay is great and it give you an excuse to shoot Nazis) o	if you want more maps and guns you have to buy the dlc’sOverall 9.5/10 "

												I liked this game a lot, like its predecessors Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2. The interface makes it a bit more easy - not as hard as previous versions on hardest level. Added a nice knifing stealth kill. What I really miss is the possibility to shoot grenades off the belt of German soldiers -- making them explode. Certainly I did expect more maps included; the extra DLC maps are few and relatively expensive. AND of course, as it is situated in Africa, I would have LOVED if they would have thrown in some lions, snakes, crockodiles and such attacking you unexpectedly as you were sneaking up to your enemies. Or some herds of wildebeasts to startle and stampede over your targets (or at least creating a diversion). I would like a bit better AI: when you find a dead comrade in your camp, you dont just look out for enemies for 30 secs but would comb out the area I'd think. But nice graphics and very playable interface and controls. Overall a very fun game to play if you like sniping, stealth and tactics.			"

												The game is really fun in so many ways. You can basically do whatever you want and kill anyone in whichever way you see fit. Only your imagination set the limits.However, there are some bugs that expose you when loading games. basically for me 1/40 games when i load them its like as i drop down from a 1mm ledge, and if im too close to enemies.. They will know where iam and i have to start running or restart the map if its a strikt objective where i cannot get spotted.Also there are plenty of bugs how the ghost system works. If you save while you have the ""ghost mark"" you lose it upon reloading the save.Also, buy it at {LINK REMOVED} they got the game for 20 euro.75/100			"

The character's persona is what you would expect from pervious games. I like it, but maybe they could introduce something different.Gameplay (8/10)Pretty much the same, i do like the fact that u can customize ur wepons further here and also and exp system is very good. Though the last saves are pretty annoying, (save from time to time urself.) I do like the exp system tho i dont see its point but still cool to have.Graphics (10/10)Freaking stunning, it is incredibly detailed, animations are very smooth and the background and little details make this game visually stunning.

												A Gorgeous game that takes place in Africa during World War II. Third person action, great stealth mechanics, even with total control over movement, and FINALLY, a game which has mastered the art of sniping. However, the story is, IN MY OPIONION (my review) average. Alot of people will argue with me, and say it is awsome, with espionage and such, but it is rather straight forward and predicatble. Still, this game is so fun that the story dosent matter much. I have not tried multiplayer, but guessing from my experience with Elite V2, (the predeccesor), I'm Guessing it requires a lot of patience, skill, and has alot of camping (duh). Overall, a large improvement in every aspect over V2, even in story, (I dont like either, but at least this one is slightly realistic. Russians stealling the plans to some rocket in V2 is just dumb.) so I give this game a 8.75/10			"

When you need to take cover ..there is no option to have a great cover!!! you have to improvise........for example in some games such as Battlefield, COD, etc there is an option to stay behind the wall or any other thing that can give you some protection from the enemy´s fire, here you have to move fast to be safe from the bullets.I like the story, and the 3D camera when you hit a target is just COOL!!!!!!yes folks...it is worthy to buy it.......hope that the TEAM who creates all these SAGA...could give us one more game....PLEASE.

												I recommend this game as a fan of the series.It has everything previous Sniper Elite games had, x-cam, challanging levels, interesting plot. And here they added some new cool mechanics (Ghost,  Relocate...)But, i would have gladly waiting few more month of development to fix some crucial gameplay aspects:1. Praise the holy rock - like before enemies react to rocks and are going to check out that suspisious sound - but imagine a full room of soldiers, leaving one by one for the same suspisious sound and never returning and no one is alerted.2.I did not understand that before and i cant understand now - why hand to hand close quarters stealth kill earns less exp than a shot with a pistol?!3. Even officers or elite enemies - once get a glimpse of you - instead of shouting for alarm or taking few guys to check it out - will check the place themselves.There are more bugs as firing into cover etc... which  Im sure people already spoke of but the 3 above turn even hard difficulty to childs play.(Oh another wierd thing - the rifles are customizeble but the machine guns and handguns are not... just wierd) "

												I liked this game a lot, like its predecessors Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2. The interface makes it a bit more easy - not as hard as previous versions on hardest level. Added a nice knifing stealth kill. What I really miss is the possibility to shoot grenades off the belt of German soldiers -- making them explode. Certainly I did expect more maps included; the extra DLC maps are few and relatively expensive. AND of course, as it is situated in Africa, I would have LOVED if they would have thrown in some lions, snakes, crockodiles and such attacking you unexpectedly as you were sneaking up to your enemies. Or some herds of wildebeasts to startle and stampede over your targets (or at least creating a diversion). I would like a bit better AI: when you find a dead comrade in your camp, you dont just look out for enemies for 30 secs but would comb out the area I'd think. But nice graphics and very playable interface and controls. Overall a very fun game to play if you like sniping, stealth and tactics.			"

												*This may seem quite negative, but playing multiplayer changed the review into a recommendation... barely.Lets get down to it.For the price asked, is this game worth it? Lets go back a step and ask a more important question; Is this a game?Well, a game is something you have fun interacting with. It challenges you and provides entertainment. Sniper Elite 3 is definitely challenging and it can be fun, so lets pencil in a ""yes"" for the question of is this a game. Now, is it worth the price?No. Definitely not (Unless you want to go purely multiplayer - see below). I'll admit I have not played the previous 2 iterations of Sniper Elite, but they cannot have been worse than this. The graphics are pretty and the xray cam can be amusing and fun, but this is counteracted by the clunky mechanics, often horrible animations, weak AI and general lack of polish on the entire thing. Still, the xray cam shots are amusing.Level design feels like limited paths with varying chances of getting pounced on by several enemies and shot into paste. The AI is perculiar to say the least. Enemies finding a dead body will become ""suspicious"" for a short time... then forget there is a problem. The noise-masking you can do by using noisy environmental objects to hide your rifle noises is a good idea, but was not executed as well as it could have been.UPDATE:After a bit more time with the game, I found that the multiplayer co-op aspect of it greatly increases the level of fun you can have with the game. Co-ordinating your shots with someone else or covering each other while sneaking around giving surprise stabs to the neck is fun and makes things worth your time. Single player might not be fantastic, but multiplayer makes up for it.			"

												I recommend this game as a fan of the series.It has everything previous Sniper Elite games had, x-cam, challanging levels, interesting plot. And here they added some new cool mechanics (Ghost,  Relocate...)But, i would have gladly waiting few more month of development to fix some crucial gameplay aspects:1. Praise the holy rock - like before enemies react to rocks and are going to check out that suspisious sound - but imagine a full room of soldiers, leaving one by one for the same suspisious sound and never returning and no one is alerted.2.I did not understand that before and i cant understand now - why hand to hand close quarters stealth kill earns less exp than a shot with a pistol?!3. Even officers or elite enemies - once get a glimpse of you - instead of shouting for alarm or taking few guys to check it out - will check the place themselves.There are more bugs as firing into cover etc... which  Im sure people already spoke of but the 3 above turn even hard difficulty to childs play.(Oh another wierd thing - the rifles are customizeble but the machine guns and handguns are not... just wierd) "

												*SPOILER ALERT*So first of all let's get this out of the way, I think it's way better than the more linear SE V2, but I think It's not as fun as the first. Let's start:-Graphics: They are alot better than V2, textures are better and more crisp and what I like the most is that the color pallete is much richer than the grays and blacks of V2. There are yellows, blues, reds, greens and etc. To sum it up much better than V2-Enviroment: SE3 is set in Africa, where the grass is green and the Jerries are pretty. No but seriously as I said in the graphics section, Rebellion made the game alot better looking. I really liked the fifth mission's beggining stage where you crawl through a field/oasis and then you approach a big desert town. I found that a very good contrast.-Map design: This is where the last game flopped, V2 was very linear and only one path to go through, this game has alot more open levels with several paths to go through but the general path is the same. To sum it up better than V2 but could be more open.-Gameplay: Preety much the same as V2 but now stealth is possible. You can go through an entire level and not alert anyone. Sniping is as great as it was in the last game, it feels superb.-Sound: I can't comment on this because I dont pay much attention to the background sound, but the guns sound excelent.-Campaign: A lacking plot in which you - Karl Fairburne seem to dismantle the entire Afrika Korps and the Royal Italian Army stationed in Africa in search of a Nazi prototype tank wonder-weapon called the Ratte P1000. The voice acting is honestly comedic and bad, so in summary ignore the plot. The one in V2 was better. Which brings me to the missions. They are long but there are only 8 of them. The campaign will take you about 16 hours, and also not very replayable unless you are going for the collectibles.-Multiplayer: After the campaign you can play the much improved multiplayer. Unlike V2 where it was very campy and it was essencially a free-for-all, here spotting is more encouraged and when you are on a killstreak you are encouraged to relocate to get extra points per kill. The ranking system is cumulative through campaign and multiplayer so you can rank up faster in multiplayer after you finish the campaign. However I miss ""Bombing Run"" :(-Co-op: You can play through the campaign with a buddy, and also you can play the great Overwatch mode in which one guy is a operative on the ground and another one is the sniper. It is incredibly engrosing and extremely fun.So that sums up Sniper Elite 3, much improved over Sniper Elite V2 but the plot could be alot better. Overall not worth 40 euros, so buy it on a sale and after that enjoy. I rate it 8.5 out of 10			"

												Nvidia gpu owners, beware!This game COULD be great, I mean, the gameplay is fun, but there's no point on me even starting to talk about that because of the state of this game at the moment.Basically, the game crashes every few minutes playing it. I was trying to finish it so that I could buy SE 4, because it looked like a good game, but it was the most frustrating experience I've ever had with a video game in my entire 30 years of life. Having to save every single time you do anything relevant, doing everything all over again if you forget to do that, rushing the game instead of enjoying it because you need to go as fast as you can to experience the least amount of crashes possible and so on...From what info I've gathered, it could be the OS, but most likely it's updating Nvidia drivers that causa the issues.So, the great solution someone found was to downgrade your gpu drivers... just to play this one game. Why? Because Rebellion has just been sitting silent doing absolutely NOTHING to fix the issue, and i'ts likely that they won't, given their usual response to anything is to remain silent and do nothing.This is outrageous. The game is not even 3 years old, so there's no excuse for not even trying to fix it. I mean, they haven't even talked with their playerbase about doing something about it.			"

												Everything is nearly as same as sniper elite v2, the story is not connected and makes no sense just like in V2. and about the gameplay it is a bit better than V2 because you do not have noobish health regeneration anymore you need medic packs like sniper elite 1. there are many features in this game but sadly it does not force you to use them so it can be a gun and run game instead of what it is made for.Mission design is really good but enemies are as dumb as V2.%50 recommended and %50 not recommended cause it also features pay 2 access guns which is not fair for what they cost.

												A very fun WW2 shooter set in africa. Great mechanics give it a fun mix of stealth with sniper mechanics loosely based on the real world such as bullet drop and using other loud noises like thunder or artillery fire to mask your shots. The game also uses a variety of other weapons such as various sidearms, machine pistols (the MP40 for example) and several grenades and traps that can be used. It also uses a cover system and allows you to distract enemies by throwing objects and both sound and vision (line of sight and light levels) are important.It's a surprisingly in-depth game with a decent amount of levels and a fair amount of replayability with several difficulties and a number of collectibles in each level. If you're a fan of any stealth or sniper gameplay, you'll probably enjoy this game a lot.			"

												Short and dissapointing.That basically says it all. A 7 hour campaign. Enemy AI made in 1985, one shot and the entire map knows exactly where you are. Mandatory rpg-unlock system that is just not worth the unlocks. Only 4 rifles in-game, the rest behind a DLC pay-wall. Stealth/relocation mechanic that sucks the fun out of sniping. A story that makes Twilight look like a great love drama. Unlikable main characters. No memorable supporting cast. Anti-climactic ending if there ever was one. It is all kinds of bad rolled into one, and it takes itself way too serious. Playing co-op makes the game even worse for some reason (how is that even possible?)I absolutely love the Zombie Army games, I really like Sniper V2, but this? Even at 70% off I feel cheated.Maybe get it for the multiplayer if that is your cup of tea. Avoid otherwise.			"

												This game is amazing I really enjoy the partial open world. Also the bullet ballistics I find are a lot better then Sniper Elite V2. Another great feature of this game is the new X-ray shots as they now incorporate muscles, circulatory system and new BALL PHYSICS! and the graphics on the x-ray shots are just sooooo much better. In a way there is more to choose from when you shoot someone. They also have added X-ray shots on vehicles so thats really awesome exploding vehicles. There is now new weapon customization and new weapons like the Italian Carcano rifle and the German panzershreck. And new enemies not Germans and Russians but now again Germans and Italians, in a way i liek that as the Italians aren't really recognised much in WWII. But this game is just legendary I definately recommend this game especially with the Hunt the Grey Wolf DLC it's really good. I give this game a rating of 8/10  "

												*This may seem quite negative, but playing multiplayer changed the review into a recommendation... barely.Lets get down to it.For the price asked, is this game worth it? Lets go back a step and ask a more important question; Is this a game?Well, a game is something you have fun interacting with. It challenges you and provides entertainment. Sniper Elite 3 is definitely challenging and it can be fun, so lets pencil in a ""yes"" for the question of is this a game. Now, is it worth the price?No. Definitely not (Unless you want to go purely multiplayer - see below). I'll admit I have not played the previous 2 iterations of Sniper Elite, but they cannot have been worse than this. The graphics are pretty and the xray cam can be amusing and fun, but this is counteracted by the clunky mechanics, often horrible animations, weak AI and general lack of polish on the entire thing. Still, the xray cam shots are amusing.Level design feels like limited paths with varying chances of getting pounced on by several enemies and shot into paste. The AI is perculiar to say the least. Enemies finding a dead body will become ""suspicious"" for a short time... then forget there is a problem. The noise-masking you can do by using noisy environmental objects to hide your rifle noises is a good idea, but was not executed as well as it could have been.UPDATE:After a bit more time with the game, I found that the multiplayer co-op aspect of it greatly increases the level of fun you can have with the game. Co-ordinating your shots with someone else or covering each other while sneaking around giving surprise stabs to the neck is fun and makes things worth your time. Single player might not be fantastic, but multiplayer makes up for it.			"

												A superb game showing the career of the Desert Ghost. All new defining graphics include light shafts, dynamic shadows, an updated x Ray kill cam showing muscles and veins,  even visually customizable rifles! The story is much shorter than SEV2,  but the missions are more open and take longer to complete. Defiantly get it on sale, it's amazing.			"

												Sniper elite 3 is one of the most intricately designed games I’ve played it is just simply amazing from gameplay to graphics through and through. However I have only minor concerns here’s what I like and what I concern (keep in mind I have only played the game on sniper elite difficulty and easier difficulties tampers with AI intelligence and bullet physics also I haven’t finished the game yet I’m about maybe halfway through)•	Realistic bullet physics very well done also all snipers are completely different in stats and it can be very fun experimenting which one suits your play style and sniping skill (sniper elite / authentic difficulties) •	Extremely smart AI (sniper elite / authentic difficulties)•	Huge maps exploring is a must and just feels right very fruitful as well  •	Many different ways to handle objectives (however on sniper elite difficulty  going in guns blazing partially suicidal its possible but very hard, authentic difficulty you might as well just shoot yourself) •	wide-ranging  modifications and upgrades for each rifle •	well-designed all maps are unique from one another and a pass or bridge could have another hidden 5 different ways to cross for either a stealthy approach or a ambush point to gain an upper hand in a firefight•	gunplay is great if any then minor unnoticed problems•	bullet time allows you to see were your bullet hit and the damage it is doing its gruesomely attractive and extremely satisfying to watch for example your bullet ripping through the eye and peeling off the top of the skull of a Nazi officer or castrating a Nazi, yes there are testicle shots ashamed their no achievement for getting one   Concerns o	not many weapons only 4 snipers 4 submachine guns 3 pistols and the first pistol “welrod” is the best pistol the other 2 are trash o	the story and some voice acting is skeletal (:my opinion: but who f*ck cares gameplay is great and it give you an excuse to shoot Nazis) o	if you want more maps and guns you have to buy the dlc’sOverall 9.5/10 "

												They improved a lot from Sniper Elite 2. Nobody can disagree onthat!But like some people said before it doesn't feel much polished or maybe isn't 100% finished yet.One thing that I didn't like it is that you are SNIPER but the stealth mechanic punishes you really hard if you try to use your sniper rifle. Sometimes it's better just to move around with your pistol and your knife.The slow-mo kill cam is awesome and I recommend because of that!			"

												Great addition to the series.  If you like sneaking around solo and taking out entire encampments steathily one baddie at a time this game is for you.Pros: lots of opportunity for head shots or other specific organ shots.  Missions are fairly long and quite replayable allowing you to take different paths through each mission.  Graphics are great.Cons: I found the difficulty on all but the highest setting to be quite easy, but the highest setting to be very hard (and with no saves on the hardest setting, you need a flawless performance or its back to the start of the long mission).I totally suggest this game.Enjoy!

												Great fun in Co-op, not as much in Single Player.  Great graphics and viceral kills.  Levels tend to be long (or short if you find a shortcut in a few), but in total the campaign is less than 10 hours long and that includes getting most of the collectibles and playing a few levels over due to bugs.  (If you have to restart a checkpoint it will boot both players out of the game and you have to start the entire level over.I recommend, but only for co-op and only when the price comes down.  The weapons are mostly a joke and the DLC is way too short.  Don't pay full price for this game.			"

												When I bought the game I thought it will be totally different from SE V2. The sounds effects, the X-Ray Kills, even the intro music is the same. The DLC's...meh... there is no difference between a normal weapon and a DLC weapon, but it's ok. The AI is a little silly and ""confused"". If the enemys not find you, it returns to the initial form with no worries. This was the ""bad"" part, now let's talk about the good part. The graphics are incredible and very well optimised on both CPU's (Intel and AMD). You have ALOT of missions / sub-missions and HUGE maps to explore and new mods. The multiplayer mod is one of the most interesting parts of the game, much harder and more complex than V2. If you liked V2, Sniper Elite 3 should be in your games library! 8/10.			"

												Took me a few days to decide whether to buy this.I've been longing for a WW2 game that is not an all guns blazing battlefield with me (confused ) in the middle of the mayhem (Ala COD World War).After an hour of playing (setting: Sniper Elite) I turned the game music off, looked for a playlist of WW2 music, and now really getting into it. Im going to savour every moment, cause its not often you get a WW2 FPS like this, beauifully made and good playability. Reminds me of the old MOH and Commandos 1 & 2.  I'm very very happy with this bit of escapism I bought myself!			"

												This game is fun for several reasons.First of all, don't expect a realistic simulation of BEING a sniper. The realism is mainly present in the shooting physics - it doesn't really simulate how snipers actually operate because that probably wouldn't be as fun as what this game provides.The best feature, in my opinion, is the consistently fun and non-frustrating gameplay, which persists despite difficult-to-master mechanics. This comes from the nice save system and forgiving stealth mechanics. Being able to quick-save really changes the fun of this game, in my opinion. Instead of what happens in other stealth games where you make a mistake, everyone gets alerted, then you have to open up a menu, sit through a long loading screen, and start at the beginning of the level, you get an quick-save button which saves while you continue playing, so you can always save before you try something risky and just focus on the fun sniping mechanics and visuals. Also, one of the other problems that can happen in a lot of stealth games is that it's hard to keep track of your surroundings, so somebody might see you but you won't realize it until it's too late. This game provides subtle audio-cues and less subtle visual cues to let you know when you are about to be spotted.You might think that the aforementioned features make the game too easy or too simple, but I think it just lets you focus on what this game does best - being stealthy and sniping people. If you really like sniping in other FPS games (the feel of precision and power), you'll definitely like this game because it focuses on that one aspect of FPS. If you're concerned about having to spend more time sneaking around than shooting, you're in luck because even though you might alert everyone and have them go aggressive, you can still clear levels just by running and gunning and shooting everyone in sight.So, overall, I think this game is pretty fun.

												Single player only review.SE3 is a 3rd person stealth shooter that focuses on sniping (duh!).It takes place during WW2, and unlike Wolfenstein, it doesn't really have any interesting characters or involving story.The gameplay, albeit linear,  is good though, and it could've been very good if it weren't for a few fundamental flaws. As the main attraction is sniping, the levels are large. They're also pretty and rendered with a very well performing engine. The main event in the visual department is the bullet cam kills, which shows the bullet penetrating the victim in x-ray vision, so you see the bones scatter etc. It's neat, and yes, it grows old pretty quick. Luckily it's skippable.There's not much voice acting, but what is there is ok. Sound effects are very good.My problems with the game are:- Spawning enemies. The premise of the game is to observe and plan. What friggin' use is that when enemies can spawn near by when a certain area is reached, or an objective is accomplished or you fire a shot that wasn't sound masked?! - All hail the sniper rifle. Naturally the devs want you to use the ""title"" weapon, but they really went too far by nerfing the other bullet weapons WAY into the unusable. You can't hit a barn from 3 feet with a Thompson rifle even while proning with a heart rate of 60. As soon as it became an option I carried a Panzershrek RPG instead.- The AI. I know AI is hard to do. AI in a stealth game is harder. This AI will lose a game of chess to a brick EVERY TIME.- Unclear mission objectives. Best example: ""Overcome the temple defenders"" with a map marker inside the temple actually means: ""Go find a half-track vechicle across the map and destroy it and return here"". Jesus effin' christ. If you're hooked on stealthy sniping, this is for you. If you just love 3rd person stealth shooters, buy a Metal Gear Solid game instead.73%			"

												POSTED: 17 SEPTEMBERI have played all 3 Sniper Elite's in the series and was excited to learn they are working on a 4th. I have also played the Zombie versions of the game (which I didn't like NEAR as much). Overall, this is my favorite in the series and it seems as each release gets more and more polished than the last. While I play single player 99% of the time, I have dabbled in the co-op multiplayer and it is fun but I do wish it allowed multiple snipers instead of the sniper/spotter setup currently. I realize this is technically more correct, we, as players, want to play as the sniper and when we are playing as spotter it feels we are just playing nice until our turn.I really only have a few gripes with the game that I can think of right now. First: (And this is a big one) you can't set your elevation on your scope. Every person that shoots firearms knows you can set your ""zero"" on your scope so that it is ""dead-on"" at a certain distance. Then, you can hold over or under depending on whether the target it closer or further. Second: This whole series has suffered from what I refer to as the ""trigger effect"" where enemies don't appear, or certain things happen until you hit a certain trigger. Usually the trigger is reaching a certain place on the map, or killing a certain person, or percentage of enemies. While not as pronounced as it was on the 2nd in the series, nothing like carefully scouting your approach, then moving forward and hitting a trigger point, and have enemies all around you. Often, once I figured out where that trigger point was, I moved forward until I triggered it, then ran back to my sniper nest and clear a path. Third: Enemies in vehicles see WAY to well. If you have ever been in an armored vehicle or tank, you will know that visibility is NOT their strong point. They should have excellent defense and firepower like they do in real life and do in the game but shouldn't be able to see you near as well unless near an enemy patrol. Fourth: Inconsistant mechanics regarding long range shooting alarming enemies. I have played the game 250+ hours, and still can't determine whether an enemy will hear my shots at a given place or distance except around broken generators and such. Incidentally, it seems logical that if backfiring generators at your location mask your sounds, you should be able to shoot a generator near the enemy and make it back firing then you could shoot towards him even if you are not by a generator any longer. (does that make sense?)A few more ""mentions"" of other things about the game I wish were different. Why can't we jump in the game?I wish you could turn off the wind, without turning off elevation. It is harder to ""feel"" the wind in a game. I had some occasional issues with the game doing a red flicker when SLI was enabled. This was the only game that ever did that. Normally, just changing the resolution and restarting it fixed it. Ironically, I could alternate between two resolutions and they both worked; AFTER the other one messed up. Every time you reload your side arm, it goes through the ""chambering"" animation. Just because you drop the magazine, and put in a full one, doesn't mean the chamber will be empty. Yes, there are a FEW firearms that the magazine is loaded from the top, usually with a ""stripper clip"" where you would potentially cycle it like that, but aside from the M1 Garand rifle and the Mauser C96 (which I don't remember any in the game), nothing should load like that. For a game that obviously desires for accuracy and realism, it seems like an odd oversight.Snipers don't fall for thrown rocks, no way to get them to move short of killing them.			"

												Played for a few hours during a free weekend.The game plays well from a controls point of view. The quick menu is smooth, you have shortcuts for switching weapons, covering and vaulting are responsive. The only part that seems off is sprinting where you can't easily change direction.There's an element of customization where you can choose your loadout before every mission. Weapons and items unlock as you progress through the campaign, or by gathering collectibles and doing optional quests. You can even upgrade your rifle, though the stock rifle with the stock parts seems the most balanced.The graphics are good, although I find the sunlight overly white. There's also some weird pixelation when light shines through the leaves of a tree.Killing any enemy will probably result in a kill cam that traces the path of the bullet all the way to the enemy and through them. They're gory, fun, but repetitive. Fortunately you can skip them. Sometimes they look a bit blurry, especially the bone fragments and the blood.The game feels very easy. With the enemy difficulty set to the highest level, you can't help but feel overpowered. The AI is simply dumb. You can pick enemies one by one as long as you relocate between shots. They'll instantly forget that you wiped half their base if they can't see you anymore. Even exploding oil barrels next to them won't hold their attention for long. At many times I had enemies look right at me and have them take a good 3-4 seconds before they even start thinking of shooting me. In that time you can easily switch weapons, miss a shot or two and take your time to line up a headshot.In the end, I recommend the game because it's fun. You can choose to go stealthy and take enemies from behind without getting noticed, or you can shoot everything in sight with little to no consequences due to poor AI. It's a good way to spend a lazy weekend, but it's not a game to commit yourself too. Compared to Ghost Warrior (the first one), this game feels polished.			"

												Cool game, I like the stealth mechanics and the ambience.  Just a couple of things I hope they change by the next game:-Changeable over-the-shoulder view, because sometimes you need to look over the left one too-NPC dialogue, because the same 10 phrases, even in another language, are noticable after a while.  Make the NPCs come alive! Have them talk about their families back home, childhood memories, etc.  They don't know you're there, so why don't they loosen up a bit? (It might make people want to spare them too. Add to the emphasis on stealth rather than run n' gun)-Variable slow-mo cam occurence.  It gets stale pretty quickly.-Maps with more than one path to the objective.  I'm talking about a side road or something, not two boxes with a hole under them off to the side that you can crawl through.-More believable sound cover.  Sound cover should echo like a gunshot if it's going to cover a gunshot, not like someone is popping bubblewrap.Aside from these things, the game is really well put together.			"

												Take Sniper Elite v2 and copy paste it. Then screw with the physics and finally throw in a few maps that are laughably small considering this is a game about sniping.

												Great fun in Co-op, not as much in Single Player.  Great graphics and viceral kills.  Levels tend to be long (or short if you find a shortcut in a few), but in total the campaign is less than 10 hours long and that includes getting most of the collectibles and playing a few levels over due to bugs.  (If you have to restart a checkpoint it will boot both players out of the game and you have to start the entire level over.I recommend, but only for co-op and only when the price comes down.  The weapons are mostly a joke and the DLC is way too short.  Don't pay full price for this game.			"

												When I bought the game I thought it will be totally different from SE V2. The sounds effects, the X-Ray Kills, even the intro music is the same. The DLC's...meh... there is no difference between a normal weapon and a DLC weapon, but it's ok. The AI is a little silly and ""confused"". If the enemys not find you, it returns to the initial form with no worries. This was the ""bad"" part, now let's talk about the good part. The graphics are incredible and very well optimised on both CPU's (Intel and AMD). You have ALOT of missions / sub-missions and HUGE maps to explore and new mods. The multiplayer mod is one of the most interesting parts of the game, much harder and more complex than V2. If you liked V2, Sniper Elite 3 should be in your games library! 8/10.			"

												This game is fun for several reasons.First of all, don't expect a realistic simulation of BEING a sniper. The realism is mainly present in the shooting physics - it doesn't really simulate how snipers actually operate because that probably wouldn't be as fun as what this game provides.The best feature, in my opinion, is the consistently fun and non-frustrating gameplay, which persists despite difficult-to-master mechanics. This comes from the nice save system and forgiving stealth mechanics. Being able to quick-save really changes the fun of this game, in my opinion. Instead of what happens in other stealth games where you make a mistake, everyone gets alerted, then you have to open up a menu, sit through a long loading screen, and start at the beginning of the level, you get an quick-save button which saves while you continue playing, so you can always save before you try something risky and just focus on the fun sniping mechanics and visuals. Also, one of the other problems that can happen in a lot of stealth games is that it's hard to keep track of your surroundings, so somebody might see you but you won't realize it until it's too late. This game provides subtle audio-cues and less subtle visual cues to let you know when you are about to be spotted.You might think that the aforementioned features make the game too easy or too simple, but I think it just lets you focus on what this game does best - being stealthy and sniping people. If you really like sniping in other FPS games (the feel of precision and power), you'll definitely like this game because it focuses on that one aspect of FPS. If you're concerned about having to spend more time sneaking around than shooting, you're in luck because even though you might alert everyone and have them go aggressive, you can still clear levels just by running and gunning and shooting everyone in sight.So, overall, I think this game is pretty fun.

												Sniper Elite 3 takes the mechanics of its predecessors and refines them even further. The game is immediately more open than its predecessor in that there are more paths to take. A new relocate system forces you to think about your position and pick your targets accordingly. Its a engaging system that when you elude pursuers feels rewarding. In prior games you could sit in one spot and kill all the approaching guards and move onto the next area. Sniper Elite 3 builds tension. It also has a greater emphasis on using sound to mask your shots. This can range from communication towers, sabotaging generators or the weather itself. You have the same tools at your disposal as in other Sniper Elite games with a few new additions. You have trip mines, grenades, anti personel mines, landmines, etc. Sniper Elite 3 also features a robust progression system. Every kill regardless of mode grants you XP. And your level is across all modes so you never feel like you have to do things over just to progress in another mode. This progression unlocks extra weapons for one of your 4 loadouts. You can unlock weapons like a webley revolver, luger, Thompson, the italian carcano, an enfield, and even a panzerschreck. That said there are a few quibbles I have when it comes to the game's stealth melee takedown mechanics. In one mission I successfully circled a guard leaning against sand bags. But I was unable to perform a melee takedown to drag him over the sandbags. It feels like a curious omission and breaks the immersion. Another oddity is in that if you are hiding behind a corner and a guard walks up or spots you; you are unable to knife them. Instead it shows you clumsily and uselessly punch the enemy while he continues to shoot you. Thus you are forced to hose him with a Thompson breaking any chance you have of being discreet. Overall this third installment is an enjoyable one with a few questionable oddities. But with the number of collectibles, unlocks, and sandbox map design; there is enough here to still satisfy.			"

												I enjoyed this game tremendously even though it's obviously got some lacking elements. I love stealth and sniping, and this game has plenty of both. It does surprise me that after 2 years, the DLC has a) not really been reduced in price, and b) apparently has hardly ever been seen based on the number of reviews of it. I'd pick them up just to have more fun with the game, but until the trio of mission-based DLC come down to maybe the price of one of them, that's off my list.Now: the good stuff!I enjoy the variety of fighting though I almost always find myself defaulting to my 'stealth, snipe, whoops - kill everything in sight, wait for enemies to relax, repeat' mode. I don't mind that at all, though I suspect some find it too repetitive. The locations are really nice and I would love to have a way to remove the UI and get first person in there, just for screenshot purposes. Killing fascists is always - ALWAYS - on my list of things to do. ALWAYS. There's a kind of satisfaction that comes from it that is kind of ... a guilty(?) pleasure.I found myself more and more liking the little bit of actual story we have - nice touches to the character even though he's mostly a blank slate (I didn't even know that his name was Karl... lol, because they don't actually SAY it anywhere). Plus his voice. mmm. His voice.Good musical cues, though at times the music overshadows any other sounds.Overall very easy and intuitive to play, though I still hate third person motion quite a bit, but that's on me not the game.The less good:I really want to be able to jump and explore. Unfortunately that just doesn't happen. However on the plus side of this is that the numerous ways you CAN explore the areas to complete your goals are a lot of fun.The sound editing is crappy, in that there's zero stereo sound cues, and that means in trying to hear directionally it's impossible to determine any locations of enemies. The chat that occasionally shows up is also weirdly triggered, because I'd already killed a number of enemies and then went through their chat trigger... so... a room full of dead guys and they're talking. O.oVirtually no story. Now, I'll give this one a pass because I didn't really get the game to have a story, I got it so I could shoot bad guys with a sniper rifle. :) Way too short. However also this gets a pass from me because the replay value is very strong, and the challenges pad the mission length. I don't play multiplayer so I probably won't get any of the other achievements or see any maps that might be mp exclusive, which is a bit of a shame. I'd love to be able to interact with the environment much more than I do. I'd like to pick things up, climb, shimmy under things, etc, and explore to my hearts' content, but that's not why the character is where he is.The .... bad? Well I suppose the one thing I might say is that it's still too expensive and the DLC should be folded into one lower price point to actually sell it. If you enjoy sniping and a variety of potential methods for doing the same 8 missions and challenge maps, highly recommend. Pick it up on sale, imo.			"

I haven't played much, but here are my opionions (I will update this over time).Pros:-Graphics are good, if a little bit fake-looking.-Model and textures are good so far.-Gameplay is fantastic (see caveat).-Visuals are unmatched.-Co-op and Multiplayer fun with friends.-Stealth is crucial.-AI seems intelligent so far.Cons:-Gameplay caveat; third person.-Ballistics are exaggerated (bullet drop is way too much, 10 inches from point of aim at 50 yards with an M1 Garand).-Weapon balancing is not realistic AT ALL. Caliber, barrel length, action type, and other variables have no consideration in the weapon stats of the game. This is the thing that really bugs me the most (I can forgive the other two Cons, maybe).-Weapon sounds are horrible, but then again all games are like that.Overall, I would not buy it for $50.00. For $15 on sale, it's a great deal.			"

												I've played Sniper Elite II all the way through and some of the extra content and I liked Sniper Elite II except for the issue with the game randomly crashing and restarting itself.  I found it's been an issue for a long time and tried all the fixes I could find but none work.  It seemed to get worse as I completed more missions.  I made it to the first part of mission 8 (the final one) and finally gave up as every 5-10 minutes it restarted (and yes I saved a lot).  Given it's 2017 I don't expect the developer to fix it but if I'd known then what I know now I would not buy it which is sad because I did enjoy the game when it allowed me to do so.  So I probably won't be buying Sniper Elite 4 either.			"

 My Experience Of Sniper Elite 3 [/b]Graphics- 9/10 This game has the top Graphics i ever seen in a game, alot to say about the graphics they run Fast and smooth. the shadows follow perfectly how the soldier moves around and shadows is a good way to hide. And the graphic has change alot since Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2. I like the graphics and new X-ray cams, they look alot better and the bones breaks alot more realistic than ever.Gameplay- 10/10 Gameplay what can i tell i got the best experience ever in this game. This game has definitely the best mulitiplayer i ever seen and the story mode uhh ohh. play CO-OP with friends in Mission even Survival that has up to 15 Rounds 5 Waves in each round all from Soldiers to Tanks or even more. And mulitiplayer thats still is one of the best. Even on battlefield i had alot of experience i was fighting along friends and even strangers and i got new friends, this game gets you alot of teammates in the battlefieldSounds- 6.5/10 The sounds are amazing and the sound of the bullet flying right through the head is overpowered good. The totally make the Sniper Elite V2 sounds look girly and bad, but still not good enough to get ~10/10~.I can't wait for more Sniper Elite in the future. ( But wait for the price goes a little bit down[/b]) Comments are allowed on this one. Having a questing that burns inside why don't ya ask me ;D i'll answer as fast i can.... (Review May Change) "

												This is a game for people who wish they good at sniping in video games, but lack patience or skill. Wanna land that sick headshot? Just press the button that not only slows time, but shows you exactly where your bullet is going to land. 1 click and you're Vasily ♥♥♥♥ing Zaytsev. No skill required unless playing on the hardest difficulty, which is extremely frustrating for other reasons.Level design is also terrible in this game. It's pretty obvious that each map was made by a different person with a different philosophy regarding enemy placement and objectives. Linear and boring with a couple maps that attempt to give you the illusion of creative freedom.Glad I picked this up on a free weekend and beat it quickly. Don't spend money on this trash. Pros: Runs pretty damn well.			"

Very repetitive and the enemy doesn't seem to be particularly intelligentI don't feel the series evolve with this game. It introduces some new mechanics but executes poor which makes this game inferior to Sniper Elite 2. Firstly, this game is not about sniper is about knife and silencer pistol. It's about stealth-ing and spying. Even objectives are not indicated for a sniper. To destroy tanks or to steal intelligence. Secondly, the maps are not make for sniping and it's very costly to snipe. For every bullet you will be penalized with a lot of troops on your zone. All the guns are a waste of time you need to fire on some zone of the head. The graphics in this game is almost same like SE2 but with more illuminated effects. "

												Don't be fooled by the flood of ""negative"" reviews from people who played over the free weekend. That always happens with games that go free to play and it is frustrating to see a great game get bad press because some picky people decided to play game critic with a game they didn't even bother buying or playing for more than a weekend. This game is fantastically optimized and is downright fun to play. It runs really well on old hardware and has all of the great features of the previous games, but with improved graphics, a new location, and customizable loadouts. If you played and enjoyed the previous games in the series, you will very likely enjoy this game. Lets face it, this series is mostly about poking holes in people from very far away and watching their organs get shredded and fly out those holes in slow motion. This game does that very, very well.			"

												The game is very good with an added marksman level.Graphics and webcam kills are excellent.On the minus side of things .Hit markers are not all ways in correct place.Have problems shooting through grass or over a wall at times,  whilst crouched despite having object in view .A.I. can shoot through solid objects you hiding behined  at times.8 maps The game appears short and ends abruptly as it did in 2nd game.The longevity of the game is as usual finding objects and added  sniper nest kills.Having said the above....I got to say I  like. ITS   SNIPER ELITE AFTER ALL !!!!			"

												“Sniper Elite 3” hits it mark with beautiful visuals, but misses giving players more content.	This is the third game in the Sniper Elite franchise and is easily the most detailed and innovated in the series. It is unfortunate that players won’t enjoy the game for long as it’s incredibly short experience.	Players take on the role of Karl Fairburn, an American secret agent sent to the African front during World War II. His mission is to learn about a secret ‘wonder weapon’ the Nazi’s are planning to create and prevent it from being built. The story for all the ‘Sniper Elite’ games has never been its strongest suit- it is forgettable and doesn’t affect the players experience at all.	Sniper Elite 3’s main feature is sniping, taking out enemies from a long distance with a rifle. Landing a good shot is difficult, as players have to deal with things like unsteady hands and wind resistance- simulating real world sniping. The game rewards players with a slow motion bullet cam as they show how the bullet enters the body and the damage it does to bone and muscles. The bullet cam does lose its amusement after a while but can be turned off.	Stealth has been greatly improved in this from previous games. Using rocks to distract enemies to lure them in to a landmine or getting them out of cover so you can land a shot. Players can hide their loud rifle shots by sniping near noisy generators or artillery pieces, making it easier to stay concealed. You are encouraged to stay hidden because the enemy out number you and can easily take you down. The enemy isn’t competent as they will investigate dead bodies of their comrades if seen. After a minute of searching they will give up looking for you and casually walk over their fellow soldier’s body-as if nothing happened. It does take out the immersion of the game when that happens.Another thing that is greatly improved in Elite 3 is the graphics. From beautiful sandy dunes to lush forest, the game highlights the beautiful environment in its African setting. Rocks and sand is finely detailed with cracks and rough edges, the trees and plants are bright and really pop out-especially looking at it through the rifle scope.There are multiplayer modes that pit players against each other or play co-operatively. Many of these modes aren’t too fun as you’ll be spending most of the time hiding and staring through the rifle scope looking for your friend as they will be doing the exact same thing.Players will be annoyed at how short the game is. It took me only three hours to complete the single player portion of the game. The dull multiplayer modes extended my experience by a few hours. Overall, it doesn’t have too much replay value. It is released on all consoles except the Wii U and priced at $49.99. You are better off waiting for this game to drop in price before taking aim to get it.			"

												worst horribly ""cliche'd"" and completely uninteresting characters ever seen in any game.  i felt more remorse killing the forsworn in skyrim than i cared when 1 main character buddy dies.  as everybody else says, you hardly ever have a chance to use your rifle and are sneaking around stabbing people or shooting them with a silenced pistol 80% of the game.  the few times you get a chance to snipe, you notice (especially with the garand) that the physics are horribly scaled (which was obviously to make up for small map size), but the farthest i ever remember being able to shoot was like 220 meters, and with that the bullet dropped like 4 feet, it would hardly drop an inch in real life at 300 meters.  nowhere close to as good as sniper elite v2, which i got for free, so i feel like i should have been paid to play through this game.  it was so bad.

												Review: 4/10Although I had some fun playing this game in campaign mode, I don't really know if I could recommend it due to one BIG concern: the game is not ready. - Bugs here and there. Fall through walls, opponents getting stuck (either where they walk or in other opponents), strange things and actions in the game can happen when loading a savegame...- Kind of a stupid AI. Your opponents will oftentimes behave strangely and unrealistic. For example, when someone sees a guy shot to death, he gets suspicious and looks around. Then, when he's not seeing you, he will just keep walking about thinking this is nothing to worry about. Can't say that's very realistic. - The soundmasking of shots is not very consistent. A broken generator with its noise can act as soundmasking but other things which in real life could mask gun shots will not act as the same in the game.- The shooting/aiming had some problems too.- Some ""obstacles"" which you in real life just could climb over, walk over, or crawl under, is in the game unclimbable/unwalkable/uncrawlable. Instead you need to walk around etc. In short I would say that this is a game with a lot of potential and great fun, but the fact that it is NOT ready yet spoils it. Really hate it when I buy a game and discover that the developer didn't care of making the game ready before releasing it.If you would like to play a better sniper game I would recommend Sniper Ghost Warrior 2.

												The game is very good with an added marksman level.Graphics and webcam kills are excellent.On the minus side of things .Hit markers are not all ways in correct place.Have problems shooting through grass or over a wall at times,  whilst crouched despite having object in view .A.I. can shoot through solid objects you hiding behined  at times.8 maps The game appears short and ends abruptly as it did in 2nd game.The longevity of the game is as usual finding objects and added  sniper nest kills.Having said the above....I got to say I  like. ITS   SNIPER ELITE AFTER ALL !!!!			"

												I love this game, obviously since I am always playing a match. :)  The maps are challenging especially in the Deathmatch lobbies.  The enemies are everywhere and there aren't indicators when they are killed or when they shoot.  If you are just starting to play the game find a few friends that have played for a while and do a co-op.  When you co-op with an expert you will be able to rank up faster and find all your weapon parts.  Until you find them all you are at a disadvantage in the multiplayer matches.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is at about the same level of quality as the previous game V2. It makes some improvements to the series like the much more open level design and a bigger focus on stealth but with those positives comes new negatives like mediocre ai, unrefined stealth mechanics, uninspired mission objectives and sometimes uninspired and uninteresting level design. It lacks the focus that V2 had because it is nowhere near as linear which can be seen as both a good thing and bad thing because you control the pacing and how those unscripted moments will play out. The story is worthless and not worth bringing any of your attention to just like V2, I also might have liked the game more if the protagonist actually had a personality. I feel like the game struggles with balancing out the difficulty as well, some of the enemy placements in the levels creates some awkward and frustrating difficulty spikes which forced me to quick save frequently which I’m very glad that they added, I think the developers knew the game just wouldn’t work very well without the ability to save whenever you want. The sniping is still well done and that’s the games saving grace in the end. 6/10 (Decent)			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is a worthy successor of Sniper Elite V2. It has a lot of fun stealth/sniping elements, and the hit boxes works well. The x-ray bullet time cam when you snipe someone never gets old. Graphics are decent and the game doesn't feel TOO much console damaged, although things like the weapon and gear selection clearly was designed with console in mind, along with how you move around the map.The AI is as stupid as ANY sneak/sniping game. ""Oh my friend died! ALERT!!!"" 2 minutes later... ""Probably nothing, let's go back to patrolling.""I very much enjoyed being able to pickup and hide bodies and being able to mask your shots by using other noises to snipe silently, without a silencer.Overall, this is one of the better sniping games out there. If you enjoy stealth and sniping, give this one a chance.			"

Posted: July 7, 2014
TL;DR - A frustratingly short game, aimed to make players pick up DLC in order to utilise uninteresting and repetitive mechanics. Don't buy at full price, or even half price.Let me start this by saying I'm a huge fan of Sniper Elite V2, and especially the Nazi Zombies series, and this game has not changed my perspective of those games. I really did want to enjoy this game - however, I cannot recommend people buy this game, especially at full price. I preordered (foolishly) and even though I received a discount by doing so, I still feel like I did not get my monies worth.As many new parts as there are to this game, I feel like it is still an incredibly short game. I cannot remember how many levels there are, but I am sure that there are no more than 10. And while these levels are expansive, the game itself feels so incredibly short. It feels like Rebellion tried to cram in as many little collectable things which don't matter at all - war diaries, playing cards, sniper nests. Collecting these seems tedious to me, and I have 0 interest in going back and replaying to collect them all.I really enjoy the levelling up system - who doesn't want to see themselves progress in front of their eyes? However, the updgrades and benefits seem miniscule and like they have little impact; I notice barely any difference in the muzzle, scope and trigger I use on my rifle. I still feel like the main way to play this game is to go tactically with a silenced Welrod, which takes away from the whole idea behind this game - lining up a shot and reaping the rewards with a gory, detailed cross-section killcam. And even the killcam feels dull - Rebellion claimed to have made them more detailed and realistic, but it doesn't come across that way at all to me - skulls still break apart in the same way, and there is 0 surface wounds. Why show all the destruction behind the scenes (so to speak) if I can't see it when I get close to the body?Still unsmart AI and game mechanics to do with stealth means that while levels may be huge, you are still pretty much forced to do things in x-way instead of having lots of options to complete a level. You can stamp and smash up a generator, which in turn creates noise when damage, but the AI pay no attention to this. Drop down from a ledge a little too far? Imagine trying to sneak up creaky stairs without waking up your parents, but instead of human parents you have bats for parents. And a further frustrating thing - as long as you stand beside a generator when you fire, you can kill anyone across the map and as long as noone sees the dead body, it'll be like it never happened. The audio system and gameplay mechanics seem totally unconnected.The mutiplayer seems like a further uninteresting aspect of the game. I believe that Sniper Elite should be built around the single player (and co-op) experience. It feels like a lot of actual good content was sacrificed to make way for the multiplayer. Especially when a lot of DLC is available on release - I understand companies need to make money, but it makes me as a customer feel undervalued and unappreciated.If this game is on sale at around £15, I would perhaps say pick up the game (or even more ideally, during a free weekend. You'd be more than able to complete the game in that time). But at 10.5 hours played (I completed this by the end of release weekend without any large amount of dedicated time spent playing), do not buy this full price. Without wishing to step on the toes of previous and earlier reviews, Rebellion seems to have adopted the Call of Duty/Battlefield strategy of draining as much cash out of the players through DLC, while drawing people in with superficial, repetitive ""new"" & ""improved"" features.

												anyone with a intel HD 5500 graphics with an i-7 core this is the review for you.anyone wanting a good-decent review on the game this is the review for youIntel graphic details below, scrol past for my review on the game if you wantSniper Elite 3 is plable on a intel HD 5500 graphics with an i-7 core as the settings I had the game set to are below> Texture Detail - MED> Shadow Detail - LOW> Anisotropic Filtering - OFF> Supersampling - OFF> Anti-alasing - OFF> Draw Distance - LOWwith these setting I got an average of 25-30 FPS 40 FPS top sometimes 50 in some areas of the gameSniper Elite 3 was an interesting game to play not as challenging as Sniper Elite V2 with all its colectables but still a bit challenging for an enjoying gaming experince. it is a fun game, annoyingly it oddly crashes at times so I had to verify my game files now and again to play it again.X-ray kill games are a lot better and improved so much more from Sniper Elite V2. more open area to snipe from is good but shooting one then moving away then going back to the same spot makes the game a bit to easy and easy to beat in a way. the challenges are good and make the game rather more enjoying to play as you try take on the challenges set for you. being able to customise your Sniper in Sniper Elite 3 is a great unlike in sniper elite V2 you couldn't. one decent thing about Sniper Elite 3 is that it wants you to take it seriously. Bushes will provide extra cover, loud noises will cover your shots, dark areas provide extra concealment, and enemies react to nearby sounds to determine your location. It tries to be realistic but some of the features make it so unrealistic that theres no point trying to go with being stealthly or trying to hide from the enemy at first I was trying to do stealth and take them out all quitely until I relised I can just kill them all off loud run off somewhere and they wouldn't care no more so thats a bit of a let down on the game but if you're new to sniper elite and never played it before then you're welcome to try it out for your self and see what you think.me well I'm gonna recommend this game for any intel graphics HD 5500 gamers that are looking for a good-decend game to play and for any sniper elite fans then my recommendation is a bit of a toss up as I really enjoyed sniper elite V2 and 3 but found sniper elite 3 fell a bit short on what it could of been like. I hope this review is useful to anyone reading this and its helped their thoughts on thinking about getting the game or not.			"

												I had really high co-op hopes for this game. The asymmetric modes sounded fun and being able to play through the whole campaign with a buddy really sold me on it.Unfortunately, the best feature of the game is basically not present in co-op -- the x-ray cam. I totally understand that some people would get annoyed if the game was slowing down all the time for shots. But isn't that why there's the ability to adjust the frequency in single player? Removing the option entirely from multiplayer is extremely disappointing. I want to be able to compete with my buddy to see who can make the craziest shots.Maybe it's just my disappointment but the game feels like a pretty big letdown without this feature. I won't be purchasing any additional Sniper Elite titles if this isn't included.			"

												Remember there was a time that it was fun to shoot hordes of Nazis in shooter games ? Well, either that time has passed or I got too old for it and shot way too many Nazis to get bored of it. Eventhough I picked it on a sale for dirt cheap, this game barely deserves the price. It has nice visuals and the infamous bullet cam but that's pretty much it. Desert is a nice touch but it has near to no change than the previous game so yeah, I'd say spend your money elsewhere. It's very repetitive and you do the same thing in every mission. It has many historical inaccuracies but I guess that's why it's a game. So yeah, then again if you do love to shoot around random dudes to spend time, I guess it'd be up to your street. These though are my opinions. If I have to rate this I guess I'd give it a 4-5/10.

												Although I have only just started I am already considering putting it down. People are saying the sniping is fun and realistic. Perhaps I was playing on the wrong mode but for me I found sniping far far to easy and stealth/combat very cumbersome.This game forces you into stealth which I am all for but must be done in a way that feels fluid. Sniper Elite series needs to take a look at Splinter Cell Black List style and how Sam moves silently and elgantly.This is surely a game I will forget fast.			"

												I'm sorry this had to fall under my category of ""nope"". But this game doesn't live up to my expectations. The graphic isn't something to get excited about, the gameplay is really, really linear. Explosions are boring, how did they even do that? And the worst thing of them all is the sound, the sound is laggy and awful, you can literally hear the bits swooshing past while in slow motion following a killing bullet. So, recap: ""nope"".			"

												I bought this from the 2015 Chrismas steam sale in hopes of continuing the fun sniping adventures of SE 2. This game is so horribly optimized I don't know why anyone would buy it. At well above the specs I cannot get more than 30 FPS which is an EXTEME problem. I am running games that require higher settings than this, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?			"

												The headshot, nutshot, lungshot and everyshot has returned to us in Sniper elite 3. Now Good things about the new game more coop gameplay with friends more heads popping and of course slowmo kill cams.Although in this installment Bullet cams have been reduced drastically its still a fair game.ok to be fair the good and the bad scenarios...The good:        Still has working coop.No connection issues.Ran great on a average computer.The kill cams are improved *slightly*Fun assortment of weapons.The bad: Ragdolls falling into the world. *Didn't happen all very much in my playthrough but was enough to notice.*A sad thing I missed the Killcams in slow mo on every kill. *To some it might seem monotinous but thats one of the reasons we play these sniper elite games.* The price tag, for a 40 dollar game you would expect atleast a 6 to 10 hour campaign for what we pay.  We got pretty much 5 hours exactly out of a coop campaign with taking a few minutes to get up grab a drink use the restroom and mess around searching for some secrets and the optional missions.All in all this review may not help alot of people but the facts are if you love the series such as myself and my coop  partner then you would enjoy this game. There is a lvl 50 cap which we only hit lvl 10 / 11 so there is replayability for sure to get those stats up and unlocks.Final rating would be 7/10			"

												What i like about Sniper 3 is you are free to take your time and really plan taking down a large group of enemiea undetected. No time limits means you can behave like a real sniper and lie in wait for ages until the time to shoot the kill arrives for you with no constraints telling you to hurry up like a ticking clock but this is present in a very minor part of the game for specific mission(s). What i don't like is although they have improved the X-ray kill cams with better muscle and bone fragmentations they have taken out one or two kill hit zones that were in the previous Sniper Elite V2 game - for example in Sniper V2 if you were accurate enough you could shoot and dismember the fingers of an enemy soldier whilst he was unaware of your prescence and smoking a ciggy, yawning or drinking from something....even coughing - as long as his hands were raised to that zone pretty much there was a chance of this happening which was a very satisfying thing to achieve in my opinion.......BRING IT BACK (in an update hopefully) AND I'LL GIVE A FULL STAR RATING TO THIS GAME.

												Okay, where to start?!First: this game is OKAY is fine!The grafics are nice, the enemies quite smart and the weapon physics are great!There will be some tense firefights and ""hide and seek moments"", too. Unfortunately that's it...And I did expect a lot more!! I expected a great story and a lot more of variation in this game (tubular  levels!!). Getting to blow up a tank was the most relieving moment after 11 hours of gaming and sniping down nazis one by one until the way is clear. Especially I missed some kind of tutorial, which teaches you how to aim under the influence of wind and long-range shots. Also there are few weapons which you can really use (Only one silenced pistol?!? Sam Fisher wouldn't be proud!) and the modifications and gadgets are kind of useless (Why use flint and stone or a rock to lure enemies only to crash around after this while shooting, when you can blow them up with a ""coincidentally standing around"" can of explosives or fuel?!).The lesson is clear: 45,99 € is waaaay too much for this game...Wait for a sale (got it for 9,19 €) and keep your expectations low! PS: Sadly there is no ""Meh-button""!!Update I: There really are no changes in gameplay: Shoot, run, shoot, hide, oh a tank: Shoot, boom, hide, ...Also the gore isn't as mind blowing and controversial as the trailer promised,...The kill cam is quite funny and a bit disturbing (Shoot the nazis in the nuts, yeah!), but there are no exit wounds and it's kind of dumb that there is a x-ray kill cam, but when you blow up someone there isn't any dismemberment.Update II: I finished the game…after 16 hours…and I did play on ""Elite""...Good, that I didn’t pay the full price!The end was quite disappointing, too. Very loveless and sudden. Killing Vahlen wasn’t really satisfying, because he was not really presented as evil and a danger to yourself (actually, what is the name of the character??! Either he has no name or I don’t remember it! Last one is the most likely possibility!!). So all in all. All in all my conclusion is definite: An empty shell of a game!! Much Ado About Nothing! All bark but no bite.  "

												I expected something much more open world than what I found. There is a path to follow. Also expected to sniper the enemies, as the name suggests, but there is not enough ammo to do that, so you have to either kill with noise or really approach them. The reasons why I bought the game are not in the game. I will go back to Far Cry 4, that is open world and has much more sniper possibilities than Sniper Elite III.			"

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!youve been warned.This game has MANY glitches and graphical errors. I have a very good computer able to handle most games on ultra.This game alone has crashed more than all my other games combined... i have alot.If you DO get this game, Do not look at it as the sequel to the previous game because the ""Optional stealth"" is a load of bullocks and the game actually penalizes you for NOT playing the way it wants you to.Yes the bullet ballistics are gorgeous, but on Ultra graphics it glitches and ends up crashing the game.""Visually stunning detail"" Nope. None of that. Just basic copy and pasted landscapes. Oh and not to forget invisible walls, EVERYWHERE.Im not saying this game sucks, it doesnt. It just is worth $50. NOT BY A ""LONG SHOT"" haha oh did i mention the ""long shots""? no?Long shots are supposed to be a collectible, but instead they are actual people you have to shoot in order to get the achievment. Its actually pretty cool, IF IT WASNT SO ♥♥♥♥ING HARD. Now bullet ballistics are supposed to engage whenever you hit a vital organ. Ive barely gotten any ballistics and i ALWAYS hit a vital organ (Chest shots usually hit an organ in your chest and will kill you).Lets not forget those amazing explosions. Oh you wanna light one wil your flint and steel? go ahead! Wanna shoot it with any gun? Go ahead!! wanna throw a gernade at it and have double the explosion? ♥♥♥♥ YOU LOGIC!!! This usually ends up either crashing your game or doesnt work. One last thing: If you buy this game, Dont set the difficulty past marksman. This will glitch most of the enemies and make them near impossible to kill. Oh and have fun... if thats even possible <3			"

												Welcome to the DLC bandwagon.What's improved, compared to SE v2:- better graphics- opened environments, larger maps (in campaign and in coop/mp)- some stealth mechanics: foliage, suppressed weaponry, sound masking, etc- weapon & character customization (based on unlocks and finding weapon parts in campaign mode)- ""improved"" x-ray (some body organs added)CONS:- buggish/glitched bullet cam- feels like a console port- lazy 3rd person FOV- content lackluster: few weapons, few attachments, few maps- dumb AI: no actual improvements, even on highest difficulties, where AI is barely challenging (aimbot enabled)The story is a lackluster, a generic mixup, just as in the previous Sniper Elite games, nothing interesting.-----Overall, this is SE3 in a nutshell, an unfinished and unoptimized game, that is looking to overly ""entertain"" the playing community with:- day 1 DLCs that should have been integrated/released for all, but was instead a preorder gimmick- sequential DLC programme: season pass shenanigans-----The devs didn't learn anything from their previous releases. The PR marketing & hype is still strong, but the game content and season pass temptation aren't enough to save the downfall of the series.Do not buy this game if:- you want to experience content-drips (over a period of time, via DLCs)- you hate overpriced skins & weapons			"

												HUD and Customization had improved, but gameplay was disappointing and slow-paced.Almost every additional mechanic that its prequel didn't have, only contributes to making gameplay generally more obnoxious.I rarely had any opportunity to relax after a well completed mission.It's just a mess from start to end.Although someone who has not played Sniper Elite V2 may not have such an immediate opinion, but as its predecessor was a great favourite of mine I feel this game is simply an insult.I can't be completely unfair with it though. Lot of work was put into this game and the overall design of the game is quite well done. While it compliments the WW2 genre, putting ""Sniper"" in the title is in my eyes just a foul violation.3/10 "

												Let me start by saying that I played and loved the first two Sniper Elite games, they gave me the sniping experience no other games could deliver at the time. Sniper Elite 3 has better graphics, customizable loadouts, and fancy new maps, but it fails to improve upon the gameplay experience. What I mean by that is enemies can see you behind cover, the third-person controls feel a bit clunky, and in some situations (like in mission 5) enemies will not render until you get to where the game wants you to be. These problems can be very frustrating, especially in a stealth based sniping game. The game is still fun as long as you play it ""the right way"", it just seems a bit linear to me.			"

												Have you played and enjoyed Sniper Elite 1 and 2? Then you won't enjoy this one.Pro:  Multiplayer Coop Missions make the game fairly fun because you can rant with a friend about the bugs and horrible logic.Contra:  Very very basic AI logic. Like a Splinter Cell game from 2005. Also some enemy sees you behind wall bugs.  Re-location is also very basic logic. Make hell of noise, kill 17 people, then go 30m aways from that, wait 10 seconds, and enemies forget anything happened.  No multiple ways to achieve goals. Only larger corridors how to get there.  Audio design is a horribly disfigured ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ baby of good audio design. (I can hear an enemy 300m away loud and clear, so I always have to sneak because I assume he's in 20m range.  Masked shots are realistic for a 4 year old child. If a small generator makes noise in a 10m radius near me, I can kill enemies 300m away without any AI hearing the shot. Is even more noticable in MP because if other player sits amongst the enemies, the shot can be clearly heard like in real life. A sniper rifle is way louder than a generator 300m away. What the hell?  Map border killzones with no warning, just getting damage until dead. Very very poor.I could list some more, instead I just give you the conclusion:This game looks and feels as if it was made by an Indie developer that bought some high quality assets(models, image effects, etc.) and threw some scripts in there. The focus is on graphics.Fun factor: 1/10, 4/10 when in multiplayer.Replayability value: None.Price/performance: Very very bad.Realism: 1/10Frustration: 9/10			"

												A huge improvement over 2, 3 gives you big levels to actual stealth around and snipe in. Stealth mechanics have been really improved with the relocation mechanic, which allows you to use hit and run tactics to avoid detection. It still does have its problems though, sometimes it feels like a killshot is whenever the game feels like it if you're not aiming for the head, the game doesn't autosave so you need to keep track of that, and enemies sometimes spot you when they shouldn't. It's a still fun game though and definitely worth picking it up on sale.			"

												I've played a bunch of sniper games, and this is probably the first one where I've really felt like I was a sniper. If you're careful, you can sit in a nest for 10 or 20 minutes just picking guys off. Everything has been improved over the previous game. The graphics and x-rays got a boost, of course, but also the stealth system is much, much better, the maps are wide open with multiple approaches, no more magical trigger-spawned enemies, new progression system, rifle customization... the list goes on and on. Probably the only downside is the limited number of missions available, but they play so differently each time you'll want to repeat them. Definitely a must have for any fan of shooting stuff or stealth action games.			"

												Aaah, Sniper Elite 3, the game I wanted since I played Sniper Elite 2 and Zombie Army. Had it on my wishlist for +/- 6 months or so, but waited and got it now in the summer sale !GeneralI'm not even halfway the game and I like it more than Sniper Elite 2. Sniper Elite 3 is located in Afrika and it has more features; the levels are way more bigger and you really need to plan and execute it carefully. Observing, planning and executing is they key in every. single. level. These 3 things doesn't matter in which difficulty you're playing. You need these 3 things in every difficulty level. The revamped and (new) features are also great !FeaturesThe details are absolutely stunning, and as I said the new features are also. You can customize your rifle, and choose/edit loadouts before playing a level. The returning x-ray kill camera is what I love the most; the new thing about this is the x-ray camera for vehicles - watch the bullet crashing into the engine and see how it explodes - You can also edit how you wanna use the x-ray camera in the settings (or if you don't like the x-ray you even can disable it). There's also a new radial menu where you see your equipement and select it if you need it. Furthermore, and i like this feature too, is when you get spotted you should prelocate to a new position to continue the execute part - and that's what the game says when you get spot, which is ... nice and realistic. And next to all this you can level up your rank to unlock more weapons/equipment. There are way more features, but that's up to you if you wanna see them or not ;)The only negative note I have to add is ... If the game is located in afrika, then why are there all germans in the game. I mean it's okay but eh ? ConclusionIf you like using a sniper, play games with a great story, apply your tactic skill or if you just wanna blow people's head off with a bullet camera then get this game.It's simple amazing ...I do not have any DLC and I didn't played co-op/multiplayer (yet) "

												Tried this game during the free weekend and all I can say is that I got bored 30mins into it. The game poses the character as a sniper but majority of the time, you're sneaking around killing AI patrols or shooting objects (ie gas tanks on trucks). If i wanted to play that type of game, it would've been Hitman. There are also invisible walls every where that seem like you're able to vault them but can't. The controlls could use a lotdevelopment. When running, the camera doesn't really follow the character and on occasion, it felt like i was circling a building. The inventory wheel (Q button) I felt had a lot of issues as selecting a gun from a landmine glitches. Game also has 0 re-playability as the game is short and you're pretty much Hitman with a sniper			"

												Well, I'm conflicted about this one. I do like it, the mehanics are better than v2. Graphics are better but only the outside skins (bullet cam and skellies are TERRIBLE). I don't WANT to give it thumbs down but I have to. This is nothing more than a money grabbing project. This game is just too expensive with all these DLC's (and probably the incoming ones too). Rebellion is really a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ company and this is probably the last time I bought their game. I don't expect everyone to share my opinion but please, try to use your critical thinking here.

												I do enjoy the gameplay, it can be fun and somewhat of a challenge (depending on the difficulty setting).  The one big thing that turned me off, however, is the lack of content included in the vanilla game. I've never seen a shooting game with so few guns.  It turns me off, big time when I see all of this DLC for sale so shortly after release day.  The campaign is short, and only 2 horde style maps, and they both look and play the same.  There are positives, for sure: the game looks pretty good, and the x-ray cam can really give some good screen shots.One other negative, that has gotten better due to a patch or two is/was the unpredictable aiming when you are close to a window or ledge.  Bullets woulld not hit the target even though the crosshair is spot on.  Overall, I can not recommend this game at it's current price; once it drops below $20 I could honestly say that I would change my  recommendation			"

												Actually, Sniper Elite 3 is a very satisfying sniper game with big open levels and adequate stealth system, All sniper rifles (with DLCs there are 10 or more of them) have different characteristics to suit any type of player + they can be customized in terms of scope (including the scope pattern), grip, muzzle, etc.  There is no more stupid ""strawberry jam"" regeneration, there are medkits now. There are many optional objectives to complete (e.g. locate a visiting general and assassinate him) while completing the main misison. All of this makes the game highly replayable. In other words, it's a big leap from the V2 in terms of gameplay and the game can boast good optimisation. I highly recommend playing it on higher difficulty levels (Sniper Elite and higher) with most of the HUD turned off to have your skills challenged.  The only problem is that Season Pass is really required to get the biggest kick from the game. It covers all the released DLCs, though - 4 mission packs (Hunt the Grey Wolf + 3 Save Churchill missions), 5 weapon packs (tons of all kinds of weapons that make choosing your pre-mission loadout really interesting). MP is good too, but I'm more of the single-player guy, so I can't adequately review it. I could have given SE 3 the score of 9/10, but for the greediness of devs who sold cut content, I can rate it only 7.5/10. In terms of gameplay it is absolutely great, so try to get the game and the season pass when there will be a good discount (e.g. Steam Summer Sale). It will be definitely worth your money. P.S. At the moment of posting the review I've completed 3 levels in 8 hours. I really took my time and enjoyed the hell out of them. There are many more to beat and I'm going to utilize the same approach for the rest of the game. P.P.S. African deserts are beautiful at night.			"

												This is without doubt the worst game i have ever played in my life.The name is misleading for starters. First word, sniper, is very incorrect as you constantly get penalised for using the sniper rifles. Most levels only have two or three areas where noise covers the rifles sound (some levels only have one though, like the kill hitler mission) an these locations are only good for one of two kills before you have to move on. Also to me sniper kind of implies long range kills, like shooting someone several hundred meters away. However my longest kill is around 200 meters which isnt really very far at all. Second word, elite, once again suggests that were in control of a highly skilled soldier. However i seemed to have to play as a soldier who cant run for more than a few meters, seems to have some illness that makes his arms shake/body twitch, and has difficulty shooting a hostile soldier at 10m. How this guy got sniper training is beond me, I guess he found a sniper rifle early in the war and no-one thought to question him having it. The mass inaccuracy of the sidearms is just mind boggling, and i cant believe anyone would be that inept at shooting, military or not.Gameplay wise the game plays like a crap version of metal gear solid. You sneak around a few african locations shooting people at close range with the silenced pistol, the only gun thats sort of usable for the most part of the game. The hostiles dont seem that bothered about you being there and dont seem that bothered about catching you. I dont speak german but im guessing most the germans go 'Oh look, that british sniper shot hans, but i cant see any snipers so i guess things are fine and we should go back to standing around.' The game doesnt even replace fallen guards or raise the alarm on discovery so hiding the bodes is a complete waste of time. When the german soldiers do actually find you, maybe you used your sniper rilfe, bad player your sniper rifle is just too look at, they either telepathically tell everyone where you are leading to the whole base looking for you for a few minutes before deciding you've probably gone home and go back to slacking off. Or they just stare at you for several seconds before raising the alarm, which brings a few soldiers over to have a quick look for you. Theres a few other things that really bring this game down and the bullet balistics and the kill cam mechanic doesnt really salvage this game. After the first level the game is basically sneak here, then sneak there, then sneak away. With really boring (assassinate the guy in a truck which can basically only be done with mines) or pointless side objectives (disable the spotlights, that you can only disable after sneaking past them) was the final nail in the coffin for me for me. Game has so many good ideas, but they're just awfully done.			"

												Remember all the fun time you had in Sniper Elite 2? Finding your way around ruined cities to find that sweet sniping spot?This game is nothing like that. Most of the time you're playing some sort of stealth commando game in small maps (and they're not even cities anymore, just sand and palm trees), trying to quietly get takedown kills or just shooting everyone with silenced pistol. Graphics and mechanics are straight from Sniper Elite 2, so nothing new in that area.This game can only provide you dissapointments, if especially if you're looking for a sniping game. I'm just glad that I got this free, bundled with my GPU.			"

												Sniper Elite III has the worst multiplayer I have ever been in. The graphics are beautiful and the maps are cool but, the gameplay consists on laying on yuour stomach trying to look around by panning the mouse to look over the top of your monitor  past whatever cover you're in so you dont get shot.  So basically theres a bunch of living people all laying on their balls for 45 minutes to an hour not doing a thing. Its basically an action packed ""lay down, and wait for someone to make the mistake of getting up"" to run so everyone can take turns shooting at them. Also then you respawn and since no one else has died you have to then run to find a new space to hide. Guess what you're probably gonna die trying to get there too. If you like games that simulates an outdoor nap where the punishment for waking up is death, then Sniper Elite III is for you! *Sleeping bag not included*			"

												The graphics in Sniper Elite 3 seem to be not as good as Sniper Elite v2. The camera & controls are nowhere near as good as SEv2.  The camera & controls are bad. Tried to adjust with settings & mouse & still not got it very good. The ""use cover"" is gone. It is almost as if it is automatic.  When you get close to a box  or wall when crouched it seems to automatically put you in cover but it feels like you are bouncing off each object. Annoying. The character movements are not smooth like SEv2. It feels like your character is darting around. There are some glitches like  A.I. dissapearing into steps , etc. There is a delay in shooting. When I press the trigger the gun does not fire rite away.  There are bugs that I hope are fixed with a patch, soon!  The terrible character & camera controls are making gameplay frustrating. I exited SE3 & started playing SEv2. ""Wow""! SEv2 camera & controls are soooo much better!			"

												Another entry in the Sniper Elite franchise. And boy, it's a great one.Story: The story might not feel very deep, but it works.Graphics: The graphics are absolutely fantastic. Look at the beautiful enviroments of North Africa. Definatively Scenery Porn (look it up on Tv tropes). The character models also look very good. Even on low settings it's impressive.Gameplay: The gameplay is in my opinion, improved a bit from V2. While regenerating health still exists, now it will only fill up to a certain point of your lifebar, anymore injuries than that will require bandages or medpacks to heal. The shooting still works very nice. One flaw though is that they removed the cover system from V2 (press Q), but so far it hasn't been affecting me that much. The A.I shows some improvement from V2, they will now react more to suspicious stuff, like gunfire and dead bodies. If you kill a soldier, they will start searching for you, and will find you eventually unless you relocate. You can also occasionally find weapon parts or upgrades for your weapons which can be used to modify your weapons.Music: The music is, like V2, epic and well made. You can even occasionally hear songs from V2 on the radios in some missions.Overall, Sniper Elite 3 is worth the money. If you liked V2, you will enjoy 3 as well.Also for the last, it has trading cards, and the X-Ray killcams are just absolutely AWESOME (shooting an enemy in some parts of the head will even DESTROY parts of the cranium).9/10.

												The graphics in Sniper Elite 3 seem to be not as good as Sniper Elite v2. The camera & controls are nowhere near as good as SEv2.  The camera & controls are bad. Tried to adjust with settings & mouse & still not got it very good. The ""use cover"" is gone. It is almost as if it is automatic.  When you get close to a box  or wall when crouched it seems to automatically put you in cover but it feels like you are bouncing off each object. Annoying. The character movements are not smooth like SEv2. It feels like your character is darting around. There are some glitches like  A.I. dissapearing into steps , etc. There is a delay in shooting. When I press the trigger the gun does not fire rite away.  There are bugs that I hope are fixed with a patch, soon!  The terrible character & camera controls are making gameplay frustrating. I exited SE3 & started playing SEv2. ""Wow""! SEv2 camera & controls are soooo much better!			"

												There's not a lot different between this and Sniper Elite 2, aside from graphical enhancements, and being set in the desert rather in Europe.The problem here is variety. No matter how good the game strives to be, there's always a point where it's just more of the same. Unfortunately SE3 is mining the same vein as SE2 was. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game, I'd say it's a good game, and I recommend it, even at full price, but if you found SE3 tedious after a while, the same is likely to happen with this one.			"

												A qualified recommendation.  This game felt like a shorter, less interesting revamp of Sniper Elite V2.  Which is weird because Steam says I played 26 hours in SE3 and only 16.8 in SE2.  Maybe it's because I spent so much time in Sniper Elite 3 sneaking around and plinking with my silenced pistol instead of doing what the game is named after.I suppose that's on me.  A lot of the levels suggest a stealthy approach but it's not really necessary.  The AI is pretty bad, so you're expected to kill a few soldiers, move positions, and the survivors will forget you were ever there.  Even if they march across the corpses of their buddies while on patrol.This game takes place in northern Africa so the levels are mostly wide open deserts and generally not that interesting.  I was surprised when the game ended because it wasn't a big spectacular finish, just another dull mission.			"

												For me, personally:PRO:-Good looking game. Textures are off in some places but that's not a huge deal.-It can get very brutal in a high difficulty.-They learned after SE:v2 and improved a lot of things.-Weapons and how you can have a tailored to you variety. (mostly)-I wouldn't say it's a long game, but it's not really short either. Nice middle ground.-A lot of the time, movements are predictable - but there has been the odd time where I have been caught out and seen.-I have came across only 1 bug - ONE - which was easily resolved by restarting the level. This can be a con, but to me it's not.-Cinematics are short and sweet, but can be skipped anyway.CON:-Sound and sound masking seem to still be quite off and unrealistic.-Night missions; enemies can see like it's day, but for someone like me that uses low contrast for ambiance can't see them.-Although I said weapons can be tailored, it's still a choice between this, that or the other. You can't be a run and gun person effeciently.-I feel the scope and the aim helper are off sometimes. The helper said I had a hit, I shoot, and the bullet flies above or past them. (Note: I had this very few times. This could be just a mechanic to not make it a faceroll? No idea)-Killed a guard, someone found the body. That someone just looks around, shrugs their shoulders and carries on patrol. No alarms or searching the area or at least gave the corpse a cup of tea. Nope, like nothing happened.-You get seen or heard from a shot and get chased to where you were last. Relocate, get an all clear and everyone just goes back to normal... again like nothing happened. This universe plays devilish tricks, I tell ye.That's all I can think of for now. Do I think the price tag is worth the game? drop the price to £29.99 and then yes, it would be VERY worth the money I would think.TL;DR: IMO, a very good game, but has it's offsets by AI and sound masking.

												Sniper Elite 3 stays true to what you would expect: find a good spot, wait for perfect timing and shoot. Also remember to muffle your shots, relocate and stay low. The game is packed with lots of action, good cutscenes, bullet time, regular customization and the hardest difficulty it's really a challenge. Although the story may be a bit short, the missions keep you interested on what's going to happen and the maps look good. The game it's totally worth it if you up to play in co-op mode.			"

												Heyyo,So I just beat the campaign to Sniper Elite 3 (played on Sniper Elite difficulty) and it was pretty good! The sniper gameplay is much like Sniper Elite V2 with a fresh coat of paint... and wow is it a lovely coat of paint. The graphics are phenomenal and the game runs so damn good too! They really brought the Afrika Korps to life in this game. You'll see beautifully rendered Panzer III and IV tanks, including the British Matilda... there's also the Tiger I Tank that looks badass.The sound effects are the next improvement... wow I love the sounds of the guns in this game. The MP 40 especially. The way it sounds when it fires or reloads is fantastic! I also love that creepy sound the game makes when enemy snipers are trying to get a bead on you or when enemies go into combat mode... kinda reminds me of 70's horror movie sound effects when the killer is sneaking up on you... freaks me right out heh.I guess I can talk about the sniper gunplay next since it's the main part of the game heh... well? It's handled quite nicely and the x-ray mode is improved over the second game in the series... but it's odd, sometimes the bullet cam gets confused and flies at full speed instead of slowing down or fails to recognize a double kill (can happen if enemies are too close together) but the rest of it works great. The controls are just about perfect... I say just about as I wish it had a button to toggle what shoulder you're looking over. it's annoying when trying to come around some corners if you're not hugging said corner to try and force the camera to pan shoulders...The campaign is actually quite the nice length as it took me 16.2 hours to beat so I feel it's actually a really nice length to it. The environments are varied and they don't feel the same which is nice since of course the gameplay options are a bit limited.. snipe, run away and return and snipe seems to work the best. It does feel like a bit of a gameplay flaw that enemies can't figure out where you are if you quickly run away and return to the same spot while they're in caution mode (yellow compass warning)... because if I ran away and came back in real life? They'd still figure out I'm in the same spot kind-of thing.Which leads me into AI... they're decent in this game but they give up WAYYY too easily. I mean... I just sniped two of your comrades! They're dead near you!!! What do you mean you're already returning to normal patrol? Aren't you worried that you're probably next? Hahaha.... So sometimes when I feel like a challenge? I'd place anti-personel mines at the bottom of stairs or ladders leading to me and set up... and then they never charge me. Instead they just keep tossing grenades at me... so that sucked. I'd recommend to other players doing the singleplayer to just set up traps in front and below where you want to snipe in positions you figure where the enemies will try and toss grenades from. I've also had AI run off bridges to their deaths and also run into fire from a left over explosion and get themselves killed haha... so yeah, AI isn't the best in this game and if I did a future playthrough I'd definitely do the hardest difficulty.So? 16.2 hours for the singleplayer campaign and I got it on a weekend sale. I'd definitely recommend it on those sales for the singleplayer. Tbh I don't really see myself doing multiplayer as I'm not the best at sniping haha so I'll keep my multiplayer gameplay to the likes of World of Tanks. So? If you enjoy			"

												I pre-purchsed Sniper Elite 3 as I had already bought Sniper Elite 2 + all the DLC's for SE2 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the entire package. I'd gone through the campaign several times, mostly at Marksman level (my personal favourite - I enjoy lining the diamond up for a shot), but also at Sniper Elite, mostly for the achievement. Sniper Elite 2, after hundreds of hours playing time is still a game I like to 'dip back into'; play a particular level in a different way, setting myself a particular challenge or go for an obscure achievement, or just play for the extra points and pure pleasure of the graphics and settings. This cannot be said for all campaign WWII shooters, some can get very predictable and can only be played in a certain way which you will realise after only a couple of plays through, so I'm really pleased to be in the Sniper Elite camp. Sniper Elite 3 proved to be even more superior in all aspects than SE2. Once again, hundreds of hours into the game and I am still looking forward to playing each mission over and over again. Still finding areas of the maps I havent explored, and after maybe 5 times through I can honestly say each time has been a completely different experience. The only thing that will hold you back as you sneak through the North African settings will be your own imaginative methods and skills. The cam-kills never get dull for me, and being able to retain stealth while I systematically silence and destroy airfields/factory's/gun emplacements etc is truly satisfying. One (constructive) criticism is the subdued enemy response to my attacks. While it really is real fun to creep through missions sniping with sound cover or silently downing enemies as I tag and find them, sometimes it seems the realism is lost as after a short period of 'alertness', comrades of the dead just seem to resign themselves to the fact that the garrison (or whatever it is) they are stationed at is slowly but surely being annihilated. There is no heightened sense of alarm. It is possible to hide bodies, which is an amazing feature, but what with the enemy not seeming to care too much, after a minute or so, that another of their comrades has been found dead, there wasn't a great deal of incentive to use it for me. I won't comment on the MP as I haven't played it enough to appreciate it, but definitely from what I have played its all thumbs up from me. Atmospheric, tense and immersive, and definitely a game you will go back to over and over again. More Sniper Elite (4?) please : -)			"

												if you like stealth gameplay and sniping its a good game, sure its got some bugs (bullet hits the wall in front of you instead of where your crosshairs are aimmed) even though I mastered Sniper elite V2, this took some getting used to. The best improvement is the enemy reaction to bullets (one shot they go into cover and are unsure of your location). You can fire from one location and then move, the enemy wont know what hit them			"

												If you own Sniper Elite 2, offcourse you will like Sniper Elite 3 it looks allot better, the maps are bigger and more open.Kill cams have been modified to be even more awsome, For sure a game I would recommend it's allot of fun trying to be sneaky and picking off people with stealth sniper shots.So the animations, graphics and gameplay most certainly is good.However the price for the game is outrages and then the price for the dlc's is also outrages considering you don't get much content from them.My tip get the game as 20-30 euro that would be a fair price and don't buy any dlc and wait for sales, maybe then its more fair. But this is certainly a game you must own at a some point.			"

												This game is fun overall. I love to do co-op campaign with my bf, but everytime we fail and have to restart at a certain checkpoint the same bug appears. This bug has been going on for a couple of years from what I can tell, and it's frustrating. It says that ""your partner has left the game. you have returned to the lobby."" even though no one has left? So we have to restart the mission ALL THE WAY from the beginning. This has happened on numerous maps, not just a single one and we have been playing it on sniper elite difficulty. Unless this bug gets fixed, my review will stay the same. If it gets fixed, then this will be positive.			"

												Pros+ Visually pleasing+ Good UI+ Decent if forgettable voice-work and sound design+ Satisfying sniping mechanics on higher difficulty settingCons- Levels filled with invisible walls- AI is very stupid- Repetative gameplayAt the end of the day, this is not a terrible game. However, the sniper based play is at odds with the stealth. The result is AI that hears booming shots, sees their friends go down, and yet makes no real effort to find the shooter or otherwise respond in any reasonable way.The game feels very dated, and aside from its visuals, it really belongs to 2004 more than 2014. I guess it could be a decent enough distraction if you're really lost for something to play, but there are just way better games out there for the same money. "

												The thing I like most about this game is how it's improved since V2. The controls all feel very familiar,  that is to say there's nothing too different about the layout of what-does-what and it's responsive on top of it, even though I still find it a little annoying that you have to take cover behind a crotch-high wall before you can vault over it instead of.. well, -just- vaulting over it. Or perhaps I'm just doing it wrong.You can definitely see that a lot of the effort has gone into the the gory, slow-mo shots where you can see, in close and loving detail, a bullet drill right the way through a poor sod's head, splattering brains, blood and bone everywhere. The only nit-pick I have with it though [honestly, I don't mean to sound like a grim and creepy fellow with this] is that after watching my bullet bore it's way through a man's face and exit with what appears like it should have left a wound the size of a grapefruit, there appears to be little damage to the individual. I've clearly surgically removed several unfortunate blokes' faces with a conservative amount of bullets but when I trot on over to the corpse, those eyes I've taken great care to get rid of are still there. No halves of skull missing or gaping craters where you would assume there'd be a considerable exit wound; kind of makes the gorey, attention to detail of the anatomy side of things feel a little bit half-arsed. But I'll overlook that as it probably is a rather large amount of work to do.Despite this, the game is great fun. Skulking around in the shadows, being able to plan a method of attack from any and all directions instead of the usual, linear path a game can normally give you. Shadows even affect how concealed you are and there are even some lanterns that can be shot to cast a bit more shadow at that; a feature I though V2 desperately needed. The whole relocation mechanic is great as well; forcing you to stay on your toes and not get too comfy in one spot. It adds a bit more of a pace to the game and add a tad more realism to the experience in that a sniper can only take so many shots from the same location, even though realistically a sniper can wait in one spot for days defacating in their pants for even just one good shot.But in all; I do have a couple of huge gripes with this game:We'll start with the length of the game; eight levels stardard just isn't enough for a full price, hyped up title like this. If you know what you're doing you can fly through those levels in less than a day and it's never a good sign when your players get the the end and sigh saying ""Is that all?"". Also, not including DLC [which I'll get to], four rifles, maching guns and pistols. Really? This game is called -Sniper Elite- and there's only four rifles? What annoys me even more is that the protagonist clearly has a Kar98 on his back in the box art and not only is it not in the game; it's not even DLC. So to even have a nice veriety of guns and even have just more than one thing to do in the survival mode and multiplayer modes you -have- to buy the DLC that came out on day one with the game [and others, now that there's another out I believe]. Why not just include it in the full game? That seems a bit money-grubby to me and like Rebellion has done the fans a bit of a disservice there just make a bit of extra pocket money.However despite the length of the game and the seemingly greedy intentions of having a very limited arsenal included, it's a very solid and very fun game. Definitely worth a go. But to be fair; I wish I didn't spend as much as I did on it for the amount of game I actually got on purchase. A 3.5/5 from me- Matt			"

												For me, personally:PRO:-Good looking game. Textures are off in some places but that's not a huge deal.-It can get very brutal in a high difficulty.-They learned after SE:v2 and improved a lot of things.-Weapons and how you can have a tailored to you variety. (mostly)-I wouldn't say it's a long game, but it's not really short either. Nice middle ground.-A lot of the time, movements are predictable - but there has been the odd time where I have been caught out and seen.-I have came across only 1 bug - ONE - which was easily resolved by restarting the level. This can be a con, but to me it's not.-Cinematics are short and sweet, but can be skipped anyway.CON:-Sound and sound masking seem to still be quite off and unrealistic.-Night missions; enemies can see like it's day, but for someone like me that uses low contrast for ambiance can't see them.-Although I said weapons can be tailored, it's still a choice between this, that or the other. You can't be a run and gun person effeciently.-I feel the scope and the aim helper are off sometimes. The helper said I had a hit, I shoot, and the bullet flies above or past them. (Note: I had this very few times. This could be just a mechanic to not make it a faceroll? No idea)-Killed a guard, someone found the body. That someone just looks around, shrugs their shoulders and carries on patrol. No alarms or searching the area or at least gave the corpse a cup of tea. Nope, like nothing happened.-You get seen or heard from a shot and get chased to where you were last. Relocate, get an all clear and everyone just goes back to normal... again like nothing happened. This universe plays devilish tricks, I tell ye.That's all I can think of for now. Do I think the price tag is worth the game? drop the price to £29.99 and then yes, it would be VERY worth the money I would think.TL;DR: IMO, a very good game, but has it's offsets by AI and sound masking.

												Another entry in the Sniper Elite franchise. And boy, it's a great one.Story: The story might not feel very deep, but it works.Graphics: The graphics are absolutely fantastic. Look at the beautiful enviroments of North Africa. Definatively Scenery Porn (look it up on Tv tropes). The character models also look very good. Even on low settings it's impressive.Gameplay: The gameplay is in my opinion, improved a bit from V2. While regenerating health still exists, now it will only fill up to a certain point of your lifebar, anymore injuries than that will require bandages or medpacks to heal. The shooting still works very nice. One flaw though is that they removed the cover system from V2 (press Q), but so far it hasn't been affecting me that much. The A.I shows some improvement from V2, they will now react more to suspicious stuff, like gunfire and dead bodies. If you kill a soldier, they will start searching for you, and will find you eventually unless you relocate. You can also occasionally find weapon parts or upgrades for your weapons which can be used to modify your weapons.Music: The music is, like V2, epic and well made. You can even occasionally hear songs from V2 on the radios in some missions.Overall, Sniper Elite 3 is worth the money. If you liked V2, you will enjoy 3 as well.Also for the last, it has trading cards, and the X-Ray killcams are just absolutely AWESOME (shooting an enemy in some parts of the head will even DESTROY parts of the cranium).9/10.

												Every mission feels the same, with a different skin, all the missions are easy, and the multiplayer is dead,  co-op is a joke because even playing with a friend it feels unco-operative, when you go your seperate routes, or if you decide to do the objectives together, you're always arguing who got the kill, and stupid tuff like that, sniper ghost warrior is 10x better imo, and that's not saying much considering it sucks too, the spray is just terrible on the smgs and pistols, the weapon custimization makes absolutely no sense, because wrapping your stock somehow adds damage, in competitve multiplayer I unloaded a full smg clip into my friend and he 1 shots me in the leg with a sniper, all in all this game is great if you like repetative tasks, and like games where you play once and don't think ""that was fun I'm going to play the story again"", this reveiw is going to be negative probably and have some stupid comments, which I will most likely ignore, so will most other people, so save yourself some time and just dislike and move on, write your own review, oh ya and to top it all off, it has the jenkiest keyboard controls, I know they are changeable but who would even suggest that at the studio, like ""lets make z use, c to crouch and prone, and f for equipment"" it should be ctrl crouch, z laydown, f use, e secondary equipment.Edit; I was crouching away from my last known location, and I got spotted through a bunch of foliage I couldn't even see through, during a night mission			"

												Sniper elite 3 is definetly better than its predecessor. HUge improvements. This game is definetly 1 of my favorite stealth games.The challenge scales brilliantly now. I played it on hard and found it just so much better. You can focus on going 100% stealth now, without those ""must fight"" situations..You have bonus objectives that in conjunction with the improved stealth mechanics and difficulty scaling, makes the game not only more interesting but bigger, fuller. In all seriousness this game might not have ""dishonored"" story or characters, but it definetly has better stealth and reason to map explore.1 of my favorite points of this game in comparison with other stealth games, are the kills and how enjoyable they are. Reminds of ""Tenchu"". It will make you want to scour the map just for extra kills. The stealth and gadget system is vastly improved and you will have to use everysingle 1 of them eventually. They also added more rpg elements and extra things like shooting range to the game. Havent tried multiplayer, but what i can tell you, is that, as a single player experience this is possibly 1 of the best stealth games out there.I recommend it, not only to stealth fans, but to shooting game fans and eventhough its not a classic fps, it offers what most do with extra uniqueness. Waiting for the game! "

												A real fun game, best played on the authentic setting where the AI enemy start puts up a real challage and you get no help in aiming. The kill cam which activates when you do a skill shot, just makes the experience all the more sweeter.			"

												Played during the free weekend.  It ran like crap, I enjoyed the visuals of bullets smashing internal organs for the first few kills, then I realized Metal Gear Solid V did EVERYTHING better in every concievable way.  Im talkin' voice acting, im talkin' plot (seriously), im talkin' about sniping dynamics....Once I realized it, I quit, and played MGSV for a few hours.  Hats off to the Sniper team for offering the free weekend though, what a great way to get a feel for a game before you buy it without demos!			"

												this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the close combat mechanics need some serious improvement. the guy is a wimp and is scared for gunfire, meaning tha when you want him to jumb out, there is a delay in firing causing you to get hit first. Grenades also bounce off invisible walls and dont follow the path of the throw line. you cannot shoot directly down but the NPC's can shoot without limitation, recoil and superb accuracy compared to the players guns.Movement is also annoying because the player carries on moving when you dont want them to and using mounted machine guns in a rush will just get you killed because of the small gab to show the key to use whch is the same to jump over a ledge.you cannot climb over rocks or up banks.summarry is that if you want a realistic battle/sniper game, keep lookingthe only good thing i like about this game is the scenary.I actually enjoyed writing this review more than playing the game itself.

												God this game kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥ not played many hours, but whenever i get time to play anything im on this! even finish work early to come shoot some people! the kill cams still here looking even sexier! and with a dlc you get to shoot hitler in the face!! plays great, not nopticed anything cxlumsy/buggy, looks amazing! i mean, its really gorgeous! i even got an acheivement /charlies challenge' for getting a testicle shot from 100m ^.^ it went through one guys balls and hit an officer in the face! DOUBLE KILL! and i got to watch the whole thing x-ray kill cam mode! :D HOW ♥♥♥♥ING COOL!but seriously, its a very polished and refined game, theres multi players pvp, tdm etc, and can even co-op the entire campaign if you wanted too, using a friend as a spotter using binoculars while the sniper picks them off, sabotaging machines to cover rifle fire, or if your into stealth you could probably go through the most game without firing a single shot, and in every mission, which the maps are massive btw!, theres a tonne of intell and goodies to pick up along the way, which really makes missions really replayable time and time again, to complete every aspect of each environment!"" and they even have a levelling perk intune with the game too, as you llv you get new guns, for different play styles so theres something for everyone!!this games a must have! realy is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant! aint bought a game this good in soo long! they dont make em like this anymore!!

												Let's get first things first: Sniper Elite 3 is not a realistic sniping game. It's a third person shooter with stealth elements. The plot is as follows: Nazis have secret weapon and America Man needs to destroy it.Most of the marketing focuses around ""celebrated rifle ballistics"" which is really stretching the things on offer. The series is already over 10 years old and when it was new, this might have been true. What you have here is a sniping system that has many elements: Sights wobble, bullets drop and are effected by the wind. Also the player needs to hold breath to focus the shots. Wind is the only thing that is not also present in most of modern shooters so it's not that special. It takes a bit of skill and luck to hit enemies while timing shots with sounds of passing planes etc. It's a nice spice to the standard gameplay but with the level design and mission objectives that Sniper Elite has, it is in no way realistic.While there are many elements to the sniping, some key things are missing. Most notable is penetration. Bullets won't pass even through wooden fences! Kills at 20 meters are much more common than they should be and a ""long distance"" kill is awarded at over some 170 meters. This doesn't feel realistic at all.Maps are fairly large and kind of open. A single map might have 3 objectives, which are all in their own areas such as a depot or a village. In these areas it's possible to move about quite freely, but the areas are divided from each other by canyons and other tight corridors. So it's not open world but a series of open ""arenas"". Often the map design feels really forced and make no real-world sense. This also ensures that you'll never have more than about 300 meters of space from end to end. For a shooter it's ok, but for a sniping game it's not.Sniper Elite 3 puts a lot of emphasis on sneaking and it is possible to sneak for really long parts of the levels, silently taking out guards, dragging bodies, luring with noise, setting traps etc. Usually things go badly at some point and after that it's just your regular shooter. Even on the hardest (custom) difficulty, the player can take a load of bullets with ease and the game doesn't punish for going guns blazing. No mission failures, no overwhelming enemies, nothing. Maybe some of the achievements are lost but that's it. This is by far the biggest weakness because there is no need to stay silent. It really doesn't matter if you get caught and some 30 infantry are alerted. It's too easy and also faster to kill them the loud way. Hardest difficulty on offer (authentic) removes saving and sounds like tedium the game. As it's hardly suitable for co-op, this review is based on custom difficulty with hardest AI and ballistic realism. Enemy AI is seriously flawed in that they don't coordinate with eachother in any way. They will spot corpses and hear gunshots etc. but they work as individuals. Also they will forget strange sounds and such almost immediately and never raise a base-wide alarm. Relocation system is a key selling point in Sniper Elite 3 but it's kind of silly. If spotted a radius of 50 meters appears around the last known location of the player. Run out of that area and your relocation is instantly succesful and enemies no longer no where you are. If you for example get spotted in a bunker with a 50 meter long corridor with and exits, just run to the other end and you are hidden againMost of the levels end in a showdown against a tank which of course appears without infantry support and must be destroyed with conveniently available mines or rocket launchers. This is always a mission objective and you can't sneak away from the area. In some missions the player takes spot in a sniper nest and covers someones exit. These kinds of missions usually end with over a 100 kills. And of course maps are littered with red barrels and canisters that explode from a single bullet. Sniper Elite 3 clearly is just a standard third person shooter. As a standard shooter Sniper Elite 3 is actually ok. Main campaing can be played in co-op and it's forgettable but fun. In co-op the main campaing can be completed in less than 7 hours. Season pass adds some more, but overall the game is really short. It is possible to coordinate with a parther but its not necessary. There are unscriped moments where best action is to eliminate two guards with simultaneous shooting and setting those up feels great. After that it's usually just shooty-shooty but as such it gets the job done. I would not recommend Sniper Elite 3 for someone who seeks realistic gameplay. Neither would i recommend it for full price. It's ok for mindless co-op shooting when it's on sale. The emphasis is on the mindless, since there is nothing special to see here. It brings nothing new to the genre and is mostly as generic as possible.			"

This game overall has a lack of everything. the only thing that brought this game to spotlight (and the whole series actually) is the satisfying bullet cams. I dont even think that this game is even worth $10 let alone the full price of $50.			"

												First of all, the game is great fun. There are enough detailed reviews of that. But it wasnt very enjoyable for me. My System includes an i7 6700k and a gtx 1080 and i had a huge amount of crashes and performance problems. The performance is just horrible. I played early access and ubisoft games with a better perfomance. In the 6 hours i played ths game so far i had easily 30 crashes at random occasions. It crashed when i loaded the game, quicksaved, when there was alot going on on the screen, when there was nothing going on and i just watched at the horizon, i had stuttering while steam and afterburner showed me 250 fps and then it crashed, vsync didnt help, changing all the other graphicsettings didnt help. I tried every ""fix"" that i could find. Even the error messages werent consistent. It saddens me because i really loved the first and the second entry to the series and also that i payed money for that game. It really sucks but this is probably the last rebellion game i will ever buy and i cant recommend this game to anyone. Only if you buy it over steam ( unlike me ) you can try it and get a refund in case you got the same problems. I had the first crash like 10 minutes into the first mission fyi. Thanks for reading and good luck.			"

												Singleplayer: Taking into account that this is a game about sneaking and sniping, I still find it pretty boring. It's basically a prettier Sniper Elite II, with a hint of gun customization. Multiplayer: It is the antithesis of Call of Duty. Depending on who you ask (me), even if you dislike run-and-gun shooters on some level, this doesn't actually make this game any more appealing.But it does have good bullet physics and killcams, and - let's face it - this is probably why you're even thinking about buying this in the first place.6/10. Even if you're interested in it now while it's at full price, I'd advise you to wait till it's $15. Because IMHO, that's what it's worth.			"

												As much as I enjoyed playing Sniper Elite V2, I cannot say that I had a good time playing Sniper Elite III. It looks very unfinished and the bugs that I ran into demolished my entire gameplay experience. The game itself looks really nice graphics wise, running on a GTX 770. The maps are much larger and open than in its predecessor but you still have to struggle with the annoying spawn mechanics, whereas you can take a look at an obvious spot for an enemy sniper (like a tower) and spot nobody. And while you approach it BOOM there he is, spawned out of nowhere as you are getting closer. The shooting distances are often very short and the game feels more like a close-quarter hide-and-seek game for kids.I should have saved the 40€ I paid when it was on pre-order. A real disappointment.			"

												I've got my money's worth from this game. This is something I made sure of especially as I originally had purchased a copy from a vender that was not steam, and therefore was deemed ""stolen"" by Rebellion and revoked. But I won't turn this review into a rant about that, I paid my £40 and have played Sniper Elite 3 now for about 40 odd hours. I've completed the game on Sniper Elite mode. I've completed it on Authentic mode. I've collected all the collectables. Completed all the bonus objectives. I've completed the DLC and obtained all the achievements from that. I've got (at the time of writing) 54/61 achievements for SE3 and I'm almost at the point of a perfect game. Once there I think I won't bother with this game again. You see, I was a massive, MASSIVE sniper elite and sniper elite v2 fan. I also loved the v2 zombie nazi DLC/standalone's too (although truth be told I haven't yet finished both). I was really looking forward to SE3. I had been following its progression for a while and tried not to get too excited because I didn't want to spoil the joy of release day. When its release day finally came around (and all the BS of getting an actual copy aside) the initial 10 minutes of the game were brilliant! It looked great, colours were vibrant and lush. The sound was crisp and map design was classic. I went through the tutorial really enjoying what I was doing, sniping through bino's, melee kills, finding collectables etc.Then when I moved onto the next mission I started noticing issues almost immediately. Invisible barriers blocking shots, AI shooting through walls at me, AI spotting from waaaay over the other side of the map, BULLETPROOF grass and bushes, AI that suddenly spawned in areas you had previously cleared, extremely slow trigger response on SMG's and sniper rifles, falling through the map when proning near walls, standard stuff that should have been found and fixed during development by Rebellions QA. These issues continued to plague my experience throughout the game. I should have stopped then and there and got a refund due to a grossly unfinished product, but I continued on because I really wanted to enjoy it being a massive fan of the franchise. I eventually committed too much time that stopping would have annoyed me just as much as all the issues and bugs I was experiencing, so I just decided to grin and bear it and try to 100% the game and then ""put i on the shelf"" and never think about it again. I don't really know if Rebellion will ever really fix all the problems this game currently has because there are so many. I work for a major games publisher and know that when we've released a title in the past, and it's had a bunch of issues with it, we've had to decide what we can and can't address because there's always time and budget attached to it. Unless this game explodes in popularity and makes Rebellion a mint, I can't see them spending loads of time and money fixing it now. So, as far as a recommendation goes; I cannot recommend this game in its current state unfortunately.			"

												3rd person war shooter. World War II shooter with gory x-ray bullet penetration kill cam, that will get boring after couple hours playing. Game reminds me of good old Call of Duty 1 and 2. There's not much to tell otherwise, you play as US soldier who is sent on missions against Nazi forces and their allies in Africa, to kill, destroy, gather Intel, etc. Game has some variation of WWll weaponry available, many types of explosives. Visually game looks good, yet nothing special. It's fun 10 hour campaign that you can play with your friend in co-op mode.			"

It has nice graphics I just set it to ""Ultra"", good sound, the long shots are great. But that 3rd person thing annoys me. If you don't mind 3rd person I say grab it! I will try it again when I don't have anything else to do.I can't imagine why anyone would make a shooter game 3rd person? I don't care what the character looks like! I just want to play. :)			"

												A qualified recommendation.  This game felt like a shorter, less interesting revamp of Sniper Elite V2.  Which is weird because Steam says I played 26 hours in SE3 and only 16.8 in SE2.  Maybe it's because I spent so much time in Sniper Elite 3 sneaking around and plinking with my silenced pistol instead of doing what the game is named after.I suppose that's on me.  A lot of the levels suggest a stealthy approach but it's not really necessary.  The AI is pretty bad, so you're expected to kill a few soldiers, move positions, and the survivors will forget you were ever there.  Even if they march across the corpses of their buddies while on patrol.This game takes place in northern Africa so the levels are mostly wide open deserts and generally not that interesting.  I was surprised when the game ended because it wasn't a big spectacular finish, just another dull mission.			"

												This is just v2 agian. Little in addition and now cover is gone. well its just like crouching behind walls instead of really getting behind something. Level designs are nice, but so many places you cant go and once again its linear, I love sniper elite i bought into even the zombie redos. Yet this is just to much of the same, the enemy ai seems stupid, they will be facing someother way then they see you even from a ridiculos distance. If he was facing my way i say ok but they dont really work together and the map is setup by loading an area once you cross a line and if you went back for something and happen to blow a truck up they will notice even though they wont notice the dead guys 2 feet from them. I bought it I will play it, but there is exp but its just a grnd to level 10 to get your 4th sniper rifle, its everything you were used to but more money, i havnt tried coop but it maybe the only save and grace, but i dont want to shell out another 50 cause i payed 40. All in all Im disappointed yet this is what i Have come to expect form game companies now adays. same game, same price, nothing new, and features taken away. Side note look at all the dlc, WTF you think the game might come with content, but apparetnly you need to buy a game piece by piece.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is a third person tactical shooter developed by Rebellion Developments and published by 505 Games. This game was released on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One in June 2014. It is a prequel to Sniper Elite V2 and the third game in the sniper series. The gameplay in Sniper 3 is based heavily on being slow and steady with your approach to completing objectives, with an also strong focus on sniper gun play much like the previous games. What I really liked about Sniper 3 is that the stealthy approach is pretty much the only viable way to go on most missions otherwise you'll just be pinned down in a firefight and outnumbered. The stealth aspect of the game is done extremely well, you probably will be detected by the enemies whilst taking down the guards, but it is all about cleaning up after yourself by dragging bodies to the long grass, or how you escape and hide away until the enemies give up searching for you. You can use various methods to distract enemies such as throwing rocks and laying traps. Before each level you get to choose your load out, you get the choice of a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, side arm, and various other items such as grenades, medi-packs and traps. As you level up between stages you also unlock further rewards and items. Of course, a Sniper game wouldn't be complete without the stunning slow motion graphics of your bullet soaring through the air and them piercing through your foes scrotum, this my friends is the pinnacle of slow motion gaming. Granted after a while you'll be skipping them because they will grow tiresome as they play after every kill with your sniper, but still, this gives you a chance to get some brilliant cinematic screenshots to show off your sniping skills. Graphically, Sniper Elite 3 is gorgeous, I wasn't able to push out full graphic settings on 4k resolution, but even on the lower resolutions (1080p), it still looks stunning. There is a wide array of setting to choose from which is always good to see. The visuals are amazing though, the night time levels really show of the games truly stunning lighting effects as well. I was a little disappointed to see the lens flare effect being used a bit too much, but everything else is truly stellar. The game is fully voice acted, with the enemy soldiers speaking in German too, so subtitles are recommended for that. The sound effects really add an extra level of immersion to the gameplay. A nice feature which is added is that you can disguise your bullet shots underneath the sound of loud sounds in game too, which really helps you in your efforts to complete levels as stealthy as possible. I have to admit, this game is quite difficult, even on the easiest settings; you really do need to take each level with a sense of slow and steady. There is really no point in running in all guns blazing because you will just get gunned down within seconds of being spotted. You will need to backtrack plenty of times in order to escape being detected, you'll be needing to hide in rooms, crawl under buildings, anything which you can imagine you doing in the situation you are in, you can do. The latter levels of the game also ramp up the difficulty significantly as well, as each level slowly introduces more and more enemies for you to deal with. Each level in Sniper Elite 3 is massive. Each level will have its own main objective, but as you progress and reach new areas of the zone, you'll also unlock optional objectives, which can be things such as destroying some trucks, cutting off communication or something searching for secret plans. These optional objectives reward you with additional experience at the end of the level and also add an extra element of immersion to the game as well. The size of each level really means that you can get stuck in, and explore to your hearts content. There are countless amounts of collectable items for you to find if that is your thing too. Each of the games objectives, whether it be main or optional, will have more than one way of you being able to complete them, which will really add some replay ability to the game on your second run through. I was a little let down by the fact that I finished the game's single player in about five hours, granted I was playing on the easiest difficulty, but for a big release like this, I was expecting something more to be honest. I can see there being an essence of replay ability due to the nature of the levels being able to be completed in more ways than one, but I would say that there is no real need for playing through the game more than twice at least. There is a multiplayer side to the game, which I tried out, but it seems to be a little on the low side of players, and struggled to actually get into any proper gameplay, because given that it is a sniper based game, most people are camping in well-hidden places just picking people off when they try and complete objectives, for me I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer. Technically, I had a one major problem with Sniper Elite 3, and that was that the game kept crashing on launching the title, it would reach the title screen, but then just crash to desktop. This actually turned out to be an issue with Malwarebytes closing it, so it would be highly recommended that you add the Sniper Elite 3 folder into the exception settings for Malwarebytes if you run that AV. Granted that it wasn't actually Sniper Elite causing the crash, you would still expect the game to have been tested with various popular AVs like this to see if they caused any compatibility problems. My conclusion of Sniper Elite 3 would be that I would only recommend the game as a single player title; because the multiplayer just didn't do it for me. Given that the single player side of the game can be completed in almost five hours, the full price tag of £39, 99 is absolutely absurd, and is actually fairly offensive that they can charge that amount of money for such little content. I would only say this game is worth picking up when it is below the £10 mark, yes the gameplay is top class, and the graphics are stunning, but you can pick up any of the other Sniper games for the same experience in both of those departments for cheaper. Actually saying that, it looks like all of the games in this series are expensive. Definitely wait for sale season to start before adding Sniper Elite 3 to your library.			"

												If you own Sniper Elite 2, offcourse you will like Sniper Elite 3 it looks allot better, the maps are bigger and more open.Kill cams have been modified to be even more awsome, For sure a game I would recommend it's allot of fun trying to be sneaky and picking off people with stealth sniper shots.So the animations, graphics and gameplay most certainly is good.However the price for the game is outrages and then the price for the dlc's is also outrages considering you don't get much content from them.My tip get the game as 20-30 euro that would be a fair price and don't buy any dlc and wait for sales, maybe then its more fair. But this is certainly a game you must own at a some point.			"

												The thing I like most about this game is how it's improved since V2. The controls all feel very familiar,  that is to say there's nothing too different about the layout of what-does-what and it's responsive on top of it, even though I still find it a little annoying that you have to take cover behind a crotch-high wall before you can vault over it instead of.. well, -just- vaulting over it. Or perhaps I'm just doing it wrong.You can definitely see that a lot of the effort has gone into the the gory, slow-mo shots where you can see, in close and loving detail, a bullet drill right the way through a poor sod's head, splattering brains, blood and bone everywhere. The only nit-pick I have with it though [honestly, I don't mean to sound like a grim and creepy fellow with this] is that after watching my bullet bore it's way through a man's face and exit with what appears like it should have left a wound the size of a grapefruit, there appears to be little damage to the individual. I've clearly surgically removed several unfortunate blokes' faces with a conservative amount of bullets but when I trot on over to the corpse, those eyes I've taken great care to get rid of are still there. No halves of skull missing or gaping craters where you would assume there'd be a considerable exit wound; kind of makes the gorey, attention to detail of the anatomy side of things feel a little bit half-arsed. But I'll overlook that as it probably is a rather large amount of work to do.Despite this, the game is great fun. Skulking around in the shadows, being able to plan a method of attack from any and all directions instead of the usual, linear path a game can normally give you. Shadows even affect how concealed you are and there are even some lanterns that can be shot to cast a bit more shadow at that; a feature I though V2 desperately needed. The whole relocation mechanic is great as well; forcing you to stay on your toes and not get too comfy in one spot. It adds a bit more of a pace to the game and add a tad more realism to the experience in that a sniper can only take so many shots from the same location, even though realistically a sniper can wait in one spot for days defacating in their pants for even just one good shot.But in all; I do have a couple of huge gripes with this game:We'll start with the length of the game; eight levels stardard just isn't enough for a full price, hyped up title like this. If you know what you're doing you can fly through those levels in less than a day and it's never a good sign when your players get the the end and sigh saying ""Is that all?"". Also, not including DLC [which I'll get to], four rifles, maching guns and pistols. Really? This game is called -Sniper Elite- and there's only four rifles? What annoys me even more is that the protagonist clearly has a Kar98 on his back in the box art and not only is it not in the game; it's not even DLC. So to even have a nice veriety of guns and even have just more than one thing to do in the survival mode and multiplayer modes you -have- to buy the DLC that came out on day one with the game [and others, now that there's another out I believe]. Why not just include it in the full game? That seems a bit money-grubby to me and like Rebellion has done the fans a bit of a disservice there just make a bit of extra pocket money.However despite the length of the game and the seemingly greedy intentions of having a very limited arsenal included, it's a very solid and very fun game. Definitely worth a go. But to be fair; I wish I didn't spend as much as I did on it for the amount of game I actually got on purchase. A 3.5/5 from me- Matt			"

I will try it again when I don't have anything else to do.I can't imagine why anyone would make a shooter game 3rd person? I don't care what the character looks like! I just want to play. :)			"

												This game is fun overall. I love to do co-op campaign with my bf, but everytime we fail and have to restart at a certain checkpoint the same bug appears. This bug has been going on for a couple of years from what I can tell, and it's frustrating. It says that ""your partner has left the game. you have returned to the lobby."" even though no one has left? So we have to restart the mission ALL THE WAY from the beginning. This has happened on numerous maps, not just a single one and we have been playing it on sniper elite difficulty. Unless this bug gets fixed, my review will stay the same. If it gets fixed, then this will be positive.			"

												Pros+ Visually pleasing+ Good UI+ Decent if forgettable voice-work and sound design+ Satisfying sniping mechanics on higher difficulty settingCons- Levels filled with invisible walls- AI is very stupid- Repetative gameplayAt the end of the day, this is not a terrible game. However, the sniper based play is at odds with the stealth. The result is AI that hears booming shots, sees their friends go down, and yet makes no real effort to find the shooter or otherwise respond in any reasonable way.The game feels very dated, and aside from its visuals, it really belongs to 2004 more than 2014. I guess it could be a decent enough distraction if you're really lost for something to play, but there are just way better games out there for the same money. "

												A qualified recommendation.  This game felt like a shorter, less interesting revamp of Sniper Elite V2.  Which is weird because Steam says I played 26 hours in SE3 and only 16.8 in SE2.  Maybe it's because I spent so much time in Sniper Elite 3 sneaking around and plinking with my silenced pistol instead of doing what the game is named after.I suppose that's on me.  A lot of the levels suggest a stealthy approach but it's not really necessary.  The AI is pretty bad, so you're expected to kill a few soldiers, move positions, and the survivors will forget you were ever there.  Even if they march across the corpses of their buddies while on patrol.This game takes place in northern Africa so the levels are mostly wide open deserts and generally not that interesting.  I was surprised when the game ended because it wasn't a big spectacular finish, just another dull mission.			"

												The AI in solo mode is terrible.  The bad guys either all have ESP and can hit you from the moment they arrive, or - in lower difficulty modes - they are cardboard targets that stand there and get shot by you.  I can't stand shooter games that have lazy collision modeling.  In other words, if I'm looking down my barrel and have an unobstructed view of my target I should not be bouncing bullets off of the window or ledge I'm looking over.  Also, there is no excuse for a ""sandbox"" environment that contains uncrossable non-obstacles.  If my guy can jump and climb up a ledge I should not be forced to walk around a 25 cm tall pile of flat steel sheets.  This is one of those games that is frustratingly almost good - but because it's so close it is inexcusable that it would have such glaring 1990's style limitations.			"

This is the last time I ever pay full price or pre-order anything ever again. Video Game makers have lost sight of what made them great and this is a perfect example. I would wait for this to go down to $10 and the DLC is less than a dollar each. So disappointed.			"

												I found this game to be seriously underwhelming. The maps have improved alot since V2 with most of the levels being ""open"" and expansive but you wil still feel like you get bottlenecked into some situations where there is only one option to progress in the game.On the lower difficulties the AI is as dumb as a bag of gravle and at most they will give you the challange of a cardboard cutout.Vehicles and tanks have the ability to spot you immediately when you exit your hideouts and to me it seems a tad wrong that a enclosed tincan of a tank can spot you faster than a sentry in one of the lookout towers. Slight spoiler ahead : ----------------At one point in the game i have to witness a conversation between three officers to progress along in the game.To trigger this event i had to climb a scaffold and spy on them from above,First time doing this i started climing down the ladder again to get a better vantage point but that resulted in the mission failing.I hate this kind of gamey logic where one wrong step can result in a failed state without any chance of redemtion.----------Personally i found the game to be way too short and it doesn't leave me with the desire to purchase DLC or even replay the game again.Although i give this game a hard time there is some fun to be had and it is a clear upgrade comparing to V2.If i hadn't bought this game i would wait for a sale unless you really really want to play around with thoes XRAY kill shots.

												I thought Rebellion would make improvements to 3, based on their experiences in developing 2. This doesn't appear to be the case, as the game is really rough around the edges, and FEELS hastily thrown together. I haven't seen any bug fixes for single player missions, just multiplayer or co-op play, and that feels kind of crappy. Pretty disappointed in this title, after looking forward to it for so long.My biggest gripes with SE3: Bodies and weapons that float a foot or so off the ground. Firing your rifle at a target and nothing happens. It LOOKS like the weapon fired, SOUNDS like it fired, but you've just shot a round of pixie dust, because you didn't hit anything.Double kills don't occur, no matter HOW perfectly you line up your shot. Long shot? How do you collect THAT?No matter HOW deeply you're in cover, tanks know where you are IMMEDIATELY after one shot, and strafe the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Loading screen hints go by so quickly you can't read the damned things.I saved a game, and the next time I opened it, my saved game wasn't there - instead, I found myself getting blown up immediately. Lost all my saved progress and had to start the level over. Enemy AI can apparently see you around corners, and through cover, and will immediately start firing at you, even though you can't see them.			"

What I liked: Great Sniping with wind and gravity Brutal X-ray kill cam Fun Stalker-like gameplay if played stealthWhat You Need to Know: Game improves on the stealth from Sniper 2 by giving us indicators on level of detection and makes it oveall just better Has more brutal x ray kill cam XD Allows rifle customization and loadout changes for each mission My biggest complaint was the checkpoints really hurt you with only 2 or 3 checkpoints in the whole game = not alot of fun Had multiple times where the ojbective wouldn't progress and had to restart Had one ojbective that makes you wait for like 3 minutes doing nothing waiting for when your allowed to kill himMy Score:CPrice: Played during free weekendMain reason for quitting: Broken objectives that don't register, and checkpoints that are too spaced outSniper V2 was just more fun and less broken even without the stealth improvements:			"

												I remember the time when Sniper Elite V2 was the game I had the most fun with in the series. . . Oh, wait, it still is the most fun in the series. To put it bluntly, Sniper Elite III does nothing to enhance the experience of the player, and falls way too short in what it tried to accomplish. Like, ""WOW"". I did not see it coming. The many reviews I've read that pointed out that it was  flawed, I didn't think it would be. But, uhh... no. The game sucks.It fails to entertain one with the storyline, the multiplayer, the overall gameplay ... Heck, let's call it Sniper Elite V2.5. I don't see anything new to it, except for the Afrika scenery, and the slightly improved graphics. Which is a tremendous shame.Again, I do like how they have improved the looks of it. The X-Ray shots are now more eye-opening, and the mechanics are more satisfying. But, that's about it. The game was all about the looks. And it only did okay over there. I feel it's an uncomfortable game to go through. It's just ... boring. And I'm NOT so easily bored with 1P-oriented games. So, in conclusion to this tiny review, no, I do not recommend this game. It's mediocre at best.			"

												Fantastic game, it did not fail to please, I bought this the first couple of days it came out and it was pretty glitchy...  but it should be good now... The levels are well done, they are big and well laid out... The story line is pretty good too, although it is a little cliche... 'a lone american saving the world one sniper shot at a time'.. There isn't much difference to Sniper V2 as far as physics and style... But well worth the money... The multiplayer is sensational, playing that with friends, we could be there for hours on end... i give the game 8/10 it loses two points because the game doesn't really offer anything new... except updated graphics and sound was a lot compared to V2...

												EDIT (22.07.2014): Raw mouse input is now available, but the game remains... kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Negative mouse acceleration, wonky alt+tab where it often bugs out, constantly throws you out when you want to tab back into the game, no option to go for windowed mode, very poor npc and character animations that don't really make it fun to follow an NPC with your scope... they just sometimes suddenly stop and turn around without a fluid animation, it is literally just 'teleporting' into different animations, if there is a transition between stances for npcs it's like 1 frame or non-existent.sometimes there's a delay to you clicking and your character actually firing, poorly responsive controls at best.multiplayer is an absolute mess, unplayable.No matter what mode it is, it is a pure camp fest, nonstop, all the time. You move around, you die; you camp in one spot, maybe switch spots after 2-3 kills, you win, no mechanics that give people an incentive to actually move, so can't blame the players. Can't wait for one person to comment ""well it is a sniper game, what do you expect?"" answer to that: fun gameplay that does not consist of waiting around for seeing a scope glint or seeing something move in the distance after looking out for 3 minutes, which is sometimes very painful to do... thanks to the weird graphical bugs going on with this title, i.e. shadows popping over and under foliage/trees, objects disappearing and fading back in, objects flickering in the distance etc... What else is there to say... ah, yes: If this game did not have cooperative campaign mode it would not be in my possession in the first place, that is literally the only saving grace for this title.however after this title I am convinced that I won't touch any game anymore that has Rebellion listed as a developer, unless they release like an absolute masterpiece which would actually have responsive and snappy controls.Campaign boils down to: shoot twice, move out of the area ""which they elegantly call RELOCATING"" and move back to the same spot when, for some reason, all the soldiers calmed down again. Rinse & repeat.Really dull game, no fun mechanics, shooting feels awkward and not satisfying either, thanks to the mouse control problems going on. Pretty funny paradox actually, you create a game where your aim, reaction time and positional prediction/knowing how fast your bullet travels is your skill, YET you fail to make the controls feel snappy and responsive, rather the opposite of that, which almost totally eliminates aim and reaction time... so yeah, not a good game. barely decent, and not even worth half the asking price imvho.p.s.: weapon sounds and secondary/tertiary weapon spread behaviour are copied & pasted from Sniper Elite V2, you might just as well go play that.TL;DR: No. The biggest fun you can have in this game is shooting some guy's balls off.

												""World War II Secret Agent Game""Let me start off by saying that ""Sniper"" should not even be in the title of this game. So little of what you do in this game is what a Sniper actually does, really frustrated me. I have yet to even complete the story of the game because to me it just felt so disconnected, boring and just plain BAD at times. What it really should be called is ""OSS Files"" or something of the sort, something that clues you in to be more of a Secret Agent who HAPPENS to be a really good marksman, not a US Army Sniper. I've been playing this series from the get go and time and time again I've been disappointed by it. Between the simple fact that a lot of the rifles in this game wouldn't have been used as Sniper Rifles, to the downright horrendous AI even on higher difficulties, leads me to finally write a sadly quite bad review for this game. Now. Let's dive into the Pro/Con.Pros:-Wide variety of tasty WWII-era, mostly authentic weaponry for your Nazi-killing pleasure.-Did I mention variety?-Bullet physics and the like are desperately refeshing in a gaming era dominated by CoD and Battlefield where legitmate ballistics are woefully lacking if existant at all.-The environment is very immersive and authentic, right down to the vehicles.Cons:-Remember that variety I mentioned? Yeah. You have to pay for a lot of it.-The AI ranges from laughably stupid to mind-numbingly difficult.-Remember those physics I was talking about? Yeah. They only work sometimes.-""Remote detonated TNT"" that you shoot to set off. (Don't even get me started with the physics of this one)-The lack of any GENUINE sniping got old after the first two or three hours.-No seriously. You BARELY snipe anyone in this game. 100-300 meters does not constitute sniping. I regularly make shots inside that distance with my Iron-sighted rifle at the gun range.-Did I mention stupid AI?-I could go on. No really. I could.Bottom line is, the game can be really, really enjoyable. It also can be the bane of your existance and WILL drive you absolutely insane with how bad some of the story can be. Honestly a very fun game, with sadly tons and tons of unrealized potential, that the game reminds me of every single time I boot it up.			"

												Not worth the asking price, relatively short game (8 missions?!) I expected twice as much or more.  Weapons customization is a neat feature but nothing spectacular to be honest, maps are VERY open which is a plus multiple ways to get round enemies hell you can go through missions without being seen or killing unless instructed too.  The ""bullet time"" effect is still there and worth watching when you put out a long range shot into someone's testicles.  AI is just as garbage as it was in previous versions wasn't improved on at all.  The stealth takedowns are pretty poor, a neck snap and a few knife stabs to throat.  It's not a improvement on v2 that's for sure, v2.5 if that.  I'd just wait till the price goes down till you buy it.			"

I want my money back, but I've played more then I can to get a refund.In short don't buy this game, unless you want to leave it half finished.I wont even go to AI because its really bad for the game I've paid this much.Avoid this developer if you can... and you can its your money :)			"

												Good idea, poor execution. Wish I could give this game a ""neutral"" score, no other game hits that ""average"" mark so perfectly for me.+ cool kill cams, too bad it's exactly the same thing as in previous releases+ setting choice, African front of WW2 is underused in games- linear, boring levels, for a stealth game way too linear, pretty much only 1 approach per each mission, no alternatives- AI can't ever find the player, doesn't detect when they should, detect when they shouldn't, sucks at combat- game feels too clear, too smooth, it really fails to create an atmosphere for itself- level design! it's so bad it should be mentioned twice to highlight it- bugs, invisible walls/poor hitboxes in a freaking sniping game? Yeah!- cringy main character with zero depth (also - same guy that voices the protagonist in Hatred, put me off it doesn't fit""- dated graphics; I can only run on medium to have decent FPS, but many games such as Far Cry and Battlefield I can run properly with far more graphical fidelity- sounds...for a gamea bout shooting guns they sound pretty mediocre, explosions are especially poorly doneSo no, don't buy it - thanks for free weekend so I was able to check it out and decide it's crap.Made me want to play Far Cry 3 again, to remind myself what a good stealth shooter game is!

												Welcome to Sniper Elite 3, or as it should be called Sniper Elite Early Access 3. This game is a step up from V2 in some ways, while in others it lacks greatly.

												If you liked the past sniper elite games, and you like seeing nazi's brains explode in slow motion. This game is for you. Cool physics and realistic sniping makes this game fun. Kill all the nazi's, but only on sale for 75% off.			"

												I LOVE THE GRAPHICS. Don't get me wrong when I say I don't recommend this game. It's just that it's not fun anymore when you see that much blood and gore in a headshot. Once, a dude's head literally exploded from one bullet I inserted into his skull. That's just too much for me. If you ask me, Sniper Elite V2 was a WHOLE lot better in toning down the gore. When you get a pristine headshot, the guy actually looks like a model in one of those medical books with the veins, bones, and everything! That not only crosses the line, but completely destroys it into the Uncanny Valley. It's SO deep in the Uncanny Valley, it would make the Kola Superdeep Borehole look like a pinhole.			"

												Okay so long story short, this game is ♥♥♥♥in amazing. Sure, some things are kind of funky, it is a third person controlled game afterall. But I'll get more into that.Started at 11:30pm. Joined a multiplayer match, not even having touched the gameplay before. Bro came into my room at 12:30pm and said ""dude its 12:30, go to bed"". It felt like 10 minutes. There wasn't even any voice chat going. Just the intensity and your heart racing in real life and in game as you line up a shot. You spawn. You creep your way to a window that is in a shadow, and you peer out carefully, pulling up your binoculars and scanning the landscape, focusing in on distant points as closer things become blurry because your eyes aren't focusing on it. Everything seems clear, so you climb out the window swiftly and go into a sprint to get to the next shadow. As you hit the side of the building, you are panting heavily, and your heart is racing at 93bmp, making it hard to hear your surroundings. As you catch your breath, you pull out your binoculars again and scan the landscape again. Out the corner of the circlular binoculars, you see a blimpse of movement. You quickly switch back to your scoped M1 Garand and focus in on the air. In the real world your heart is beating faster, and you're focusing more and more on that spot, waiting for your unsuspecting prey to poke their head out. Then you hear a gunshot and a split second later you are falling over, dead.In this time frame about 2 minutes have passed, and it was the most intense, realistically worrying experience you've felt ever playing a video game.Singleplayer is just a ton of fun, using broken generators and artillary barages and planes flying overhead in order to mask your sniper rifle's firing so that the German Afrika Corps soldiers don't realize you're there. Having to figure out the puzzle of who to shoot first and at what point on their patrol so that their buddies don't see the body but also masking the sound of your shot and firing from a position where you aren't visible to enemies. Setting up an ambush with Dynamite and blowing it up to cause mass confusion and win the section of that mission.Oh, I almost forgot, I spent 3 of these hours on the first mission ALONE. Let alone the countless others to come.A game has never made my heart race this hard, or keep me entralled in heart startling multiplayer.I give it a total of 9.5/10, because third person moving is a painnnnnn in the♥♥♥♥♥ I often find myself using my iron sights to walk through some spots because its like using first person controls			"

												I bought this as i love playing the role of the lone sniper, something i did successfully with Wolfenstein.What this game offers is a dedicated role as a sniper with varying degrees of realism with fantastic levels interesting missions and a good storylineIf you are into games where you have to think and setup your attacks and want an immersive and very challenging experience then i would recommend SE3 The game play is very rewarding and it has to be said downright frustrating at times depending on the level of realism you have selected the loadout (weapon selection & customisation) takes some setting up but once you have sorted that you can settle down and enjoy ! the setting up of a shot is very rewarding indeed waiting for the target then achieving the mission is all the stuff of latent schoolboy fantasies i thouroughly enjoyed this game im now gonna do SE V2 as i just love the whole silent killer very rewarding (years of playing Thief haha) . . . for a greater challenge there is the multiplayer which is again equal in its rewards and frustrations !!

												Sniper Elite 3 has provided several new aspects to the Sniper Elite trilogy, making it an excellent sequel, including features such as...- A new ""sandbox"" type  feel to the game that its predecessors had lacked. - A change of scenery from the typical WW2 shooters taking place in Europe and the Pacific.- A clever (yet primitive) relocation system after every shot.- An awesome class customization system.- Missions that can take up to 2 hours to complete if you attempt to do everything in the game you can.- The multiplayer is still very entertaining, but I would like to warn potential buyers that there are usually only around 13 servers capable of holding 12 players each in session.The Sniper Elite series i have come to enjoy greatly, and SE3 has and continues to provide me with numerous hours of enjoyment, however I simply CAN NOT RECOMMEND  Sniper Elite 3 simply because I am extremely disappointed that the game WAS RELEASED ALONGSIDE $25 WORTH OF DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT. Although the content is basically only aesthetic (in my opinion, the DLC weapons provide little change in gameplay) it still makes me furious. This is content that could have been included into standalone game! TL;DR - Sniper Elite 3 is an excellent sequel to Sniper Elite V2 and provides several new features that make the game more enjoyable than the last, HOWEVER I CAN NOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT simply to reflect my disappointment that the game was realeased with $25 worth of downloadable content. Beware that there are only roughly 100 people playing multiplayer at a time.			"

												How Rebellion can charge £40 for this is beyond me. The game is neither finished nor polished. I have experienced xray bullet cams simply not showing up, although the sound does play. Objects such as ammo caches being present but not visible (still usable though). Grey aiming indicator suggesting that there is an obstruction between me and my target when there clearly is not. Invisible walls. Clunky movement in 3rd person. Graphics dont load as quickly as they should when you change from looking at something far away to something much closer (see wolfenstein the new order). A dreadfully small selection of weapons and maps (roughly 4 snipers, 4 side arms and about 6 MP maps). Dont even get me started on the fact that you have to buy DLC to add more weapons. The campaign is a bit short in my opinion. They have completely overdone the xray bullet cams. Almost every single kill you make with a sniper activates it, it is difficult to build up any momentum in the SP when literally every time you shoot somebody you have to endure 3 - 5 second slow mo animation of your kill.On the bright side though, you can shoot peoples testicles off.

												Far better than previous game in the series. Xrays of bullet penetrations are still here and more brutal than ever, the main reason why it is so great is that the levels are really big, creating different paths and approach towards your objectives. You can find your own way of fulfilling them. I didnt just flew through the game, but it was a real challenge, whcih provided 16 solid hours of gameplay through all levels. Using mines, traps and other useful accesories spice up the gameplay real nice too.			"

												Single player: Much, much worse than V2, which I enjoyed. This game was clearly rushed. All of the development budget and time seems to have been spent on making the slow mo x-ray scenes that much more grizzly. Bullet physics are great, but no improvement on V2. The devs mixed poor level design, glitchy environments and clunky character movement to create an expensive mess of obliterated expectations. Don't even buy this if it's on sale.Multi player: Such a disappointment. Tiny community, many of which use the game's unfinished, buggy nature and hacking tools to exploit genuine players. There's no anti cheat initiative and so its no wonder that there isn't a dedicated community. The ability to rule out wind and bullet drop essentially means players must perpetually re-adjust their aim from server to server, trashing any sense of challenge or realism. Some hosts opt for high wind and no drop, others for no wind, drop or glint, others for glint and drop no wind, its impossible to derive any satisfaction from the MP when each server requires a completely different aiming mechanic.  Stick to V2. Better community, greater challenge, no hacks.			"

												Absolutely horrible community. And by community, I mean every server host out there. Most of these morons either do not possess the knowledge or are just a bunch of butthurt cry babies. Almost every server requests that the players have their steam profiles on public. Its never stated in a rule. But the second you lead in k/d, you will be banned if its private. They literally just want to snoop at your friends and community. I'm sorry, but that harrassment is not allowed by Steam's standards, hence the option for privacy. The community is lead by sore losers and cry babies. Console COD players with unregulated authority. The community killed this game. THE COMMUNITY. Besides these fools, the game is great.			"

Though modern 'sniping' is done mostly at closer ranges due to visibility (or lack thereof), for a game going by the name 'sniper elite' I really wanted to see the opportunity for shots at over 800m.

												Sniper Elite 3 is a satisfying combination of stealth that's not irritating and sharpshooting that's not impossibly difficult, alongside interesting missions/maps. I'll admit, I passed over this one a few times because of the pedestrian-sounding name. ""It does what it says on the tin."" It is, however, a gorgeous, well-crafted game on par with Wolfenstein, with added history and realism, and without the monsters.Only two issues: First, Sniper Elite 3 needs more missions (so did v2). We want to play more, we'd happily pay for more DLC, but there is no more. Second, the co-op system could be more robust. Most nights, we can play through a mission with zero problems. Other nights, we'd get 90% through and boom, our game would end because one of us ""disconnected"" (not really--we were chatting in Mumble the whole time). What followed was a game that often could not be resumed, and much swearing. That said, co-op mode is still the killer feature for us. Great 2-player fun.If you have a friend, and you both have similar levels of patience (or impatience), add this one to your wishlist or cart right now. It runs great in both Windows 10 and Windows 7 for us.			"

												This review is ENTIRELY based on CO-op play only!The game is Good- You cannot play it like an action game, take it slow and easy- The game is edged towards sniper shooting therefore, only the sniper gets all the love for customizations- Don't look for realism, it's not meant to be so- Only 8 Missions = Almost 3 hrs or so per mission, DLC's add more- Play co-op, a lot more fun.What's not to like:-- The game is not really well designed for Co-op, if one player dies, the game will start from Last check point, there is no drop in and drop off in the game, also if by chance anyone disconnects, you cannot save the game, but WILL have to play ALL the way from the START. This SUX when you've finished everything but the last objective after a 3 hr mission level.- It is not Assassin's creed, it is not a close quarters stealth game BUT appears to be. The game actually deviates from previous Sniper Elite games in this regard as more often than not, you'll actually be taking enemies down with your silenced pistol close up.- Close quarters is clunky, use silenced pistol instead as NOT ALL situations lend to taking silent take-downs, this is by design and incredibly silly as it's not intuitive.- One shot from the sniper gun and the ENTIRE base is almost on you.- Far too much emphasis on Sniper gun only, everything and the kitchen sink is thrown into it, other guns' accuracy and damage is purposely kept lower.- Far too much emphasis on Headshots to take down, seriously! Come on. Give extra XP for it, Don't make a player shoot twice just cause he hit at the torso.- Every mission becomes tediously long of about 3 hrs if you play it slow and hidden in the game.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is a fun casual sniper game.  I'm giving it a thumbs up because by itself its an alright game.  However that said, I'd like to point out that in my opinion this game is a step back from Sniper Elite v2.  Here's how the two compare in my opinion:Improvements:- less linear maps- improved graphics- more customizable weaponsCons:- Empty lung ability now shows where to aim to adjust for gravity and wind (even on the hardest difficulty).  Sniper Elite v2 is incredibly fun when you get dialed in to a rifle and pull of numerous long range consecutive headshots.  You'll do that in SE3 as well, but it'll be so easy you won't even notice.- The new detection mechanics are broken. While SEv2's were admittedly pretty simple SE3's is just to wonky to ignore.  Get caught in your sniping nest?  No worries, walk 50 meters away, then walk back and the Nazis will forget all about where you've been picking them off from for the past 10 minutes.- Poor clipping on cover.  It's always annoying when you shoot the barrier in front of you when your scope shows a clear shot, but this is especially bad in SE3 where the detection mechanism penalizes you for every shot.- Poor checkpoint system.  Sometimes it saves after objectives, sometimes it saves when you're sitting in a bush, and sometimes it doesn't save at all. "

Though modern 'sniping' is done mostly at closer ranges due to visibility (or lack thereof), for a game going by the name 'sniper elite' I really wanted to see the opportunity for shots at over 800m.  The all new amazing awesome open maps, however... fail to present such options.3.5/10			"

												Gameplay mechanic is similar to Metal Gear Solid V. Mostly on the stealth and actions. Jump, climb, sprint, carry body, prone, crouch, etc. It's just basic mechanics I've noticed similar to MGS5.			"

												Played Sniper Elite V2 and #3 is a total improvement.  The adjustment from v2 is minimal, the AI is MUCH better, the open areas allow for a variety of play styles and as always the bullet cam is screenshot fodder.  Dont pass this one up!    12 testicle shots out of 10, would murders nazis again.			"

												So I picked this game up durring the steam summer sale, thinking it would be a nice expierence.It was... but not for the hefty real price tag.The game itself barely has any content right from the start. From missions to guns, there was very little. It seemed to be buy dlc to use this gun type of game. It seemed that the game was aimed for multiplayer.Second issue, clipping. Usually you think you can fire over cover? Wrong. Most cover was broken in the way that the hitbox was larger than your crouch profile; which ended up fluffing your shots. In this game firing alerts enemys to your position so It is frustrating seeing your shot magicaly not happen and you pressing down the trigger agian thinking it just ""missed"".Third issue, ""Sniper Elite"". You'd think this game was about sniping, from doing cool trick shots or raining death from afar. You are wrong. Most of the game play is geared towards ""stealth"". Which means you rarely get to fire your sniper. Firing your gun, ANYWHERE, even if there are no enemies around alerts everyone on the map. Utilizing the system of sound masking, gives you an average of 1 shot per minute, unless you find a generator in a good position which is not common. If you break stealth, depening on the difficulty, all the enemies will come alive and chase you down.Fourth Issue, movement. Sprinting in this game is completly redudant. Normal walking is basicly sprinting without holding shift. Because of this enemies will notice you from afar if you just stand up. This leads to the ENTIRE game of playing CROUCH MAN. Which is completly irratating due to the fact it is slower than a slug. There is no sprint crouch like in MGSV.In the end I rate this game a 6/10. It has a decent engine, mechanics but lacking in content and riddled with bugs and poor in-game player optimization.			"

												Positives:Testicle shots on the X-Ray cam is so satisfying to say the least.The sound each shot makes as it passes through different areas of the human body is amazing.German Voices sound funny as always. Negative(s):Miss the Russians from Sniper Elite 2 :(This game is great in terms of a games that you can keep going back for more!. The Levels are quite long so it keeps you going for a while. Its more about sniping than gun fights with automatic rifles, you can run and gun as they say if you really want to. The new landscapes and envirnments are a new strange feel from the tight, small streets of Berlin. SE3 also alows you to pick your own path, instead of following that red arrow like in SE2 V2.Although, there are a few things that Rebellion need to work on for their next game and that would be:1. please put more levels in.2.put more wepons in the game for the price we payed for the game.3. allow costum change in campaign 4. customisation of all guns 8/10			"

												Great game. Goes from the simple nice graphics blastathon of SEV2 to having to be more like a real sniper, I like the fact you have to move postition to stop becomming comprimised by staying in one place and blasting away like SEV2. Still has the awesome bullet cam, which I recommend to have on reduced mode, then only really satisfying shots go bullet cam. Has great graphics and game play, it's fun to replay levels to get better shots. A little short, took me 9 hrs in total but well worth the £19 I paid for it in a sale. Not sure it's worth £39.99, but then I don' think any game is worth that, always wait for a sale if you can!Score out of 10. 8/10			"

												I regret buying this game even on sale. The whole X-ray cam on snipe hit is awesome, but it gets old fast.  The rest of the game is like an advanced version of whack a mole. Enemy pops up, shoot, move to next position, repeat untill next objective, do that for the next couple hours and the game is over.Enemies patrol faster then you can really set up a viable trap, if you try to trigger them to go through it by alarming them they rarely go very far from their patrol pattern so your lucky if you can get a kill that way. If you play on hardest difficulty, you will find it isn't a challenge, but more of a guessing game where your bullets will go, as the game gives no clue where the drift will be, a guess to how far the enemy is, and finding where a missed bullet even went can be tricky.On top of all this, the game is designed focusing on stealth and tactics, but you will find there is not only no motivation in a lot of parts to be stealthy, it is actually easier just to run in guns blazing, and there is no reprecussions to that as the game has absolutely no reward for being stealthy, other then to add hours onto game play of watching your guy crawl through areas of the map.

Check.Everything great so far, except:HUGE♥♥♥♥♥MARKER ON EVERY ENEMY'S  HEAD, ON EVERY OBJECTIVE, BOTH IN VIEW AND ON MINIMAP? F***** CHECKWhat's the point of making a stealthy sniper game if you mark every enemy with a big ""LOOK HERE'S OVER HERE!"" symbol that you cannot disable in options? Really? Where's the challenge? Why does my character bother to carry binoculars when he is a telepathic wizard who knows where all his foes are hiding?I instantly dropped the game and uninstalled it. Buyer's remorse.

 Sniper Elite 3 - A solid WW2 Sniper Game that considering that it launched more then two years ago, still belongs to the best in it`s genre.Considering that Sniper Elite 3 from Rebellion was developed during the peak of the last generation of consoles (PS3/Xbox 360) and therefore had a few limitations brought with it when it launched back in 2014 I`m was very suprised that it still turned into is a solid WW2 Sniper Game with a couple positive aspects and only a tiny among of downs.After the first six hours of Gameplay in which I had played through the first five missions it became clear to me that the biggest advantage of Sniper Elite 3 (compared to it`s very successful predecessor) was also somehow it`s biggest strength - At any point in the Game I could change my play style from being just the skilled Sniper to become the Hand-to-Hand Combat Expert I always wanted to become in Sniper Elite V2 but really couldn't back then for whatever reason.As a Sniper you are as deadly as it can be…It took me the first two mission to realize that I wouldn’t have enough ammunition with me to just blast through the hole Game and so I stopped shooting everyone that run across my sight and instead choose very carefully when and how I would kill someone to not waste my time or my few bullets to many times and instead only kill those that i coudn’t avoid to get past through or if I couldn`t kill those in a more effective way with what the Developers of Rebellion had put on the Map for me that I could use to kill someone instead.In my eyes one of the biggest strengths of Sniper Elite 3 is that you can`t only shoot everyone but that the Game does allow you from time to time in the Game too to use different ways to get right of your enemies in a more effective way if you look out for those hints that the developer might have left for you on the map.…but you will never have brought enough ammunition with you to kill everyone on the field so choose carefully whom you shoot…Secondly the Maps are as always great and always fit the hole African Corps theme very much and I have encountered more then once a moment in the Game where I just stopped moving and enjoyed the overall design and architecture. …since otherwise you might regret it in the end if you waste your last bullet on someone that wasn’t worth your time and your bullet.On the other hand I can clearly understand why some wouldn’t enjoy playing such a game that would force to to first think before they shoot and instead scout first a (complete) map out and afterwards plan how they would have to proceed from there on to full fill their different mission goals from there on. This is also so far my major issue with the Game. Instead of trying to offer those that want to blast through the hole Map and blow everything up enough ammunition the Game so far made it clear to me that it don`t want to bend enough for those kind of Gamers but instead want to put those in a corset and teach them to slow down too many time. Some will like that while others won’t.Conclusion:I haven`t yet finished playing through the Game so far but I’ll for sure play through the other left missions over the upcoming Christmas Holidays and update my Review of the Game with more Details about the Single Player Mode and a couple of Multiplayer Games too if I will encounter more issues with the Game.But seeing how much I have enjoyed playing Sniper Elite 3 till today I would definitely give the Game a strong…Thumbs Up.That´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-) "

												Con:- Poor control due to bad 3rd person implementation. A scrolling option like in Skyrim would be good. It is extremely hard to maneuver inside a building or between cover-sandbags. And you can barely estimate if your choosen cover will hide you from getting spotted.- When you aim 1st person you will likely hit an obstructing object (door frame, window).- There is no such thing as tactics because you can not always choose your path. No free movement.- 99% of the fights take place in almost cqb (50m). That is not sniping!- DCLs (= Did not finish game / want more money). But that is a common probleme these days.Pro:- Nice graphics and lighting- Runnes smooth on GTX770Maybe the developer should not have focused on ""Revamped human X-Ray Kill cam"". Was good in SE2 anyway.			"

												PLayed the game for about 10 minutes on hard difficulty. Super dramatic introduction that places you in the middle of action? Check.Natural shake on scope? Check.Wind factor influencing projectile direction? Check.Interesting heart beat mechanic influencing scope steadiness based on stress? Check.Everything great so far, except:HUGE♥♥♥♥♥MARKER ON EVERY ENEMY'S  HEAD, ON EVERY OBJECTIVE, BOTH IN VIEW AND ON MINIMAP? F***** CHECKWhat's the point of making a stealthy sniper game if you mark every enemy with a big ""LOOK HERE'S OVER HERE!"" symbol that you cannot disable in options? Really? Where's the challenge? Why does my character bother to carry binoculars when he is a telepathic wizard who knows where all his foes are hiding?I instantly dropped the game and uninstalled it. Buyer's remorse. Now, Project I.G.I... now THERE'S a proper sniper game. That old grandfather of sniper games released in 2000 is still far more immersive than this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Considering this game has the word ""sniper"" on it's title it's surprising how little snipping it envolves doing.The stealth mecanics is broken and the relocation system is just asinine. For the most part, the player shoots once, runs back 30 meters to get the relocation bonus, then the AI just resumes it's path as though nothing happened, and the player shoots some other enemy and runs back again until he gets the relocation bonus. The sniper nests are, for the most part, useless, unless there is a generator to make noise nearby. The story is thread bare, almost non existent. The sound and graphics are decent, but nothing special.			"

												Great game that has it's own unique perspective of an fps/sniper. Multiplayer is fun and with co-op you can't go wrong. Don't have any friends that own this game yet so i think there should be an option to do a random co-op online but other than that i love this game.  There are many approach's you can take to each mission and interactive environments. And to be able to take out a tank with only a sniper rifle lol. Game runs smooth on my alienware 18 so i say it has a solid graphics engine. Games like this can help keep the pc gaming community alive.			"

												Really  well put together game.  Single player missions are fun and tactical, and the multiplayer is even more tactical and incredibly tense - you have to earn your kills.  Excellent level design accross all modes.  Cover system can be a tad unreliable but it's by no means an obstruction.  Great game, highly recommend.			"

												This game is awesome, not a lot of people play multiplayer but you can create a server and invite friends- you've got awesome settings if you're the host, you can ban everything but sniper rilfes, you can make them one shot, adjust wind, choose map, yes/no for bullet drop- singleplayer is awesome you can even set a CUSTOM difficulty, you can play CO-OP survival, 2 co-op game modes more and co-op campaign. But there isn't a lot of guns in this game... even the music in this game is awesome xD, oh yeah it's a 3rd person shooter. Highly recommended... I got it in Big Bang store for 35€... worth it (now its 20€)			"

												This game is awesome, not a lot of people play multiplayer but you can create a server and invite friends- you've got awesome settings if you're the host, you can ban everything but sniper rilfes, you can make them one shot, adjust wind, choose map, yes/no for bullet drop- singleplayer is awesome you can even set a CUSTOM difficulty, you can play CO-OP survival, 2 co-op game modes more and co-op campaign. But there isn't a lot of guns in this game... even the music in this game is awesome xD, oh yeah it's a 3rd person shooter. Highly recommended... I got it in Big Bang store for 35€... worth it (now its 20€)			"

I would have expected a bug of this nature to be resolved in a game that was released close to 2 years ago, but I guess not.			"

												I've never played the first two games, so I cannot attest to the quality of this game compared to the others. However, this was a really fun game. I love the x-ray bullet thing, however I spent more time skulking around and hiding bodies than actually sniping. The game is visually impressive but I would have rather spent more time sniping. I also wish the game had more guns and that gun ugrades were faster to unlock. I usually got the first upgrade for a gun right when I'd unlock the next gun, so the upgrades were pointless until I unlocked the best gun and stuck with it long enough. While there's a lot that could be improved, It's still a fun game but not worth more than $30. Wait until a steam sale.			"

												Yeah, third person with gory sniping (you get a MRI scan for everyone you snipe showing exploing skulls and spleens). Basically it's a sneak around game, be patient, be silent. The game gives the idea of Far Cry freedom, but is pretty much on rails to be honest. Flaky in 3D, although ok to play with. Have completed the first mission in three sittings (I don't play much these days), and persuaded me to drop 25 quid on the season pass, for all the DLC - Hitler / Churchill missions and some guns to improve your loadout. LIttle clumsy in play style, Lara Croft did it better, but nice little shooter that's isn't in your face, and rewards if not demands... patience and a little planning. Next sale, get it, it's good!

												Not going to discuss DLC. If you want it, get it. The game should only be judged for what it is, and likewise with the DLC. I am also not going to comment on the multiplayer aspect, just because I haven't tried it and don't really want to. It looks like there are always a few games going strong, but overall it is not very busy.+ Game length is pretty good, and open missions bring some replayability.+ Purist sniping is rewarding and not overly complicated. Likewise, if you want aim-assist, you still feel badass+ Looks pretty good aside from zoom blurring+ AI, sniping realism, and UI assistance options are independently customizable. Although there are only three settings for each, nothing in-depth+ Stealth system is good and works fine for what it is, ""but""+/- Not very realistic. Stealth, AI, and many mechanics are too video game-y. As serious as the game takes itself (super gruffy mcsniper man gotta save arfica or whoever it was), it is not a realistic stealth game, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing unless you don't like that. The sniping alone may be realistic, though. I don't know, I'm not a sniper. But it emulates it well, at least. bullet drop, wind speed, yadda yadda. actually no yadda yadda, that's it I think.- Poor weapon variety (four sniper rifles in a sniping game?)- I mentioned AI is too video game-y, but I think it is so in a bad way.SE3 is a pretty good recommendation for someone who is interested in a stealth and/or sniping game that is easy to get into and easy to enjoy. It has become a little more accessible than SE2 (and like pop music compared to the first game being like black metal), but improves on the framework a LOT. My first playthrough alone is/was almost 20 hours, but the map design is pretty well done and you should be able to replay the game a couple of times and it will still feel like a different experience, especially if you practice different play styles (run and gun, booby trapped house of horror, cat and mouse, pure stealth, etc). I think there are like 8 missions in all? 8 to 10.There is nothing fancy about the stealth. It is simple and works (mostly). No parkour, pseudo-platforming, or anything remarkable. It is sight and sound-based. You crouch, go prone, hide in grass, shadows, or behind something. Instant kill enemies from behind, shoot em with a silenced pistol, take them out with a trap, or mask your shot with environmental noise. The automatic cover system is pretty seamless and I don't think it has ever frustrated me in the least. Very well implemented. I'm kind of disappointed there is no over-cover silent kill. If a guy was leaning up against a short wall and you were behind him: nope. sorry. You can hide and scurry off, and the enemy will stay pinned down assuming you are still active in your previous location (you'll see a ghost of your character, signifying you can relocate).The AI regularly switches between omniscient and brain-dead. I think that is very, very bad, but I enjoy the game regardless, and personally it's more comical and inexcusable. An enemy will hear you running in an underground bunker beneath them...but they won't see you kill a guy right in front of them 50 meters out. They will hear you walking on a roof above them and go investigate with weapons ready... even though one of their buddies was just walking around up there before I killed him undetected. They will hear you running a couple of blocks away...but they won't hear the guy who just got shot through the helmet grunt and slump to the ground five feet to the side of them. They won't be alerted by explosive traps that go off outside of combat unless they are very close.Some of the other mechanics in the game bothered me at first, too, but I quickly got over it. Sound masking makes some sense, but that logic isn't applicable to every situation. I can certainly understand shooting undetected when a plane passes low overhead, but not when some piece of machinery grunts and your gun is clearly much louder and sounds completely different (Like a gun, you know what I mean?). The sound masking is in relation to YOUR position, and never the enemy's. So when a loud noise happens near them, they will still hear you shooting just fine. Oh, and the AI will never ever see nor hear your bullet hit anybody or anything, no matter how close it is and even if it is in their field of vision.A couple bugs, but overall the game is very stable. One problem, a HUGE problem at some points, is that loading into a game will make a noise at your location. I don't know if it spawns you slightly above the ground and it's a dropping noise, or what. But it actually ""broke"" my mission once when I had an objective where I could NOT be detected because yaknow I was eavesdropping on something important. I saved on a platform above the conversation, and when I loaded into it again after messing something up, I alerted them with every single attempt. Not cool.Zooming in with your rifle or binoculars will make many foreground or background areas quite blurry until you aim at them and clear them up. I thought it was intentional at first, but it really looks like annoying texture bugs to me. Unsure if there is a fix for this. Might be.I've discussed the cons a lot (I think that is most important to get out of the way) and my comments on the AI may turn you away. But I still recommend giving this game a shot if you can get it on sale. The mechanics, despite having a logic of their own, all work together very well and make the game tense and exciting. It's fun as hell to scout a location, lay out traps, plan your encounter out, and see how it goes.			"

												I liked V2, but there were definitely some problems with the gameplay. Elite 3 takes the problems of 2 and improves in virtually everyway. The stealth is tighter, the gunplay better, and hell, even the story is better. Africa is a much better setting than bombed-out Europe, and with the newer engine build, the world looks absolutely wonderful. A couple of problems with it though. Don't buy the DLCs. They aren't worth it, at all. Buying them encourages bad business behavior. That's not points against the game however, it's a marketing problem. It's not a 40 dollar value, overall. Wait until it's on sale for 10 or 15. Fun game. 7/10.			"

Where can I untag this game from my account or delete the Steam game content from the server. I have no. repeat no further use of this game . Is my only choice  to throw this game in the rubbish bin or is it a better idea to have someboy else enjoy playing it after regtistering through Steam. Or maybe the idea is for people to buy the game and throw it away after finishing it . I understand the Companies can make more money this way while users waisting it. "

												The plot of this game is that there are Nazis within range of your high-powered rifle. There's probably more to it than that, but I wasn't paying attention. Whether I don't remember anything about the story because I played this game half drunk on a lazy Saturday or because the story was just that boring and/or superfluous, I don't know. I suspect it's a combination of the two. What I do know is that the day I need a reason to shoot video game Nazis in the face is the day I renounce my American citizenship and put down my controller. I do note that the story being set in Africa was a nice change of pace from the rather more common setting of ""3/4-exploded European city.""But, obviously, I enjoyed this game or I wouldn't have recommended it, and I'm recommending it for the gameplay. I'm not really a connoisseur of shooters, but I thought it worked well. For the most part, the maps are pretty open, and you're given substantial leeway as to how you're going to get your mission done. Generally speaking, I appreciated this, though it did lead to a couple rather absurd situations wherein I murdered every Nazi in the postal code before accidentally stumbling upon a checkpoint and being informed that I need to make my way through an extra-special dangerous area to accomplish a plot point. Then, the game plays really intense music and the protagonist (who has a voice like disinterested, chain-smoking batman) growls about being sneaky while I take a leisurely stroll to my objective among the recently deceased sons of the Third Reich.In addition to the maps being fairly open ended, so is the Nazi murder. Your rifle is of course your work-horse, but you're also given plenty of support weapons: pistols, machine guns, land mines, trip mines, grenades, and rocket launchers. So, while the game emphasizes shooting Nazis from far away, you are more than welcome to shoot them from up close and/or explode them. Relatedly, it doesn't seem like the game knows that it's giving you all this freedom. It gives you great number of tools, tactics, tutorials and terrain with an eye toward killing all sneaky-like, but most missions can be beat quite easily by finding a high point with a good view and decent cover and then just going nuts. You see, if anyone gets close to you, they can often deal a lot of damage very fast, but threats with a range comparable to your own are few (tanks or enemies with their own rifles or rocket launchers) and fairly far-between. The rest of them are left spraying wildly with pistols or sub-machine guns, gradually moving forward into closer cover or--more often--your bullets. This is about as effective as you would imagine, and a couple dozen Nazis will be doing well to do one bandage-worth of damage to you before they're all dead or rolling around on the ground doubtlessly wondering why no one thought to give even one of them a gun that could reliably hit a target more than 30 yards away.In sum: this game has its fair share of quirks and shortcomings, but I thought the mechanic were reasonably well-executed, and using them to shoot Nazis was fun enough to earn the game a recommendation from me.

Then, the game plays really intense music and the protagonist (who has a voice like disinterested, chain-smoking batman) growls about being sneaky while I take a leisurely stroll to my objective among the recently deceased sons of the Third Reich.In addition to the maps being fairly open ended, so is the Nazi murder. Your rifle is of course your work-horse, but you're also given plenty of support weapons: pistols, machine guns, land mines, trip mines, grenades, and rocket launchers. So, while the game emphasizes shooting Nazis from far away, you are more than welcome to shoot them from up close and/or explode them. Relatedly, it doesn't seem like the game knows that it's giving you all this freedom. It gives you great number of tools, tactics, tutorials and terrain with an eye toward killing all sneaky-like, but most missions can be beat quite easily by finding a high point with a good view and decent cover and then just going nuts. You see, if anyone gets close to you, they can often deal a lot of damage very fast, but threats with a range comparable to your own are few (tanks or enemies with their own rifles or rocket launchers) and fairly far-between. The rest of them are left spraying wildly with pistols or sub-machine guns, gradually moving forward into closer cover or--more often--your bullets. This is about as effective as you would imagine, and a couple dozen Nazis will be doing well to do one bandage-worth of damage to you before they're all dead or rolling around on the ground doubtlessly wondering why no one thought to give even one of them a gun that could reliably hit a target more than 30 yards away.In sum: this game has its fair share of quirks and shortcomings, but I thought the mechanic were reasonably well-executed, and using them to shoot Nazis was fun enough to earn the game a recommendation from me.

												I had never played a Sniper Elite game before so I had begun playing this game without knowing what to expect. Besides a barrage of sniping. The graphics in this game exceeds my expectation, the game truly delivers outstanding textures and effects that make the whole gaming experience more pleasureable and more enjoyable. I really enjoyed the bullet cam feature. It delivers a satisfying vibe along with every kill you perform. Though quite repetitive. Luckily, there is an option to lower the occurrences or even disable the feature. The missions are also quite repetitive. You'll find yourself performing the same objectives over and over again. The game is also rather short. There are only eight missions in total. Though each one of them can be made up of a long duration of time if you decide to take the stealth approach. Otherwise, you can blaze through each mission rather quickly if you decide to battle without the element of surprise. Another major problem is the spawning of enemies. Enemies would randomly spawn every time you fail. The enemies also tend to ""camouflage"" themselces by almost ""merging"" each other. Making the player to acknowledge that only one enemy is present. Overall, the story was great and in-depth and was well worth my time. The game isn't entirely bad. But I wouldn't recommend it either.			"

												Well... it's really a good game technically but I don't like it. Fallout 4 is the much better sniper simulator than this game. In Fallout I wander the wastelands and kill monster from afar with my sniper and they have no clue what happens. In this game I need to search for one of 3 or 4 sniper spots on the map, wait for a generator to make a sound and then use my sniper. The rest is stealth kills and grenades.... that IS FUN in the beginning but I got bored a the end of the first mission. At the end of the first mission I wished I could just rush the enemies and kill every one of them withe something like a rocket launcher like in a good old first person shooter.			"

												Much improved version of the previous Sniper Elite games.  With every iteration of the game they seem to make improvements.  However, the game can be a bit short if you play it on easier difficulty settings.  Ramp up the difficulty settings and attempt to play through the missions completely stealth and you'll see a much longer play through.    I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they added the full on co-op, play this with a friend and you won't be disappointed in the fun you'll have.  Using Steam to connect with friends and play co-op is a breeze! I had no disconnect issues, no lag, and no fuss with playing co-op unlike many titles where you can spend hours forwarding ports, etc.  If you are looking for some competitive play I really wouldn't recommend this title though. The regular VS multiplayer was uninspired and boring and I don't recommend it for that.  It quickly devolves into hiding behind cover and firing wildly at people when you see them; basically a big camping game.  It would have been nice for them to add some objectives to complete or some incentive to move about the map.The graphics seem to be improved from the previous games.  The game runs extremely smoothly on my computer and loads lightening quick.  I haven't had any issues with game crashing or major bugs.  One issue is sometimes ""invisible"" cover will block your shot if you try to fire too closely to it resulting in a shot that should have hit, but doesn't.  It isn't perfect, but I still highly recommend this game if you enjoy sniping games and co-op!			"

												Sniper Elite- A game about shooting human testicles, cos who doesn't like that? I know I do!But in all seriousness, this is one of the best sniping games of all time. I adore the Sniper Elite series for its fantastic sniping, which feels smooth and responsive. Playing on the harder modes with no aim assistence to help you shoot and with realistic ballistics makes it all the more fun. I urge you to pick up this game, or even the older but awesome Sniper Elite V2. It's even more fun to play with your friends, provided the servers don't bug up, causing multiple crashes like it did to me...So what are you waiting for? Grab that Mosin Nagant, set up your sniping nest, and hunt some balls!			"

												Sniper Elite 3 is very different if you compare it to other shooting games that were realeased in the past few years. I can only say that a select few enjoy the game due to its gameplay which by some can be considered monotonous since after each shot that is notsomehow silenced you will have to relocate by walking away 50 meters and the guards will have forgotten that you even exist. The setting is very unique since this time you are not storming the beaches of Normandy but are instead crossing through African terrain and one of the most underrated military theatres in history. there is also a unique feature where whenever you fire a shot your bullet will go into slow motion as it penetrates your target permitting you to see the carnage first-hand. If you don´t understand what I mean by this think of it as the special X-ray special moves from the new Mortal Kombat games but with bullets.Pros: Unique settingAdvanced bullet physicsSlow-motion killsVast array of weapons to choose fromKill Hitler DLCCan see your bullet destroy a man´s balls via the slow-motion kill featureCons:May be considered monotonous and boring by some peopleOnly one silenced weapon in the game, making it hard to be stealthy.Conclusion:I would only recommend it if you know what you are getting into and if you are positive that you will enjoy it. Otherwise you may have wasted your money.			"

As McGruff-Voice you single handedly annihilate the entire german presence in africa with your sniper rifle and ridiculous amount of ammunition and max payne focus. You get to take away possible future nazi children  when you blow the testicles off of unaware nazis and destroy tanks with your god rifle. You plot is about as intriguing as any true 80s action film in which it is absolutely not and you have a welrod pistol which is confusingly silent for some reason and is used for poof moments where your testicles shrink and you decide to use it to ""silently"" reduce your masculinity.Also Quick saves because YEEEEESSSS!!!!

												The praise for 'ballistics' is 100% false. In real life the bullet drop on a 30-06 is measured by inches at long range beyond what this game has you attempt shooting at, in this game bullet drop is measured by feet at 50 yards. Really? Seriously? Do the guys at Rebellion even know one end of a gun from another? Lack of ability to change scope zero, bullet drop worse than a bb gun, all items hidden behind expensive DLC as well as several levels, the fact that this game is made by Rebellion, there is nothing but reasons NOT to buy this game. Ever. I bought it on sale and was severely disappointed to the point of disgust, thanks to Valve for allowing refunds now you guys saved me from losing on this deal.			"

												while I did enjoy the game i feel as though this is another lazy sequel attempting to make money off of a popular franchise. While nothing is really broken with the game nothing is really new. the majority of the guns were in v2 and the ones that are new feel like re skinned versions of the old ones. the game is gorgeous running at 80 fps on my gtx 760. This game took all of the charm of urban sniping and replaced it with a.i. that hardly poses a challenge on the lower difficulties and acctually becomes interesting on the harder ones. also the map design is often bad making you shoot a couple of shots and then run off to find another hiding spot when on several maps it hardly makes sense that the enemy could determine where the shot really came from due to acoustics from desert warfare. overall this game was a fun experience (the story is very generic and often has you fighting in far too similar combat areas) however the gameplay doesn't make up for the overly generic story and basically higher resolution re-skin of sniper elite v2. tl;dr pass on this game,because it doesnt really add anything new to the frnchise and feels like a money grab.

												I've never played the previous two games, but I have played Splinter Cell and Metal Gear, therefore I will be comparing SE3 to those. I would not pay more than $10 for this somewhat lazily made game.  To me, this feels like a poor man's  Stealth game; Many things I've taken for granted in other titles are absent in SE3, such as storyline, characters, dialog, humor, a decent control scheme. The story is pretty non-existent. You are a soldier in WWII killing Nazis. Almost nothing is revealed about your character. There is no dialog whatsoever, aside from the occasional monologue given about whatever mission you are on by the main character. Who gives him his orders, who are his co-workers, does he have a family? We will never know. Even games that don't focus heavily on storyy and cinematics, like Call Of Duty and Halo give a bit of background on the setting and characters.  The controls and gameplay are extremely clunky even compared to games from 2003. I have a hard time trying to figure out where I can and cannot walk/run. One time I was trying to Shoot from a tower, only to realize my bullets were hitting the railing. Much older games from the Splinter Cell and MGS franchises had much better control schemes and felt much more fluid, especially in hand-to-hand. Not only is hand to hand horribly undeveloped, but you are forced to rely heavily on it throughout the game. Even the Sniping mechanics in older games is much more fun.    I would recommend almost any other shooter/stealth game made in the past 15 years  over this one.			"

												Yeah, third person with gory sniping (you get a MRI scan for everyone you snipe showing exploing skulls and spleens). Basically it's a sneak around game, be patient, be silent. The game gives the idea of Far Cry freedom, but is pretty much on rails to be honest. Flaky in 3D, although ok to play with. Have completed the first mission in three sittings (I don't play much these days), and persuaded me to drop 25 quid on the season pass, for all the DLC - Hitler / Churchill missions and some guns to improve your loadout. LIttle clumsy in play style, Lara Croft did it better, but nice little shooter that's isn't in your face, and rewards if not demands... patience and a little planning. Next sale, get it, it's good!

												I've never played the first two games, so I cannot attest to the quality of this game compared to the others. However, this was a really fun game. I love the x-ray bullet thing, however I spent more time skulking around and hiding bodies than actually sniping. The game is visually impressive but I would have rather spent more time sniping. I also wish the game had more guns and that gun ugrades were faster to unlock. I usually got the first upgrade for a gun right when I'd unlock the next gun, so the upgrades were pointless until I unlocked the best gun and stuck with it long enough. While there's a lot that could be improved, It's still a fun game but not worth more than $30. Wait until a steam sale.			"

												Not going to discuss DLC. If you want it, get it. The game should only be judged for what it is, and likewise with the DLC. I am also not going to comment on the multiplayer aspect, just because I haven't tried it and don't really want to. It looks like there are always a few games going strong, but overall it is not very busy.+ Game length is pretty good, and open missions bring some replayability.+ Purist sniping is rewarding and not overly complicated. Likewise, if you want aim-assist, you still feel badass+ Looks pretty good aside from zoom blurring+ AI, sniping realism, and UI assistance options are independently customizable. Although there are only three settings for each, nothing in-depth+ Stealth system is good and works fine for what it is, ""but""+/- Not very realistic. Stealth, AI, and many mechanics are too video game-y. As serious as the game takes itself (super gruffy mcsniper man gotta save arfica or whoever it was), it is not a realistic stealth game, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing unless you don't like that. The sniping alone may be realistic, though. I don't know, I'm not a sniper. But it emulates it well, at least. bullet drop, wind speed, yadda yadda. actually no yadda yadda, that's it I think.- Poor weapon variety (four sniper rifles in a sniping game?)- I mentioned AI is too video game-y, but I think it is so in a bad way.SE3 is a pretty good recommendation for someone who is interested in a stealth and/or sniping game that is easy to get into and easy to enjoy. It has become a little more accessible than SE2 (and like pop music compared to the first game being like black metal), but improves on the framework a LOT. My first playthrough alone is/was almost 20 hours, but the map design is pretty well done and you should be able to replay the game a couple of times and it will still feel like a different experience, especially if you practice different play styles (run and gun, booby trapped house of horror, cat and mouse, pure stealth, etc). I think there are like 8 missions in all? 8 to 10.There is nothing fancy about the stealth. It is simple and works (mostly). No parkour, pseudo-platforming, or anything remarkable. It is sight and sound-based. You crouch, go prone, hide in grass, shadows, or behind something. Instant kill enemies from behind, shoot em with a silenced pistol, take them out with a trap, or mask your shot with environmental noise. The automatic cover system is pretty seamless and I don't think it has ever frustrated me in the least. Very well implemented. I'm kind of disappointed there is no over-cover silent kill. If a guy was leaning up against a short wall and you were behind him: nope. sorry. You can hide and scurry off, and the enemy will stay pinned down assuming you are still active in your previous location (you'll see a ghost of your character, signifying you can relocate).The AI regularly switches between omniscient and brain-dead. I think that is very, very bad, but I enjoy the game regardless, and personally it's more comical and inexcusable. An enemy will hear you running in an underground bunker beneath them...but they won't see you kill a guy right in front of them 50 meters out. They will hear you walking on a roof above them and go investigate with weapons ready... even though one of their buddies was just walking around up there before I killed him undetected. They will hear you running a couple of blocks away...but they won't hear the guy who just got shot through the helmet grunt and slump to the ground five feet to the side of them. They won't be alerted by explosive traps that go off outside of combat unless they are very close.Some of the other mechanics in the game bothered me at first, too, but I quickly got over it. Sound masking makes some sense, but that logic isn't applicable to every situation. I can certainly understand shooting undetected when a plane passes low overhead, but not when some piece of machinery grunts and your gun is clearly much louder and sounds completely different (Like a gun, you know what I mean?). The sound masking is in relation to YOUR position, and never the enemy's. So when a loud noise happens near them, they will still hear you shooting just fine. Oh, and the AI will never ever see nor hear your bullet hit anybody or anything, no matter how close it is and even if it is in their field of vision.A couple bugs, but overall the game is very stable. One problem, a HUGE problem at some points, is that loading into a game will make a noise at your location. I don't know if it spawns you slightly above the ground and it's a dropping noise, or what. But it actually ""broke"" my mission once when I had an objective where I could NOT be detected because yaknow I was eavesdropping on something important. I saved on a platform above the conversation, and when I loaded into it again after messing something up, I alerted them with every single attempt. Not cool.Zooming in with your rifle or binoculars will make many foreground or background areas quite blurry until you aim at them and clear them up. I thought it was intentional at first, but it really looks like annoying texture bugs to me. Unsure if there is a fix for this. Might be.I've discussed the cons a lot (I think that is most important to get out of the way) and my comments on the AI may turn you away. But I still recommend giving this game a shot if you can get it on sale. The mechanics, despite having a logic of their own, all work together very well and make the game tense and exciting. It's fun as hell to scout a location, lay out traps, plan your encounter out, and see how it goes.			"

												This game is poor. Sniper Elite 2 was much better, but in all honesty that isn't saying much. The following reasons are why this game is terrible and should not be purchased, or redeemed for free as I have.1. Broken movement mechanics: There is horrible mouse acceleration which cannot be adjusted and makes movement very difficutl.2. Broken Shooting mechanics. I play on Sniper Elite mode as well as realist mode. Aiming over a targets head and compensating for bullet drop was not consistant. Slightly shooting over their head then compensating by a little made me shoot the target in the lower chest or pevlis on many occasions. Bullet mechanic are broken.3. Beyond repetative. Increadable linear battlefield. Terrible AI. Increase in difficult turns up the speed of the AI aimbot.The Positive: Xray vision on shooting people is a cool and enjoyable aspect. For about 30 minutes. And Since Sniper Elite 2 has the exact same Xray, set in the European Theater, with much less buddy mechanics. That is the game you should choose if you want to just destroy people with xray bullet cams.I will try to suffer through a few hours of gameplay just to make this review more respectable.			"

												I've just finished playing through the single player campaign on marksman difficulty, and I really enjoyed the game.  A nice balance of interesting maps, and different scenarios to consider.  It's a huge improvement over V2 which was more linear and involved far more close quarter encounters.I've started again on authentic difficulty and I'm enjoying the struggle.  The enemy AI is really good I think, although it would be nice to be able to fine tune the assistance.  For example:  I'd like to be able to range find with the binoculars, but not tag enemies.  I'd like to see my health bar, but not the tactical map.  I'd like to have free reign with the loadout and swap all my health kits for trip mines if I so desired.Also, the people complaining about not having a zillion different guns to choose from, I think are missing the point.  I played through the game with the same rifle, pistol combination and didn't feel like anything was missing.It's a great game.  And while the x-ray kill cam is awesome initially, it does get tiresome quickly, and I ended up turning it off near the end.  You can also press space during kill cam and it'll skip, which is a very nice feature.I'm looking forward to the multiplayer.			"

However, the game can be a bit short if you play it on easier difficulty settings.  Ramp up the difficulty settings and attempt to play through the missions completely stealth and you'll see a much longer play through.    I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they added the full on co-op, play this with a friend and you won't be disappointed in the fun you'll have.  Using Steam to connect with friends and play co-op is a breeze! I had no disconnect issues, no lag, and no fuss with playing co-op unlike many titles where you can spend hours forwarding ports, etc.  If you are looking for some competitive play I really wouldn't recommend this title though. The regular VS multiplayer was uninspired and boring and I don't recommend it for that.  It quickly devolves into hiding behind cover and firing wildly at people when you see them; basically a big camping game.  It would have been nice for them to add some objectives to complete or some incentive to move about the map.The graphics seem to be improved from the previous games.  The game runs extremely smoothly on my computer and loads lightening quick.  I haven't had any issues with game crashing or major bugs.  One issue is sometimes ""invisible"" cover will block your shot if you try to fire too closely to it resulting in a shot that should have hit, but doesn't.  It isn't perfect, but I still highly recommend this game if you enjoy sniping games and co-op!			"

												For those of you who are saying this game isn't better than V2 and that it sucks, you're all ignorant. I hate whining people... Anyway, with that said, this game does have its problems (mainly in multiplayer). The single player is fun. Its very short, but hell, its fun and rewarding especially on higher difficulty levels. You get the freedom to do what you want in all the missions and you can use whatever tools at your disposal to complete your mission. Now in terms of content for this game, there should have been more. But what can I say? No game is absolutely perfect in its own nature. The developers put most of the ""extra content"" into DLC bundles if you want an upper hand. They really aren't that jaw dropping or needed for completing missions but they do help in multiplayer. Ahh, multiplayer. Multiplayer is definitely a fun and exciting expirience all around, but there is quite a bit of lag going on but idk if thats because of my connection or if its actually the server. Also, there are quite a few glitches. For instance, I could be running to a corner to get some cover and hear another person shoot, I would assume they miss me but as I get around the corner, I fall over dead. Its that kind of stuff that makes people hate it and I understand. But the Devs will fix this in no time. Also, there needs to be more people on multiplayer. Sometimes I cant even find a game. Overall, this game is fun and really enjoyable. Just stick with your gut. It is a pretty high price tag, but I am definitley glad that I bought it. The multiplayer is just too fun for me to pass up.			"

												Great game that has it's own unique perspective of an fps/sniper. Multiplayer is fun and with co-op you can't go wrong. Don't have any friends that own this game yet so i think there should be an option to do a random co-op online but other than that i love this game.  There are many approach's you can take to each mission and interactive environments. And to be able to take out a tank with only a sniper rifle lol. Game runs smooth on my alienware 18 so i say it has a solid graphics engine. Games like this can help keep the pc gaming community alive.			"

												Really  well put together game.  Single player missions are fun and tactical, and the multiplayer is even more tactical and incredibly tense - you have to earn your kills.  Excellent level design accross all modes.  Cover system can be a tad unreliable but it's by no means an obstruction.  Great game, highly recommend.			"

												Considering this game has the word ""sniper"" on it's title it's surprising how little snipping it envolves doing.The stealth mecanics is broken and the relocation system is just asinine. For the most part, the player shoots once, runs back 30 meters to get the relocation bonus, then the AI just resumes it's path as though nothing happened, and the player shoots some other enemy and runs back again until he gets the relocation bonus. The sniper nests are, for the most part, useless, unless there is a generator to make noise nearby. The story is thread bare, almost non existent. The sound and graphics are decent, but nothing special.			"

												Awful camera and controls will end up killing you countless times when you stand in front of an enemy in perfect sight while the camera (ie you) is behind a wall blocking your sight... The camera is fixed on the right side behind the character meaning you dont have the same view as the character and this is extremly frustrating. The character movement is jerky and game physics is clearly lacking, for instance run into an object you are thrown sideways in a very unnatural way. I love sniper games but this is clearly an unfinished game or really bad PC port.An important bug to keep in mind: Quick saving isn't permanent meaning if you quit the game without doing a real save via the save menu you will lose all progress.On the plus side if you can live with the camera problems it's a fairly good game with good graphics and enjoyable kills.

												Great game! Good graphics and physics. Great storyline and awesome maps. Some of the maps and missions are so well build, they give you the sense of real proportions, space and time, that's a first for a video game. It can be challenging and fun to walk around to complete the mission in a personal way and not guided by the AI. I'm not the kind of patient player, i'm head out first in the action but i really enjoyed this game and it is my favourite for PC.The only bad experience with this game is the fact that i've encountered a few cheating players on multiplayer servers, wallhaking to be more specific.

Wish it had community support for maps and stuff. Only DLC worth buying imo is  the last churchhill mission the others are ok but not at all worth full price. Good game.			"

												Awful camera and controls will end up killing you countless times when you stand in front of an enemy in perfect sight while the camera (ie you) is behind a wall blocking your sight... The camera is fixed on the right side behind the character meaning you dont have the same view as the character and this is extremly frustrating. The character movement is jerky and game physics is clearly lacking, for instance run into an object you are thrown sideways in a very unnatural way. I love sniper games but this is clearly an unfinished game or really bad PC port.An important bug to keep in mind: Quick saving isn't permanent meaning if you quit the game without doing a real save via the save menu you will lose all progress.On the plus side if you can live with the camera problems it's a fairly good game with good graphics and enjoyable kills.

												I cannot recommend this game, spend the first 30-60 min of my gametime just trying to figure out how to get at least 60 fps. Was stuck on 20-30 fps on low setting with a gtx 960 card, after trying diffrent of suggestions from forums i finally got my fps to around 90-120 on ultra settings. finally i could actually play the game, that was at least what i thought. Then the game started to crash every 20-30 min. Tried to look up another fix for this but this time the suggestions did not help me. Not only the really bad crash and fps problems this game has, the gameplay seems extremly boring. There is little to none actuall sniping in this game, once in a while you find a generator that can mask your shot (so the enemies wont hear you) but this is the only time you can actually snipe. the rest of the time you have to try and get into close combat to either shoot them with your silenced pistol or give them a knife in the back. i only reached to third mission until i simply gave up on this game.

												3/10 Literally unplayable!If you ALT+TAB you never get back in the game as the moment you click resume it takes you back to the desktop where you have to killtask it and start it again.It glitches in the campain as when you aim the sniper rifle, zoom in and hold breath the red aim thingy is well below the crosshair making it impossible to accurately shoot anything. It crashes so many times without the faintest error message just the annoying ""Sniper Elite stopped working"".Updated graphics driver, set game details to medium, altough my machine can run the game at 200fps on ultra, updated game files and now i get the Run time error Microsoft C++.It's a great game overall and love the play-style of sneaking and sniping badies but the errors and alt+tab thing and the persistent glitches ruin it.

												Sniper Elite III is hightly recommended by me. I especially take pleasure from playing the single player challenge levels. I only wish they levels were larger. Perhaps the creators of this game will see the potential of simply expanding the two levels beyond the red band that defines the edges of the map. I'm dying to see what's up that hill, around that corner or behind that rock. I'd certainly be willing to pay for the experience. Come on, just expand the maps!			"

												I really enjoyed this game for the first few hours.- nice graphics- amazing and very satisfying killcams- good soundThen the clunky controls and all those weapons and Items I never used, started to annoy me.After like 4 hours, I got tired of killcams and the lame story, so I started skipping everything.What was left was... nothing really. I suddenly got no reason to keep on playing. Just played till the end expecting to get better. But It didn't get better, I finished one level and didn't realize it was the last one. It just ended. Short game.I'm glad I got this on sale, but I would not recommend this, even on sale. It's gonna stay on my steam library forever reminding me of a failed purchase.Don't bother, better use this moneh for Tacos, or a date, beers,... whatever.			"

												This game isn't enjoyable at all.I'm on windows 10 and haven't had any issues with bugs or crashing, but the game itself just isn't fun. The open world aspect of the levels compared to the mostly linear levels of the past makes everything take much longer and much more monotonous. Running around plains in northern africa is fun for a bit, but when every level involves the same general tasks with a different map it gets really really cancer, even in coop.Along with this, the game is relatively short with only 8 levels; and of course the multiplayer is pretty much dead.

There is something missing (  i am 50 ) about WW2 and madness of the human race ! maybe  i ad some wrong expectations !  Maybe this type of game is more trilling when use as Multi-player !But i am glad  that my money  end up  in the hands of a  Cie that sell something that is working and beautifull  !

												Honestly, one of my least favorite games i've played. I thought i'd buy this game considering it's on sale why not right?I am not huge on the 3rd person camera of the game, but 3rd person is to be expected due to the history of the last games. some people like it, i happen to not be one of those people. I also would like to clear out for other potential players, the game instantly throws you into an unforgiving enviornment at the begining of the game.  Which gives you little to no time to get the feel of the weapon play.			"

												Not recommended, way too many bugs. Damn, I can't event start the game after the first run. Looks like it's been improved on SE2, as it allows for more customisation, but can't say anything more really, as it just doesn't work. I play 30+ other AA+ games on my hardware (i7-2600K, 3.4GHz, 16GB Ballistix, GTX 760 2GB, 5.1 SRND Logitech HeadPh) without any issues, so it looks like this one has just poor quality. The support doesn't seem to care much, as Tech Support forums are full of un-answered cries for help.			"

												A huge step up from Sniper Elite V2. Big expansive settings, improved ""slo-mo"" kill cams, and improved stealth addressed many of the weaknesses of SE V2.

												Sniper Elite III is hightly recommended by me. I especially take pleasure from playing the single player challenge levels. I only wish they levels were larger. Perhaps the creators of this game will see the potential of simply expanding the two levels beyond the red band that defines the edges of the map. I'm dying to see what's up that hill, around that corner or behind that rock. I'd certainly be willing to pay for the experience. Come on, just expand the maps!			"

												I found the game amusing enough until the more into it I got the mouse lag subtracted what there was to like about it.I noticed it from the beginning of the first campaign but kept trying. It's an alright game and is paced for taking one's time to plan ahead before initiating an attack,but on the third campaign I entered the fortress and my instincts and mouse control became defensivly useless. Not the kind of mouse control I would like to have and so I wouldn't recommend it.The sniper graphics are emmensly cool I don't understand why they let the mouse lag ruin the game.When it's a life or death situation and you can't aim to save your life because the mouse lag is viral when you really need it,""What more can I say.""

												not much of a challenge, ai hears you shoot gets cautious for about 3 minutes then goes back to what they were doing acting like nothing happened. natural sounds to mask your shots are all but gone in this and require you to kick that same generator that youve seen in the past 8 levels that makes the same generic sound.

												I found the game amusing enough until the more into it I got the mouse lag subtracted what there was to like about it.I noticed it from the beginning of the first campaign but kept trying. It's an alright game and is paced for taking one's time to plan ahead before initiating an attack,but on the third campaign I entered the fortress and my instincts and mouse control became defensivly useless. Not the kind of mouse control I would like to have and so I wouldn't recommend it.The sniper graphics are emmensly cool I don't understand why they let the mouse lag ruin the game.When it's a life or death situation and you can't aim to save your life because the mouse lag is viral when you really need it,""What more can I say.""

												brand new added features like timed sound blockers (bangs from engines etc), better xray cam (it just soooooo good to get that headshot off). typical Sniper Elite gameplay but at a pace set by the player, objectives that can be done in any order, side objectives that you may never find. for example: finding a piece of intel that then gives you the option to kill another commander- lay a trap for him and continue on your way.... or wait for that perfect shot. its. all. up. to. you.i recommend this game, for both SE veterans and new players to the franchise. it runs great also, although there are a few bugs (what game doesnt have them?). it is very enjoyable, and i cant wait till a mate gets it so i can do co-op.

												So to start I played V2 and I loved it. From the get-go Sniper Elite 3 left me wanting more. The story was garbage and felt rushed. It was too stealth oriented and ironically revolved less around sniping leaving you sitting in your nest waiting for a plane to fly by to mask your shot. What really bugged me was when Vahlen would appear in a cutscene it's like WTF, there was nobody within a mile of there 2 seconds ago.  I expected more from Rebellion on this one.			"

												Sniper Elite V 3 is a very playable game. The storyline is somewhat forgettable, it’s really a FPS with a shoot to kill attitude. But that is quite all right. There is plenty of ground to cover outside your missions and to try different approaches. The controls work pretty well and smoothly and I am impressed with the slowmo. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and some improvements can be found along the way. Overall it is great9/10 "

												It's exceptionally well made, great graphics and gameplay.Pros- Multiplayer is sniping paradise, tons of servers and a cool community- You can stealth through the whole game.- Gigantic well thought out maps, beautiful details- Historical detailed environment - enemies speak Italian, German, etc.- Optimized, beautiful graphics and high frame rates- Generally a very pleasant improvement on the previous release.Cons- More weapons I guess?  Not really a con for me, especially with the ability to customize them completely, even with reticles.  - Hilarious ragdoll physics, anyone who has played knows.  While it's very amusing, not always realistic to shoot someone in the foot and then they do a flip in the air.			"

												So you are interested in this Game and want to know if its good ?If you ask me, i can say to you ; It is a good Game if you like Stealth-Action Third Person Shooters and WW2 Setting - First let me tell to you what games you may can compare to this,- Splinter Cell- Hidden and Dangerous- Commandos 3- Metal Gear Solid- Hitman 1 & 2So if you liked the games listed above then i think you also will like Sniper Elite 3 - and if you liked Sniper Elite 1&2 then let me tell you this game is a little bit better then theese areWhat i like ?- Nice GraphicOk the Graphic wont be the best you have seen - but it is good enough to play the game and it feels kind of realistic .The Night mission looks fantastic with a great atmosphere and the special effects are also good.- Stealth Gameplay This is one kind of the games where you really need to act stealthy, you cannot simply run and shoot trough the missions like call of duty! NO ! if you play on Sniper Elite difficult it really makes fun to stealth and it is really the only way to finish the mission - alive^^- Bullet CamWhat can i say ? The X.Ray Cam is so much fun and makes me fear of myself when i see my bullets hits balls,lungs ,brains and bones and make them broken or explode - really , i fear that^^- Big LevelsThe levels are really big and you can spend 1 or 2 hours with stealth progress till you have accomplish all mission objectives - there are also some side-missions like taking out spotting lights or trucks - wich is really cool- Level System and ExperienceYou gain EXP and Level Up , and the best is, you can level up in multiplayer AND singleplayer with the same character and it feels good that everything you make or kill is importent - because it gives you exp and you will rank up again and again -you can also find weopon parts in singleplayer campaign and then can modify your weapons for singleplayer and multiplayer with it - isnt that cool ?So - there are also a good Storyline, but it is not cinematic or hollywood like - it is more like a 08/15 story but it is okay -the gameplay itself makes the game fantastic !- You can take bodies and bring them to another point so that enemys will not see them and make alarm - like in splinter cell or hitman - i really like that ! its more realistic and stealth is fun ;DSo what can be better ?----------------------------- More weapons would be fine because you have only 4 Sniper Rifles to choose as i can see right now and only 4 MP Guns - that is not really much - and there are the same weapon mods for all 4 rifles - and theese are not that different anyway. So that could be more and better ;-(- Controls with Mous and Keyboard feels a bit slow and difficult,you will often keep hanging at rocks and barrels and something like this,also it does not feels very realistic how the character moves - this could be better !!!With a xbox one or 360 controller it makes a lot fun to play - but i dont recommend you to play with controller in multiplayer because aiming is no that fast as it would be with mouse^^- Some smaller bugs but no game breaking- Coop Multiplayer only is avaible with steam friends right now - but in the official manual they say we can play coop with friends OR wih online players - but there is no option at the moment to play with online players - so i dont know if it is a bug or if the manual tell us a lie ;D we will see if they will fix it because none of my friends have this game and so o cannot play coop - that really sucks ! I WANT COOP WITH ONLINE PLAYERS ! NOW ;DSo,at the end - it is a good game with nice atmosphere about a single elite sniper in special missions at the time of world war 2 in Africa - better then Sniper Elite 2 in some ways but no big jump or next gen game - but it makes fun if you like stealth games and coop-games ( hopefully with online players soon) with friends who also have this game-There are many achievements you can complete and some collectibles in singleplayer campaign-also there are some survival modes for single and coop and nice multiplayer game modes like a mode where the winner is the one with the longest distance kill - which is perfect mode for sniping ;DSo if you are interested in this game ! You can buy it , it makes fun - it is no broken or silly game like othersYou will have alot things to do and if you feel boring in campaign you can always play multiplayer or coop- level up TO BE THE BEST SNIPER ELITE EVER thx for readingMoon			"

Posted: October 4, 2015
												I've played a lot of, and beaten many times, Sniper Elite v2 on my Xbox 360. That was an excelent game, 10/10. However, this installment in the series is just garbage.Firstly, the amount of glitches and bugs present is ridiculous. For a polished game, especially after the non-glitched Sniper Elite v2, there are too many bugs (and very serious ones too) and don't seem like they are ever going to be fixed by the devs. Ex: I was mid-bullet cam (a quarter of the way through my first mission) and my game crashed, I had to quit it and restart the game. Another serious bug is when I beat the first mission only to proceed to the main menu and it saying that I haven't beat the first mission and I must restart it.Aside from the bugs and glitches, it is basically like Sniper Elite v2 but in a different environment, oh and I should mention that the environment is WAY TOO BRIGHT. Even if you turn down the gamma, the reflection of the world and brightness of the terrain is blinding, that is not realistic and extremely annoying after a while.There are, essentially, the same amount of guns, slightly more equipment; and the sound effects of weapons, germans, and the environment, are exactly the same. You can ""customize"" your rifle...but changing the reticle and material of the scope is not full customization.Also, long range sniping (like the second game) is barely present. The game is mostly close-quarters so you don't have much breathing room to stop and make a shot at a far distanced enemy. Snipers are meant to fire from long distances, not 5 feet away from the enemy.On the pleasent side, the multiplayer experience is fun, and the survival mode is alright. The bullet cam hasn't changed too much but it is still exciting to watch a bullet rip through a German soldier's nutsack. There is bountiful amount of enemies in a mission so you can just keep picking off those damn Nazi soldiers until you have had your killing fix. I can't think of any more good qualities of the game.So with everything (or what I can think of) said, I unfortunatelly cannot recommend Sniper Elite 3. I paid $21 on sale (for the game+season pass) which I regret. I'm trying to save you from spending your money on this let-down failure of a game. You can watch videos and read other reviews and I gaurentee you that most of them are negative towards this game.Rating? 5/10Note: My edits (or updates) were just grammar corrections.			"

												Feels like a watered down version of Metal Gear Solid V, there's more stealth than sniping, and neither of them is very good. The level design isn't exactly top-notch either. I thought this would be an upgrade from V2, but the only difference is that this one is 'open-word', and I'm not so sure if that's better.Unless you want to go guns blazing, you won't use your sniper rifle that much...

												<Review after gaining access via ""free weekend"">The shooting is awesome, the stealth is good. So why the downvote?A simple, yet extremely annoying bug. Given the game isn't new, how this bug still exists in the game is a mystery.What bug is this? Well - you line up a shot, you fire... nothing happens. The enemy is still alive. You think ""well, OK, perhaps I twitched at the last moment and missed?"". You line up a second shot, fire... another miss. What gives? Well, you're shooting the small wall / barrier / plank in front if you rather than the target. The scope suggests you're well above it, but nope, you're not shooting where you think you are. The ""hold breath"" also shows the bullet should hit the target (not obstructed).This bug appeared so many times during my relatively short game, than I really don't wish to bother with it any more. Which is a damn shame, because the game otherwise seems great.EDIT:I think it might boil down to something similar to this:

												This is my first time playing a sniper elite game. So I apologise if I get anything wrong. I feel like this game is not very story based. Yes, there are a few cutscenes but thats about it. I feel as if the story is not gripping enough to grab my attention. The missions drag on for ages, and I sometimes lose track of what I'm doing or why I'm doing this mission. Every mission feels the same to me. I have to go and destroy/kill someone or something and kill multiple enimies along the way. The map is nice and big, but the game feels linear. It's like invisible barriers all over the map and I can't climb on certain things and go to certain areas. Overall, I think this game needs a bit more story depth, sand-box approach and more creative missions. If the devs do that then this game would easily be worth the money, but for now it is not and I would not recommend this game "

												I'm just glad I got this game for FREE with my AMD gold reward.The overall game design sucks, shows the developers aren't up to the task. It all starts with the kinky cutscenes that could have been done in year 2000. The intro is that bad and uninteresting, you just have to skip the trash.Animations suck, level design is a joke, sound isn't statisfying at all, story...what story?, character movement feels wrong, A.I sucks (they're just cannon fodder), the HUD and all the messages in it to guide the player through even the easiest situations are so annoying - it plays like some arcade shooter such as CoD but in third person and much worse than CoD. In fact, any CoD is the better choice.The graphics are so extremely unspectacular, everything looks way too bloomy and clean. Character faces show no emotion, they rather remind me of games such as Gothic3. Level graphics show, that everything has been just thrown together in the maps. Nothing seems to be really handcrafted, just dropped randomly on the terrain from a larger ""pre-fabs"" library.The game is called Sniper Elite but the Sniper Elite titles were never really focussed on real life sniping, instead it's some simplistic long range arcade mass shooter, the sniping is more like camping. Going rambo is much more effective and solves the game much faster however. lolA Sniper game should give you the impression that you are alone and surrounded by danger. That you HAVE to land every shot and maybe sometimes take your time by just sitting in one place, as stealthy as possible, for a while to accomplish this.In this game however, you run around like a chicken with your rifle, pistol, machine gun and shoot stuff from different spots all the time. Like some uber soldier from another planet.			"

Could not wait for this to hit my Steam 'mailbox'.  i have now spent 123 hours playing this with only the Hunt the Grey Wolf DLC and still have yet to really even hit the mutli player or the co-op and have yet to make all the achievements for the single platyer game.  I am loving this to the end and back again.  Al these players busting the companys♥♥♥♥♥about their lawsuit or the game only having 8 mission. well they need to go change their diapers and quit the whinning.  This is a SNIPER game its not a run and gun type of game.  You have to play stealthly or you gonna die.  Plain and simple.  You like to take your time with a good sniper game then you will be satisfied with Sniper Elite 3.  You want a run and gun type game then go to something else you won't like it.			"

												It has better stealth mechanics than SEv2 but almost everything else from story to shooting to weapon variety to level quality is just worse enough to not be bad in and of itself, but just enough to make it inferior to SEv2.Two real improvements are stealth that works properly and no regen health which means far fewer cheesy instakills. These are huge improvements but the game suffers for too many other niggling little issues. SEv2 is simply more fun to play.			"

												nice graphics (if you can run them). But the gameplay can get very tedious very quickly and it seems like the levels have the same structure the whole way through. It should be called: ""Shoot people when the shot is masked man.""			"

												It has better stealth mechanics than SEv2 but almost everything else from story to shooting to weapon variety to level quality is just worse enough to not be bad in and of itself, but just enough to make it inferior to SEv2.Two real improvements are stealth that works properly and no regen health which means far fewer cheesy instakills. These are huge improvements but the game suffers for too many other niggling little issues. SEv2 is simply more fun to play.			"

												Well now that I have finished the 3rd installment of Sniper Elite, I am a fan of the franchaise. Well I was a fan after the first one anyway.So how do I begin to review this game.Let me start by saying that the gamemakers finally got most of this game on the correct track. After playing the first two, this one sort of forces you to play more as a sniper or face enemies coming down one you if you are spotted. There is also an XP ranking system within the game, so quiet sniped killes give you more XP than making the shot and alerting other soldiers. You have the cover of noise to help you AND enemies can now start to detect you. Just like in FarCry 3. If you have played that game,you will know what I am talking about. And if you are detected, you have to relocated. You don't have to, but it does help. You can also tag enemies with your binoculars, one by one. This does help in the game as well.A notable feature added to this game is the stealth kill. You sneak up from behind and make a silent kill with your knife. Again, like the takedown in FarCry 3. AND, the WELROD is your FRIEND!!!! Use it wisely.There are 8 missions all together, and within those missions, you have objectives and optional objectives to do. You will do wise to do all the optional objectives as well. But unlike in SE2, the missions take longer! I myself was taking about 1-2 hours per mission. I was even viewing Youtube to locate items for the game and it helped greatly. And the missions are not always easy. So you get a lot of gameplay on this one. I did this one in 30 hours. I did SE2 in 11 hours. So hence the difference.It's pretty much the same routine gameplay as well. But in the desert now. It was a nice change.Now for a couple of negatives....The graphics can be heavy. I was on lowest settigs and the first mission, the gameplay was choppy, it got better when you got out of the main battle and into the mountains. But could be my system, but just a heads up. The choppiness went away after awhile on the other maps. I only ran into very few instances where it slowed down.The ohter thing and this is NOT my system, I can guarantee you that. The players movements.It seems to be a half and half of the first two games. The first one having horrible movement, like if you were to just tap your direction key, you'd move a lot. This made it difficult to get angles to snipe at. SE2, the movement was a lot better, You could stop pretty fast from running and was able to make angle shots easier. NOW it seems that in this one, OK you can stop pretty easy, but if you are running and get caught on a corner or obatacle, you get stuck for a brief moment, just like in the first one. It's rather annoying that they did this and again, making tight angle shots and all you want to do is inch over... forget it... It's hard.But if you can overcome those small nuances, then you will have a really enjoyable experience with this game. Oh ya, the bullet cam... It's great still, but they made the bullet look too big now. It's unrealistic. It looks like dumb actually and at least with the bullet size in SE2, It was more realistic and believable.The only ONE other thing that was annoying actually was ending the missions. Ok cool, you had to maybe provide cover for an escapee or create a distraction. But a few missions required that you take out tanks. Kind of opposite of stealth here. Maybe it's me, but you do the whole mission perfect and in the end, you have to Rambo you way out sometimes. Not exactly the most ideal of things.Happy sniping!			"

												Simply, this is not a snipping game anymore!!! You rarely have to use your sniper, and the game does not reward you at all for snipping!!! You are encouraged to sneak, do stealth kills, and use your silenced pistole!!!If you fire sniper once, you have to retreat couple of meters until bar empties. and if you fire your sniper 2 times, then hae to retreat a bit more to make enemies go to their postions again!!! And the game keeps going like this to the end!!AI is so dumb, it does not matter what diffic setting you choose, each enemy moves in the same dirction back and forth!!!Most of the time you have to walk ducked down, becz the character will run without you using key or button, and enemies will hear you.No bosses fights, and no challenging events. It is purely a cheap stealth game that does not encourage anything new or tries to push you to think!!!Still worth playing for 10$ but not for a full price or even half-price			"

												So, Sniper Elite 3. Fun game, nothing to say about that, I really enjoyed shooting people in the back of the head with the result being their brains smeerd all over the wall. I really liked it, until.... my key got deactivated. first thing I though, must me a error. then I saw that the game had PURCHASE instead of PLAY, then I thought, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I do recomend the game, but not for the full price. I'm not saying DON'T BUY IT. I'm saying, wait for sale or a third party seller that rebelion said they have clean keys. If you havend heard, 7050 keys were stolen and mine was one of them. So do be carefull when buying through a third party. Have fun shooting fritz in the balls and see you guys later			"

												If you loved Sniper Elite 2, steer clear of this game. If you enjoy 'dramatic' set pieces and are 11 years old, buy Sniper Elite 3.I played through the first 2 missions on 'authentic' or whatever they called the realistic setting. First mission is a big set piece where you take out a tank that literally cannot kill you, even if you're standing in the open. The rest of the enemies were positioned in single file facing all in the same direction, so you can kill them from behind with ease. Even when they did happen to notice me, they shook their heads frantically and screamed, giving me plenty of time to shoot them 4 times in the chest, reload and finally kill them. A disappointing game.			"

												whenever I wasn't setting up a shot, emptying my lungs, and pumping a sharp metal bullet through the thick skull of an unsuspecting enemy soldier, I was frustrated with Sniper Elite III. Not because the surrounding mechanics are broken or the levels are poorly structured, as the subsidiary elements of this third-person shooter are, for the most part, serviceable. However, every action building up to you actually pulling the trigger of a rifle feels more like a chore than an interesting setup for the perfect shot. There's an undeniable satisfaction that stems from the glorious slow-motion kills that abound in Sniper Elite III, but missions tend to promote stealthy, silent takedowns rather than the grotesque headshots it does so well.Fortunately, what the game does best is on full display early on. The level design in Sniper Elite III is more open than previous games in the series, often encouraging shots being fired from more than 300 meters away. Instead of funneling you down a straight path, each of the eight locations in the campaign presents you with a sniping sandbox where creativity leads to better shooting and stronger positioning. Bullishly rushing headfirst into enemy territory is always an option, but the grizzled protagonist crumples to the dirt after just a pair of well-placed shots. Silent steps often lead to better vantage points, and with so many routes to choose from in any given level, the method by which the objective is completed is up to you.That doesn't make this an open-world game, though. There are various side objectives like shutting down search lights or sabotaging the enemy's explosives supply, but there's still a clear path to completion within every mission. An ever-present objective marker reminds you that just 200 meters away lies a folder of intel that could greatly benefit the Allied forces, and all you need to do to collect it is pick off whatever patrolling soldiers stand in the way.You're not required to kill everything with a heartbeat in order to progress, but the innate satisfaction that comes with long-range marksmanship is almost too great to pass up. After perching atop a sniper nest and locating a viable target, you have the option of steadying your breath and adding an additional red reticle that illustrates exactly where your bullet will drop. Once you fire off that perfect shot, the camera ignores the man behind the rifle and instead follows the round as it leisurely approaches its mark. It's a remarkable scene that all but erases auxiliary threats, letting you enjoy the slow-motion mayhem. The crack of your barrel will likely alert anything with a heartbeat nearby, but in that very moment, all that matters is the journey of a single bullet. "

												Short honest answer here is that the gameplay is amazing, fun, smart, somewhat new, and it is just good time. However, this game CTD extremely frequently so much so it is unplayable. Luckily there is a fix for this, but you have to roll back your Nvidia Driver Version to at least version 376.33. If you are experiencing frequent CTDs then that is the likely problem you are having. So check your Nvidia Driver Version.-Quote From Rebellion-""Nvidia has confirmed there is an issue with their more recent drivers that may be behind crashes some players have been reporting recently.They are working on a fix and we will try to keep you updated with any developments. For anyone with an Nvidia card experiencing crashes, for now please try rolling back your drivers to at least 376.33. Obviously this is not ideal, and is not intended as a permanent solution.""The roll back was indeed the fix I need to get this game running properly. No more CTDs:) However, I still can't recommend this game. While it is really fun, it is plagued by this CTD problem. Even though there is a fix for it... it is not a great one, and I can't recommend you buy this game at the moment. If they do fix this issue without you having to roll back the I do suggest you buy this game if you are on the fence about it. Hopefully, I will remember to edit this review if they do fix this issue.			"

												I had that game installed in my library for some time now, and I didn't remember why I never played it.After an hour trying again I remembered.The game run like♥♥♥♥♥♥(we are talking 30fps on a pc that can run anything 60+) and it crash every 15minutes.Too bad, I loved SE2, but that one is just way to broken.

												Oh beleive me if you are one of those people who wants just a little bit of complexity in a game? YOU GOT IT. All those COD fans out there hate this game because it is ""Difficult"" or ""Impossible"". That is because they dont realize you should NOT run and gun in this game. Your a sniper. A ghost. Not a grunt. If you want a challenge you found it. Even me (Im a bit of an elite in stealth mechanics) had trouble handling this game at times. It requires alot of forethought and that is what makes this game very enjoyable!Oh and try to get a freind with you as well. Nothing is more satisfying than blowing 2 guys away quietly with 2 guns on them!			"

												Comparing this to V2, this game is meh. It doesn't feel like theres a war going on, every level is exaclty the same. You spawn in some outskirt of an arena like base, infiltrate base, do the thing. Tank/armor pops out of nowhere. Kill tank to leave. Win. At least in V2 you actually felt like a sniper observing a war and picking people off from a distance, even observing russians and germans fighting it out. This game its just you alone, and the game mechanics get boring.			"

Rating2/10Yes, I have only played two hours, but that is because I am hoping to get a refund. If it is denied, then I will finish this game. Sniper Elite III is in the top five worst games I have ever played. Infact, I went and bought Sniper Elite V2 first because I wanted to play this but I didn't want to ruin the experience of the older game. Turns out that V2 was MUCH, MUCH better than this, even with its near lack of any stealth and stupid AI.The level design is the worst aspect of the game. It just feels really cramped and linear, even more so than V2. What I finished of the story was really quite boring. Rebellion did well in most the stealth aspects (despite the dumb AI that forgets that they just saw their friend be brutally gunned down in front of them after a few minutes) but it felt really... forced. The game is far too difficult to complete unless you use stealth, and the only glaring problem with it that most of your time will be spent getting to the position to welrod people in the head or stab them in the neck. The sound masking is not extensive enough, so most of the time you won't even have a chance to use your sniper rifle, despite the game being called 'Sniper Elite'.The AI are improved over V2, but I would think that in fricking 2014 they would have the capability to make them smart enough to not be: Blind, Deaf, and forgetful as hell to the point where they can't seem to recall after a few minutes that there are dead bodies lying all around the place because a sniper has been shooting people up, and that they need to find this sniper and kill him.I would recommend in place of this Dishonoured, Hitman or Metal Gear Solid five. Even though I was not impressed by V2 or III, I am interested in the upcoming Sniper Elite IV in Feburary 2017, since from what I have read many of these problems have been rectified.			"

												Overall its an ok game, not worth the the price they are charging.  Wait for a sale.  Ballistics are a little wacky for the ranges you are shooting, for me I kept on getting frustrated with the amount of bullet drop over rather short ""sniping"" distances, under 150 meters, which doesn't require a sniper, and also the auto weapons bullet spread after very short burst and the amount of time it takes for it to return to center mass.  15 dollars is what I spent and i got my moneys worth out of it.  Haven't played all the way through and maybe i'll be pleasantly surprised if I manage to make myself complet it and if so will change my recommendation, but still....not for full price....like...half at least. Especially with lovely DLC's that make the game sooooo much more enjoyable right :D....*sigh*			"

												Ok first of all I have to mention that I spent nearly 30 hours in previous titles 10 hours in first sniper elite a very good, now quite an archaic game in terms of graphics, but still playable and 20 or more hours in sniper elite v2 and I can honestly tell you that sniper elite 3 isn't as good as the previous games, I will try to tell you why in these few senteces. Sniper Elite 3 has little to no innovations, sure there are stealth kills from behind and you can customize your loadout before the mission and the missions are wide open and they can be completed different ways but thats about it. Those are the only new things sniper elite 3 developers brought us. The game suffers from a lot of bugs like pin point accurate enemies with machine guns and extremely accurate enemy snipers, the annoyingly quick tanks and armour and lots of weird bugs in terms of enemy detection and so on. The graphics seem a bit better compared to previous sniper elite v2, but not by much. it all feels like it was done way too quick for my taste, campaign isn't as lenghty as in sniper elite v2, you only have 8 campaign missions and thats it, some of them are extremely linear, like the last two missions, which are quite difficult too and overall the game just feels rushed, the hunt for the grey wolf mission dlc isn't as good as I expected to be, but at least the three lovely maps about protecting churchill were worth it. Overall I would give this game a fair 7/10 and I would reccomend this game to fans of the genre			"

Kill Hitler, change history, if only this guy was real. Ha. Well let's get on shall we? I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite v2 like the AI for example has been fixed in SE3. I also like how Stealth is even more important here as it was on SEV2, if you decide to go Rambo, don't. Seriously, just don't. You're gonna get ganked and if you're not fast enough, you're dead. I like the Close Quarters takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes, I did notice some bugs where for example the bullet came out of my barrel in reverse, directed at me, but ended up showing where I hit my target, doesn't happen too often but I think this is something Rebellion should look into. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with, you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him, you really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and adjust your aim accordingly. Great game, if you're into sniping, buy this..Immidiately. For me personally, it is the best game I bought this year.			"

												Here is my review, Sorry I didnt want to play for more than two hours so I could refund this joke of a game. I defintly would not recommend by this unless you like linear sniper games this game was extremly boring the tutorial the first mission made me laugh on how stupid it was people with binoculars just sit there and let them snipe them I hate this game its one of tjose walk through shoot him, Blow up that, Grab this. I am tired of this bullcrap sniper elite v2 had it but this is a laughble pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2/10 would refund again.			"

												Ok first of all I have to mention that I spent nearly 30 hours in previous titles 10 hours in first sniper elite a very good, now quite an archaic game in terms of graphics, but still playable and 20 or more hours in sniper elite v2 and I can honestly tell you that sniper elite 3 isn't as good as the previous games, I will try to tell you why in these few senteces. Sniper Elite 3 has little to no innovations, sure there are stealth kills from behind and you can customize your loadout before the mission and the missions are wide open and they can be completed different ways but thats about it. Those are the only new things sniper elite 3 developers brought us. The game suffers from a lot of bugs like pin point accurate enemies with machine guns and extremely accurate enemy snipers, the annoyingly quick tanks and armour and lots of weird bugs in terms of enemy detection and so on. The graphics seem a bit better compared to previous sniper elite v2, but not by much. it all feels like it was done way too quick for my taste, campaign isn't as lenghty as in sniper elite v2, you only have 8 campaign missions and thats it, some of them are extremely linear, like the last two missions, which are quite difficult too and overall the game just feels rushed, the hunt for the grey wolf mission dlc isn't as good as I expected to be, but at least the three lovely maps about protecting churchill were worth it. Overall I would give this game a fair 7/10 and I would reccomend this game to fans of the genre			"

												Really just... incredibly dull and not fun. The levels are poorly designed and the enemies aren't challenging and the storyline just isn't all that great. Coop mode isn't a whole lot of fun either. The game is just not amusing enough to keep playing. It's just not any improvement over Sniper Elite 2.Go play Sniper Elite 2. It's more fun, and can be gotten on sale for much cheaper. This one just isn't fun.			"

												The game is fairly optimized well on the PC.The game is fun for old school Sniper Elite fans especially with the X-Ray kill cam.There are new mechanics implemented into the game where when you fire your weapon enemies may hear the sound and you are required to move to a different location from being detected.The AI is pretty bad in normal settings where you can walk right up next to an enemy or in front of him and knife him.There are some confusing way points.Overall the game is pretty good Rating 7.5/10This is what the game looks like on the best settings and it looks pretty good on the PS4  PC Ultra Settings 1080phttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVWEzE2SdFM[youtube]YVWEzE2SdFM[/youtube][yt]YVWEzE2SdFM[/yt]			"

												It's called Sniper Elite but you spend most of your time sneaking around and frankly if I wanted to play a stealth game Hitman and Metal Gear Solid would do a way better job.  For starters the AI is dumb as rocks and you'll need to fire multiple times for the enemy to send anyone to check your location, and even then you'll largely have the time to run to another spot.Well, if you can find a spot that is, because levels are really limited with invisible walls everywhere. Of course you could always go for stealth melee kills (of course it has that) but with the AI it's almost cheating.  Last options would be your MP and pistol but somehow people just fall down and get up like nothing happened when shot once, so you really have to go for headshots. Note that a shot to the head to someone wearing a helmet doesn't make any noise, so as long as nobody directly witness the death you'll be fine.At least the game is short and doesn't have too many weapons or diverging paths so replayability is low.  There's also very little in term of story, not that it's any good either.Nothing to see here, move along.			"

												If you like first person shooters, where you need to try and be silent but deadly, this is a game for you. It has amazing graphics and amazing story line, there arn't many glitches which i like.EDIT: ive gotten more hours into the game and ive meat some friends that play it so i know alot more about it. First sniper elite 3 has coop campaign which is only for two player.. obviously. nothing changes in the campaign but thats okay its still fun to do with someone. there is also overwatch, survival and solo survival. Overwatch is where you have to scout ahead and complete certain objectives while the other person (sniper) watches your back. Survival is where you have to survive 15 waves.. each 3 waves of my expirience on beachhead there is an armored truck and you need to take that down. there are still ammo boxes and relocations needed but you dont have to be quiet. Solo survival is the exact same thing as survival... just by yourself. You can also play Deathmatch team deathmatch capture teh flagand more with maps... and you ccan play with more than 1 person... obviously again. There are no quickscoping and yelling sqeakers... you may have them every once in a while but in my opinion parents should not have 7 and under play this game... alot of testical shots and slow movement... GO BACK TO CODDo i rate this game up? Yes.			"

												 Game is way too glitchy and sometimes unresponsive, that's already bad but you can still enjoy the game if you mind and ignore some bugs here and there. You can't fully customize the movement keys (like an option to allow walk toggle instead of forcing you to hold Left Alt everytime you don't want to walk like a hunchback) and that makes movement clunky at times and literally the thing that is going to get you killed sometimes and for a stealth game like this it is just unnaceptable. You can still bite the bullet with an X-Ray but for me it is not worth it, also the DLC is way overpriced even if only for MP stuff, cosmetic skins and some weapons			"

												The follow bullet thing is cool but it happens for every single sniper kill. youre required to kill 50 people a mission and to watch it 50 times a mission is annoying. AI is terrible, story is horendous and so is the voice acting. I only pushed myself to finish the story because I sent the money and I didnt want it to be a waste.			"

												A fun sniping sim marred by serious technical problems, and fickle AI.Was good fun right up until the game decided to overwrite my quicksave with an autosave during a failure state (yes, the game actually autosaved when I failed a crucial objective) and overwrote the ONLY quickload slot it gives you. Epic programming guys.			"

												Sniper Elite 3 made good improvments over SE v2  it has better loadout edit wider maps and enemys dont know exactly where you are after one shot so you can relocate and go ahead.The gfx are also improved and the whole game seems like a solid Port, also the xrays are even more fun in the new game and they never get old its always a pleasure to watch them.The PC Version also has Dedicated Servers thats always a plus because matchmaking sucks.The Main Game took me 8 Hours on Normal Difficult but i will do it again on the Hardest.All in all i had a blast with this game for me it was a nice mixture of Arcade/Strategy/Stelth combat that never felt to realistic or to CoD like.I would give it 1 8/10			"
