												The Next Big Thing, is a point and click adventure game developed by Pendulo Studios. Being released in February of 2011 on both PC and iOS devices. Gameplay in TNBT is your standard point and click action. You can walk around the areas fairly freely, allowing you to interact with objects and talk to other characters in the game. Obviously with all point and clicks the game play is not why you are playing. The puzzles in the game are somewhat entertaining as well, some of them really make you think, but are not so obscure that you have no chance of working them out. I had to resort to a guide for a few of them, but that is more than can be said for other Point and click titles out there.  The game’s UI is one of the better I have seen in this genre, it is very easy to navigate and to select objects and use them in different ways.  Even though the game doesn’t have any sort of in game tutorial, there is no real need for one since it is all so self-explanatory. The game has a really nice art style. Whilst the game does have “cut scenes”, this is done in the same style and effect as the actual real time stuff. You can only really tell a difference with the frame rates.  The character animations are all fantastic too; there isn’t one weird looking walk, or strange facial expression to be seen here, a very nice looking game in my opinion. As with all good point and click games, you should expect a half decent story, well The Next Big Thing certainly delivers there. I went into the game expecting it to be a sort of political tale, I was wrong.  The plot is set Los Angeles in an alternative reality. The two main characters, Murray and Allaire are both detectives and you set on the assignment to cover a kidnapping and conspiracy.  There is some witty banter between the two characters, and this is what drew me into the game right from the get-go. The dialogue between all characters is all top of the range and I was overwhelmed with how good they all sounded. The story does have a few clichés, but overall it is captivating enough that it kept me engaged right until the end. There isn’t a real difficulty level to this type of game. It is only hard if you cannot work out how to progress with puzzles. But like I said above, none of the puzzles are so strange and obscure that you cannot work them out by using a little bit of thinking juice. This is something which I admire in point and click games nowadays and even though some may be a little let down by this, The Next Big Thing is a casual experience.The full story took me just about seven hours to get through – for a point and click game I think that is just about the right length, it allowed the game to reach an end which tied up most loose ends, and it leaves you wanting more of the same, without over staying it’s welcome. There isn’t any replay ability sadly since it is very linear. I didn’t run into any major technical problems during my time playing. The game runs at all resolutions and given that the game is mostly pre-rendered graphics, it can run on any type of hardware (it’s an iOS game so….).  The only slight problem I had, was that the game doesn’t lock your cursor in the game’s window; if this was any other game than a point and click, this would have been a major issue, but since it is a slow paced adventure game I can forgive it there; but honestly in this day and age, these types of issues should be mopped up. The Next Big Thing is an absolutely stellar game and one that fans of the genre should really be checking out. The game’s interesting story line and good looking art style, on top of some quality voice acting, you can’t really go wrong with checking this title out.  The price tag of £6, 99 is well and truly on point with the amount of content and quality of it on show as well, so definitely picks it up when you can.

												La version française de ce commentaire vient après.It is a really funny game! If you an adventure and point clicker gamer, this is one for you. A big bunch of crazy dumb monsters, some good jokes and well-made characters and you're in ;o) Some nice puzzle to go through. Some are tougher than others, but all in all it’s not a hard game. You have to be careful to every details in each scenery you’re going through (for instance, some of the things you will notice, that could be useful further in the game).Also you will going to play two different parts which make this game more interesting as you will have to deal with the temper of each one.The story is well made with some original development during the game. Overall, it is a game in the vein of Pendulo Studio and what If I may say so, a nice Lucasart revamp. Hope to see some more (like the Runaway saga)!-------------------------------C’est vraiment un jeu très marrant! Si vous êtes un joueur de jeu d’aventure en point and click, alors c’est un jeu pour vous. Un bon nombre de monstres idiots et fous, de bonnes blagues et des personnages bien fait et vous y êtes ;o)De bons puzzles à passer. Certains sont plus durs que d’autres, mais l’un dans l’autre, ce n’est pas un jeu très difficile. Vous devez faire attention à tous les détails dans chacune des scènes que vous allez traverser (notamment, pour certaines choses que vous allez voir, cela pourra vous servir plus tard)Aussi, vous allez jouer deux personnages différents ce qui rend le jeu plus intéressant du fait que vous aurez à composer avec le caractère de chacun. L’histoire est bien faite avec un développement assez original durant le jeu.En conclusion, c’est un jeu tout à fait dans la trempe de Pendulo Studio et si je puis le dire, un beau clin d’œil à Lucasart. J’espère en voir d’autre (comme la saga Runaway) ! "

												The Next Big Thing was a really fun and entertaining game to play throughout. It's relatively short and the puzzles are pretty easy, but the stylish graphics and witty (often underhanded) humor really makes it a joy to play. If you're looking for a light, quick adventure game to run through over a weekend, this should definitely be on your list.			"

												After watching gameplay of Pendulo Studio's new game 'Yesterday', i was keen to see what other titles they had to offer. Looking at  earlier titles from the  company i wasn't exspecting too much in ways of gameplay/storyline as these games lacked the reviews that Yesterday had received. I'm not sure if i just wasn't paying attention when they came out, but this was the first i had heard of these titles.For a point and click game 'The Next BIG Thing' did not dissapoint, providing a variety of areas and 'puzzles' to last a few solid hours. Being a somewhat indie title i didn't bank on the game being the standard 9hrs but was pleasntly surprized by the games 2-3hr playtime.Some of the puzzles are insanely complex and require you to either be playing on easy for hints or to have access to a walkthrough (praise google!). As certain items open up key dialogue etc, without the game informing you as such.Overall the story is rather weird but seems to work rather well with the genre. The game takes a while to get used to and seems to require some prior knowledge of controls as well as some minor character information. These things seemed easy enough to overcome and fill in the gaps yourself.tldr: This is a very fun game for those who like a good puzzle/adventure/point and click! Also its on sale at the moment for $2.50 and its well worth the price tag.			"

												A unique Point&Click adventure game.The Next BIG Thing is a good Point&click adventure game. I'm glad I found this game because a PC magazine recommend it, and yes, this game is good.Where to start? If you're a lover of Point&Click games, you don't want to miss this one. It has a wacky puzzles, weird mysteries, and a lot things you will love.It gave me a wonderful experience during playing it. Well, it's short, you can finish it with 4-5 hours, but hey, with a good story and experience you will get, it will worth it.It is really a good game. Something you don't want to miss if you're a Point&Click games lover, and a good start if you're new to Point&Click adventure games.9/10			"

												8/10 Pendulo is fab. Pendulo loves us all.Full disclosure: I've had a number of jobs on horror/b-movies, this game was recommended to me by a director I worked with.The Next Big Thing is a very well put together Point-n-clicker set in a schlock B-movie world. with a style and a sense of humour ideally suited to the setting. The story is very good and makes as much sense as anything in that world. Play as 2 very different characters through different chapters, solving puzzles in different ways. The graphics are high quality, well animated, and fit together. Sounds are good, music is good enough to listen to through the game. Dialogue is well acted and natural sounding, so an advantage over Daedalic there.The only downside is that it's now over. It was short, and I don't see myself going back to it again.  The story's done in a few hours, and there's no sequel hook, which kinda limits the bang-for-buck. Look out for it in a sale.			"

												The Next BIG Thing is one of the funniest, quirkiest adventure games that nobody's ever heard of. The characters are great and it has touches that are reminiscent of the old classics of the genre. While the puzzles can be a bit difficult to figure out, the game as a unique hint system that will usually set you on the right course. Whether you love adventure games, comedy, interesting characters or a just good story, you owe it to yourself to check this out. (There's even a demo!)			"

												This game is epic. It's so funny and crazy, I wish there would be more like this.I don't even know where to start.Do you like cute and healthy humor? Do you like this kind of animated-movie graphics? Then this game is for you.The story is a huge nonsense and that's why I love it so much. But in the end everything will make sense, don't worry. Uhm, well almost everything...  The locations, the events, the characters will look out of the place and crazy first but later you will get used to them. It's not an easy task to talk about the quirkiness of this game, it has to be experienced. It's unique and crazy.The characters are so weird and interesting, I love them all. Their design choice and personality are something you will never see in other games. Here are some aspects in short:Pros:- crazy, unique- excellent voice acting (!)- great, likeable characters, from Liz to the punching robots all of them are perfect- chaotic but engaging story- very funny, will make you laugh- breaks the barrier of ordinary games (you will see what I'm talking about)- easy puzzlesCons:- Some puzzles are illogical- sometimes you will have to pixel-hunt- the puzzles are easy but figuring out their mechanism can be very hard- there are times when you may have to use a walkthroughOverall:The ending/epilogue is so heartwarming and great  if this would be a theater play I would stand up and clap with tears in my eyes.So overall this game has to be experienced. It's not like any other adventure game. This is an overlooked and underrated, beautiful and entertaining piece of art. I recommend it to everyone who likes unique and funny games. Definitely one of the best adventure games I ever played, I will keep this story and the lovely characters in my heart forever. Dan Murray, what a guy!			"

												As an adventure game it is pretty much as you would expect, some pixel hunting and puzzle solving. What this game does well is the humor and the story, the characters are good and the puzzles range from easy to medium. There was only a couple that I struggled with but one of those was simply because I missed a doorway to another room so it was my own pixel hunting prowess that failed me not the puzzle itself. The downside is the puzzles when easy are so easy that feels pointless making you solve them but I did not feel that way enough times to make this a bad game.I would recommend this game to adventure game lovers and even those who like a light hearted and humorous short game to play between potentially larger more complex and demanding titles in your library. As adventure games go it is about the right size in length to feel like spent your time enjoying it and not becoming a chore to get to the end. Speaking of the end it was a let down I felt (I won't say why as that would be a spoiler), but I felt it was predictable and could have been better but it does not damage the quality of the enjoyment too much that I had playing this title.How much the game is worth is subjective so I can't say it is worth it's price x to other people because everyone values things differently. What I would say is I found it to be worth what I paid which I picked it up on a 50% off sale a while back, I would have even been tempted to pay full price though having played it now based on how much I enjoyed it but I cannot say others would feel the same way. I still find more enjoyment from Daedalics adventure games than Pendulos titles, Pendulos adventure games have a certain charm but my personal preference is Daedalics style. This game is probably my favorite one from Pendulo that I have played in a long time, much better than the Runaway series I feel.			"

												If you like adventure games and don't give this game a chance, I find you to be very dis.....concerting. All jokes aside, the game pays homage to era gone by with an enjoyable and comedic story. The puzzles are pretty straight forward, but if you do get stuck, there are lots of options to help you power through built into the game. I do have to mention that there is one puzzle in particular that is pretty rough. It's been a deal breaker to some on the game, but I looked up a tutorial on YouTube and made it through. I felt like the ending came pretty abruptly and I kind of wish for more explanation, but for the price I can't complain. This game is a no brainer to pick up during a Steam sale and it's a quick little story that you will thoroughly enjoy!But for real, Dan Murray, what a guy!!			"

												As with all the others done by the same company it's a fun adventure title with a lot of laughs. However the flower puzzle near the end can die in a coal fire for all I care, argh.It seems to be based on the same UI as the last Runaway game, meaning you get a button to ask for help and a button to see all the hotspots just in case you believe you are missing something, but not sure what. not to mention, the help was far better too.Love the ending and it's quite a interesting political story to it too.

												I have loved the Pendulo Studios' games I've played so far (The Runaway series). They've all been corky humorous with likeable characters and excellent artwork. This game follows in the same vein, but have stepped up the wackiness and plot-line compared to the previous games. They might have taken it a slight bit too far in this one, but I still enjoyed it immensely. I found it to be a bit short, which is ""dis....concerning"", and a bit too easy. It seems to me that this was planned to be a first of a new series, as the ending opens up for a sequel. And I find myself hoping that a sequel will eventually show up. But if it does, I also hope that they make it longer and tone down the wackiness just a little.If you are into point & click adventure games close to the old school stuff this is a no-brainer. It is cheap and definitely worth your money and time. It should even be possible to get it dirt cheap during a sale.I can only rate it a 7 out of 10 because of its length (or lack thereof :oP).Happy gamingJ3ST3R			"

												I don't think I played a Pendulo title I didn't like yet (their Runaway Series still remains one of the better adventure games I ever played), but The Next Big Thing really takes the cake! The puzzles are excellent, the characters witty and quite eccentric, and the story had me laughing and at times (I must admit) shrieking with excitement. On the technical side, I enjoyed the art, and the choice of various difficulty settings (the easiest enabling hints and hotspots, for the more casual player), and the in-game hint system provides just enough help to point you in the right direction, without depriving you of the pleasure of figuring things out for yourself. All in all, it is a title I would definitely recommend!			"

												The Next BIG Thing is a fun, bizzare, and silly adventure game by Pendulum Studios that is an indirect sequel to a Hollywood Monsters, and adventure game released in 1997 in Europe. It has charming characters, and again, a bizzare storyline. By the way, the game is bizzare. Did you know that? The Next BIG Thing also has very beautiful cell-shaded 3D graphics with complimentary 2D backgrounds, and a nice soundtrack. Despite this, the game has a few jokes that fall flat, some puzzles that are baffling, and pacing that sometimes feels a little ""off."" Overall, even with it's few flaws, I will have to say that The Next BIG Thing is a great, fun adventure that I'd recommend to any fan of the genre (if they can handle the ""high creativity"").			"

												It passes my recommendation for a short, entertaining point and click adventure game. The voice acting was decent, the animation was visually impressive, very cartoon like.  I did have to use a walkthrough a couple of times because the solution was not obvious at all, but for the most part it was easy enough to figure out.  The music was great. I did have a problem with the story though.  You really don't know what's going on until about halfway through the game, which wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't so short.  I felt like this was a continuation of another game as the characters around you aren't really explained and its taken for granted that you know who they are.  I almost gave it a downvote just because the backstory wasn't there to explain what's going on from the beginning and why you should care.  Overall 6/10			"

												A very well made ""point-and-click"" game. The characters are likeable and emotional, and the story is well done, though quite simple at times.   The game adds on a variety of ideas that help simplify some of the tediousness that normally stems from point-and click adventures, such as allowing your character to fast travel to a location by double clicking it, instead of having to sit and watch as your character crosses a large space simply to investigate something and skipping faster through dialogue by left clicking. The graphics are well done, in a cell shaded manner, and very aptly portray the emotions of the characters, seeming more so like an animated movie than a game.   The characters present are all very unique from each other, though I wish we got to see more of the ones that are so commonly mentioned, such as the Octopus Haring, who is mentioed to be a pretty bad guy. The game could have also done to be a bit longer, with a little more puzzles, and the ending before the final scene could have been a little more fleshed out, but I still finished the game satisfied. The final scene of the game was very well done, and actually caught me off guard. I applaud them for that one.			"

												I haven't played all there is to play in the way of point and click adventure games and I am a new comer to the genre. Have played a total of 5 games from this genre? And I think The Next Big Thing is the best of them. The puzzles mostly make sense, a lot of times in these quirky games the solutions are improbably fantastical. There is still some of that here but I never pulled any hair out from it. This game also has one of the most helpful features that I've come accross for the genre, which is a button that lightly highlights the objects that you can interact with. So many times in other games have I endured frustrations of simply having overlooked a necessary item because it blended in so well to the background. GONE IS THAT! Now, to the storyline, characters, and dialogue that, in my mind, are the entire reason to play games of this type. Simply put they are very good. Very lovable. Very quotable. I find myself saying ""dis-con-certing"" to my friends only to sigh when I remember none of them have played this game and have no idea what I am referencing. Anywho, buy it!			"

 The Next BIG Thing Verdict:All in all a technically very solid adventure, which, due to flaws with regards to the content, unfortunately did not become the (next) big thing. Recommended for lovers of other games made by Péndulo Studios. Not recommended for all others. You might take a look at the numerous other adventures which have been relased since then. There is a demo version as well, so if you are interested, check that out first.Review:Péndulo Studios' “The Next BIG Thing” presents itself as a classic point-and-click adventure. Connoisseurs of the “Runaway”-games will feel right at home. As before, the graphics are well done and nicely drawn. Some animations feel a bit chopped and not very smooth. Hints and hotspots are optional and can be turned off.The developers kept their sense of special humour. The frame narrative takes place in a world in which monsters, robots with personality, and humans are living side by side. The introductory sequence shows the two playable characters (Liz and Dan), who are reporters for a newspaper called “The Quill”. Their boss sends them to the monster-movie producer FitzRandolph, who is a monster himself.After getting there, Dan is hardly thrilled by this assignment, as he prefers sports over movies. Liz on the other hand wants to prove herself as a professional reporter and takes the assignment very seriously. The first dialogues between the two are overly clear about the two not liking each other at all. Even their personality could not be farther apart. Here Dan, the eloquent man about town, who could care less about authority. There Liz, being particular about everything and suffering from various psychological traumata as well as personality disorders.This marks the probably weakest point of the game, which continues until its end. Some of the characters are bizarre to the extend that an identification with them seems almost impossible. The thoughts and dialogues are rather causing raised eyebrows and disagreement than a smirk. Whereas Daedalic's “Edna Breaks Out” integrated and established the (at least alleged) psychiatric disorder well as an element of the game, it feels overdone and out of place here. Péndulo should have taken a more careful and cautious approach.During the course of the game, the player takes turns controlling Liz and Dan. The sections are pre-set and completely closed; there is no team-approach. The two meet the same characters. Those react, depending on whom they are talking to, differently; though comments or thoughts about the other main character remain sparse. It feels as if there were two parallel storylines. At least the voice actors are professionals and did a good job on sounding convincingly. At least in the English version of the game, characters often start or end sentences with ""ayo"", which becomes annoying rather quickly.The story itself can be summed up rather quickly: FitzRandolph is preparing the mysterious “Next BIG Thing”. Soon it becomes obvious that this is more than a mere motion picture. Liz senses the potential for a front page story and gets drawn in too deep for her own good. Grudgingly, Dan starts out to rescue her. Needless to say, the true “Next BIG Thing” is being discovered in the end – and then the game is already over. At least the ending holds a heart-warming surprise.			"

Short version: 71%The Next Big Thing is a solid adventure game with incredible visuals, a well-crafted world, and an interesting, yet very short story. The puzzles are easy and fun to do, yet there is one that will cause rage-quits in large numbers. Though its shortness hardly justifies the price, it’s a real deal even on a 50% sale: you get a fun and entertaining adventure for your money that won’t disappoint you later.Long version:The Next Big Thing is one of Pendulo’s many point-and-click adventure titles with the studio’s trademark cell-shaded 3D characters and carefully constructed, astonishing hand-drawn backgrounds.The game is set in another world, where the classic Hollywood movie monsters from the 1940s and 50s are real people who live among the humans. The story follows the adventure of two journalists– a cynical sports-maniac and an enthusiastic and downright loony investigative reporter– fresh on the trail of a new scoop that will eventually leave to kidnapping, brainwashing and of course lots of puzzle solving.The style and the story is more cartoonish than horror-like, and this shown in the characters and the puzzles themselves. The latter ones aren’t especially devilish, but there is one that gave many people nightmares and caused many rage-quits and unfinished games. It’s a purely time- and rhythm-based puzzle which is hard to figure out, even harder to properly execute.Apart from that the difficulty level may only come from pixel-hunting if you chose not to use the item highlight feature, as some of the objects you need to interact with can easily be missed.Although the story is quite good and well-paced, and even the dialogues are well-crafted, the fact that the game is actually a sequel to Pendulo’s 1997 title Hollywood Monsters, and sadly for some reason the developers thought that anyone who plays this game will know the prequel: we learn next to nothing about the world and how it works in the first half of the game, and only small bits are revealed later in optional side-conversations and item descriptions.Also, the game is short, even for an indie adventure game: shorter than their previous three title on Steam (the Runaway trilogy), clocking in about 4-6 hours depending on how much you may get stuck (especially on the aforementioned tango puzzle). The story itself compensates for it, but still, for costing as much as other Pendulo games, the play time feels awfully short in this one.			"

												The Next BIG Thing is a traditional point and click adventure. I am a big fan of this genre and I usually like most part of games contributing to it, but this game clearly makes an exception.Two of the most important characteristics of graphic adventures are extremely weak. Although the story is indeed original, it doesn't make to capture gamers' attention and is somehow boring, if we exclude the mental trip part between chapters 5 and 6. Furthermore the story (and the game) is REALLY short. Puzzles are just poor, being way too easy and often illogic. Characters are not bad, I would define them average, since they are well defined but not able to intensively involve the gamer. Finally the two strenghts of this game are the graphic interface, which is really user friendly and very well designed, and the graphics, that I rather loved both for the style, the colors and the attention to details.Is this game worth to be bought? I am afraid that the answer is no. I can recommend this only to gamers who are very into graphic adventures, and even in this case only on a large discount.			"

												I'm not the biggest fan of point-and-click adventures, but loved Discworld and Grim Fandango. This game got some good reviews, so I thought I could give it a try. Bought this game at a Steam sale.The good:Conversations and reactions are very funny. The graphics are very satisfying for a point-and-click adventure.The bad:Slow animations, gets boring. Caught myself doubleclicking more and more. Conversations get boring very fast. And puzzles based on luck contrary to logic.Conclusion: I get why a lot of people like this game, but it's just not my cup of tea. If would rate this 5 out of 10.			"

												WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSI've played adventure games since the days when they were all text-based and required players to type in commands like ""GO NORTH"" or ""LOOK HOUSE"".  In all, I have probably played dozens (if not hundreds) of both text and graphical adventures over the years.The fun in an adventure game comes primarily from the writing in the underlying story and the challenging nature of the puzzles.  Graphical adventures like this one can increase the fun by adding interesting visuals, good voice acting, and music.  The Next BIG Thing hits some of these notes, and either mangles or misses the rest.The story in this game could easily be interpreted as racist.  Monsters are allowed to have jobs, earn money, buy homes, run businesses, have human friends, etc., but aren't allowed to hold public office.  The antagonist is trying to change that (albeit in a dishonest manner), and get his people equal rights.  Your characters stop his plan, and seem to feel no remorse for what they're doing.  The story could have been made more palatable with a simple line out of one of the good guys' mouths like ""You know, we could have prevented all this if we had just given the monsters equal rights.  He had the right idea, but went about it the wrong way.""  (There is even a reference at one point, admittedly within a dream-like sequence, where characters admit to enjoying staged fights between animals and get excited about receiving tickets to a fight.  Does cruelty to animals offend you?  It does me.)Many of the puzzles in the game make sense and are somewhere in the easy to challenging-but-fun level.  Some of them, however, are very convoluted and make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  If it hadn't been for online walkthroughs, I doubt I would have ever come up with the precise combination of objects to solve those puzzles.  I don't think I'd have ever gotten there even by randomly combining objects in the game.One puzzle in particular was very irritating.  There was very little intellectual challenge to it... I'm referring to the Tango puzzle.  You're required to click four flowers, each representing a musical instrument.  When you click one, it starts playing that instrument's part of the tango.  You click the next at the right moment in the first instrument's melody.  If you miss this by more than a fraction of a second, the puzzle resets.  Despite consulting the walkthroughs, only through dumb luck was I able to get them all four clicked at the exact right times.  I hate puzzles like that, and get no enjoyment from them.  (I find the mazes they used to slap into old adventure games irritating for the same reason.)Some scenes in the game take your ""suspension of disbelief"" and stomp all over it.  At one point you're told a safe is too heavy to be carried.  Then the solution becomes hauling it around on a folding cart designed to carry cakes, cookies, and pies.  It's not too heavy for that?  The delicate contents of that safe can be tossed out of a flying zeppelin with a parachute attached and reach the ground safely?  And I can take an elevator to the surface, start a motorcycle, drive it into position, and be waiting when the safe finally hits the ground?  Really?The dialog in the game has an annoying trait as well.  Characters, for no known reason, start conversations with the word ""Ayo"" as in ""Ayo, Hello, Fred.  How are you today?""  They end conversations with ""Aya"" as in, ""Well, have a good weekend, Ann.  Aya.""  This is sort of amusing for the first five minutes of the game.  Do the developers think people really talk this way?As for the humor, I don't recall a single ""laugh out loud"" moment.  I think I smiled at a few things.  Maybe my standards are too high.Ultimately, this isn't a bad game.  It's just... OK.  I'd give it about a 6 out of 10. I've played many adventure games that were more fun (the LucasArts and Scott Adams games come to mind), but I've played quite a few that weren't.  The visuals are excellent.  The voice acting has its moments.  In the end, it's not a game I expect to ever play again.			"

												I'm usually a fan of adventure games, including Runaway also from Pendulo Studios. While this game looks really well-crafted, I cannot find any motivation in playing it. You are just thrown into it without any proper introduction or thread. Most of the dialogs are boring and contain tons of information about characters you simply do not care at all.The rest of the game is clicking through all objects in a scene and combining them by using the stupid help option. Boring, absolutely no recommendation.			"

												I have not played a point and click in a while, actually I have not played once since re doing some retro classics last year. So foundly I love some of the cartoon styles used in this game. The funny animation and use of character design, plot and verbal fun that can make these games so special.Well the Next Big this is just like the old style of games - the funny lines and speach are some of the best, this to me is just great. The graphics and amination fit in well and nothing stands out of place.Music, sounds and speech are top notch. But I did find a few things that just went bleep sound, I would of really liked to have some funny talking when things should not work, or even some more commical sounds.It really has some nice puzzle hints, help system, also a double mouse click for fast travel and this is something I have not seen in other point and clickers. Help is so needed with some of the really odd puzzles and item combinations in a few I played.  The game feels a bit too short and the main characters could always come back, it just seems like one chapter in a life story. But until the next big thing... I think I will see what other point and clickers this studio has to offer.And being on Steam it offers cloud saves, steam play (but no Linux), but no trading cards.* One slight failure was the annoying random crashes, then you found that you forgot to save because your enjoying it so much - but once you work out how to solve the puzzles, then your quickly complete everything again anyway and remember this time to save.

												It is just a great adventure, and even better if you have played ""Hollywood monsters"", but I don't know if Hollywood monsters were played out of Spain...Before buying it you should notice a few things: don't expect a very complex and hard adventure game, like those of the Lucasart's golden era. This is short, and easy (there are just a few puzzles that will stop you more than two minutes) but funny adventure, and if you have a little bit of sense of humour you will probably pass the whole game laughing out loud.I have completed the game in more o less ten hours, and i think that it can be done in half this.

												Excellent game. I still remember playing the old one, Hollywood Monsters, and I always waited for a new story about it. This is a great game, a little linear compared to Hollywood Monsters, but the story is appealing, the voice acting is really nice (english version, haven't tried the spanish one) and has some funny parts throughout the game. I totally recommend this game for point-and-click adventure game lovers!			"

												It is just a great adventure, and even better if you have played ""Hollywood monsters"", but I don't know if Hollywood monsters were played out of Spain...Before buying it you should notice a few things: don't expect a very complex and hard adventure game, like those of the Lucasart's golden era. This is short, and easy (there are just a few puzzles that will stop you more than two minutes) but funny adventure, and if you have a little bit of sense of humour you will probably pass the whole game laughing out loud.I have completed the game in more o less ten hours, and i think that it can be done in half this. But is REALLY great.			"

												That Point'n'click is a very enjoyable game.The characters are fun, the story yet simple is interesting and the graphic part is very nice.the gameplay is really classic here, but enjoyable too. The game is pretty easy, and i think you will love it if like me you hate chasing small pixels in this kind of game.The game is pretty short, but i don't regret it, that was just enough for me. Fun !			"

												The Next Big Thing is an average Point and Click adventure game with a decent, humorous story.  The one sore spot for me was a rather frustrating puzzle involving starting certain things at the right time to keep the tempo.  Tempo?  I may have taken a University-level music course but only because it was a bird course!7/10Playtime: ~ 7 hrs			"

												I have not played a point and click in a while, actually I have not played once since re doing some retro classics last year. So foundly I love some of the cartoon styles used in this game. The funny animation and use of character design, plot and verbal fun that can make these games so special.Well the Next Big this is just like the old style of games - the funny lines and speach are some of the best, this to me is just great. The graphics and amination fit in well and nothing stands out of place.Music, sounds and speech are top notch. But I did find a few things that just went bleep sound, I would of really liked to have some funny talking when things should not work, or even some more commical sounds.It really has some nice puzzle hints, help system, also a double mouse click for fast travel and this is something I have not seen in other point and clickers. Help is so needed with some of the really odd puzzles and item combinations in a few I played.  The game feels a bit too short and the main characters could always come back, it just seems like one chapter in a life story. But until the next big thing... I think I will see what other point and clickers this studio has to offer.And being on Steam it offers cloud saves, steam play (but no Linux), but no trading cards.* One slight failure was the annoying random crashes, then you found that you forgot to save because your enjoying it so much - but once you work out how to solve the puzzles, then your quickly complete everything again anyway and remember this time to save.

												Although the first time I played it, the game crashed about 3/4 through and lost all the checkpoints, I'm still giving this one a positive review. I found out that I was not the only one with a such of a setback, but decided to start it again after a few months. The storyline is somewhat stupid but it really doesn't affect that much in the level of entertainment of the game. Game is quite funny, and even though the puzzles aren't that difficult, it still gives out several hours of entertainment for a casual game that it is. Because of of the known random crash issues, I recommend you save your game from time to time. If you like point and click adventure games that are not fustratingly hard, this is a good one to try out. There is even spot indicator button, so when you get stuck, you can find out the spots you may have missed, and also a clever clue helper, that doesn't give you direct assistance but gives you something to think about you may have not though of or point you to a right room. Though all of this is something you barely need, because progressing the game is relatively easy when you use some common logic and try out stuff. It's a well built and entertaining piece of adventure game with a reasonable price tag.			"

												A pleasant but short point and click game. The visuals are nice and the vocie acting is charming. The story though pretty short was enjoyable enough but it is the charactes that really made an impact. The main duo was really enjoyable and the side characters were interesting even though i could not help but think that some of them should have gotten some more screentime.  The game certainly feels complete but i get the feeling that it was planned to be more than it actually is.The point and click mechanics are solid and for the most part the puzzles didn't get too obscure and far fetched for me. There have a system which lets you see everything that is interactable in an area and this is something that i really enjoy. Nothing is more infuriating that not being able to solve a puzzle just because you didn't realize that the slightly different colored rock on the ground was interactable. There is also a hint system which i used at some times.But overall this is a short and charming point and click adventure game. I would recommend it for people with an interest in the genre. "

												I am a big fan of Pendulo Studios games, I started with the first of the Runaway series I got on sale and immediately loved everything about the games they make, the complex puzzles, the eye for detail, the art style and the humor.The Next Big Thing is (from what I've read) a sequel to an early game released in 1997 called Hollywood Monsters but it doesn't seem that you need to have played it to enjoy this game as I haven't and enjoy it a lot.This game pokes fun at common cliches and classic movie cliches as well as winks to the audience regarding older movies with even a reference to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.The gameplay is 'point and click' which may not be for everyone but it can be fun and I would recommend this game for any fan of that style of gameplay, anyone who loves puzzle or just wants to play a game that isn't an FPS where the main character is a burly white man with facial hair. If you aren't sure about this game or you're using an older model laptop, you may want to try the Runaway series, its a little older and can run on cheaper or simpler build laptops (I know, I had one for some time) but the humor is similar as well as the art style.

												As with most of Pendulo's games The Next Big Thing is stylish, funny and cartoony. The characters are interesting, albeit some more than others, the settings are colorful and the puzzles are (for the most part intuitive.If you've never played a Pendulo game, think of the original Monkey Island games with a more post-modern theme and at the 10 euro markup it's well worth the price.

												Wow, huge step up from Pendulo’s Runaway series. Spot on story, comedy, characters, and puzzles. If this was released 10 years earlier it might have been an unforgettable classic.Pretty much everything about this game is a massive improvement over the Runaway series. It still suffers from the wonky input controls, but the writing is by far a huge step up. Story has fairly straight forward plot, reporters must thwart a politicians evil plans. But the clever setting takes you to a variety of different locales without seeming over contrived.  While we finally have coherent plot, Pendulo doesn’t try for any depth.  The story revolves around monsters being marginalized and discriminated against being the motivation for the villain. While that may have been excellent foundation for a thought provoking moral on not judging other by appearance, no morals of any kind manifest. No matter though, this is a straight up comedy and, unlike the Runaway series, it does not rely on racism or painfully dated references to make a joke.  Characters interactions are the main driving force. Dan Murray is a well-liked but incorrigible jerk, while Liz Allaire is a well-respected but disconcerting loon. They are surrounded by a number odd but likable monsters and robots. With flawed characters comes flawed motivations as well, Dan Murray’s goal in the game is simply to get a pair of boxing tickets. No heroism or romanticism here. It just works well for the character.The puzzle are far better balanced than Pendulo’s previous games, most are logical and do follow some sort of logic.  But it does still suffer from some bad trigger design.  For instance, occasionally if you want to set off a sequence of events you might need to talk to same person twice in a row. This happened when I needed an item a character was holding, when he denied my request the first time, I tried again and it worked. It is weird why they set it up like that, but learned my lesson from the previous games. There is also a PAINFUL audio timing puzzle, but aside from that the rest of the game has that same 90s era twisted logic puzzle design, both fun and humorous.Put simply, Pendulo nailed the Point and Click Adventure this time around. There is really very little to hate on and a lot that was just done right. "

Excellent controls, like being able to jump quickly to different areas instead of walking and I also really liked the inventory and menu designs. It was a very entertaining use of my time. The female character was an enjoyable change from the norm, more games need characters who lean towrds the crazy side, though the male was extreme version of a typical stereotype.			"

												Yet another top-shelf game from those Spanish adventure wizards at Pendulo Studios!  The Next BIG Thing tells its story of corruption at a monster-owned film studio through witty (and well-localized) dialogue, tricky puzzles and some of the best artwork in the genre.  I used to think that Daedalic (Deponia, Memoria, etc.) was the uncontested king of modern point-and-click, but now it is clear that Pendulo is a serious contender for the crown.  Pendulo may have a relatively slow output, but its high standards and  awesomely unique style more than make up for it.			"

												A fun little point and click with 6 chapters that each run about 1 hour.  The puzzles are pretty easy, even playing on the hardest settings.  And if you get stuck on a puzzle there isn't too much to interact with, so they're still pretty easy to figure out.  Keep in mind that with Pendulo games, often you need to open up certin dialogue trees to solve a puzzle.  This can mean coming back to a character several times, sometimes after performing a certain action or talking to other characters to open up the new dialogue options.  As long as you're aware of this though, there isn't too much to get really stuck on.  Parts of the storyline are simplistic and cliche, but it's also equally funny and charming.  7/10 from me.			"

I bought the game at USD$2.99, so I am happy that I bought the game at this price. For $2.99, this game is a casual, humourous + witty game for an easy day, but not totally EASY :)			"

Interface, movement, help, everything has been tweaked to be familiar yet modern and practical.The art is gorgeous, the animation is really good, and the story interresting. The 2 protagonists are a refreshing take on the detective couple meme.Dont expect tens of hours of trying to find cryptic and absurdly insane puzzles, but rather a nice run with effective puzzle that manage to integrate well the story and its zanny world.

It is very entertaining and is just the right side of exploration to figure out the puzzles - but you have to pay attention. I got caught out with a bit of overthinking  on a couple of puzzles though it looks good and sounds good, looking forward to trying the other Pendulo games as I bought a package deal. I am an old school fan of point n click and this is a winner, if you like Sam and Max it's along the same lines.			"

												It has been a long time since a played a point and click adventure that I enjoyed so much.  I tend to skip a lot of the dialogue these days just to get on with the puzzles and adventure, but this game had sharp and witty dialogue that was worth hearing - very idiosyncratic.  The plot was intriging too!  Presentation is top notch, with the option to have a help system, hints or nothing at all; and the clues are done beautifully, highly context sensitive and with polish and humour.What more could you wish for?
