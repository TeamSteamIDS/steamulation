												This might be my nostalgia speaking, but to me this will forever be the TRUE Indiana Jones 4.If you have any interest in Indy, you have to play this game. The plot, the mystery mixing history and mysticism, the nice touches of humor, the nazi villains, some nice action and twists... Arguably, it is sometimes even more ""Indiana Jones"" than the original trilogy movies themselves! This game also has a pretty unique feature for a retro adventure game : the story actually branches at one point, giving you very different playthroughs. Some puzzles are also randomized. This helps replayability a lot.Bearing with the old graphics of this game is entirely worth it. Unless you truly can't stand seeing some pixels, the dated technology should not stop you from enjoying a true Indiana Jones adventure.If you read this, you care about the Indy franchise, don't you? Then just play this. You won't regret it.			"

												For starters, I was not born around the time of old point and click adventures like LucasArts', but i would imagine that many people played them. why? Because LucasArts made what are quite possibly the best story driven point and click games. Where to begin? The graphics are as they were 20 years ago, and yet they still feel fresh, so nostalgia will hit hard with older gamers. I have not played the original, so I am not sure if this version is different in any way, but it has the original music, voice acting and graphics, so I assume it's the same. Even though i was born around the time where they started moving on to making more Star Wars games (which were mostly good, and one of them is one of my most favourite games of all time), I still wanted to try these. Last year, I saw a show with a segment about LucasArts' history, and they talked about games like Loom, Indiana Jones And the Fate Of Atlantis, Full Throttle, The Secret Of Monkey Island and many more. And I always like games with a big focus on story lines, and I decided to try them since it would be a break from Call Of Judy or whatever generic shooters are called these days. So I found a bundle with a few of LucasArts' games, and while the controls are a bit fiddly at first, I think Loom, The Dig and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis will keep me playing 'till the credits roll because of the stories that just make you reflect after the end. It's like reading a book, you say you will read one chapter, and then you read the whole book. It's games like these that make me wish I was born in 1990. Nowadays it's all about pwning n00bs in halozone with masterchef or something. Sorry for the long review about me saying how much i like the stories in these games, But after all, the one thing that sticks around in your mind about a game, is it's story. Thank you for reading.Edit: Another thing about their games, is that the writing is so good, It's always full of humour.			"

												Disclaimer: No refrigerators were nuked during the playing or reviewing of this game. This game was great! The game looks great, for a classic LucasArt adventure game, and the voice acting is actually pretty spot on.  The puzzles can be a bit challenging, but luckily there isn't a moment where you have to start the game over because you didn't get that one item you were supposed to get in the last section (Shame on you, Last Crusade). Also, there are three different paths to beat this game: the Team Path, The Wits Path, or The Fists Path. I personally chose the Team Path, because then the puzzles aren't too demanding, since you have help, and you don't have to worry about the fighting system. Also, Indy has to have his lady :). The fighting system is greatly improved from Indy's Last Crusade, but thats really not saying much, since it couldn't have gotten worse. Not only are there multiple ways to accomplish tasks, but there are two different endings, depending on what kind of Indy you want to be. Overrall, this was a great game, that I know I will play again for the different paths. OH, and different paths mean visiting different locations! Honestly, this should have been the fourth movie. They would have to have tweaked it just a bit, but this should have been the film. The love/hate relationship between Indy and Sophia is real and genuine (I loved seeing Indy grab her for that ""we saved the world from the Nazis kiss""). Also, its Indy against the Nazis, the ones we love to see him fight. The script is strong and believable.  Just a fun great game that all adventure gamers should pick up, at any cost.UPDATE: My play time is not accurate, since I played this game on the SCUMM engine. I used my Steam file and loaded it to SCUMM, which greatly improves how it looks and sounds. My overrall playtime would be between 6-7 hours for a first time.			"

												Another LucasArts classic point and click game.  I played the game when it first came out back in the early 90s.  One part I thought was great about the game was the different paths Indy could take that would ultimately lead to Atlantis, providing some replayability.

This game is a 10 John Williams’ composed theme songs out of 10This review is a shortened reupload from Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com] due to Steam's character limits.NOTE: The original release of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis from 1992 came out in several European languages including German and French, however, these are not available in this particular release. Unlike some Point & Click adventures, this game includes Game Over screens, so save often and use different save states to not run into problems later on.

The GameDr. Henry Walton “Indiana” Jones Jr. PhD is an American lecturer for archaeology at Barnett College who goes on wild treasure hunting adventures whenever he’s not busy teaching. Partially based on Henry Rider Haggard’s Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jones is best known for his wit, as well as his iconic clothes: the bullwhip, the leather jacket, and the fedora. Despite being blessed with substantial knowledge on ancient cultures, languages, and combat methods, he often makes the situation worse by accidentally leading his opponents directly to the mystical treasures he tries so hard to prevent them from getting. His most prominent enemies are the Nazis who want to unearth ancient artefacts and plan to abuse them for their world dominating plans. In Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis the Wehrmacht now tries to find the sunken city-state of Atlantis and is determined to kidnap Sophia Hapgood, Indy’s former partner, to reach it. Fortunately, Dr. Jones is able to get to her in time, but discovers that her apartment has already been ransacked by them. The two heroes now set out on a thrilling race to find Atlantis before the Germans can.The game was released twice, once in 1992 and then in 2009 with a newly added voice over and reworked sound effects. Despite it bringing back Lucas Arts’ staples like the SCUMM engine, it sets itself apart from the developer’s other Point & Click adventures like The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), Day of the Tentacle (1993), or Grim Fandango (1998) by incorporating a much more versatile, partially randomized world that takes player choices into consideration. The story of The Fate of Atlantis can roughly be split into three acts, with the first and last always playing out more or less the same way, but the second offering players a choice on how they wish to proceed.Players can go for one of three playstyles: Wits By picking the “wits” route, Indy will travel alone and face a number of very difficult puzzles by himself. Fists When opting for the “fists” route, Indy still travels alone, but the amount of puzzles and their difficulty level will be greatly reduced in exchange for more hand to hand combat. Team When selecting the “team” option, Indy will be joined by Sophia and together they will try to work their way towards Atlantis.


That sounds about right.

What surprised me is that these three options not only truly alter the gameplay, but that some locations, like Algiers, will look differently, while others, like Thera, are only available in certain routes. Not only that, but depending on the playstyle, characters like Omar Al-Jabbar will change in personality. Even during the team route, one will encounter puzzles with alternative solutions to them. Both Indiana and Sophia, for example, have different ways of trying to get information from Alain Trottier in Monaco.But the game’s strength is also its weakness. In order to add variety, item locations, puzzle solutions, and some NPC responses are randomized. This certainly adds flavor when replaying the experience, but also might make re–searching items and information somewhat tedious and demands attentiveness from players. It also means that one should keep pen and paper ready (or take screenshots) as some puzzles rely on memorizing and correctly interpreting clues. Two minor gripes I have with this game are what they pass off as German and that apart from three brief sequences, there appears to be no way to play as Sophia. After briefly playing as her at the beginning of the game, I was anticipating a tag team mechanic that never came.Overall, I was not prepared for how hard the puzzles were going to be. This is definitely a good thing and I loved that I had to think as much as I did in this game, but players who just want to enjoy a nice story might want to think twice about purchasing a copy of The Fate of Atlantis. And despite my enjoyment for everything, when I finally thought that I had gotten the hang of things and that the game did not have any new tricks up its sleeves, act three came along and threw me for a loop with a massive fetch quest and increasingly cryptic clues. I was completely stuck and did not know how to proceed. At this point, I unfortunately have to admit that I caved in and cheated. I looked up what I needed to do on the internet and as it turns out, I had missed a barely visible cogwheel that was hanging on a wall in one room. Unfortunately, some of the plot relevant items in this game are barely visible or blend in so well with the background that players will pixel hunt to progress.Nevertheless, the astonishingly detailed and advanced presentation of this 1992 title kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn’t wait to see where things were going from here on out. Design–wise, the game is definitely a high-end product that will leave players guessing at how long the developers must have worked on it. Especially alluring are little details, like the waterfall in Knossos, or the pitch dark rooms that become brighter the longer Indy stays in them. However, not everything is perfectly executed. Point & Click adventures are really good at presenting inventory and dialog based puzzles, but terrible when it comes to fighting or driving mechanics. Though these are a nice change of pace from the riddles, they are somewhat unintuitive in The Fate of Atlantis. When driving through the streets of Monaco, the car is very stiff and the fighting mechanic remains to be a mystery to me.Players can choose to either control the fights with a mouse, or, after pressing the F key, by using their keyboard. Strikes and blocks can be done to the top, mid, or lower region, and there is a way to skip most of the violent encounters by pressing the 0 key. Fortunately, the Steam version includes a pdf file of the game’s manual, explaining the intricacies of the mechanics as well as some hints for the game overall.

BugsI encountered one game breaking bug, during my third playthrough, while playing on my old toaster – an old, 32-bit desktop PC running on Windows Vista Home Premium, an Intel Core 2 CPU, an Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT, and 3070 MB RAM. There were occasional graphical bugs throughout my various playthroughs, (I replayed the game several times to see different puzzle solutions, endings, and alternate routes), but none of them dampened the fun nor are they truly worth talking about, except for this one. During my run in the “wits” route, Indy temporarily disguises himself as a German sailor. Upon changing back to his actual outfit, his whip was suddenly missing and I could not proceed with the story. It is suggested to save frequently and to use different save stages, to avoid this conundrum.			"

												I loved this game as a kid when it first came out and think it has held up quite well (aside from the graphics).  Indy is in rare form searching for the lost city and his wit always delivers.  He races against the Nazis (again) to locate Atlantis, which they believe is the source of ""orichalcum"" - a metal that produces immense energy at no cost and could potentially be used for war power.  During the first part of the game he is accompanied by the lovely psychic Sophia Hapgood, who provides him with acerbic banter.  The second part of the game allows you to choose one of three paths:  1) Wits, 2) Fists, or 3) Teamwork.  Each path is completely different and invites you to replay the game each way.  Wits and Teamwork are my favorite.    In sum, ""I think it's mayonnaise, but it looks like used motor oil.""			"

												I remember this being one of the first games I ever played, albeit when I was a kid I didn't get all the references, and some of the puzzles were a little above me- but a classic point-and-click puzzle adventure game. This game did a good job with the music score, and voice acting as well as having decent graphics for its time. Some of the puzzles are challenging, and some of the controlls in can be hard to figure out in certain puzzles (e.g. the hot air ballon). This however in my opinion, in no way diminishes the story or the excement that you will get when you're trying to figure out the proper thing to say in the middle of a seance! It of course has Indy's classic humor with banter between Sophia Hapgood (don't think she's in any of the movies) and Marcus and some of the other characters that we're familiar with. Love some of the available dialogue options, they can be funny at times, as well as down-right get you into trouble! It is clear that the writers put a lot of thought and attention into ancient Atlantian mythology, and that is a plus. They detail excerpts from Plato and other ancient philosophers and theorize on supposed ways to find Atlantis. You will enjoy the dialoge, the score, the puzzles, and the action that is packed into this game, I recommend a try.			"

												This is definitively a classic game you should play. At least if you are a fan of point&click and Indiana Jones. Don't judge the graphics, the game is from the 90's.I played it in window mode. But be warned, if you click outside and have an overlapping window there might be the chance you will not see that area when clicking back to the game. Clipping is computed differently ;-)For such an old game the graphics are awesome. A lot of small easter eggs and funny scenes can be found. Sound is like it was back then.			"

												     With a personal nostalgia factor through the roof, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt. But I freaking love this game. Such a smart, exciting game to play with witty dialog and inspired locations. Definitley an old school vibe, which I am assuming you're looking for if you are reading this in the first place. Look no further. I'd play a game like this in heartbeat if LucasArts, SCUMM, or anyone kept producing them.      Anyways, there *are* two major concerns for anyone wondering (this is my attempt at writing an unbiased review). One is the voice acting, which I didn't remember from my floppy disk copies when I was a kid. But you can mute them, or better yet laugh at the horribly outrageous ""German"" and ""French"" accents. Perhaps the worst are the ""Arabic"" accents although I confess I only heard one, cringed too hard at the delivery, and promptly muted the voice volume in the preferences section, whish I was relieved to find was possible because the background music is a definate selling point (especially the syncopated Indiana Jones theme, somewhat Atari-fied like it belongs in a pokemon game). The other main problem is the fighting mechanism, which is complicated, or, rather, just not fun.     Anyway, plenty of puzzles, hours of gametime, total replayability (hell, I for one attest to fifteen-years-later replayability). Please play this with your young son. Haven't even mentioned THREE DIFFERENT storylines to make it to Atlantis, with varying character allegiances, settings, and of course puzzles. Still haven't mentioned the art direction, perhaps the most understated selling point I've found when reading the other reviews. And multiple endings depending on prior actions once you make it to Atlantis. Refreshing alternative to the brainless droll of shooter games that seem to dominate the market (not that there's anything wrong with brainless droll). What happened to point and click adventure games? In a way they are to my generation as the Saturday Morning Matinee serials that inspired Dr. Jones in the first place, lost to an earlier period but their appeal lingers. And and Indiana Jones adventure is the perfect fit for this genre. Campy, but in a unique and exciting way. Plot twists a plenty. Sigh, writing this makes me want to explore the Labyrynth of Minos again. Bye.			"

												I used to play this game when I was a kid. Back then, I relied heavily on the Hint Book that came with the CD; then again, I was also 8 years old. There are 3 paths that one can ""choose"" from based on early actions and dialogue in the game: The Fists Path, the Team Path, and the Wits Path. My favorite of these three is the Team Path, simply because it seems to provide situations privy to having the largest amount of sarcastic dialogue classic to the Indiana Jones franchise. It's the only path where Sophia Hapgood (the female character) joins you for the entire time, and thus gives you an AI teammate (who has a witty demeanor quite similar to that of Marion Ravenwood).I always feel like dialogue is the most enjoyable part of a point and click style game - especially the old DOS ones - and can definitely make or break it. This is one of my favorite games for this reason; it does a very good job staying true to the feel of the movies and really deserves it's unnoficial title of Indiana Jones 4.If you're looking for a fast paced adventure game, this is not it. While a lot of the puzzler-type aspects can be very difficult without the use of the Hint Guide (obviously not included on Steam), fighting is optional and with the limited point-click method - not very engaging, so I wouldn't reccomend that. The puzzler aspects include using objects with one another from multiple locations and working out persuasive dialogue paths.All in all, I would have given this game an 9/10 in the late 90's, but as it is 2014, (but I'm still nastalgic) I'd say it's a 8/10 (mostly because the DOS-style pixilizated art now drives me nuts).

												Lucasarts was known for creating some of the most memorable adventure games of the 1990s, from Sam and Max Hit the Road to Day of the Tentacle. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is easily near the top of the list. Play as the world's most famous archaeologist as he wards off the forces of evil and searches for the lost city of Atlantis.

Thanks to Steam, I finally had the chance and brought back a lot of nostaglia for games of that time. What impressed me the most is that the story is excellent.

												I will start by saying that for me the SCUMM video game engine truly was a beautiful piece of work, anyway This adventure is one of the best point-and-click games ever made imo, fact is most of LucasArts adventures were, i loved this and last crusade more than i did the monkey island games and don't get me wrong they were fantastic too. I really loved the setting and the feel for both games but mostly because the puzzles are a bit more logical compared to others... im not saying that the other LucasArts adventures are impossible, but you really can complete this one without the need of any help/guide.If you are interested in point-and-click adventures, and for some reason you dont know yet? LucasArts made some of the most fantastic and memorable games of all time, and if you are a fan or just getting into point-and-click games there is no better place to start, LucasArts really were the creme de la creme of this genre when i was growing up, so many fond Memories.

												BUY IT! Awesome game back then. Saw it and decided to buy it again. Wow did this bring back memories from more than 14 years ago. Very fun puzzle solving, if you want to it can be eaiser (path of the fist), but path of the wits gave me a challenge. Overall challenging puzzles, great old humor, many lucas arts refernces, overall for a game released in 1992 at the time it was in the top 10 adventure games, back then. Be sure to check out others like sam and max hit the road, the dig, full throttle,etc. Definatly worth the price and then some!I have the original and yes theirs programs like scumm vm to run it, but with that comes a lot of errors and hoops to jump through yes it is nice, but after so many headaches and frustration with grim fandango (save issue 5 hours in) im glad i got this.

This game really has it all, now there were momments or frusturation, but thats part of these games , all I can say his pick your stuff up after you use it, it'll save you a lot of time...

												If you like the Indiana Jones series and wish to see everything that are related to his numerous adventures Worldwide, this is one of the stones that you have to tread on.  I have played and finished the 2003 Lucas Arts game Emperor's Tomb before and did not hesitate to buy this 1992 game in year 2016, once i heard that it has completely unique set of events which were not replicated in any Indy film/game before or after. I wanted to finish the game by not reading any of hints or tips from a walkthrough guide -and i succeeded-, because adventuring through the untold dullness of life is THE INHERENT core of Indy adventures. This game gives that unique feeling of being an Indiana Jones even with 1992 graphics and sounds. Because, the feeling of playing Dr. Jones does not rely on eye-candy graphics, but lies with finding whatever way to wrestle through life even if it goes somewhere that was not intended initially. Once the game starts, be careful about your selected words towards other people -be it an enemy, comrade, or foreigner- because it affects the storyline. If you want to hear all quotes, know that we can save our progress anytime we want. So, the game does not punish us needlessly. If you stuck at a level and not finding a proper way to go further, i recommend NOT to rush a walkthrough guide quickly. I somehow figured out many challenges by trying to act in the same manner as Harrison Ford we know. IMO, the game scenario has outdone even the well-known Indy films. All things considered, buy this game if you know and follow Indy franchise and/or want to travel in time to see what a PC game feels like in early 90's. Either way, you won't be disappointed.			"

												The storyline to this 2D adventure game is so rich and enjoyable! I first played this game back in the 90's and it has stuck with me ever since. I love how you can choose between three paths, ultimately meaning that different scenarios will appear for each path during the course of that particular gameplay you have chosen, until they diverge in the middle part of the quest. The puzzles range from easy to head-scrathching, and one thing to note is that with most games, there is often one way to solve a puzzle, unlike this one, where there may be multiple ways to solve certain puzzles.The dated graphics are obviously nothing special, but does not detract from the game and the interface is easy to use.Just remember to save games! Would definitely recommend!			"

												In 1995, at the tender age of 12, I got my first x86 PC: a Pentium 286 16MHz (can't remember how much RAM or anything else). My father had a 486 in his office, and I'd get to play with it sometimes, but not long and not often. Still, my first gaming PC was a glorious machine for me at the time. Among the pirated games (hey, third-world country, no Steam or Amazon, sue me) I used to play (Master of Magic, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, Leisure Suit Larry, Ultima Underworld, Alone in the Dark, Doom, SimFarm, etc...), there was one LucasArts point-and-click adventure in particular that filled me with a sense of wonder and even awe: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. I wasn't a huge fan of Indiana Jones, but this game was bigger than the character. My English was barely rudimentary at the time, and I couldn't really follow much of the story and the humour. But the sense of wonder and awe was there from the start, and it remains to this day at the rugged age of 33, on my nth playthrough. That's why I recently included this game in my list of #7FaveGames on Twitter: while I do have very fond memories of all the other LucasArts adventures and other games from that period, this game will always have a special place in my memories.In many ways, it is a classic LucasArts adventure in terms of gameplay, humour, cartoonish villains, and several tough and sometimes questionable puzzles. But all the mythology behind Atlantis, the clandestine translation of Plato's dialogue that you have to decipher, the eerie and sometimes Lovecraftian atmosphere when you finally reach the submersed city... the artists and writers who made this game were onto something here. It was and remains a unique, wonderful game.			"

Arm with whip and Webley! And don't go on this adventure without your hat (or female treasure hunting/artifact finding partner)! And wonderful storyline in keeping with the Indy films. And, the game also became the basis for the first four-part serial Indiana Jones comic series by Dark Horse Comics (which is also awesome).			"

												One of the best point and click adventures ever made. The characters, the humor, the locations, the puzzles are all have a unique charm. I played this a a kid not long after it first came out, so this has a bit of nostalgia for me. Needless to say I was very excited to see this on Steam. The puzzles definitely take some brain power, a lot of trial and error, and maybe a hint or two from a guide. I would also point out that the difficulty definitely ramps up near the end and you will no doubt be stumped on how to complete certain tasks, but it's absolutley doable. Regardless, what you're left with is an engaging, entertaining, and challenging masterpiece that succeeds in keeping the appeal, and aesthetic charm of the original movies. If you like adventure games with dynamic puzzles, interesting characters, and an ever-changing locations, you won't regret buying this game.			"

												Yeah, it's not looking like games from today. But this game is one of the first I've played on PC... and I have memories of being stuck in the damn desert and of that damn balloon to lead... When you're only a child, it's marking you. Without that game, I wouldn't be playing adventure games or indie games like Ben Jordan, Chzo Mythos or Barn Runner.As it's a very old game, you have that old interface with ""Push"", ""Pull"", ""Use"", etc.. It's perhaps a weird way to play an adventure game now but it was the norm back then.Anyway, I managed to get stuck in the first level when I remember clearly being at ease when I was a child.The graphics are maybe pixelated but between libraries, islands, deserts and I don't know more because I stayed stuck in the desert like before and because I'm more aware of the multiple paths you can take now than before.So, if you're in for good memories, the game is made for you.

												I grew up playing this game on my first Macintosh System 7 I believe, so expect nostalgia goggles.  Fate of Atlantis is a point and click adventure game originally released in 1992 by LucasArts.The story and atmosphere are on par with the best of the Indiana Jones movies.  While the pixelated visuals are quite dated by today's standards I find I'm still so easily immersed into the game that I hardly notice.  The voice acting was well done in the original, and it sounds like the audio quality might be better in this Steam release. The music is also dated digital sequences, but still good enough to hold the immersion and also sounds as if it's been improved.Unlike many adventure games, there's a point where the story can take one of three routes: team up with Sophia, use your wits, or use your fists.  Each branch takes the story in a different direction and to different locations, often not accessable in the other branches.  Kids used to spread rumors of a different ending as well, but to my knowlege, no such thing exists.  The mechanics are based on selecting one of the nine pre-selected verbs and clicking something in the world that you want to act that verb upon; for example, Using ""Pick Up"" on ""Ancient Artifact"".If you love point and click adventure games, and somehow passed this one by, I'd say you're in for a treat as Fate of Atlantis is one of the best, if not THE best.  Yeah, I went there.			"

												I enoyed this game much more than the last crusade, mostly because the three paths enabled me to pick the type of game I like to play, which is puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles. The multiple paths do give the game a lot of replay value which is rather rare in old style pointandclicks. The story is typical Indiana Jones, looking for an ancient long lost something or other with a beautiful woman by his side or kidnapped by Nazis. Some of the puzzles are really obscure and I needed to use a guide for, which lost the game points coz I think if the answer is too hard to figure out for a (self appointed) veteran of these games, then the solution is far-fetched. Over all I enjoyed it, get it in the Lucasarts pack which comes with three other games and it's well worth it.			"

												Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a rather unusual entry in the SCUMM games catalogue. For a start, it's one of the few to be based around an existing IP rather than an original story. Secondly,  the game scores you as you play, with an ""Indy Quotient"". Granted it's meaningless, but it's interesting nonetheless...Lucasarts has already made games based around the first three Indy films, so when there was call for another game, rather than wait for another film to make an appearance, they decided to make their own. And it's good. really good. If this game's story had been made into a film, it would have been... well... let's say somewhere below ""Last Crusade"" but above ""Temple of Doom""Even before the opening credits start you can tell the amount of care that has gone into this game. The word ""cinematic"" may keep appearing in your mind, as the first few puzzles weave their way in and around of the credits. This game is simply a joy to play.There is one point in this game (well, technically two) where you are given the option to determine how you want to play the game. You can play it as a standard graphical adventure (WITS path), as a graphical adventure with beat-em-up subgames instead of some of the puzzles (FISTS path), or as a graphical adventure but with commentary and assistance from the game, making it a little more like an interactive movie (TEAM path). It's nice to have these options, as the puzzles and dialogue change accordingly, so it's worth playing through again.If you like other Lucasarts adventure games, you certainly can't go wrong with this. It's more enjoyable than ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls"" anyway...			"

												Forget about Crystal Skull, this is the fourth Indiana Jones story you want!Fate of Atlantis has aged incredibly well over the years. The soundtrack is great for its time and the sound effects are satisfying. It's a very smart game full of historical references, but the best part of Fate of Atlantis is the gameplay. The puzzles are tricky and hard to figure out, but never unfair. Exploring is also fun, given the great variety of environments you encounter. It is a kid's game so expect a somewhat light hearted tone, but it works very well here and does the story justice. Great game and a timeless classic - get it.			"

												A terrific Indy puzzle game (ha ha).Fate of Atlantis was surprisingly innovative for it's time: multiple paths through the story, an actually forgiving/signposted death system (coming from the notorious Sierra-era of instant-kills that required hours of replaying, this is a pleasant change), and Indy's voice actor actually sounds like Harrison Ford. There's also a scene where Indy's eyes adapt to a dark room that still holds up as a pinnacle of good game design.Funny and full of charm, Fate of Atlantis feels like what it is: a classic Indiana Jones adventure.

												Indiana Jones and the genre optimised by his franchise is something I've been MAJORLY obsessed with, and been a fav of mine for most of my life. I love all four films (yes, you can go f*ck yourselves other reviewers, the Crystal Skull is A LOT better than this game), copycats and stuff inpired by or in the style of him. So the premiere point-n-click game of his made back in the early 90s was something I was happily on board to experience. My impression?Well I think an appropriate thing to call it is ""The Janky Adventures of Indiana Jones"". Yeah, I don't know if the developers of it could've done anything to make it less janky, but it is that at least a little. The gameplay mechanics are solid, they do a good job, but I like mine a bit smoother. They have a feeling of jaggedness and stiffness.The voice actor who plays Dr. Jones doesn't even get close to sounding like him. I once suggested to my old man, who's a fan too, an idea I've had for a while for an Indiana Jones animated series with Harrison Ford actually stepping into a recording booth to voice him. It would be better than a fifth film, and would fix Fords age getting in the way. My pop just flat out told me that he thought Harrison wouldn't do voice work for anything. I wonder if back in the early 90s, he was in a public library or something, and saw someone playing this game on a publicly availible computer, asked what this newfangled thing on the computer was, watched a little, and then asked why Indiana Jones totally didn't sound like himself, which is how he got the opinion he told me. But it can slid do to artistic licence or medium constrants or whatever.The tone is also slightly off. It feels like someone's close approximation of the Indiana Jones tone. I'm admittedly picky, so this caused the game/story as a whole to not feel that definitive. Not that it was bad, they tried. Stuff like the female sidekick character and the stuff she does and that happen to her, the design of the stuff in and from Atlantis, and a noticable amount of the dialogue, successfully lend to the appropriate classic tone. But when stuff like Jones dressing up like Charlie Brown on Halloween night to pretend to be a ghost, and Jones clumsily tumbling down multiple floors of his own university happen, the tone is comprimised due to out of place sillyness. I am planning to read the comic book adaption soon, so maybe that will help give me a better appreciation of the story.The problem solving of the game is decent in the first half, but in the second half, I consistently was falling prey to mistakenly thinking the game was too strict for what turned out to be the correct solution, to be the correct solution. The game comes off as too strict for the ladder item to be usable in multiple places in Atlantis, or too strict for the knife thrower to be someone you can talk to. I guess suffering from cronic depression, the worst/hardest case scenario is the one I jump to first. But it's frustrating to go to a walkthrough, not because you don't know, but because you think you know, but you need CONFIRMATION BECAUSE THE GAME ISN'T TRUSTWORTHY AND HAS THE ATTITUDE OF A PRANKSTER.But moving on, here's a query. Doesn't Indiana Jones get to experience a bunch of awesome things? What cool stuff do you get to do? Well my favorite thing would have to be the exploration of Atlantis itself in the form of a giant maze. You get to run Indiana Jones around a giant maze, try and find all the rooms you can enter, and avoid the Nazi soldiers. Indiana Jones and giant mazes were meant to meet each other! There are other set piece objective activites like that which give the game some substance. Flying a hot air balloon is okay, just a smidgen too hard, just to name one. I recommend this game, but only as a novelty piece. It deserves to be counted certainly as a solid part of the franchise because it is fun enough and Indiana Jones enough. But it has too many deviant things to it to escape novelty status in my opinion.			"

												Indy Solo and Fate of Atlantis is much like Wispa chocolate bar.  In 1992 many people like Wispa and buy many chocolate bar.  Over years more and more chocolate bar released so Wispa sells fall.  One day sales so low that Wispa no longer available.  Ebay then filled with ""last Wispa from vending machines"" for large fee.Steam then say ""We will sell Wispa again"" which made people lick lips and claim they cannot wait...I buy Wispa, and it look like a Wispa but taste I do not remember being same.  I still eat Wispa, but think it is only okay.  After Wispa I go back to buying Aero.  Aero much better.  I am not mad I waste money on Wispa as it made me like Aero more.What I really want to eat is Spira whilst playing Curse of Monkey Island.			"

												I heard so much about this game, one of the best etc, started it, really liked it, the humour the puzzles, all fun.  Then the arcade sections hit.  Move a submarine around and reverse it into the hole with these controls invented by a madman, with no hands, or brain.Now naviagate your way through a big maze that extends over four screens (from birds eye view) with more than a dozen rooms, patrolling guards and where you have to pick up about ten different items to be used in various ways... etc etc... Ah, now that you're through you can naviagate ANOTHER maze which is randomly generated so that if you load back a too far you have to work on its crazy logic from scratch.... THEN you get to the end where you need a combination... It was on the wall in the maze, you saw it right? NO Then you get to redo the entire maze, that has been randomised once more...No game, no I don't, I get to remove you from my computer and watch the ending on a playthrough on Youtube to see the last two minutes I missed.It's a shame, the first half of the game is really good, but then it falls into a heap, basically when you get to Atlantis it's the worst kind of puzzle game.The movie version would have 2 hours of exciting action finshing with twenty minutes of the hero doing his taxes.There are three paths to follow to get through the game with extra locations etc, but you still end up in atlantis, so I don't care, I genuinly get more enjoyment from reading the FAQ's, so in conclusion, Fate of Atlantis can blow my pet dog.

												In the days when Lucasarts was pumping out amazing point-and-click adventures, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis stood out as one of those awesome stories that you can never forget. Anyone familiar with similar games like The Secret of Monkey Island, Sam and Max, or Loom, will simply love this game. Also, the game has a fully voiced cast, and plenty of action and puzzles to test you as Indy searches for the lost city of Atlantis. In my opinion, this game could have turned into a movie very quickly! In addition, it has some reply value, as the puzzles and situations change depending on your choices, and your adventures can be completed by using your wit, your brains, or your fists. Easily one of the best Lucasarts classics, and quite possibly the best Indiana Jones game ever.			"

												This game is what I would consider ""The fourth movie in the series"", completely disregarding the trash that is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It uses the classic SCUMM engine and plays similar to a monkey island game, but with a much more cinematic feel to it.Depending on your playstyle, there are THREE different paths you can take to finish the game. The ""wits"" path has more puzzle solving, the ""team"" path is puzzle solving with a twist of teamwork and dialogue, and the fists path gets you more face-mashing Indy-Action, without being constant waves of baddies.If you're a fan of classic Monkey Island AND Indiana Jones then look no further.

												When you feel like you need a good dose of retro adventure games or want to feel like a pixellated treasure hunter with a whip, pick this one up. A classic that never gets old. Fun puzzles, Indiana Jones'ish dialogue and nazis!An adventure game that never gets old. If you are a die-hard FPS-gamer, avoid this, it would be like giving pearls to pigs. You wouldn't appreciate this game as much as it deseves. All the rest, it is cheap, pick it up, sit back, start clicking and enjoy (and I suggest you to turn speak voices off).			"

												So be quick, point and click adventure games aren't for everyone. But if you want a terrific detailed story to take you for a wild ride with some gimmicks, decent puzzles and a little attention to detail....this game is it. This was the first game I ever owned as a child, and still the best in terms of story presentation as well as game progression.This game...shares among the top 10 best point and click adventures to exist.

												To start off, I'm a HUGE Indiana Jones fan! Much like Point 'n Click games, I have a love-hate relationship with Indiana Jones. I love the movies, but hate the video games. Out of all the Indiana Jones games I've played, this and Staff of Kings were the only good ones. Coincidentally, I first played through Fate of Atlantis as part of the Wii version of Staff of KingsThe game captures the wonder and sense of discovery that the films have, and combine them with the quirkiness and lovable charm of other LucasArts Point 'n Click games (Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc.). The iMuse music system is solid, giving ambient tone and texture to every area. The voice cast is great, featuring LucasArts veterans like Nick Jameson. Doug Lee does a great job as Indy, though his voice could be a better impression of him. The game play is your standard affair of pointing at stuff and clicking on said stuff to solve puzzles. While fun and well paced, the game suffers from the problem that afflicts all early Point 'n Click games. Every puzzle has one and only one solution. I understand that this is likely to prevent logical fallacies and game killing bugs, but some of the puzzle solutions are so obscure and strange that it borders on the completely frustrating. When it comes to difficulty in games, there's a magical ""butter-zone"" where the game is frustrating enough to taunt you, but not so frustrating as to make you rage quit. You know a game is in that magical zone when you want to beat the game to teach it a lesson. This game (as well as other Point 'n Click games) has a hard time finding that ""butter-zone"" due to its slow pacing, but it comes closer than other games like Uninvited and Deja Vu. If you love Point 'n Click games or Indiana Jones, this game is worth every penny if you can get past the vices of difficult puzzles and slow pacing. Overall, the game is solid, though it's not a game you should sit down and play casually. Fate of Atlantis is a game you need to be committed to in order to play.			"

												You play as Indiana Jones in a point-and-click style game. Need I really say more?Okay, I will. Unless you feel any nostalgia for old point-and-click games like Putt-Putt or Pajama Sam, avoid this game. These kind of games will usually frustrate and some puzzle elements are insane with how specific they get. I think the way these games communicate with the player is off, because I find myself hitting a dead end sometimes for longer than I'd like in a point-and-click, and then suddenly I'll have that ""eurika!"" moment and move on.. Maybe it's a limit of the genre, but I don't see too many leaps in this game. I'd still recommend if you like adverture games.			"

There is also replayability added in the mix, as there are three ""paths"" you can play through that completely changes the puzzles and interactions you will face throughout the course of the game.However, this is a port of the old DOS game. This means, that the resolution is very tiny, and if you can't accept the pixellation that comes with trying to stretch the image, then that is unfortunate.

												Lucas Arts at its absolute finest, 'Fate of Atlantis is one of the BEST Adventure games ever made, period. Multiple-paths, schads of puzzles, beautiful art design, characters you care asbout, and a totally original soundtrack make this not only a favorite of my childhood, but a game that has contined into adulthood as a pinacle of what storytelling can be. The best Indiana Jones movie that never was!			"

												I have fond memories of playing Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis as a kid.  Replaying the game still feels like a worthwhile experience, especially for fans of the Indian Jones trilogy.  Lucas Films should have used the plot of this game for its fourth installment of the series, instead of the horrid Kingdom of the Crystal Skull script.  This game is Dr. Jones and LucasArts in good form.			"

												An absolute masterpiece. The adventure game team at LucasArts were going through their golden era when they made this, producing some of the finest works the genre has ever seen, and The Fate of Atlantis is more than deserving of its place amongst them. If you've never played a pre-2000 adventure game (the last time the genre was truly worthwhile) then this is a perfect place to jump in. Logical puzzles, superb art design, and excellent writing, when coupled with voice acting which perfectly captures the sometimes-campy-sometimes-serious spirit of the franchise, create a story which is at least equal to (and arguably better than) its filmic counterparts. Buy this game.			"

												This is an all time classic that I loved as a little kid in the 90s growing up with floppy disks and pixel graphics, and the first time booting it up took me back.Fate of Atlantis follows the same design of Monkey Island that requires a user to talk, build, and combine items in zany combinations to crack puzzles and advance the story. This is not a combat game per say aside from fist fighting and requires players to use their wits. Sadly this type of game has become lost with the ages, which is a shame because the dialogue based puzzle games really are an outstanding genre.The graphics are exactly as they were when the game was first produced, as well as the sound...which is as it should be. Indiana Jones requires no editing or touch ups as the game itself wins anyone over with its story and puzzles that will make even the most clever player frustrated. This is a difficult game that I dare anyone to beat without the guide in a decent amount of time.			"

												This game is what I would consider ""The fourth movie in the series"", completely disregarding the trash that is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It uses the classic SCUMM engine and plays similar to a monkey island game, but with a much more cinematic feel to it.Depending on your playstyle, there are THREE different paths you can take to finish the game. The ""wits"" path has more puzzle solving, the ""team"" path is puzzle solving with a twist of teamwork and dialogue, and the fists path gets you more face-mashing Indy-Action, without being constant waves of baddies.If you're a fan of classic Monkey Island AND Indiana Jones then look no further.

												I first played this game as a child, at the start of the adventure game craze.  I bought it on Steam because of the fond memories I have of playing it back then, and it's always been my favorite Lucas Arts title.  Being an adventure game, the pace is usually whatever you happen to play it as.  In addition, it was one of the earlier popular titles that featured a choice of play styles- one can choose fairly early on to play the puzzle, teamwork, or action pathways.There are some things to poke holes in it.  The graphics are clearly from the early 90s and haven't held up as well as I'd hoped, although they are still servicable.  Some of the backgrounds are actually quite well done and it's only in detailed images that the quality is lacking.  In addition, the voice acting is not that good.  Since the subtitles are defaulted to on, though, one can simply put on some music and mute the actual game.The biggest problem is that the controls on the Steam version don't work as well as those in the original version.  Since most of the time, you're simply going to be pointing and clicking, it doesn't make much difference.  However, fight sequences (which are much more common on the action pathway) may be difficult until you get the hang of the odd control scheme.Those issues aside, the story is comparable to the movies (and better than Crystal Skull).  Most players will likely be able to complete a playthrough in several hours, but there is a save game feature should you need multiple sittings.  This is a fun game that all adventure game fans should at least try out.			"

												Ultimate classic, and surprisingly fresh even now. Lots of humour, clever dialogues, mind-blowing puzzles (provided you didn't look up the soluting online) - and that catchy theme tune which will haunt you tomorrow! Just brilliant.			"

												There was absolutely nothing I wanted more for Christmas in 1992 than this game. I got it and I loved it then, and I love that it's on steam now not only for the nostalgia factor, but because this was really a great game. The three different paths were incredible for the time, and creates built-in replay value. I picked this up on sale and I'm loving it yet again, nearly a quarter decade after it first came out. Worth picking up for only 6 bucks and a great buy if it's on sale.			"

												One of the games I grew up with, playing on an Amiga! As a point'n'click game, it requires some thinking but it ultimately pays off as the story unfolds... It's simply amazing. RECOMMENDED!			"

												Made in the early 90's, this game embodies the popular PC adventure games of the time. However, this game cleverly adds voice-overs to what would normally be a text based graphical adventure, which was new at that time. This game is fun and engaging until the last few stages of the game, where the puzzles get much more complex and vague. A few times I was frustrated with the lack of leads I was given in this game in order to complete the puzzles, and much time is spent walking back and forth just to transfer items to and from your inventory. All in all a good game, but if you're a fan of this genre, or LucasArts, or adventure games, or all of them, I would recommend the Monkey Island series over this.			"

												One of the greatest adventure games of all time, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis offers not only ingenious old-school puzzles, but a great replayability value (three different paths to choose from, each one with different puzzles and difficulty) and above all this, a story that could have been easily part of an amazing movie, a fantastic tale worthy of such a character.From the core of LucasArts's golden age, this is the game that any fan of Indiana Jones should play.

												This game is one of the best adventure games to come out of LucasArts. It features Indiana Jones in all his awesomeness and contains multiple paths for multiple playthroughs. Buy it before the desert swallows your bleached bones.			"

												The must have game for fans of Indiana Jones and one of the best adventure games ever made.  Pioneered many concepts for story based games and features a plot good enough to be its own movie entry to the series.With three different branching paths to the story providing replayability and the classic LucasArts SCUMM gameplay, this is a game well worth the already discounted price on Steam.  If you have played games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, Grim Fandango or The Curse of Monkey Island, this is just as good as any of them.			"

												This game may be old, but having recently replayed it I can tell you that it is still everything I like about Indiana Jones.The background art is still amazing after all this time, and this is by far the most stiking, and my favorite, depiction of Atlantis in anything ever.So, for a solid point and click adventure with branching stories for great replayability, definitely consider this.Plus it's relatively cheap and goes on sale fairly often. So why not?			"
