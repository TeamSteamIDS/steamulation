												Antichamber is easy to dismiss as a Portal clone at first glance; it is a first person puzzle game wherein you move from chamber to chamber, equipped with a puzzle “gun” which interacts with your environment.  But while Portal deals mostly in learning the rules of its mechanics and then adding complexity to those mechanics, Antichamber is a game which aims to subvert your expectations about how a puzzle should fundamentally work.  It makes you question the unspoken rules that video games abide by.  Frequently, it is simply brilliant and mind blowing, though occasionally it’s too obscure or random for its own good (especially in later parts of the game).There’s no real story to speak of in Antichamber, but the entire experience is expertly accented in a very sterile atmosphere and minimal graphics.  Sound design is also minimal, but well done.  Certain audio cues can give you hints to where you are in the world, and the simple tick-tock of a clock can become a fixture of an entire portion of the game.  It’s definitely a polished game which looks and feels nice.Of course, the real meat of Antichamber is the puzzles, and it’s hard to say much about them without revealing part of what makes this game special.  Suffice it to say that it is one of the most unique and creative games that I have ever played.  Environments are frequently non-Euclidean in nature, and rely heavily on perspective or understanding the rules of the universe which Antichamber itself has defined.There is inherent difficulty in designing that kind of puzzle; if you don’t abide necessarily by the rules of physics or perspective that we’ve come to rely on, puzzles can have arbitrarily hard solutions.  For the most part, especially in early parts of the game, Antichamber does an excellent job of staying consistent and teaching you the ways of its mind-melting world.  But in the later hours, you are bound to run into situations where a puzzle solution will feel almost entirely arbitrary.  Frustration will set in, and occasionally solutions don’t have the satisfying payoff they were designed for. There was one instance where I resorted to some online hints because, it turns out, I had completed an earlier puzzle in a non-traditional way and didn’t have the resources the game expected me to have.  It took quite a bit of digging before finally understanding how I was supposed to complete the prior puzzle so I could complete the current one. One very smart addition to curb some of this difficulty is the ability to, at any point, press escape and jump out to the central hub of the world.  From there, you can see your progress and also a map of the entire area you have so-far discovered.  You can jump in to any area you’ve previously visited, and I found it helpful to jump from puzzle to puzzle I didn’t know how to solve.  Typically inspiration would strike somewhere, and my frustrations would yield relatively quickly.  Overall, Antichamber is a smart, mostly incredible puzzle game.  Moments of frustration are almost inevitable here, and for the most part the balance is hit just right so that frustration results in joyous satisfaction when you make progress. It occasionally missteps and frustration just leads to greater frustration, but it’s easy to forgive when so much of the game is so good.  Highly recommended.			"

												Antichamber is by far one of the best games I have ever played. It is a puzzle adventure game similar to Portal. You have many different types of guns that can modify the blocks around you to help you solve puzzles. In addition, Antichamber uses a variety of different ways to mess with your head, such as the countless numbers of geometrical paradoxies. For example, you can walk through walls that you thought were solid. If you turn around at almost any point of the game the end will be right behind you. This game is extremely hard to explain but it is incredible you really must try it to find out.			"

												You have to play this game.It is not a game, but you have to play it.It is not that fun, but you have to play it anyway.This game is hard to explain. I cannot make a pros and cons list. Please, read the review, but my advice is buy and play the game without looking it up at all. It will just ruin it.This game is not really fun, at least to me, as I stated earlier. It is not much of a game, as I stated earlier. But it is a work of art.You will lose yourself in it's surreal world. You will have to learn a new reality. You will have to explore. You will fail. You will learn. You will like. You will hate. Now, I might be coming across like this ""game"" is bad, but it isn't. It is not even that much of an ""artsy"" game. It is an experience, there are no quests, there is no seeming goal. No real tutorial, nor any hand holding. It just is. You will feel smart at times, and at others you will feel dumb. Yet, the whole way through the game is ... is..... have you ever had the feeling of contentedness? Or the feeling of awe and wonder while learning or seeing new things? That is what the game is. You WILL, lose yourself in it, and that is good.The game is cleverer then you. But that is good.This game is good.Play it. Some things are always worth it  "

												Pros:-If you love hardcore puzzle games this is the game for you.-Unlike other shallow games, this one tells a story, the Journey of life -as it was first called. You slowly see it unveil as you make progress.-The main feature that I like is that you never know what to expect in the next step you make. The map is full of surprises.-The design is beautiful and unique.-The game requires you to pay attention to details and think outside the box, then you will realize that the solution was right in front of your eyes. It has its own logic and its own specific style, and once you come in terms with it, you will love and appreciate every single puzzle.Cons:-The music gave me headache after some hours into the game, so I had to turn the volume down. It's supposed to be soothing, but I personally found it a bit annoying.-There is no Antichamber 2			"

												After 1 year of procastinating to play such a great game.I don't even know why my brain decide not to finish this game last year, maybe it just got confused.Nevertheless, now I have finished this game and learn every life lessons that is included in the game.Every single challenge got real life advice from the dev.I admit solving the puzzles most of the time frustated me. But you will get the hang of it when you learn how the mechanism works.One of the advice stated ""With more experience, previous challenges aren't so difficult"" and that is indeed true.Truly a lifetime experience, one of a kind and will be remembered as a masterpiece.Last quote ""Every journey comes to an end"".

												Do you like games that screw with your head? Do you like wondering around for hours feeling like a rat in a maze? Do you just want a new kind of ""puzzle game""? Then this is the game for you.Antichamber is a game that throws you into a maze like a blind puppy. You are left to wonder around, confused and completely alone. Every turn you make is just another step in no direction. While you can beat the game in only 5 minutes, the real fun is how deep into the game can you get before getting extremely confused? I mean, I haven't even finished the game yet myself, but I have had so much fun. Oh, and do NOT use a walkthrough. Even though the game is a maze, it is only one maze. It doesn't change. If you use a walkthrough, you just basically wasted the $20/$10/$6.66/Whatever you paid for it. There really isn't much else to say about the game without ruining it. It's got simply yet beautiful visuals, and the ""puzzles"" are very immersive. Most parts of the maze don't care only about where you where. There are times where it depend son where you are looking, or HOW you are walking. If you want some brain bending, buy this. If you just want a game to waste a good 5-15 hours on, then buy this. It will not disappoint. 8.5/10			"

												I've never had reason to write a review before. You need this game.  Consitently, from its first moment to its last, it engages your assumptions and expectations in a way that opened my eyes to the potiental of video games as a medium.  Even through a relatively simple mechanic of interaction with the environment - i.e laying blcoks down and picking them up - it cultivates a very real sense of agency for the player. The game is not linear at all, in fact most of my difficulties happened because I was trying to do some puzzles before I had the rescources to do them. The paths branch off in all directions, and there are multiple ways into nearly every room. Each puzzle teaches you specific aspects of the rules, with later puzzles and abilites building and expanding on those lessons. All of this happens in a place where the laws of physics and spacial reality do not apply. I've had lots of my friends try playing this game, its crazy to see how differently they approach things. My favorite part of the game though is how you create the narrative for yourself.  I felt like I was unraveling a crazy, Lost style conspiracy complete with mysterious ""radical other.""Don't take my word for it, put a tab on your tounge, buy this game, and grow			"

-Quick Review-The Definition of Antichamber is “Brainteaser”. Antichamber is an indie puzzle game developed by Alexander Bruce (“Demruth”), Antichamber was released 2013 and is an excellent puzzle game that you should get right now.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: To my understanding there really isn't a “story”, not in the literal sense. You start the game working your way through puzzle after puzzle trying to get to the exit. There is a strong sense of progression and rewards for completing various puzzles, so in a way that's the story driving you... completing the puzzles and getting to the end. Gameplay: The controls are very straightforward, and the game explains how to play as you play... Unless you miss one of the hints like I did once I got the yellow gun. I had to wander around the game for hours before returning to the original place I picked up the gun and noticed the tutorial tip.As you progress through the game you obtain a gun, then upgrade that gun to get a different unique ability that will help you solve new puzzles and sometimes make the old puzzles easier. Just like any good puzzle game, each puzzle is tougher then the last, and often times dynamically different.This is probably one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, Antichamber forces you to think about puzzle games in a whole different way (“To think outside the box”), and after you've gotten used to thinking a certain way for one puzzle the next requires you to think of a solution a different way.There were a number of times playing Antichamber I thought “Yeah! I broke that puzzle with my creative solution” only to find out that the game actually EXPECTED me to figure that solution out the way I did. Expect twisted solutions, creative planning, strategic thinking, and down right mind screwing.Achievements: At the time that I'm writing this review, there aren't any achievements (07/23/15) but they could easily be added later with a patch. The game already has many goals and hidden pathways that you can find. Including added difficulty if you're trying to beat the game in a short time.Price: Antichamber is priced at $19.99, as most people who have consistently read my reviews knows, I like to spend an hour playing a game for every dollar.So far I've spent 6.3 hours in the game, but it has a high replay value because puzzle games are always easy to come back to play, even after beating them. (I forget solutions to the puzzles and go through the whole process again!)All in all, this game is definitely worth it to me, because I've enjoyed the challenges and the puzzles I've figured out on my own. (Just saying, I haven't looked up any solutions, if I got stuck I would go to another puzzle in the game!)Conclusion: To quickly recap: Story, Not applicable. Gameplay, excellent, challenging, exciting, confusing, winning. Achievements, Not Applicable at this time. Price, fair, better if you purchase it when on sale.I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle games (especially difficult puzzle games) For those of you who have played Portal... think of some of the most twisted... crazy... test chambers you might play on Portal? This game is like that, almost the whole time. It's awesome.I think this game deserves a play, and even if you're not fond of puzzle games, the developers are indie so they could definitely use the support!As always, thanks for reading my review.

												Antichamber is a first-person puzzle game that loves to trick the player with rule changes, visual sleights, false walls and impossible spaces as well as some testing logic problems.You start the game in a black-walled chamber with the controls printed on the wall next to a clock ticking down from 90 minutes. From here you enter the game's maze, where a staircase can lead to its own foot, walls and floors can vanish when you touch them, a set of rooms can be both horizontally and vertically adjacent to each other and pressing your face against a window can change where you are standing.The puzzles are well designed and for the most part - difficult. Antichamber is not a linear game. You will often find yourself bouncing off several puzzles simultaneously in different parts of the maze.In my opinion is Antichamber a must have for every first-person puzzle game fan.Sounds 6/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Antichamber wants to screw with you. An abstract puzzle game, it exists in a world built upon its own rules, requiring you to shed conventional logic and adopt an out of the box mindset to progress through the labyrinthine chamber you find yourself in. Up is down, going backwards moves you forward, and nothing can be taken at face value. It's one of the smartest games I've ever played; thoughtfully evolving at every step, as my feeble brain scrambled to keep up.To attempt and describe Antichamber would be counterproductive, and a rather hopeless task. The foundation of the experience is designed around self discovery and interpretation, making any outside explanation of how to solve the absurdly clever puzzles and navigate the twisting level layouts detrimental to someone playing the game for the first time. At its core, Antichamber involves manipulating the rules of its world to allow you to overcome seemingly impossible tasks and continue onward toward the next puzzle. More often than not this involves interacting with blocks placed throughout, by way of a gun whose functions extend far beyond the simple ability to move and delete.Though outwardly simplistic and plain, Antichamber's art direction (and to a lesser extent its sound design) is as purposely and meticulously designed as its puzzles; with clean lines and intelligent use of color all playing a large role in telegraphing integral aspects of the puzzles. Its basic graphical design also accounts for a huge portion of how atmospheric Antichamber can be. Often times I'd find myself so drawn into the experience that I'd look up to find to my surprise I'd been engross in it for hours, as time becomes rather meaningless once you begin to make your way through the chamber. It feels like being inside an abstract painting, with as much artistry and inverted syllogism as you would expect.The moments when you manage to solve a puzzle and move forward in Antichamber is one of the most satisfying feelings I've ever had in a puzzle game, which is why it's unfortunate that its intelligence can at times become a handicap; blocking the player from continuing onward and giving little knowledge of how to do so or where they might should head in instances where its functionally impossible to progress without collecting an upgrade first. This is a deliberate aspect of Antichamber's design and a large factor in why solving its conundrums is so empowering, but it has the unshakable counter effect of turning people away on the basis that the game is simply too smart for them (especially early on). It's a shame because once you begin to understand the way the world works the game really opens up and you can finally appreciate it in all its glory, but to get there you'll inevitably be hitting your head against the wall quite a bit as you try and make sense of it all.Antichamber is a rather intimidating game even to those with a mind for puzzles and an ease at thinking irrationally, but its one that's worth forcing yourself through the first few confounding hours for the brilliant moments of understanding that follow. The ingenuity of Alexander Bruce's abstruse creation is mindboggling (which I mean quite literally), and an incredible accomplishment that I honestly cannot believe came together without falling apart under the weight of its own ambition. I still only barely understand it, but even my limited intelligence can appreciate how remarkable Antichamber is; making me feel clever even as I can fell it silently mocking me for being the comparative imbecile I am.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

 After playing for a bit, I can conclude that you will say these 2 things a lot: 1. Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?2. And how the ♥♥♥♥ did I get here? In short  Antichamber is a puzzle game where the laws of physics and logic do not apply. Try and survive your way through the many, many ordeals in a world where common sense is non-existent. The game offers many philosophical messages which you will completely miss as you try to comprehend what to do and where to go.An amazing game if you want to lose your sense of logic and your sanity.Have Fun!8/10			"

												Early on in Antichamber, you will come across a room comprised of large floating letters that state ""W T F ?"". This pretty much sums up the experience... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite refreshing, actually. But let's start at the beginning - what is Antichamber exactly? It's not easy to explain. It's a puzzle game, but the puzzles you solve are not exactly of a traditional nature. The game is set in some sort of nondescript facility, comprised of interconnected hallways and chambers. Visually, the world is quite simple, made up mostly of bright white walls with a spattering of color here and there. You explore in first person and must figure out how to solve each room in order to progress. And that's where it gets even harder to explain. The solutions are far from clear-cut and there is no one main mechanic that is used from start to finish. You just have to think, experiment, and explore. Eventually you will find a tool that is able to manipulate small cubes that are scattered throughout the facility. But unlike in a puzzle game like Portal for instance, the cube ""gun"" is not the only component of the puzzle-solving experience (though it does become so later on). Rather, at first, you will likely just spend a couple of hours exploring, getting lost, and trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. It takes a little while to adapt to how the game wants you to think, but once you have learned how to solve certain problems, it opens up more of the world for you to explore. I know this explanation sounds very vague, but it's almost impossible not to be when trying to explain this game - it is very... unconventional. That said, I thought the game was really cool, though I can definitely see that it would not be for everyone. If you like games that have a clear goal, explain their mechanics well, and don't require much thinking, then this is most definitely not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you are curious to try something that is vague, never provides anything in the way of explanation, and has some truly ""out-there"" puzzles to solve, you just might find Antichamber to be a breath of fresh air. All in all, this is a worthy experiment in the puzzle game genre, and unlike anything else I have ever played. Check it out if you think it may interest you - just don't hold me responsible for how much hair you end up pulling out of your head in frustration.Final Grade: B+			"

												 A game like Antichamber should not be played by people like myself; games that have puzzles that go beyond merely logic, reasoning, memorization or problem solving and into the realm of beating your head against it until a solution reveals itself do not sit entirely well with me. This is more an issue with myself than those types of games for sure, but while Antichamber does take a couple of cues from Portal, this title is a drastically different experience that, while at times went way over my head, I can still recommend to people who want a puzzler that's different from your Trines or Professor Laytons or Mysts.I'm really the wrong demographic for this kind of game, but Antichamber's advertising suckered me in since I wanted an exploration-based puzzle game in similar veins to La-Mulana; puzzles that were made to crush lesser minds. While I did get that vibe and happily did so, Antichamber sometimes felt like it could get away with whatever it wanted and did so with crossed arms and shrugged shoulders to the player. The Steam store page does say, quote, 'Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward'. 'Accomplishing the impossible' may sound quite romantic to a player thinking about buying the game, but there are some cases where the impossible is possible, it just requires a ridiculous solution. To talk about these cases would just be absolute shameful spoilers and would take away from your experience, but the big pro tip here is that just when you think you've tried absolutely everything and are ready to give up, you actually haven't tried absolutely everything and need to try again. Not every puzzle in Antichamber is this 'impossible', as for a majority of the game your challenges are quite tame; blocks, switches, platforming, interacting with the environment, toying with some anomaly that's keeping you from progressing... Many of these can be solved just through expirimentation, trial and error or simple application of your brain, and for quite some time you can chug through the game at a steady rate, only meeting major opposition when you near the end of the game - And I mean major. Again, perhaps I'm the wrong kind of person for this kind of game, but at some point I ran up against puzzles where just nothing clicked and I found myself spinning my wheels in perpetual defeat, and that's where my enjoyment of the game took a heavy drop.What kept me from really getting sour on the game is that at just about any time you can return to the main 'hub' room where you can look at a map of the 'facility' (players have insinuated there's a story some kind, but there's no plot in Antichamber at all) and then teleport elsewhere. This means that you can zip around the game and try assaulting a puzzle again or from a different angle, never being stuck against just one challenge forever until you complete it. This is an absolute god-send of a feature, and one that no doubt has kept many players (including myself) from quitting the game with a bitter aftertaste. It's also incredibly useful since you can stumble upon shortcuts or alternate exits everywhere that will take you all over the place, sometimes not quite in the direction you wanted to go. If you keep hallway-wrapping into a room you've visited or accidentally fall off a bridge that melts if you're looking at it, being able to warp back and try again keeps frustration down to a minimum, especially when you're trying to find the matter 'guns' to further manipulate blocks that you need for switches, platforms or other impede your progress.The 'guns' is the aforementioned cue from Portal, and how they help you get around the game is the other. Again, to talk in detail about the puzzles you'll encounter would be shameful spoilers, but each new gun upgrade you find unlocks that much more of the game, with a myriad of possible solutions and new challenges to run into, which is a good feeling of constantly asking yourself 'what's next?' when you unlock this door or find a way past this chasm. You'll be looking forward to the next puzzle and not to the designs of the rooms as a whole since the game's sterile white environment at times feels just downright oppressive on the eyes, save for the splashes of bold, full colors that are strangely relieving when mixed in with the 'music' that is nothing but ambiance noises that I feel were designed to keep the player as relaxed as possible when hopping around the game trying to figure out a new solution. Color doesn't play any sort of theme like in Okami, but it does serve as something to take hold of your attention and to differentiate one route from another to avoid confusion.While it sounds like I haven't had the greatest time with Antichamber, I walked away from it (and completed it) quite satisfied with the experience I had, and some minor technical hiccups like major frame-rate hitches during transitions and broken floor geometry were just that - Hiccups. Antichamber brings to the table a wildly different kind of puzzle game that sometimes can feel like it's cheating in order to challenge you, but overcoming these challenges brings personal accomplishment that is its own high. My overall enjoyment of the game left something to be desired, but I can still happily recommend Antichamber to those looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow conventional rules.			"

												If you are looking for different and brilliant puzzle game, you have come to the right place. Some puzzles can be difficult but suprisingly not frustrating, if you find yourself to be stuck on something, you just go to do something else and things will eventually work out, sometimes you might even get to feel good about yourself for figuring it out.1000 / 1010 "

												A MASTERPIECE ON ITS OWNIf you're interested or semi-interested in this game, just buy the game, just BUY IT and  ''avoid as much spoilers as you can'' (my tip),if you dont like what you see in like 1-2 hours inside the game, then this game is not for you.I dont think this game fits to everyone since, you've to learn and progress slowly, talking baby steps until you can manage bigger stuff, a lot people wont have enough patience  or the game doesn't have enough action for them.This game also requires patience, while sometimes smashing your face on the keyboard might be the answer to a problem, the next time you try smashing your face that wont help you much.The sings you see in the game are one of the best thing in the game for me, they can help you in-game and to your not so in-game self.Take your time, learn, experience and have fun''Life isn't about getting to the end.'' -Antichamber			"

												Fantastic puzzle game, possibly even the best to date (Portal 2 makes a run for it). It really makes you think, and its use of Non-Euclidean Geometry (Structures that would normally be impossible in three dimensional space) adds a brand new aspect to the game that I have yet to find in any other. The graphics really add to the atmosphere and the music is alright if nothing special, while it's enjoyable at first it simply loops for the duration of the game and becomes old rather quickly. The puzzles are extremely diverse and become progressively harder as the game goes on, and while easy at first can and will become very challenging. Finally, only buy this if you are looking for a serious challenge, if you are not a patient player, don't buy it. That said however, I loved it, and would certainly recommend it.			"

												Well, I hate puzzle games, so I often stay away from them, mostly because I'm not too bright, and some stuff people find extremely easy takes me a LOOONG while to solve. Yep, math and puzzles are not my best.But, this game is different. Sure, it does take a lot of thinking, so after a long while of moving around aimlessly, I said ""Well, why not checking a walkthrough? ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll do it, I really wanna finish this game, but my head hurts and I don't wanna end up killing myself."" And...Jesus. This game.I freaking love the simplistic design of it, sometimes it looks as if somebody was just drawing lines on a piece of white paper with a pencil. Sure, that looks....Bland at times. But what really shines in here, is when you are suddenly walking in pitch black rooms with bright colors, bright colors in white rooms that look like splattered ink, stuff like that. This game does really make you feel like you are trapped alone in some kind of weird ever changing place like in that movie, The Cube. The M.C Escher like geometry in here is awesome, too.Control wise, it's the bare basics of a first person game, nothing too great about this one, but it isn't bad, neither.Sound....Well....there is silence, silence, the ocassional ambient sounds, and look! Silence. It really builds up the atmosphere of loneliness, creepy at times, too, like in a certain pitch black tunnel.You will frequently get lost, cry, and more often than not, you will say to yourself ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?""Also, another one of the things I love so much about this game.This game is full of signs with simple white drawings on a black background. When you click each one, you will get a phrase. All of those phrases are perfect for your everyday life, for succeeding, and for when you are truly down and depressed.Some examples:""Failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress.""""A dead end will only stop you if you don't try to move through it.""""When you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up.""""If you never stop trying, you will get there eventually.""""Falling down teaches us how to get up and try again""""We can appreciate the entire journey by looking back at how far we have come.""There is 120 of those, and jeez, it's definitely one of my favorite points about this game.All in all, definitely try it, if you love a challenge and thinking outside of the box, here you go! If you are like me, who wants to see the game and read the signs, then, there are also walkthroughs you can follow, so don't sweat it.BTW......The ending.....Wtf. I'm speechless.			"

ANTICHAMBER is a puzzle game based on a concept of thinking outside the box. The story is almost non-existant. The gameplay is enjoyable for most of the time although controls might be a little clunky sometimes. There are various puzzles and most of them have interesting and unusual concepts but they aren't very hard. Visuals and music are minimalistic but it fits the concept of the game greatly. It's one of these games where the less you know about it, the more you enjoy it.STORYThis game is about solving puzzles so there is almost no story except trying to find the exit from the maze. Sometimes you can spot some minor similarities with Portal, especially being trapped in chambers full of puzzles. Although in reality they seemed more like areas than chambers to me.GAMEPLAYMost of the puzzles have interesting concepts. Actually sometimes it's hard to call them puzzles but I don't want to spoil. Especially the beginning of the game is surprising but once you get the gimmick the puzzles become a little less interesting and way easier to solve. It might turn out that the biggest puzzle to comprehend is the maze you are trapped in. The controls might be a bit troublesome from time to time but nothing game breaking. VISUALSThe design is very minimalistic, mostly in black and white and some bright colors. It fits the style of often abstract puzzles but not everyone may like it. Sometimes I've got motion sickness because of the game but it was usually happening when I was looking around too fast. Nonetheless have in mind it might happen to you as well.SOUNDMusic is minimalistic yet athmospheric. Any dubbing in this game doesn't exist.Don't mind my recommendation because it is only my subjective opinion which shows if I've enjoyed the game or not. If you are considering buying this game, read the review and decide yourself. "

												I bought this game a long time ago, tried it for about thirty minutes, and then stopped. That was a mistake.Pros:- Very abstract approach to puzzle solving, especially towards the beginning of the game. Makes you question everything, essentially.- Mechanics work very well. Most of the details, including some very fine ones, are not revealed directly to you. You MUST experiment to work your way through this game.- I like the design concept of the ""main menu"".- The graphics are super simplistic (MSPaint simplistic), but I actually like that for this particular experience.(Possible) Cons:- The abstract puzzle solving! For the most part, I enjoyed exploring what I thought might be the solution to a puzzle and being wrong. There were a few times, though, when being right felt kind of dumb.- I crashed the game about five times. Every time was due to one specific mechanic, wherein the game engine is evidently not designed to handle what I was doing to it.- There is no real story and reaching the game's end is underwhelming. This game is 100% about puzzle solving and bending your ideas of ""what should happen when I do X"".Not your normal puzzle game experience, but an enjoyable one all the same.			"

												This is a game of deceit.No, not like a riddle nobody could answer, but instead, a game about challenging conventions.Many people like to compare this game to the portal series or other first person adventure puzzle games, but it's not like those in the fact that it never holds your hand. Instead, it finds a way to teach the player indirectly through experimentation rules in the game that were never in the tutorials preceding. It's like doing math in that respect.The game also has some metroidvania premises to it, you can't solve this puzzle until you upgrade your gun, an open world that you can freely roam, and a end goal that's so open to interpretation, an alcholic could probably have just as good a guess to the meaning.So yea, a game about thought, deceit, math, and metroidvania design.This could either be a chore or the best thing since butter on sliced bread.

												Having some unusual, but clean graphics, presenting strange physics, but very accurate, Antichamber runs its own league.It's a puzzle game that plays with your mind. When you thought you reach the end, it's just the game trolling you. You will often come back to some visited places and notice that the Matter Gun opens a completely new and unexplored path. Then you will reach a dead end and you will try new approaching techniques.In short, this is literally mind-♥♥♥♥. But a brilliant one. You will feel really satisfied after you get past a challenge. The solutions require careful thinking and sometimes the most unexpected idea turns out to be the correct one. I have played the game more before getting it on Steam, yet I never reached the end myself.Pros: +takes the ''unique idea'' to a whole new level;         + challenging and rewarding puzzles;         + the way you see the path (and this is actually a real hint) matters a lot;         + makes you feel comfortable in its world, as you cannot die or take damage;Cons:-after you discover most of it, there is not much that wants you to get back and replay it;         -can become frustrating at times, as some puzzles have very unexpected solutions;Personal rating: 78/100 - Good			"

												""Mind-bending"" is less a description of Antichamber and more a hint for solving its puzzles. The game clearly has its own consistent internal logic and random things don't just occur to mess with the player's head. However, many of Antichamber's puzzles depend on upsetting the usual order of things to - if the tablets of advice hidden around the game are to be believed - teach a lesson about life.  It is not terribly uncommon, for example, to turn around and find yourself in a different place than where you came from. It makes no logical sense, but over time, it becomes a reasonable solution. While still sporting more straightforward puzzles like covering a series of sensors with a limited number of blocks, Antichamber seems to more often beg the player to look at the problem sideways. Instead of looking for tools to get around obstacles, understand that every situation may not operate under the same set of rules. Be willing to adjust assumptions based on new observations. But these observations need to be made independently by the player as the game itself provides no real external assistance; even the ultimate purpose of the game isn't handed to the player. Without guidance, you're left to discover your own meaning to the strange and sometimes inconsistent world around you - just as everyone must do as they progress through life.			"

												A glorious game that manages to consistently balance head scratching with moments of euphoric revelation. Utilising non-euclidean geometry, the game requires lots of creative thinking and relies on your problem solving ability (rather than technical prowess) to progress. Though never frustrating, the puzzles will often have you thinking ""How the hell..."" before the solution simply pops in to your head and makes you feel like a genius. The free-roam layout and fast-travel map allows players to leave an area to try their hand elsewhere if a particular puzzle is proving troublesome which gives you chance to refresh your head.In my opinion Antichamber deserves the same level of recognition that heavy hitters like The Talos Principle and the Portal franchise have achieved and it is well worth a play if you are fans of those games.

												Protip for LSD – The Game: Real world rules don't apply.Ironically, they do give good in-game tips that apply to life as well. Like ""if you never stop trying, you will get there eventually."", or ""at times we need to view the world from someone else's perspective.""It's pretty hard to throw away everything that you've thought you've known, but the thing is that you're no longer in the real world, you're in the Antichamber. What is the Antichamber? I don't know. There's no narrative to the game. I think the game's sole objective is to make the player furious.But everytime I enter a new area my frustration is replaced by the desire to discover. What more can this M.C. Escher-like world throw at me? Why are the vibrant colours so nice to look at? Wait, what am I doing wrong? Then I get mad again. Rinse and repeat.Occasionally I hear the ocean waves and the cawing of seagulls in the distance. This game is very atmospheric. With the desolate, isolated tone they set up adding to being confined in the false spaces, moving walls and rule changes, I realize that sometimes this game can't be fun. It can be pretty draining. Took a long, long break, but I still wanted come back.And that's what makes this game pretty magical. It teaches me to think way way way outside the box, and it's great that a game can have that effect. It's engaging, mind-bending, thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind. I don't know how long it'll take me, but I'll finish the game eventually. Damn you, Antichamber.			"

Frequently mind bending; sporadically tedious.You would be doing yourself a disservice by learning too much about this game before playing it. For that reason I'll avoid talking about specific puzzles in this review.Antichamber regularly breaks the rules. It does so very carefully, building upon its own kind of logic. Puzzle solutions that might seem too random or illogical if they were in another game, here are made to work through a masterful progression that subtly teaches you how to explore each new challenge.In many ways it feels like you are visiting another universe that is similar, but not entirely the same as our own. As you play you are constantly questioning things that you otherwise would take for granted in order to learn the laws of this place. As you look around, the visuals are simple and easy to discern, yet often striking. Occasionally there are some uninteresting white rooms but by and large their use of line weight, perspective, color and contrast make for a memorable display.The most familiar and comforting aspects of this world are its sounds. Sounds of nature, from birds chirping to thunderclaps, are at times paired with the right swaths of color to evoke serene feelings of home. The music is mostly content to quietly set the mood until the final stages of the game where it livens up slightly with a primal drum beat. This is at once both unexpected and strangely fitting with all the sounds of the wilderness featured prior.Each of the puzzles you solve typically rewards you with, and is sometimes preceded by, a sign on the wall that has a picture and a short phrase. They are written with a double meaning: part lifestyle mantra, part hint or clever tie-in to the puzzle you've just completed. I've seen some negative responses to these posters, calling them pretentious and full of themselves. I disagree. I see them as cute, tongue-in-cheek rewards for our efforts that are meant to be taken about as seriously as a fortune cookie. They may also be teaching you to play more than realized. Without a discernible over-arching story to the game, they further add to the game by giving it a voice and a bit of personality.My chief complaint stems out of a system that I don't want to detail in order to avoid spoilers. Let's just say that in the middle portion of the game you are sometimes able to manufacture materials needed to solve puzzles. However, the process to do so isn't interesting and got tiresome as I had to repeat it while piecing together the proper solution to the problem at hand. It may be that I played things too conservatively by making more than I needed, but in a game that throws you so many curveballs, can you blame me? This problem is alleviated toward the end, but I would argue that this relief should have been fit in sooner.Antichamber exceeded my expectations and ranks in as one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

												Clever puzzle game revolving around the use of perspective and non-Euclidean space in a minimalist environment. Puzzles were challenging without ever really feeling unfair (except for one instance: but it turned out to be an optional puzzle so i don't feel like I missed very much.) Great fun for anyone that loves the puzzle genre and can handle the potential headaches of navigating things that don't quite make sense, unless you force it to.Things that annoyed me: There are a few precise platforming moments that feel awkward in the FPS scheme, and there was one puzzle that relied on an annoying jumping mechanic where I knew how to solve it but couldn't make the stiff platforming work 'properly' for lack of a better word.Everything else was fantastic. I beat the game and I still have some puzzles left unsolved. Some of them seem to lead to hidden side areas that only exist for the satisfaction of getting there.			"

												There are good games, there are brilliant games, there are classic games and there are one-of-a-kind games. Antichamber is one of a kind. If I was to compare it to any other games I have played, the closest would be the Portal franchise, but even that is only similar in first impression, usage of a non-lethal weapon-like instrument and making you use your brain. There, the similarity ends.While in most other titles the game teaches you in the beginning about its own peculiarities, Antichamber does not. You are never prepared for the quirks of its play with spatial dimensions, unstable matter or anything else you encounter. You are to figure out everyrhing by yourself. And this is one of it's many beauties.This is not a game just about puzzles. It is a game about self-exploration through solving puzzles. The philosophical pictures and phrases that you find while solving puzzles don't only help you understand the weird world of Antichamber, but can also help you in the weird real world. Nowadays there are many games, ranging from Crysis to Portal that to a smaller or greater extent make you think out of the box in order to overcome a certain obstacle. Well, Antichamber isn't one of those. It has NO BOX. You can never be sure about what you will find if you keep walking forward. Or if you turn. Or even if you look back. Or if you look forward again after looking back. Sometimes, you fell as if the only way to solve a puzzle is by tricking the game mechanic and after solving it, you realise that this is exactly the way the puzzle was intended to be solved. At the same time, unlike many other games of similar genre, it strangely feels alive on its own. The rooms, the dimensions do not just stay there where you left them. It leaves an impression that while you are absent from the rooms and corridors, they continue to live on their own. The cubes move around, the walls relocate. As soon as you appear in that strange, distorted universe, you feel alien in there. But this alienation is not of a menacing kind, but of a kind that encourages you to explore the world around you. And as you do that, the Antichamber more and more feels more than an strange trans-dimensional labyrinth.

												Interesting puzzle game that will keep you thinking about it long after you stopped playing it. The game attempts to make you forget everything you learned from playing first person games in the past, and learn new rules that apply only within its world. This might leave you confused at first, but you soon learn to play by the game's own rules and this is when the experience becomes something truly remarkable. The puzzles are very creative and some of them will have you squeeze every bit of brain you have to solve them. The art direction and music both combine to put you in a sort of zen mood where you are focused on understanding the world and solving the puzzles. Sometimes the controls don't do what you want them to do and this can be frustrating. Overall though, I enjoyed the time I spent fully exploring everything this game has to offer and would highly recommend it to everyone who likes puzzle games.			"

												Antichamber is a mind bending puzzler which has you navigate a series of chambers until you can escape/get free.It took me 8 hours to complete the game to 96% completion (missing 3 pictures). It was super fun. The puzzles were challenging, but not impossibly hard, and very satisfying to complete. As for criticisms, the lack of Steam Achievements was odd, especially since the game actually contains ingame triggers and easter eggs to discover, so it should be a no-brainer. Other than that, a great game.I don't feel it's worth the current price of £14.99. For that price, I would expect some replayability or additional content, for which this game has literally none, which is a shame, and I don't feel DLC would be appropriate, but it might happen.Definitely one to get when it's on sale, as it was indeed a fun experience.Nilesy			"

												The game opens with players spawning in a small, black room with a cartoon-style picture of a fetus on the wall. The first thing the player sees are these words: ""Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey."" Players then turn to find a second wall labeled ""All You Need to Know"" that displays the options and the control scheme for the game, as well as a third wall labeled ""Choose Your Destination"" that acts as Antichamber's sort of level select feature. The map on this wall is initially only one room big, forcing players to select the very first room with only a vague idea of what this first ""level"" might hold for them.From there Antichamber is very loosely organized, with players often being presented with multiple paths that lead to separate rooms on the map. Antichamber is often called a puzzle game, though its developers have more accurately labeled it a ""mind-bending psychological exploration game"". And in order to play Antichamber, your mind will have to bend—often into complex, pretzel-like contortions. The puzzle rooms of Antichamber frequently involve doing the opposite of what you expect. Each one requires creative thinking and the rooms often make up there own set of rules in order to solve them and then expect the player to figure each one out. Some rooms want you to walk quietly. Some rooms are shy and don't want you to look at them. Some rooms will only play fair if you walk backwards the whole time you're in them. Each puzzle is odd and unique, though I rarely found myself being frustrated. More often, I was enamored with their perturbingly unorthodox logic.Should players grow irritated with a puzzle, however, a simple press of the ESC button will bring you straight back to where you started: the Main Hub. As you continue through the game, your map slowly expands into twisted corridors with labeled puzzle rooms listed on it, allowing you to transport yourself to any puzzle you've already encountered (though not always solved!). Along the way, players will often come upon black and white signs hanging on the walls in the hallways of Antichamber. The very first wall of the game, called the Moral Wall by fans, collects these signs, each one a black and white cartoon picture containing some sage words of advice when clicked.The true beginning of Antichamber begins a handful of puzzle rooms in, when the player collects their very first Matter Gun, a weapon whose only ability is to collect and shoot out little colored cubes. There are five Matter Guns total, with each new gun being an upgrade from the last.  Each one comes with its own set of abilities and rules that make more complex puzzles solvable, but in order to use the guns players are required to discover these abilities and rules with very little direction from the game itself. It's this lack of direction that makes Antichamber so clever: the game never tells you how a puzzle should be solved or even how to use most of the equipment it gives you to solve those puzzles. Players are required to pave their own way, developing and creating new techniques to tackle constantly changing challenges and sticky situations. Soon players end up with a large set of skills that have slowly been discovered through hours of trial and error.Antichamber's journey has a quiet, unstated goal: there are no waypoints or quest lists to follow. Your only clue on where to go is the mysterious, flowing worm of black matter that appears early on in the game and the undeniable urge to delve deeper into the mysteries of Antichamber's hallways. However, a game like Antichamber does not need a strong sense of character or story. Antichamber places a higher value on gameplay and ingenuity than narrative, though the game is no less immersive because of it. In fact, Antichamber's atmosphere is enhanced by the silence of its white hallways and the player's fumbling, stumbling exploration of its convoluted structure.People often believe Antichamber to be a sort of Portal clone—you're locked in an inescapable labyrinth, armed with a dubiously effective gun, and presented with a series of puzzles to solve. However, Antichamber is barely comparable to Portal. It is a more somber game, with a much less linear style of gameplay that is focused more on discovery and learning than the progression of a plot. You do not connect things, you create and destroy. You guess and postulate and trip and balk. There's no smooth sequences of flying through the air or near misses with laser beams or perfectly timed jumps. There's only a slow contemplation and the constant sensation of reaching into a dark hole and feeling your fingertips graze against something warm and smoky before it just slips away.There are some games that I'm afraid to review. They're often games that, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find any noticeable flaws—games that I've become so pleased with that I would almost dare to call myself biased. Antichamber is one of those games that I've fallen in love with, a kind of unflinchingly blind sort of love that leaves me unable to see any of its faults. As such, it's no surprise that I'm giving it a positive review with the addition of a rarely ordered command: buy this game. Buy it now, and let yourself flounder in its often backwards and inside out logic.			"

												I 100% recommend this game if you like puzzle games. Most people compare it to Portal, which is a fair parallel although Portal is more weighted towards personality and humor whereas Antichamber is focused almost enitrely on the puzzles and your environment.The game is not super long - assuming you don't get stuck on puzzles for a really long time - so most people are probably looking at 5-10 hours of gameplay before ""beating"" the game unless you are some kind of puzzle god. Fun fact: the world record speedruns around around 2-3 minutes for this game! Of course, the game is always fun to play through more than once and trying to go for speed aids replayability. It's also fun to play with friends though it can be hard to draw the line between bestowing small hints to them and giving too much away so that the puzzle is spoiled.The puzzles reward lateral thinking. Many puzzles can be solved in different ways; sometimes they can be solved before they are ""supposed to be"" solve. Sometimes puzzles can even be skipped entirely. The game subtly hints to the player that the game is more about exploring and becoming a stronger thinker than ""winning"" the game. Some areas don't really lead anywhere and aren't necessary for the technical completion.Beyond the gameplay, Antichamber is an example of incredible design. The visuals at first glance are simple: most of the environment is white. The floors and walls are devoid of detail. There aren't a whole lot of colors beyond white and black in some areas of the game. That's not to say the graphics are bad though. Every visual is clearly thought through and offers a innovative beauty. Distractions are eliminated with this choice. The space through which you navigate is not too small and not too large. The interesting part about the physical layout though is that the game uses a lot of non-euclidean geometry. Not only is this entertaining and fascinating to explore, it lends a sense of mystique to this world you are thrust into. Through the warping of space and dimensional conventions, Antichamber toys with your brain and is constantly threatening to trick your mind.The audio choices are also fantastic for Antichamber. There's nothing distracting - nothing loud or obnoxious - to draw attention away from the game. There is quiet music of sorts, although the atmospheric sound is mostly relaxing noises reminiscent of beaches and birds among other things. It is quiet and along with the simplistic visual design creates a really unique personality for the game that totally won me over right away. The quiet reminds you of how truly empty the space is and how alone you are as the player.You're not entirely alone though. Throughout the game there are simple black pictures present on walls. Clicking these changes the picture into a brief sentence. These sentences are usually vaguely motivational in nature and also serve as subtle hints to aid in progressing further into the game. I adore their presence and it really is a great example of design. It makes you feel less alone because it's almost like the game is sentient and congratulating you when you discover new areas.There is no narration to the game, no real characters, no story, and no explanation even when you win. Similar to a game like The Stanley Parable, Antichamber forces you to draw your own conclusions. Is it just a cool game, or is there symbolism to be found and suggested meanings? It's up to the player to decide whether or not to try and delve deeper or not. Open-ended experiences always tickle my fancy. "

												Games can offer experiences beyond what is physically possible in the real world, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's ever sent Mario soaring ten times his own height to smash a brick cube with his fist. In recent years more games have experimented with warping the realities they offer players, and Antichamber might be the purest concentration of those efforts. Much of what you see and interact with in this strange, stark world does not behave as you would expect, adhering to its own internal logic. And while the game never really rises to anything more than a collection of oddities, it succeeds on the strength of its progression of puzzles.Antichamber opens with you standing in a sort of testing chamber. One wall lists the game options and controls, and another displays a map of whatever place it is that the game unfolds in. Selecting a spot on the map transports you into the oddly white labyrinth of chambers, hallways, and puzzles to solve. As you progress through the game you'll find clipart-style posters with inspirational-sounding clues that get checked off on a third wall in the menu room. There's no direction for what you're doing but you'll find your bearings soon enough, along with goals to work towards as more of the labyrinth is revealed.Your first hour in Antichamber is going to be a confusing mess of progress, and this is a good thing. The early puzzles ease you into the thinking necessary to tackle the challenges ahead: Experimenting, finding new perspectives, testing the waters, and so on. No two hallways can really be expected to work the same way. One might drop the floor out on you, one might split unexpectedly, one might dead-end and open a new path when turning back, one might only be traversible by walking backwards, and so on. The real tasks here are not figuring out how to solve a puzzle, but rather figuring out what the rules of the puzzle are. You're not facing sliding blocks or Towers of Hanoi, you're facing rooms with no floors and doors with no handles. The solution is always simple, but recognizing its existence is not.That's not to say there are no proper puzzles to be had. Eventually you'll find a device that lets you pick up and place small cubes which are used in all manner of more conventional brain-teasers like building staircases or blocking sensor beams. It's also used in far less conventional puzzles, of course, and there are some very clever upgrades to be found alongside discovering new uses for manipulating matter inside a world with mutable rules. I enjoyed working out the mysteries of each room but the block puzzles using your cube gun thing were the real highlight because they tend to be very constructive challenges. There was one specific one that frustrated by way of how picky the solution was but all the rest were little pleasures to tinker about with.You're bound to reach dead-ends as you explore the labyrinth, in fact the path you're most likely to take the first time in dead-ends to demonstrate how that original menu room works. Pressing Escape at any time teleports you right back to that chamber, where you can then use the map to teleport directly to any puzzle room you've visited. It'll take a little work just to puzzle out how exactly the map works but it's a surprisingly effective system for keeping the unconventional expanse comprehensible and easy to access. It took me about three hours to reach the end of the game (featuring an unexpected expansion of scope) and I found maybe 80% of the posters along the way so I know there's more to be found than just the conclusion. I wouldn't expect any huge secrets or revelations, though... if you haven't cottoned to it yet, this is very much a game about the journey, not the destination.The stark whites, bold colors, and strong outlines cut a striking image for the game to play out in, perfect for the surreal puzzles you'll be tackling. Any special features modeled in 3D tend to look pretty impressive too but flat images like the posters and other wall elements tend to be fuzzy and break immersion a bit. The sound design is just as minimalist as you're imagining but include some very nice ambiance in areas and terribly pleasant wums and blips for your matter manipulator. As a whole Antichamber isn't much more than a funhouse filled with tricks and subversions of game experiences, but they're executed and connected with masterful grace. I never felt like I fully understood everything that happened, and that lingering mystery proved more gratifying than the satisfaction that so many other puzzle games have offered. If it's a labyrinth of possibilities you're seeking, you can get lost in this title for hours.			"

												I can 100% recommend this game. Knowing about it early on in it's ""Hazard: The Journey of Life"" stages, when it was merely a mod for UT3, I knew it was on it's way to becoming a great title; 2013 GOTY possibility.Soon after release, I collaborated on Reddit with /u/raulness to become the Antichamber subreddit community head. I invite any Redditors to come down to /r/antichamber for a visit. We are mainly speedrun-oriented, but any Antichamber content is accepted.Then a few days later, I was able to collaborate with Prochamber on the Antichamber Wiki to become one of the two Antichamber Wiki Admins. We still have a lot of unfinished work to be done on the wiki, so I invite you all to come visit and make a few edits; don't be scared to add wrong information, it can be fixed.Finally, I learned of a small community who were speedrunning it, and attempting to route out the best/fastest possible path. Within a few days I was able to head this community as well. I've spent countless hours (well... you can see the number right there, but that's beside the point) routing and running in this community, learning more than I ever thought I would know about this great game (Edit: Like all the bug abuse that we thought was completely impossible for the first 6-7 months of release).Whether you're looking for a new speedgame, or just something great for a casual playthrough, Antichamber is amazing. The first playthrough is the best part, learning all the mechanics for the first time; and the speedrunning is always fun with an awesome (and growing :D) community.			"

General ReviewAntichamber. In my opinion it's a really great game despite being ""simple"". But beware because I promise that you are not prepared. Euclidian spaces aren't something that this game knows about. You'll most likely get stuck at least once. The mechanics are easy to understand but quite tricky to use. The ambiance is very relaxing actually, which helps ease your mind, especially when you're not getting the point of the puzzle.I can't really say there's any sort of pros or cons. You get it, or you don't. But while you progress you'll get a clearer vision of things. Some mechanics will be reused in parts of the map you didn't think you could.One other great thing is the motivational quotes you can find throughout the map. Getting them all is rather satisfying as well. But they really hint you on what to do sometimes.One small protest I'd have to make is dev rooms. They're hidden and sometimes impossibly hard to get to. But they also are decoys to where to go next or how to progress, which sucks. If you're going to hide them, sure but regroup them or put them on a special path dedicated to them.Overall I'd give it 9/10. I mean, it's challenging, it's somewhat relaxing, and helps you develop how you think things.I've found a ""Under Construction""-labelled door. Does that mean something will be added or it's just aesthetic? I sure as hell don't know. Find out yourself while playing the game.			"

												Based on the first hour alone, I would not recommend this game, but by the time I finished it, I loved it!  At first the puzzles appear to all be bizarre trial-and-error types.  I found that I could typically play for an hour before I'd get stuck, but then I seemed to immediately find the solution for whatever puzzle had stumped me whenever I next played. Despite the bizarre nature of the puzzles, there is a consistency that you discover as you play the game.  By the time I reached the final portion of the game, I felt like I knew exactly what to do in each situation.The minimalistic art works for the game, but it is not great.  Navigating the map is quite difficult during the middle portion of the game as some areas are only accessible if you make a long trek from another area and the corridors change as you walk through them.  Eventually you learn how to get where you need to go, so the navigation issues disappear in the late game (assuming you don't have long breaks between play sessions and forget what you've learned).I would say anyone who enjoys a good puzzle game should give this a shot, and make sure you play well past the point where you get your first gun.  The first hour or so may not be all that impressive, but I think you'll like it if you stick with it!			"

												It's an awesome game. At first sight it may seem sharp with such colors, but after the first 5-10 minutes of gameplay you get used to it.Tricks with space in this game are the best I've ever seen in games. Some similar ones can be found in Super Mario Bros. (in the last castle) or in The Stanley Parable. Unlike these games, Antichamber is a game about such tricks themselves. This game doesn't have a plot in standard meaning. In the beginning you just appear somewhere and start to explore environment and game mechanics. After you find the first ""gun"" things become much more interesting.If you like psychological, thought-out, extraordinary games, then you would  surely love this game.P.S. This game was in development for ~8 years (2006-2013, as it is said in developer's notes inside the game)Review was updated to fix some grammar errors and spelling. "

												A friend once described this game to me as ""learning to walk backwards."" After playing it myself, I have to say this game feels more like ""learning to *think* backwards.""Antichamber is a first-person puzzle game that plays with the idea of non-newtonian space. This means that if you walk down a hallway and turn around, what's behind you isn't necessarily the same as what you just walked through. There are a couple of points in the game where the only way to progress is to walk right back where you came from, which turns out not to be the same place at all.The process of learning to deal with non-newtonian space is confusing for some, although I have to admit that I am not one of those people. If you approach each room as a puzzle and ignore your ideas of what is in front of you or behind you, (as well as some real-world ideas like 'common sense,') the game itself is not actually very difficult.What nailed this game for me was the atmosphere. Set in what many have described as an Escher-esque world, the game's stark minimalism and use of visual space meant that even though the entire complex is built out of white walls, there was always something interesting to look at or think about. In some ways, I found this atmosphere to better than that of Portal - while GlaDos made the Portal series fun to listen to, with an ever-present and witty dialogue that provided much of the tone and narrative depth for the game, Antichamber removes the narrator entirely and forces the player to decide how much - or how little - narrative is present in the game at all. The lack of a Narrator Voice lets the game's own tone settle in the player's thoughts more closely, a tone that I can only describe at varying times as 'child-like discovery' and 'calm confusion', as oxymoronic as that last statement might seem. Antichamber is the kind of game that is best played without a guide, not knowing where to go next, with as much or as little confusion as that might bring you. This is one of those few interesting games that can intrigue storytellers and non-story gamers alike with a dialogue and narrative that barely exist, in a setting that does not conform to the vast majority of popular videogames.

												Even with a labelled map to tell you where you've been, I still have absolutely no idea where I'm headed.Absolutely brainbusting, Antichamber smacks you in the face, then teaches you a life lesson right after you just learnt it. Expect bucketloads of mind-twisting self-doubt, and that characteristic smug feeling after getting through with it. Feel the palpable sense of progress as you upgrade your arsenal from your bare hands to a gun, and watch it change colour as you unlock more and more.It's a real delight of a puzzle game. Get it while it's on sale, and you'd be proud to see this refined, clean white game sitting in your library. You deserve it. Pros - Life Lessons- Getting tricked by the game- Clean visuals; colourful- Sense of progress- You get to play with a gun Cons - Frustration getting stuck with puzzles- The game expects you to think			"

												Antichamber is hard. There's no doubt about it. It's a First Person puzzle game, and puzzles are by no means easy. Sometimes the game helps you with hints (mind you: don't think that those hints will give you the key to finish the game, nor to solve the puzzles... they are a sort of lisergic/oniric visions only). Sometimes not even that.It took me more than an hour to understand that there are ""weapons"" in the game. More than one, of different colours. Most of the things I've seen remain a mistery to me, and I think that this won't change ever. If you get sucked into the game, you will have great fun. Personally, the first person perspective gave me nausea/motion sickness, so I'm afraid that I won't be able to keep on feeling stupid in front of the absurd puzzles of Antichamber. Despite that, I think that the game deserves to be played. The idea is interesting, and the game itself is very well executed. It's simply very very very hard!			"

												The most concise way I can describe Antichamber is, ""a sleek enjoyable exploration of irrational geometry and impossible objects.""  While we're describing it concisely, another description: ""incredibly well made.""  The level of polish and detail put into every aspect of this game is admirable on its own, but the developers get a fair amount of extra credit for doing so on a game that focuses so heavily on things that break the laws of physics.The puzzles here are very well done, some being relatively simple while others take some complex reasoning to understand.  None of it is using cheap ""gotcha"" logic, that annoying brand of ""the only way you'll figure this out is by guessing randomly"" that entirely too many puzzle games fall afoul of.  There is a firm logic to this game, even if that logic could never work in our reality.As far as the setting of the game goes, it's truly minimalistic (as I mentioned before).  There's no lore, no narration, no plot structure to speak of.  The rooms themselves are all but untextured, relying on cell-shaded lines to show boundaries for the most part.  This would present a challenge in most other game genres, but for a puzzle game it's wonderful.  No distractions, no hamfisted attempts at making this more than what it is.  The conclusion to the final puzzle, such as it is, is a little confusing given the lack of context, but that's arguably what was intended.  By and large, the gameplay-focused setting is an outstanding choice.  Here are your controls, here are some puzzles, figure it out, and have fun.The only other thing that can really be talked about in this game is the overall enjoyment factor, and I'm happy to say it's quite high.  The well-designed but often intensely clever puzzles are a head trip to figure out and very satisfying to solve.   Even the ones you've already figured out can be fun to revisit as you gain upgraded equipment, especially as some of them have multiple ways of being solved and multiple paths to take from there.So, conclusion time: this game is great at two things: breaking your brain, and presenting you with fun puzzles to solve.  While it's not the first game to present the player with impossible physics, I can think of no other game that demonstrates so many and in such variety, much less making them the sole focus of a very enjoyable game.  It's enough that I would say even if you don't like puzzle games you should play Antichamber at least once, if only for the experience.			"

												A unique puzzle game using the first-person perspective to its fullest potential. The progression feels compelling, introducing you to new design elements and presenting levels in a non-linear, exploratory manner. There's something about manipulating the blocks within the space that feels satisfying, even outside of puzzle solving. All this with the stylish monochrome aesthetic makes Antichamber a memorable experience.			"

												Straight puzzle game, and does it excellently. The non-linear nature of the game, along with some excellent puzzles will give you a hardtime. The mechanics of this game are handled very well. The music is decent enough, never distracts from the experience. The artful visuals add the mystery of where you are.

												It took me a lot of time to have an opinion about this game. Because it's so confusing in the beginning that I lacked solid elements on which to build a judgement. Said judgement began to form halfway through, and never really deviated until the end.The first thing that strikes about Antichamber is its very unique and distinct graphical personality. It's essentially a black-and-white cell-shaded world made of straight lines, with touches of primary colours here and there, a couple shades of grey, and (almost) no gradient. It sure doesn't look bad in screenshots, but it needs to be experienced rather than just seen to really appreciate it. The graphics are striking, and even though they barely vary throughout the game, Antichamber is short enough that it doesn't become a problem.Going hand in hand with the unique look is the great soundtrack. I say soundtrack, but in truth there isn't any ""song"". It's more a collection of ambient soundscapes that blend seamlessly into each other as you navigate the mazes. It's beautiful but also unsettling because, in stark contrast with the cold and precide graphics, the sounds are very organic and often originate from real-life sounds like pigeons cooing, for example. There is a soundtrack CD/digital download (actually, there are two of them) on bandcamp, which I will probably buy at some point even though they are just static renditions of the organic/procedural in-game soundscapes.So, unquestionably, Antichamber is a great place to explore. But Antichamber is not Proteus: It's a real game, with puzzles to solve. And this is where stuff start to disappoint somewhat. Puzzles come in two varieties. The first kind involves finding your way in Antichamber's very personal take on geometry. This is not the kind of place where turning left four consecutive times will necessarily take you back to your starting point. Antichamber's space folds on itself in all kinds of intricate ways. Somehow, those puzzles are reminiscent of the parts in games like Dungeon Master (or Legend of Grimrock) where only a specific sequence of moves will let you advance and any other sequence would lead you in circles. And, if your memory of them is similar to mine, these were usually not the best parts. Of course, it's more diverse than that. Strictly speaking, many of the ""strange geometry"" puzzles involve completely different mechanisms, but the feeling is kind of the same. In essence, those puzzles are less about thinking your way through than about trying everything that crosses your mind.The second variety involves cube manipulation. Early on you'll get some ""gun"" that will let you manipulate the small cubes that feature in many puzzles. Those are usually solved by filling some space with the cubes. Achieving this will often unlock doors and let you progress. There are different ""guns"" that will progressively allow you to manipulate cubes in new ways. These puzzles are much more logical in nature than the first kind. But they're not always well designed. Very frequently, I would solve them in way that felt inelegant. I thought I was using a glitch-like solution and that there must have been a more clever, satisfying way to solve them. Unfortunately, it appears that it isn't always the case: the game's official FAQ acknowledges that some solutions may feel ""like a clever exploit of the mechanics"" or ""like a slow brute force way of doing things"".Antichamber is very non-linear. Not just geometrically, but also in temrs of progressions. You have access to a vast array of unsolved puzzles at all times. The positive consequence is that there wasn't a single moment when I felt completely stuck. Every time I fired the game, however briefly, I would at least solve a couple of puzzles. This is good, and all the better because Antichamber can be approached as a pick-up-and-play experience if one feels like it: It loads lightning-fast and constantly saves your progress.There is a flipside to this non-linearity: you also have access to many puzzles which you cannot solve because you don't have the right gun. And you have no way of distinguishing them from those you can solve. Another collateral damage of non-linearity is that many times, I solved a difficult puzzle only to find myself at a place I had already reached through another puzzle. It's hard to find a great sense of accomplishment in those cases.One last grief: NOT EVERYONE HAS A QWERTY KEYBOARD!!! I don't want to change my Windows keyboard settings every time I play a game just because my A and W keys are not where you think they are! Let the user customize the controls.Overall, I would still recommend Antichamber because it's a unique experience. It's also a beautiful one. The puzzles do get in the way, but because they are not that difficult (despite first appearances)and because Antichamber is short, it's bearable. Just don't expect that the puzzle design will come anywhere near Portal-quality and you should be fine.			"

												Pros:-Great visuals-Outstanding use of music/sound effects-Very atmospheric-Requires intuitive leaps as opposed to deductive problem solving which is a refreshing rarity.-Game does a great job giving you difficult but solvable puzzles.  It is able to fake you out several times where you think you know the answer but it turns out it was something different than expected.Neutral:-Game is pretty short.  Nothing wrong with that, just keep that in mind.-It is possible to skip several of the puzzles unintentionally if you figure out harder puzzles before the game ""teaches you"" to solve them.-No controller support.Cons:-No 1440p support baked in.  You have to modify some of the files yourself to get that.  Surprised this was an issue for a game from 2013.-Huge fps drops for some parts of the game. For referencing I'm using an i5 4590 and an R9 390. And while the game's suggested specs make it seem like it could be played on any computer made in the last decade, I played maybe a quarter of the game between 12-18 fps.  Other areas were a perfect 60 fps.  There are particular times this happens, and it usually has to do with how the game is routing you through the map.  I don't think there is any avoiding this.-Modest screen tearing despite repeated attempts to resolve the issue. -Poor control of character/tools.  There will be times you second guess yourself if you've found the answer to the puzzle or not.  It will turn out that you have found the answer, but it's more difficult than expected to pull it off because of both jerky or too fast motions.  It reminds me of URU this way.  The challenge should be solving the puzzle, not getting the mouse to click the thing you want.-Only one save file at a time unless you copy and store multiple saves yourself.  Hard to share with friends/family this way.-The game crashes for me toward the end when there are too many bricks around (at least I think that's the problem, not sure).Conclusion: I view a ""thumbs up"" as meaning you should buy this at full price.  In my view it's not worth full price.  It's a fun game that is refreshingly bizarre, but it seriously lacks polish.  There comes a point where I have to judge the game more for how it plays than for what it was ""going for.""  Conceptually, it's an A+.  Execution is a C.  Wait for a sale and pick it up then.			"

												I didn't feel the ""mind ♥♥♥♥"" hype surrounding Antichamber but I really enjoyed the game. It was an adventure where you explore the unknown in many forms. Unfortunately, because half the brilliance of this game lies in uncovering what you do not yet know, there isn't much replay value in it.If you choose to enter Antichamber, don't ruin it with walkthroughs or guides. Make the experience something special, about your navigation through a mysterious world where squares act like spheres and what you see is just as real as what you don't see. Do that, and you'll regret ever finishing the game because the second playthrough won't be as amazing.			"

												I can't believe I've waited this long to play this game. Mind blown with how crazy good this is. One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The mechanics of using perspective, the tool and it's upgrades that you get, and the 'outside the box' approach to so much of the game is just amazing. The way the progression works is also crazy. I have no clue what order I went to go from area to area and I also have no clue how much of the game I missed since I'm pretty sure I got to the end without seeing everything, and I like that that can happen. Do yourself a favor and do not look up any videos of this as spoilers will really ruin the experience. Only problem I have with the game is the lake of options over the visual quality. The number of resolutions available is low and my native resolution is not included (2560x1440). The game is capped at 60fps which is a massive let down as someone with a 144Hz monitor. Finally, I would have loved to be able to increase the FoV beyond what it had. Despite all of that, this is now one of the easiest games for me to recommend to fans of puzzle games. If you enjoyed Portal, The Talos Principle, and/or The Witness, then you will really enjoy Antichamber.			"

												Antichamber is a masterpiece of psychological trickery that systematically deconstructs and plays with every single unspoken assumption you have about the way FPS environments and 3D puzzle games work.Assume you're operating in Euclidean space?  Think again.  Assume a corridor will still take you to the same place if you walk down it facing backwards?  Think again.  Assume if you walk around a corner and then walk back around the same corner that you'll end up in the same place you started from?  Think again.Every time you get stuck in Antichamber it's either because you have an unspoken assumption about the way 3D games work.  Inspect your assumptions and work out which assumption to discard, and suddenly the whole game opens up again as what seemed like an intractable problem is solved by an action that - in retrospect - now seems as simple as ""turn left"" or ""walk backwards""... but which you were never even aware was an option before.If you like your assumptions unchallenged, this is not the game for you.  If you want your intuitions about 3D spatial navigation violently rearranged in the same way as Portal did your understanding of physics and mechanics, this might be the game for you.  It's only short, but you'll be thinking about it for months afterwards.			"

												It is easy to misjudge this as ""some sort of Portal clone"" from the trailer. It is NOT.In summary, you draw cubes from rooms and you can lay them in another point of the room to solve a puzzle e.g. building a stair climb up a ledge or placing it in a socket to close/open a door. Doesn't sound much interesting, but the chambers take place in some sort of mind-bending reality, playing with your perspective: rooms look like something else depending from where you are looking... Its hard to explain without spoiling the exploration feeling, I'm doing my best here! Expect many WTH moments.Puzzles are usually not trivial, some are even quite challenging, and the mind-bending mechanic is rarely used to impose ""fake"" difficulty (that is, the puzzles follow a logic that you can as well follow). Some chambers require some dexterity.I have two critiques about the game:- No achievements... c'mon...- Some of the puzzles are initially presented in a point in which you just cannot solve them. At first I thought the colour of the cubes were giving this hint away, but later I proved myself wrong. Its just frustrating.This game is fantastic, and even though the price tag sounds a bit too high, it is more than worthy.			"

I finally drew the map out on paper, wrote everything I know down and used a bit of intelligence to progress.  Superb puzzle game!			"

												Antichamber is like Portal but at the same time it is nothing like Portal. It is a game that will twist your mind. The puzzles are great and really make you think. It is really a shame that only once you get to play this for the first time. The only downside is that Antichamber is a rather short experience with almost zero replay value. It leaves you craving for more! But hey, quality over quantity, I guess.			"

												I bought it on sale, but even at full price it would have been worth it.Firstly, you do not play Antichamber, Antichamber plays you.If you had your sanity on the way in, chances are you lost it somewhere between the chirping bird corridors, the ending never-ending circle-spiral and the 23rd time you went down that same corridor by accident (except it wasn't that corridor, something's different this time).If you never had your sanity in the first place, you might regain some, this place probably makes perfect sense.Buy this game if you like Legend Of Zelda dungeons, Portal maps or thinking.Don't buy it if you don't like fun, challenges or insanity. Reality is an illusion!The world is a hologram!Buy gold!Infinite cubes!PS - Say hi to the purple cube for me.			"

												A first-person non-linear puzzle game set in a nearly non-Euclidian labyrinth, Antichamber is a game that toys with a player's mind: walls appear out of nowhere, doorways lead halfway across the map, and passages alter their physical geometry if they're looked at the wrong way (or the right one).  No clear instructions or objectives beyond cryptic motivational posters are ever given, and even when the player stumbles upon a block-manipulating gun, it's not immediately clear what the rules of it and its upgrades are.  This forces the player to explore, experiment, and think outside of the box, as the individual puzzle rooms are themselves just pieces in the giant puzzle that is the entire game.  While a minority may find the confusing non-direction of the game frustrating and deceptive, overall Antichamber is a unique and surreal game experience that keeps the player guessing right until the very end.

												I have never played a so mindblowing game in my entire life. I completly recomend this game. All the physics and reactions we are used to see in games are different here, wich makes the game a lot interesting and adictive. Sometimes you need to think outside the reality to solve the puzzles, and the less predictable the solution might be, better. Also, there's a really nice ending and some easter eggs around the open world set of levels. This is an awesome game for who likes different games and puzzles. Also, the simple visuals and the amazing sound work gives the game an awesome experience.I entirely recomend this game!			"

												A unbelievable game whose fame can never match its greatness.Pro:+ sophisticated puzzles+ charming atmosphere+ distinct arts style+ inspirational hint+ Con:- overwhelmingly visual impact- This is a game that I will recommend to everyone, for I believe whoever plays it, they will  definitely be absorbed by its charming experience. Or perhaps, they are inspired by those philosophical axioms, then acquire an obscure sense of life atittude.Gaming experience is incredibly good. Players will feel a great sence of achievement after beating every puzzles. Yes, puzzles are so well-designed that I regard them as arts. To beat them requires players to be good observants--in game, nothing is trivil, every single things maybe extremely helpful. Besides, players need to understand and master the function of different guns, and try to combine them, which make puzzles more challenging--but I reckon this is exactly what you want, isn't it?But I have to say, Antichamber has a unique arts style which is attractive for some people, but it may be too overwhelming to others. It is not hard to find intensive color clash in game, sometimes it may cause uncomfortableness or nausea. Please rest for a while for every hours played.All in all, great game, must-have. 9/10.			"

												    Antichamber is definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played. It's a very unique experience that plays with your perception and makes you think outside the box. It has a very bright color pallet that helps point out specific points of interest (although it can strain your eyes after a while), and it has some very interesting uses of ambient sounds. As you progress, you will find images on the walls that, when clicked on, will give you quotes about life experiences while also acting as hints on how to solve the next puzzle. On my first playthrough, I was completely lost in barely the first quarter of the game, mainly because I didn't realize that there are mechanics to this game that can be applied elsewhere. I returned about 1 or 2 years later, and beat it in one day, slowly remembering some of the things I did wrong the last time I played. The game may be daunting at first, but it's much more possible than you may think.    Another great thing about this game is that I can't recall a single puzzle in here that I would dread to do again on repeat playthroughs. In most puzzle games there's usually that one puzzle that you absolutely hate to do and you typically stop playing there. Even if you know the solution, it's so frustrating and uninteresting that you loose the motivation to continue playing. The most annoying puzzle in this game wasn't all that annoying once I figured it out, it only took me about 10 minutes and it was optional. It just unlocked a special room that was not required to beat the game, it was simply a nice bonus room.I do have some tips to save first-time players from unnecessary agony: Remember every game mechanic the game shows you, they aren't just one-time gimmicks.    In the beginning, the game will throw a lot of new mechanics at you one at a time, which made me think they were all one-time gimmicks. I eventually became stuck for a while because I didn't realize I had to use one of the mechanics from earlier. I restarted my save file, was re-introduced to that mechanic, and finally realized what I did wrong. Just make sure you remember every mechanic the game shows you, no matter how insignificant it may seem at the time. Most rooms and interactable cubes are color-coded. If your current or any previous guns do not match the color of the cubes, you probably can't solve that puzzle yet.    This is an issue caused by the non-linearity of the game. Often when I encountered a new puzzle, I was never too sure if I couldn't complete it because I was missing a tool or ability, or if I was just not seeing the answer. To prevent this from happening, just keep in mind that most puzzles that involve interactable cubes (the kind you can pick-up and place) are color coded to match the color gun upgrade you need to solve that puzzle. I don't want to spoil much, but you'll understand once you're further into the game. You can never quite get your bearings.    The non-linearity of this game also creates a problem with your spatial-awareness. The game has so many twists and turns, and some areas and paths are different depending on you current actions. This becomes very disorienting, and there is practically no logical way to map the game out in your head. There is a map in the game, but it's mainly used as a fast-travel system and to give you hints on where to look next. The layout does not actually make much sense. You kind of just have to keep wandering around trying the different paths until you get somewhere new.    Finally, some personal gripes about the game. There are a couple of ""dead ends"" in the game, they're puzzles or rooms that seem to exist for no reason. It left me a bit confused as to whether they were put there intentionally to add to the feel of Antichamber's universe, or if the developers actually forgot to remove/finish it. There's even a door that is labeled ""Under Construction"". There are also pink cubes scattered throughout the game. I was really interested in these, as they seemed to be some kind of collectible. Upon further research, they were actually supposed to be collectibles, but the feature was never fully implemented. Nothing ever happens when you collect them all, and there are even some that are completely unobtainable.    Aside from it's flaws, this is definitely a game that should be experienced at least once in your lifetime, and is a remarkable technological feat.			"

												In Antichamber, first impressions are key. This game is basically a massive mind♥♥♥♥, and when I was first thrown into the world of Antichamber it broke my mind. But to beat the game, you need to learn to think like you're playing a nonsensical puzzle game instead of thinking as if you were doing anything logical. After a while of playing, you get to the point where you have to do more than just wonder around. This is around the point where the initial ""whoa!"" first impression feeling starts to wear off, but don't worry. At this point, you realize that under this world of madness actually lies a challenging and very fun puzzle game.This game is amazing. The minimalist and colorful art style are great . Puzzles are fun. Going to all the rooms is fun. Breaking your mind is fun. I definitely recommend it.			"

												EDIT: Now a bit more of a review than just my thoughtsSo this is by far the best puzzle game I've ever played, and since this game I've played a LOT more. Other puzzle games will base themselves around basic physics, physics with some neat twist (e.g. Portal), or a few unique mechanics (e.g. The Talos Principle), but with all of them you start at the same basics and learn maybe one or two new things to keep track of and work from there. Antichamber is a whole new things, because it plays by a different set of rules and doesn't tell you what they are, you have to figure them out. Other puzzle games explain there puzzle solving device (Portal Gun, Jammer) and it's uses (Light Bridges/Energy Pellets in Portal, Fileds/Turrets/Switches in Talos) and then make minor variations to the same techniques you've used to get you through. Granted, some games (Portal 2) introduce a few new things (Gel, different kinds of buttons I guess) for you to figure out but it's always explained and eases you into it.AnitChamber (as I just said) writes a whole new rulebook, and then lets you figure it out. The things that at first seem random and inexplicable you realize follow their own rules and patterns, walls disappearing, floors breaking, rooms changing when you turn your back, windows that let you step into other rooms, it all follows a set of rules, and this game is more about figuring it out. The negative reviews here mostly complain about unsolvable puzzles and having to brute force your way trough things or look them up and a lack of guidance. I can say that these people are wrong. This game guides you (albeit in a strange, indirect way) through the puzzles and rooms, and the puzzles are never unsolvable. Some of them are diffficult, but never unsolvable. The game makes use of a system allowing you to leave and travel to other rooms at any time, making the backtracking you have to do very simple and quick, and it makes the realization that you've stumbled into a room you are currently unequipped to solve that much easier because you're never more than four clicks away from going back to a fork in the road, a room you want to take another crack at, or a puzzle you know you can solve now.Just like in the original review though, I still have one complaint: this game has ruined puzzle games for me; games like Portal or the Talos Principle hold very little interest to me by comparison to this game.Original (much more subjective) review:Hands down the greatest puzzle game I've ever played. Everything from the mechanics to the aestetics and controls work wonderfully together to create an experience unlike any other game I've played to date.I honestly wish I could remove my meories of this game and play it again as a fresh experience.The only real complaint I have about this game is now puzzle games like Portal hold little interest to me by comparison.

												simply one of the best games i have ever played. Often you think you tricked the game, broke the rules and managed to solve a puzzle or get past an obstacle by cheating. But after playing through the whole game, i think it was everything just supposed to be like that.and this is only one little part of the game. If you can't solve a puzzle one day and come back the other day with a free mind and solve it, it's an awesome experience.TL;DR absolutely awesome mindbending game, but you have to learn how the world works and that may take some time! stay strong!

												If you don't know who M. C. Escher is, search his work up. You've probably seen one or two of his pieces before and never realized it. If you already know and love Escher, then you will not only appreciate Antichamber's look, but you will likely enjoy playing it.First of all, this game is not easily comparable to Portal. They have similar aesthetics; you are in first person, you are some voiceless being, and you simply interact with the very concrete world around you to solve puzzles as they arrive, until everything you've come across is no longer a mystery. The similarities stop there. Portal is linear; it has humor, it has lore, it makes you feel your situation like you are a character in a world with the odds against you, and it pushes you forward through each puzzle with just enough to solve it and move on.Antichamber, in this aspect, is the exact opposite. You will not feel like someone else, like someone installed into the lore, or like a character who needs to escape from their situation. You will start with absolutely no clue what you're doing or what you can do, and you will come across each challenge using only a portion of it, and then have to return to a room later just to suddenly realize what everything was supposed to do all along. All the pieces of the puzzle will click together. Then you move forward.Every single room in this game is available to you at all times. It's not linear, not at all. If you run into a dead end, you press your Escape key, return to the start of that room and try to figure out what you did wrong previously, or jump somewhere completely different all the way across the map and find out what you can now do that you never used to be able to. However; things are still connected. There's nothing meaningless. You'll have to fail a lot in order to succeed in the end.I've addressed these specific things about Antichamber because the majority of the complaints in the Negative reviews section seems to be built on the idea that these are bad things. Tedious trial-and-error, statements trying too hard to sound wise, a lack of any direction to what needs to be solved next. Are they bad things? Do they go against the definition of a puzzle game? No. Those kinds of things are purely subjective. In this review I am not telling you to buy this game. I'm not going to try to convince absolutely everyone that this game will be in their taste. I have told you what Antichamber is.The only honest reviews you read from the Negative section about Antichamber will be the ones that say ""This game is not my cup of tea.""			"

												What they say is true; this game plays you, hard. It puts you in the mindset that you yourself are legitimately trapped in a labyrinth and you need to find your way out. The mental stimulation keeps you on edge, and you can play for hours without noticing. You get a lot of of this game; while struggling through puzzles, you also learn a lot about life itself. The puzzles you solve are metaphorical of problems you face in real life, as the lessons you learn at the end of each one will enable you to be wiser both in the game and in real life. I highly recommend it for anyone who seeks intellectual stimulation, wonder, and a game that will humble you.			"

												I'll be vague to avoid spoilers.In many ways Antichamber is like a less in your face and heavy handed alternative to Stanley Parable. The same use of impossible space, fourth wall breaking and meta commentary but without the zany on the nose ""Oh ho! AM I BLOWING YOUR MIND!"" narrator. It also more importantly has actual interaction with a range of extremely clever and twisty little puzzles that feel like they really respect the players intelligence and which are laced with subtle humour and moments of epiphany. The game does overuse a couple of its more fiddly elements. But it is never the less a wonderful experience .Highly recommended.			"

												That´s particulary amazing. Even though I got this as a gift, I would have paid the full price. I should have got this way earlier, but I didn´t know if it was being worth it. It is. When you are playing this for your first time you may be confused, you will wonder what kind of game this is. But once you are getting started, this will become more and more interesting. Who said a game needs to look realistic? This is the proof that isn´t the case at all. Antichamber looks amazing, but yet UNREAL (got it?). You are wondering what that ""Antichamber"" is, while you are trying to succeed. There isn´t much explanation needed, it´s easy to progress by trial and error and you still won´t get upset. I am really enjoying the design, as weird as it is, and I always managed to play on. There are also a lot of hidden hints, all over the map, which is enourmous. Later you can even unlock some helpful abilities while you´re trying to find out what´s going on. In case you doubt like I did, don´t wait to buy it. If you like Puzzles, you will love this!			"

												Antichamber feels like the opposite of Portal, Quantum Conundrum and Q.U.B.E. Those games make use of logical puzzles, Antichamber... does not. It will force you to think outside the box. And that is not an easy task for most of us.The game itself consists of a mostly seamless world (until you get to a part where you're being forced to teleport out of it), with puzzles in every corner. Not all of these puzzles have to be finished for you to complete the game, but you do have to collect the 4 different guns in order to advance and finish the game. Once again, not an easy task.I'd love to explain some of these puzzles to you but that would spoil them and it's too difficult to even try anyway. It's something you have to experience, if only for a short while.Antichamber has another cool feature; the use of in-game achievements. The rooms use icons/pictures and text to act as in-game achievements. Seeing them lets you know if you've been there before and it might even give you a subtle hint on what to do. You'll have to solve every puzzle there is so fill up your wall. It would've been nice if there were Steam achievements involved as well, but hey, you can't have everything I guess.One annoying thing is that if you press Escape you have to start over if you wish to continue the puzzle you were working on. There's no pause button, if you press Esc you're back in the 'main menu' where you can select which puzzle you want to solve and see your achievements. Quite annoying if you want to take a little break.Oh, as you may have noticed the graphics are a mix of simplistic, artistic and futurustic styles, and while they're not always hi def, they're cool to look at. It's really something special.Hmm, I don't know what to say to you. I wish I could recommend this game to anyone out there, but I think it's a 'love it or hate it' game. As a game though, it's a success ![Rating: 77/100]			"

												Welcome back everyone. Today I'm takin' a look at Antichamber, a mysterious exploration-filled puzzler buster of a title. I'm not the most experienced when it comes to games of this genre, but I walked away from this with a pretty solid sense of contentment in my belly.Right off the bat, here are some things I didn't quite like about Anitchamber. The game is pretty short, probably around the 6-8 hour range. Your time spent on this will vary depending on how long it takes you to complete the puzzles, if you use guides, and if you know where you are going, but it's certainly more comparable to a delicious double-chocolate cupcake rather than a triple-layer funfetti birthday cake.Throughout the game you acquire a couple abilities that make certain puzzles possible, but I found myself getting frustrated that I couldn't tell whether the puzzle I was trying to solve was even solvable at this point in the game. ""Do I need the next upgrade to get past here?"" Those are the words that were spoken in my mind.Outside of these issues, Antichamber is a real psychedelic trip through a clusterball labyrinth of mind-bending chasms and confusing conundrums so confounding that it would make a goose liver take a swift elbow to the gut before it could understand what lies before it. The puzzles are a real treat in this game and they made me think outside the box to solve them, especially the ones early on.There really is no feeling like trying to solve a puzzle, and you endure a solid 15 minutes of mentally taxing brain processing before you discover the simple solution that seems so obvious in hindsight. It's really something to experience that lightbulb moment where it all comes together and Antichamber really NAILS IT when it comes to this.This is not a title I would recommend to anyone, but for those of you who are into this style of puzzle-ish problem solving mystery crackin' nonsense, I think this would be right up your alley. Well-made game, simple and effective design, difficult and interesting puzzles. Maybe not worth 20$, IN MY OPINION, but it's certainly one of the wackest games i've played in some time. To put things simply, if Antichamber was a type of co-worker, he'd be a quiet, moody lookin' guy who can really grind your gears sometimes, but then he brings in sprinkle donuts for everyone and you realize he's a stand-up fellow. Thanks for reading this review.			"

												I honestly, truly have absolutely no idea why I delayed getting this game....Although abstract and simple (as seems natural for many puzzle games to help the player focus on the puzzles), it's colorful, and needless to say, surreal and non-Euclidean.  That and the soothing, soft ambient sounds and music were so mesmerizing that I actually lost sleep while trying to solve the riddles.  It's art therapy in a way, which eases the otherwise extremely painful mental anguish that would melt lesser minds (yes, this game is not for the faint of mind unless you're daring, but I recommend it anyway for its looks).Having been very well-trained with the Portal series (and even seeing some workshop maps which imitate the classic ""many paths to nowhere"" room), I kinda knew what to expect.  Plus I love to explore.  Here you're exploring not with a portalgun, but with a 3-time upgradeable cube gun, which you use to solve various areas of the map.  And although random guessing in not required to reach the end, you will need a touch of it for the easter eggs in this game.  So, if it ever feels like you need to rely on random guessing, you really only need to think more creatively.This game is a learning adventure, right from the time you start in the antechamber with the UI and your map to the time you end the game.  You may be able to take some things for granted (and may even become familiar with them), but not everything.  You must learn to think, to look, to visualize, to remember, to unlook, and to unthink.  If you're stuck, there are hints on the walls, both in pictures and in words, which altogether make for a nice little philosophy lesson on the ""where"" of life.Among puzzle games in general, I rank this one right up there with Portal (except Portal's better since it has a more developed game engine, graphics, and storyline, not to mention replay value via custom-made maps and mods).

												You are nothing. A wanderer, adrift in a mysterious world that is otherwise physically impossible. Your memory is time and time, deceived. Deja vu moments and memory gaps, contradictorty as they may seem, plague your mind.You obtain a cube gun, which generates...well...One can argue that you simply create cubes, and nothing elseBut one can also argue that you create life. The first cube gun, which can pick up and shoot little units, cells perhaps.Your tool shall evolve as you progress, as the quotes you encounter unfold a story of pictures.You will create plant life, gardens of inward growth. Your gardens will transform into animals, primitive snakes of sorts, slithering upon command.You progress, a plague, a virus, horrendous, beautiful, but limited in dimension.Your final form, a carrier, a harbringer of death, a black hole, a plague. The end of all, yet a beginning of a life of wisdom.You play the story of one who creates life and death amidst a grand puzzle in which you attempt to define the impossible with what seems real to you. Only by performing the unconventional action within an unconventional space, rather than the conventional action within the unconventional space (which is not the same as performing a conventional or unconventional action in a conventional space) can you hope to progress.Enjoy the game that teaches you more about life than society ever will.

												This game is absolutely fantastic!  It's like Portal on LSD, but rather than use portals, you use guns that can shoot and absorb cubes with varying abilities the higher quality gun upgrades you find.  There are little proverbial quotes at the end of every little puzzle, replete with charming pictures, that a little bit of flair to game, despite its lack of ANY story whatsoever.  Nevertheless, it is certainly a brain teaser one can enjoy.			"

												----A 3D Real Engine ran puzzler, that left me short of words at the end. An indie game I passed by and played a couple years after its release, that has some pretty clever puzzles, from the simple movement of blocks, to the outright mass replication of the same few blocks to (in my case) an entire floor of the same block set you started with. Mind you I missed some puzzles more than likely, and the mystery of the pink roaming block is yet to be cleared as of this review, but what I did from a standard start-to-finish playthrough of this gem, I can safely say theres plenty to do that I've yet to see myself. You get pretty much thrown into the world, with no real spoken start, just signs that can be used as proverbs for life, or big hints for the games. Even the silly little cartoon drawings in them made me chuckle from time to time, while others made me reflect on life.----The controls itself, were pretty direct, and the menu was thrown into the nexus room, not saying that it was a messy move, mind you, it in fact was quite the opposite. The Esc menu itself was actually something you returned to often, whether you wanted to or not. It in of itself, was a nexus that almost acted like a brick wall, but at the same time, an indicator for where you are in progress. Sensitive and precise, you can easily snag a block from across the room and place it elsewhere, which it requires you to do exactly that in some puzzles. Even when you gain new abilities though a differently colored ""Matter Gun"" (as I like to call it), it gives you a lesson on the basics, and leaves you to notice the rest on your own. The controls are quite simple and limited to your three mouse buttons (left and right click, and mouse wheel click) and the standard WASD to move. Those familiar with FPS games in terms of controls, won't feel too alien to the game, at the same time, anyone can just simply pick it up.----The gameplay, is puzzles, puzzles puzzles puzzles. Not that its bad as well, in fact its quite nice, since the puzzles aren't simple after a while, and involve some true out-of-the-box thinking. I can't say too much about the puzzles without spoiling too much, but your worse enemy is your eyes. Theres also no bugs that I've found, only the occasional graphics flicker in very miniscule zones, which is very ignorable, and likely due to my GPU. Also your ESC menu is a damn room with a map to warp from place to place on. So the puzzles won't be so draggish if you have to repeat them for some form of progress.----The music is sort of there, not that I'm complaining about its subtlty, since its all atmospheric sounds and music. From a meadow to a swamp, you pretty much get placed in a rather clear state of mind, and in my opinion, a good clear mind for some of these puzzles.----The graphics are simple, and yet clever in reason. Even the graphics will make you wonder if its part of the solution. Hint hint.----The difficulty is wholy dependent on you, this could be the easiest game you will ever play, or the hardest one you will even attempt. With the game throwing you for loops, sending you into ""Dead-ends"" or just outright dumping you somewhere else entirely, new or familiar. Things change around you, causing you to miss things, or notice them outright. It keeps you on your toes, and tries to fool you into thinking some parts are pointless, while others may get you somewhere.----All in all, the game is a fantastic grab, even if I got it on Humble bundle, and did this review after it was done and over. Its still worth a purchase and some time. Though personally, for the purest experience, don't use any guides, considering it can easily reduce the effect of the game. I don't want to review this game on a numbered scale, because that stuff is so askewed lately for game reviews, so if you're into puzzle games, or just into something to sink your time into between breaks of other games, hell even just to play it, I say its highly recommended.

												Antichamber is a thoroughly mind-melting first-person puzzle game that utilizes non-euclidian geometry as most of the puzzle elements. Now there's a sentence that doesn't apply to most games.The visuals are very simple; the hallways are mostly white, with only black lines to indicate where corners are. Colors are very important in this game; they can help you orient yourself as the world changes around you (did I mention that you can be walking down a hallway, get to the end, turn around, and see a completely different hallway behind you?). The color of your gun also determines what its powers are. There are several sections of the game, each requiring a different gun to solve its puzzles.Speaking of puzzles, they are a doozy. Because the game does not rely on traditional notions of geometry, they can really do whatever they want. I don't want to spoil any of the puzzles, but don't feel discouraged if you can't solve one the first time you try. Sometimes there is a tool or technique that you have to get in a different chamber first. And even if you get completely stuck, you can just hit Esc at any time and go to the Antichamber.The antichamber serves as a main menu. The game's options and controls are all plastered over one wall, a map of all of the chambers you have been to (you can travel to any one of them from the antichamber) a view of what claims to be the exit, and a big chalkboard of the lessons you have learned.Those lessons are my favorite thing about the game. They are often placed just before or after a puzzle, and they contain a life lesson that pertains to that particular puzzle.I've played about three hours of the game, and I have discovered two different colors of the gun, and I think there are two more. I'm kind of stuck though, and I might have to bite the bullet and look at some walkthroughs.I would say that a reasonable price for this game is $10, so you should definitely wait until it is on sale to pick it up.

I though I rush through it like nothing, since it doesn't look like much, but I got lost uncountable amounts of times. Many times I was hitting my head against the wall because some puzzles where so difficult. In the end I was sad though, because this game came to an end.

												Right next to Portal, this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Consistently and continually challenging, the puzzles stay diverse and multilayered right until the end. The smooth sound and visual style let you think and relax at the same time. Unlike many other games in the genre, this one gives you space and tools to play around with and lets you complete the puzzles at your own pace, and it's full of little secrets for those curious enough to find them. Highly recommended.			"

												Excellent puzzle game. Haven't enjoyed a puzzle game as much since Portal 2 and the Talos Principle. If you enjoyed any of these 2 games you will surely enjoy Antichamber.The game does not hold your hand quite as much as the above, however. There are some ""learning puzzles"" and hints, but some of the basic mechanics and moves are left for you to discover. I came across some while fooling around rather randomly, and this can be a source of additional excitement or frustration, depending on how long it takes to discover. If you are stuck, it probably means you have missed something about the mechanics.On the other hand there are several paths possible which is great since if you are stuck you can simply switch to another puzzle room and avoid getting too frustrated, possibly coming back to it later with a fresher mind or improved knowledge of the mechanics. Only real downside is that is is fairly short, I finished my first playthorugh in 12 h, so you may want to wait for a sale.			"

But be aware! I never heard of motion sickness before and I didn't read any comments before i purchased this item, but I was feeling sick after the first 20 minutes of gameplay. I had to sotp for 2 hours before i could return.I found out, that using speakers instead of a headset and Downsampling (NVIDIA: http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dsr/technology ) help a lot.Downsampling is great because it sharpens the blurry models used by this game.Enjoy!

The focus on exploration and the unconventional style of puzzles makes this one of the best yet confusing games out there.Don't let yourself get fooled by the artstyle, this game is actually pretty beautiful. The ambient sounds also play a big role in the games overall great atmosphere.Finishing the game takes about 4-8 hours, depending on how good you understand the game. However, there is a lot more to discover, since you most likely haven't seen everything by just playing the game once.  There are also some secret rooms with really cool stuff in them.Personally, I found myself going back to the game many times, and playing it beyond completion. I don't really know why, there is just something special about it.			"

I came across some while fooling around rather randomly, and this can be a source of additional excitement or frustration, depending on how long it takes to discover. If you are stuck, it probably means you have missed something about the mechanics.On the other hand there are several paths possible which is great since if you are stuck you can simply switch to another puzzle room and avoid getting too frustrated, possibly coming back to it later with a fresher mind or improved knowledge of the mechanics. Only real downside is that is is fairly short, I finished my first playthorugh in 12 h, so you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												Antichamber is a amazing exploration puzzle game. There are alot of aspects of this game that I liked and very little that I didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Overall a interesting story.+ Puzzles were well thought of.+ Great atmosphere.+ Sound is well done and matches with the gameplay perfectly.+ 10+ hours of gameplay if you suck at puzzles too.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- The anti-alising doesnt look to good.- Some puzzles are overly complicated.- You can finish the game without getting all the signs.Overall this is a remarkable game and I do recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★☆			"

												This game is incredible. The puzzles are reminiscent of Metroid Prime, but with a surrealist view. Nothing you see in this game can be pre-conceived, and as such, no two puzzles have the exact same solution. Level design is brain-melting, disorienting, and highly soothing all at the same time, with signs that give excellent live advice placed intermittently. The visuals are bright, highly palateable, and full of contrast. Everything is cued properly, with nothing out of place anywhere. Signs are hand-drawn, and match the advice they show perfectly. My props to the art dev on this one.More subtley, I couldn't help but notice how much of an impact the sound design had on the game. There's not much there as far as audio, but every now and then, a sound effect would give me chills, just because of how well it set the mood. Again, this was done flawlessly.Overall, the game is incredible. Do not miss this one.			"

												Right next to Portal, this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Consistently and continually challenging, the puzzles stay diverse and multilayered right until the end. The smooth sound and visual style let you think and relax at the same time. Unlike many other games in the genre, this one gives you space and tools to play around with and lets you complete the puzzles at your own pace, and it's full of little secrets for those curious enough to find them. Highly recommended.			"

												This game is insane. It's so simply designed with very easy to understand concepts, yet it's so hard to figure out all those puzzles. I though I rush through it like nothing, since it doesn't look like much, but I got lost uncountable amounts of times. Many times I was hitting my head against the wall because some puzzles where so difficult. In the end I was sad though, because this game came to an end. But I have to say that the experience is incredible.This game is a must play for everyone who likes to think around corners.			"

												An awesomely confusing puzzle-action game that plays on the idea of room changing-3D space and lighting and using cubes to solve puzzles. Trust what you can see, but don't trust what you can't unless you've learnt the map - Areas you have once visited can't change, but the entrances and exits to them might take you to completely different areas instead.I don't want to say more, because I don't want to spoil it. It's brilliant.			"

												Fantastic game!I haven't played a game similiar to this one, and I love to explore wierd and colorful worlds.This unique game sucked me in and made me look for solutions for hours. 100% worth it. But be aware! I never heard of motion sickness before and I didn't read any comments before i purchased this item, but I was feeling sick after the first 20 minutes of gameplay. I had to sotp for 2 hours before i could return.I found out, that using speakers instead of a headset and Downsampling (NVIDIA: http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dsr/technology ) help a lot.Downsampling is great because it sharpens the blurry models used by this game.Enjoy!

												This game was simply amazing. Finished it a little under 9 hours... In one day! It's like reading a really compelling book. Near impossible to put down. I was a little frustrated at times because I would be naturally stuck... and after a long while do something accidentally, and  find out a power I didn't know I had. Traveling to past sections, searching for the next step was also time consuming. But even though it may seem like it, I am not complaining. I had a really great time figuring out the puzzles, and enjoying the beautiful colors and art (Wow. I'm such a girl) And the struggle is what made it worth while, because who wants a game that doesn't give them a little challenge? There are also a lot of secret areas in this game, which I always find fantastic. If you want an adventure... with life lessons, puzzles, colors, blocks, weird, weird art, and absolutely no explanation of what and why you're doing what you're doing, then this is the game for you. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale, and it was my favorite purchase so far. Right now it's $20, but I still beileve it is a great buy., with or without the sale.			"

												Well, well. This is something unusual, that's for sure.A lot of things are not as they seem. Entering a door might lead you back to where you were. Walls may not be walls and air might turn into floors. Right off the bat you are tricked completely. That's the fun bit about this game. There are some clues spread about, but you really have to be willing to think unconventionally if you're going to get anywhere. It really had me intrigued.Eventually you are given a gun of various types. These let you place and manipulate cubes. This is necessary to solve most of the puzzles. It makes a new twist on things, and for every new type of gun, you get a-ha moments and can solve puzzles you previously struggled with.There are a lot of puzzles to solve, however, eventually they actually become rather easy, and can be solved in different ways. It might just be that you get used to thinking differently, but the curiosity you had in the very beginning loses momentum as you get deeper in the game. Sometimes you'll just get stuck too, and that was a bit deterring. I had to cheat some times.There's very little information on what your purpose is. Don't get me wrong, there doesn't have to be a narrative, however, the game gives you a map, but it doesn't tell you how to read it. I learned how, just a short while before I managed to finish the game. Had I known sooner, perhaps I wouldn't have gotten stuck so often.There doesn't seem to be a soundtrack, sadly, and the sound volume is rather low. The visual style is really cool and different, if not a bit ""glitchy"" at times. The ending was surprising, but honestly a little disappointing.This isn't Portal. It's not quite like any other game out there. I can't say that about many games these days. It's refreshing. I guess it has some similarities with Stanley's Parable, except there's not a lot of humor. If you like puzzle games I can easily recommend it. It's not perfect, but it's original.			"

												I found myself often saying ""Oh my"" at the next bit of mind bending. Seeing that the rabbit hole goes still further when I thought there couldn't be any more. I am impressed at the scope and the style. Some things could have been slightly better signposted but figuring out some of the mechanics even exist as a possibility is a real treat when you pull it off for yourself. Hopefully you are quite good at navigating, as those skills will pay off almost as well as knowing for puzzles. If there is an easy puzzle and a hard puzzle, do the easy one first. Follow that path, and by the time you get back to that spot you will have likely revealed what you need to do for the harder bit. Sometimes it will take ability upgrades that enable more. Better to keep yourself moving as the game is not well suited to keeping a pace, often happy to let you bounce off walls.More than spoilers on the puzzles, more than any sort of plot hook, the real thing to manage to not spoil this game is your expectations. The puzzles aren't always ideal. There can definitely be parts where you know how to do it and just make a bad play of it and need to start the area again. Some bits are repetitive even without that. Navigating is more of a challenge than I might otherwise excuse. The mechanics are often obtuse needing you to just get lucky to discover. For me though, what may be frustration at other times has more often been pure triumphant joy. 5/5			"

												To review this game is like a puzzle in itself.Antichamber is a inspiring indie puzzle game that does not hold your hand and pits you little to none explanation in a strange maze with Escher-like architecture, in search for ways to truly escape it, an endeavor that requires the use of several ""color guns"" scattered across the map. These guns allow you to do some fantastic things with the games little cubes, and so the adventure lays itself upon you.The paths will elude you, your perspective on things will be challenged, and you bet the puzzles of this game are as hard as they come. The problem is that the game ""cheats"" you to boost that said difficulty, by purposedly keeping you ignorant of the game's mechanics and its own ""laws of physics"".Truth to be told I could only go so far without help after grabbing the Green Gun, because there is a trick that you must learn to procede (to the Yellow Gun) that is almost impossible to figre out on your own. Seriously. In that point I felt compelled to search for outside help, which broke the experience for me; to add insult to injury, I faced a few others ""obligatory"" puzzles (the game has a very open world structure, in that you can finish it but not see all it's content) with a solution that broke down to the use of a ""hat trick"" that was never, ever teached by the game - I can only assume some people discovered it by accident and the word spreaded.The lack of a more elaborate story is also a negative point, because the developers made such an intriguing maze that the absence of a proper story is felt like a missed opportunity.Overrall, Antichamber is a beautiful, ingenious game, that deserves to be played simply because it is really mentally challenging. It is nowhere near a good experience as Portal, for example, but it was worth the ride.			"

												So i picked this game up in the steam summer sale, my friend reccomended it to me and i'd seen about 3 minutes of gameplay from a youtuber i watch. My expectations for the game were quite low to start off with. I thought either the game would be really easy or the puzzles would be too hard because of illogical and random solutions that make now sense. However after playing the game for about 2 hours online and 5-6 offline, It is easily the best puzzle game i have ever played. Some parts were unbelievably challenging and none of the solutions were thrown in just to add an extra 20 mins of gameplay. The game allows you to slowly evolve through the gameplay mechanics in a subtle way and there are multiple ways to progress depending on how early you figure out different things.   If you're into deep puzzle games and don't mind back tracking through the game a few times... definitely pick this game up. :)My only one problem with this game is now that ive given it almost 10 hours, i've completed it ... i have discovered all the easter eggs (i think) and i don't see any viable DLC for this game, so there isn't much replayability. Still i highly reccomend it.			"

												This is likely the best puzzle game I've ever played, perfectly toeing the line between being esoteric and intuitive. Each new puzzle feels utterly impossible, until something clicks, and then it's suddenly laughably easy. No other game I've played managed to capture such a contrast without feeling contrived or frusterating, but this one has. With its ""story"" conveyed by little tiles on the wall, and its interface never once showing you a menu in a conventional sense, this game managed to be immersive in the face of a massively surreal environment, leading me to feel as though I was actually in this odd place. Given the nature of the setting, this was utterly shocking. This game is not so much a game as a work of art in the interactive medium.tl;drI cannot recommend this game enough.			"

Throughout the way the game continues to challenge you with new ways of thinking and re-use the older tactics that it has already taught you.While the game is relatively short, it feels complete and worth it.If you want continual and constant progression, or even hints, this isn't a great game for you.

												I felt smart playing Antichamber - well, some of the time.  The rest of the time I felt extremely stupid.  Antichamber is a game that can do that to you.  The concept is simple: you are traveling a maze of rooms, attempting to reach an Exit.  However the way through each room is never clear.  Some rooms have invisible bridges; others have breakaway floors.  And many have physically impossible architectures, the traversal of which may require something as simple as walking instead of running, or as subtle as refusing the presented paths in favor of something far less obvious.The game does provide hints in the form of illustrated signs with varying levels of helpfulness.  ""Moving through a problem slower may help find the solution"" was illuminating.  ""Live on your own watch, and not someone else's"" made me want to punch the wall.  For me, the majority of the signs were like the latter, and not the former.And yet, I can't deny that solving the challenges sparked a strange species of delight in my brain.  Transitioning from utter frustration to an almost primal delight is an effect that few games have had on me, and one that I would not have expected to find in a game that is all about mental taxation.I haven't finished Antichamber, and I suspect I never will (playing a game like this with a FAQ feels like missing the point).  But that doesn't mean that the game didn't have an effect on me.  On the balance though, I'm just not sure it was an enjoyable one.---- Labyrinth: A Failure -------------Once upon a time, I tried to write a story called ""The Minotaur in the Labyrinth"", a re-telling of the famed Greek myth. The twist? In my version the Minotaur is not some ravening beast; instead he possesses both reason and civility, and he is fully aware that he is a martyr of the gods' childish whims.But rather than despair or rage or fall into self-pity, the Minotaur discovers hope in his situation. Trapped in a Labyrinth constructed so well that not even the gods can penetrate its mysteries, he recognizes that he has been presented with a rare opportunity.And so when victims are thrown into the Labyrinth he does not devour them. He shares with them a vision of a life free of the gods' capricious influences; for within the Labyrinth, the gods have no sight. All that needs to be done is to labor from the inside, work to expand the Labyrinth until it grows to cover the island of Crete. And maybe, the Minotaur thinks, maybe there is a way to have it enclose the oceans, and from there the whole of Greece, and then the world itself. A global paradise.I liked the idea - still do! - and made serious efforts to create a narrative out of it. My first attempt was told from the perspective of Theseus and the story was told straight, an adventure tale with a lyrical tilt and a mystical epiphany at the end.It did not read well. It was overlong and somewhat toneless. I tried to introduce some overt humor by turning Theseus into a musclebound cretin, but quickly discarded that idea as cruel. Then I tried extending the narrative distance, giving the story a more legendary feel. That didn't work either.I had the Minotaur speak in a modern voice in opposition to the Greeks' archaic speech. I turned the story into a tragedy by having Theseus slay the Minotaur. I tried many different things, all of them failures, and one night while lying awake in the dark reflecting on other possible choices, I came to the sudden realization that I had, in effect, trapped myself in my own Labyrinth. I was traversing a hundred different paths looking for the center of my story. And I feared that I was nowhere close.So I let go. Not every maze can be solved, and sometimes it's better to just to move on to other things.  Maybe my subconscious will solve the story someday; that has happened in the past. Or maybe it will forever remain half-formed in my mind, a never-realized dream. There is no great tragedy in that either.I will say this. In every attempt I made, there was one phrase I kept: rays of sunlight lilted their way through the verdant canopy.  Not the most earthshaking use of the English language, but even so.  I loved the use of the word lilt, how it turned golden light into song.The phrase will stay in my head, I think. And perhaps that's center enough for me.			"

												A fantastic puzzle game that basically takes the concept of reality-manipulation from Portal, and instead of filing all the rough edges off like that does, sharpens them to a razor point. It's the Dark Souls of puzzles. Every single thing you pull off in this game will make you feel amazing, and it's good enough about hints and tips around the world that only once did I need to ever look up an answer.Learn how your map works - that's the best advice I can give you without spoiling the game.

												Before anything else, buy this game. No matter the price, if you haven't played this game you must play this game. Quick *spoilerish* review here, expanded *nonspoiler* review below. It is a simplistically drawn puzzle game that makes You the biggest obstacle. Rooms often disappear and floors sometimes appear where there were none. Everything you come across will twist your brain. You walk around trying to solve puzzles in order to move on, but there is no set order you have to go in; two people will likely progress in two completely different ways. You start the game without instruction and have to figure things out as you go, almost entirely by experimentation. There are some areas that require extra equipment that you find later on, and hitting those roadblocks early is sometimes quite frustrating but they will make sense once you come back to them later. There is a central mechanic that allows you to revisit any area you've been to before, which is nice if you want to put certain puzzles on hold and try them again later. Sometimes the game makes you feel so frustrated you want to give up, and other times it is addictive to the point where you won't let yourself stop. There are also cute little placards that give quips summarizing whatever task you've just completed, which in their entirety tell a story all their own. In this game there is a lot of trying, a LOT of failing (even though there is no real way to fail the game--you can always go somewhere else), and the biggest sense of accomplishment you might ever feel in any video game. Walk around, solve brain-scrambling puzzles, get frustrated, try again, ????, profit.9.8 / 10, absolutely must must Must buy.And now, a slightly more eloquent, *spoiler-free* review:The user reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive for a reason. Rather, for lots of reasons. This game is unlike anything I'd tried before. It is a puzzle game in the sense that the game itself is a puzzle: you have to figure out how the game works as you go along. And the rules keep changing. The in-game puzzles themselves are often difficult but it's mostly due to the limitations you've set up within your own mind. You have to unlearn a lot of what other games have established as how FPS-style games are ""supposed"" to work. In certain ways, it might be easier for many non-gamers because, as my mother (who had never played a videogame before, and whom I forced to play this, yes) explained after handily solving several of the puzzles, ""I didn't know you couldn't do that.""You can't take anything as granted. This game takes well-established tropes and warps some and downright breaks the rest. To fully succeed, you have to unlearn a lot of normal video game mechanics.. often things as simple as if-I-walk-out-of-a-room-and-turn-around-I-expect-it-to-still-be-the-same-room-I-walked-out-of. Yeah. Nope. This game makes you twist your mind inside out in order to solve some of the puzzles. Often the game was hard simply because my brain couldn't think sideways enough for it. It messes with your mind so much MC Escher would get dizzy. Please know that I relish a good mind messing, and Antichamber takes the cake.A nice part of the game is that there is never a time when you ""fail"" a puzzle. There is no ""You Lose"" scenario. Everything you do, even if it isn't what you intended on doing, will lead you somewhere. The puzzles have definite solutions, but you can't do anything ""wrong"" in the game. Not in the sense that you lose and have to start over. It all builds on itself. The game also does a very good job of subtly teaching you skills you can use later for more complex puzzles. Even though it is a brain-melting puzzle game, in a sense you are eased into things. There is never an unsolvable puzzle, you just might not have learned what to do yet. However, this game requires you to think so far outside the box that you end up thinking outside the other box that the first box was sitting in. It isn't just a sitdown, jigsaw puzzle, you-know-what-to-do-but-you-just-have-to-figure-out-how-to-do-it type puzzle game, it is also a learning-new-things-as-you-go type puzzle game. I loved (almost.. grr) every second of it.Except maybe for Portal --and it's a close race-- there is no game I would more fervently recommend than Antichamber. That blue thumbs up isn't big enough for how strongly I recommend it.If nothing else, the title is a pun.			"

Antichamber? What about it?Is it a good game?Well, we can get to that in a minute, but don't you want to ask me some more specific questions first?Um, okay. How about you start out by telling us what it is.Well, the title lies. It's not Antichamber. It's (lots of)Antichamber(s). Lots and lots of antichambers. It's a game set in a highly linear, and highly surreal maze. In order to proceed through the area, you must solve physical puzzles. Sometimes based on resource management, sometimes based on clue decifering, and sometimes just based on trial and error, the puzzes often prove to be challenging. Ususally when I finish playing Antichamber my brain is sore. Okay. So now that we know what it is, how would you rate the gameplay?The best word to describe it is unique.There are plenty of other first person physical puzzle games, such as Portal or the Talos Principle, but this one stands as a completely different game.The world is very surreal. There are parts where you fall through the floor when you look down. Where a room changes depending on where you're looking from. Where a hallway changes if you walk backwards rather than forwards.And I love the unpredictability of it. There's no experience like it.Why don't you describe the visuals to us.Sure.To match the surreality of the environment, the graphics are simple, yet abstract. They fall into the same category as the gameplay: unique.Colors are bold, and the visual contrast between different materials in the game make it easier for one to distinguish key items that are vital in the solving of puzzIes. They're also high resolution. *oooooooo, high resolutionnnn*Do you find yourself wanting to come back and re-do the puzzles?I think you're asking about replay value. If so, I wouldn't say it has a lot of it.Granted, though, Antichamber is a puzzle game, and as the puzzles can only be solved in one way, there really isn't any point of returning to replay the game. Unless you just freaking love it. However, it must be remembered that few puzzle games do have very much replay value, due to their linearity.What about the cost? Is it worth the $20?I don't want to say this, but I need to. It really isn't worth $20.I actually got it for less than half price, as I traded for it. I would say it's worth at least it's sale price ($5), but not the full price. But that's just my opinion. Alright alright alright. Looks like we're just about done. What are your overall thoughts?I would say that overall Antichamber is a great game.It's creative, innovative, unique, and it's exactly what the puzzle genre needed.It's worth your time. See if you can get it on sale.For puzzle fans, this is a must have. No, an essential... ugh  JUST BUY IT OKAY .Have fun.~ caleb4est			"

												This is like a version of Portal that doesn't hold your hand through the puzzles; it's genuinely difficult.

												What a great game. And I genuinely mean that. This game made me think, it made me want to progress and was genuinely challenging at times. My only possible complaint is that, as you progress, some of the earlier puzzles get easier because the tools you obtain allow you to position blocks and use them in ways not previously possble. Which in it's self, allows for new ways to approch a situation. The art style is minimalistic and it suits the game. I highly reccomend this game to people who like puzzle games.			"

												Antichamber is a game in which I would describe a 'simulation' game. There are many types of simluation games, and this one does very well at simulating the process of being on drugs.For the most part, Antichamber is a very simple game. You walk into walls to get guns so you can turn the black box man into an optical illusion. You can also click on pictures of bears and children that give hints along the way.If you want a challenge of a game, this is the game for you as it tests your ability to stay sane while it spits weed out of your computer that you unintentionally smoke during the game. This likely explains why I feel different after playing an hour or two of this game.All of the puzzles in this game are actually much more logical than they may seem, though you only find this out after you FINISH the puzzle and click on the hint duck pictures. Assuming you are NOT on drugs and can in fact read, I recommend you read the hints and take them into consideration. The signs never lie, just like people on the internet.If I had to rate this game, I would probably give it a 400.20/420. There wasn't really a story at all, I guess is why that is. Otherwise I'd give it a full blazed 420/420. The art style is so simple yet fantastic, the puzzles are much more difficult than I was prepared for, and there were so many moments that I went ""OH that was SO satisying to finish!"" though I may have been saying that about the weed that kept coming out of my computer. I HIGHly recommend this game.			"

												Antichamber feels like what I imagine Portal would have been if M.C. Escher designed it. The similarities to Portal are obvious: Antichamber is a first-person puzzle-platform game in which a key tool to solving the levels is a kind of gun for manipulating the world. But those similarities are big structural elements, as far as the actual experience of gameplay and the nature of the puzzles Antichamber is unique, and well worth attention in its own right.Antichamber is very abstract; it essentially omits characters and plot altogether. As a player, you are not even told who you are. Instead, you simply find yourself in a world of stark geometric forms from which you are seeking an escape. The system of interconnected rooms and corridors you find yourself in is essentially one big level, without any marked division into stages. But as you discover solution to various puzzles, and gain new tools, more and more areas will become accessible to you. To help with disorientation you may return at any time to a kind of antechamber which provides a map of your progress and also doubles as the game’s only menu.All this sounds rather stark, but the real delight of antechamber is its hard-edged surreality. This is where Escher comes into it. Instead of trying, like most 3D games, to give you the impression that you are in a real, physical space, Antichamber revels in the fact that you aren’t. Instead you are in a world where the geometrically impossible is actual: staircases deposit your back where you started, hallways connect to different places depending on how you use them, doors change where they open to when you turn your back. Relatedly, the game eschews realistic-looking textures for vivid monochrome, including a lot of white. The puzzles also defy expectations. If you’ve played a lot of puzzle games you’ll notice this right away. Unlike many games which tell you what sort of solution you’re looking for and give you a series of puzzles on a common theme, Antichamber leaves you to figure it out for yourself—to wander around and play with the world until you have insight. Some puzzles are of a type players of puzzle platformers will more or less recognize, but others require an entirely different approach, more like lateral thinking. This makes each breakthrough feel like a flash of brilliance. Enigmatic little clues are found on the walls at intervals, some to help you have the needed insight, others just to provide general good advice.All this to say, Antichamber is a great game for the puzzle aficionado, provided she is somewhat patient. Solving this game was really engaging and satisfying. Even after accomplishing your main objective various rooms will, likely, still have something hidden in them. But, also, Antichamber gives you the fun of simply exploring. The place you find yourself is not conventionally beautiful, but it is fascinating, and much has been included simply to fascinate. Among other things, there are several hidden rooms in antechamber which preserve artifacts from its development, and others where it seems the level designers are simply showing off what they can do with the faux physics of their world. Antichamber provides you with a digital artifact worth simply looking at.There are a few downsides to this. That you are not restricted to working on a single, clearly delineated problem is both a blessing and a curse. Being dropped into this labyrinth without much direction, unsure where to even start looking for solutions, can seem daunting. There were points in my first play through where I had to just put the game down to come back to later, and others where I spent a lot of time on challenges that turned out not to really advance me (for instance because I’d been trying to access a point which was meant to be easily reachable much later in the game). Also, this would be a poor choice for somebody not already familiar with this sort of videogame. This is a puzzle game for gamers.But, overall, I’d rate this as one of the very best puzzle platformers I’ve played, in a category with things like Braid and Portal. It is well worth a look.			"

												Antichamber is similar to Portal as it involves going from room to room solving puzzles. However, this game makes Portal look like child's play. The cleverly constructed obstacles can leave your brain rattled. This game is not for everyone as it requires outside of the box thinking, and can leave the player frustrated. Overall, it's a great buy for anyone that wants to try something different and insightful or is just looking for a mental challenge.From r/gaming 6 months after I wrote this: http://www.livememe.com/9mjb40x "

												This game starring Master Chief from Metal Gear has you running around a russian missle base trying to find the bad guys to shoot, but you never even get to shoot anyone. This game has some major issues like, how do i get people to shoot, and how to get a real gun not some stupid block placer thing. The problem is that this game just isn't as good as it's predecessor, namely Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. In that game i could shoot all the bad guys i want, but in this one I am supposed to think with my brain to do a riddle? I really think Square Enix missed the mark on this one, it doesn't even have fan favorite character Blanka, who everyone loved when he first appeared in Final Fantasy 7 eating mud in the Lindblum dump.

												This game is impossible... to not enjoy!I dont understand how someone could come up with something as mindboggling as this. All throughout you are constantly being bombarded with brain-buckling problems. When you think you finally have the hang of it, the game changes. The game is not meant to be understood and wont be, it will always be one step ahead of you.The amount of self reward granted from the game is immense, that feeling of, ""I just did that"" ""I figured it out.""Yes, that must sound lame but play the game and you will understand how much it wreaks your brain.JUST DONT GIVE UP I know there are many people who have this game and they get bored of it because it is ""too hard"" it is not hard it just requires you to think, think into, away and outside the box. You can't tunnel vision. This isn't your typical puzzle game, if it were on ranking; Portal 2 would rate 4, and Antichamber would rate a 10.And please dont look up walkthrough, you are damaging your enjoyment, practically letting someone else play the game for you and so you wont get the self congratulation.For a game based on mixing your brain around by showing the impossible, sometimes attempting to do the impossible (creating a box which then fills itself in) is impossible and causes the game to crash. Just dont fill in all the walls of a roomAlso just wait until it is on sale and pick it up, although I have heaped all this praise onto Antichamber it isnt worth $20 (bought mine when it was 90% off not realise what a treasure it was) but get it and dont let it gather dust.

												I mean this in the best way possible: this game is just frustrating enough to not want to give up entirely at quite a few points.I wound up 100%ing it oer the course of three days, and the way it is presented and developes the player is well thought out and well executed.I don't want to comment on the difficulty or learning curve outside of ""it's doable"". If you keep going at it there is nothing you can't figure out, and the game makes it very easy to step away from a particular puzzle and come back to it. There is nothing in the game that can't be figured out with a little ingenuity or trial and error. The art and animation are flawless and very pleasant to look at, and the little posters with phrases on them are a nice touch, even if the hints are a little late to be helpful at times(on purpose, I'm sure). Some of the puzzles are pretty clever and some involve a bit of synthesis. Overall a really enjoyable experience. Well worth the purchase even at full price, 9/10.			"

												I'd been looking for a decent puzzle game for a while when I picked this one up but none of them were really interesting me. This one breaks the mold, though. Actually, this one breaks pretty much every mold. What starts out as feeling like a series of completely random adjustments to real world physics actually starts to make some kind of weird sense. There definitely were some frustrating areas that took me a long time to get through, but it really isn't as random as it first appears. You'll need to be willing to try the stupidest of your ideas (the good ones probably won't work) and get ready for some serious thinking outside of the box. If you're into that, the game is well worth the time it takes to adjust. It isn't very long, though; I'd watch for it on sale if you're thinking of picking it up.			"

												This game is the most amazing thing I have seen in my life when it comes to illusions. A fantastic M.C Ecsher style game. When you turn a corner you see lights, suddenly, you turn around, interpretting what your brain is not telling you to do as the right path, and winning, at that stage it rewards you with a life lesson for you. This brain both stimulates your brain, and gives you an amazingly big eadache. For anyone who would like to change their mindset completely backwards, this is the new hypnotism. If you easily get frustrated, don't play this, it stretches minutes into hours. Good luck finding the end of the maze... if there is one.			"

This is a game you explore, both in exploring the physical world and in exploring the mechanics of how the world works.

												Antichamber is a refreshingly fun exploration based puzzle game involving simple mechanics applied to not so simple problems. A majority of the game will be spent using various tools to fiddle with varied and intricate locks made of tiny cubes, more often than not discovering the solutions organically rather than through hints or walkthroughs. The game world is a minimalistic 3D environment that plays with the concept of non-euclidean space ranging from hallways that infinitely loop back on themselves to doors that change destination depending on your perspective.The game is quite imaginative at times, avoiding the pitfalls of a lot of similar puzzle games by not having a lot of arbitrary timed puzzles or gating progress by requiring the solving of one particular puzzle. Antichamber takes a non-linear approach to exploration and this means you often have three or more re-visitable branches to explore at any one time.Don't expect a story though, Antichamber leaves the narrative up to the player, hinting at a deeper meaning through symbolism. The game world is dotted with surprisingly relevant inspirational quotes accompanied by clever little pictures. Collecting all of these soon becomes your measure of completion, even after reaching the pretty spectacular ending level.Admittedly, there are a few puzzles requiring a silly amount of planning but these are few and far between. Most of the time, you can come back to these puzzles at a later time with more knowledge and tools and solve them more easily. That is how non-linear gameplay is supposed to be done; take notes game developers! In addition to some easter-egg rooms, there are even a few bizarrely unfinished areas, hinting that the creator may have had further areas in mind, although there sems to be no real plans to expand the game. Finding these areas is no easy task, and some of the hardest puzzles in the game reside in these places. It's a little sad they didn't get used, even just as an easter egg or something, because they were quite enjoyable and challenging.When it comes down to it, whether or not you will like Antichamber depends on if you are the kind of person who doesn't mind a puzzle game where you are invited to take your time exploring every corner. At worst, Antichamber can be a bit of a confusing labyrinth, but at best it is a forgiving puzzle game with outside-the-box visuals and a great sense of variety.			"

												Very original puzzle game. It loves to mess with your perception above all else, things change and defy logic most of the time.A really cool thing about this game is that every single puzzle translates into some kind of a life lesson or simply motivational quotes. Sometimes the solution will not be hard but will require you do take a different approach, to think outside of the box. Then, the game will re-assess what you did with a little motivational poster that gets put on the wall of the main hub.The game feels very mysterious and you're not given a lot of explanation. This is not a game that you play to finish. It's a game that you play to sit back, relax and think. There is actually a conclusion to the game (that I absolutely loved) although it only really ends once you run out of rooms to explore.The game makes impressive use of the Unreal Engine and the environment constantly reacts in ways that you would not expect. It is filled with impossible rooms and patterns and requires a ton of open-minded thinking. Honestly, it can get a bit overwhelming at times. Sometimes you feel clever for solving the puzzles and sometimes you're just completely lost in how not rational things are, although there is always a very methodic way to solve them.It's also really hard to pick this game back up after not playing for a while. You unlock new mechanics as you progress through the game and not remembering one of them can make solving some puzzles very difficult. Since it's not very long, I would suggest starting over if you haven't played in a while.As a side note, I was slighlty more disappointed with the game's technical side. Options are embedded inside the game, there are no menus, which is very cool on its own... But because of this, I could not set the resolution past 1920x1200, there was no anti-aliasing (and the aliasing is fairly bad in this game) or any other graphical options. I don't think there are any keybind options either (I believe this can be done through the Ini files). I would definitely have liked a bit more of these options.I did not go through all the rooms myself and the game lasted me about 4h30 (played a bit offline so maybe add a few hours to that) for about 75-80% completion. I would expect around 3-4 hours more for 100%. It does feel much, much longer than this however, which is not a bad thing. It's a bit expensive at 22$ for that playtime but honestly, I think it's worth it if this is your kind of game.			"

												This game is impossible... to not enjoy!I dont understand how someone could come up with something as mindboggling as this. All throughout you are constantly being bombarded with brain-buckling problems. When you think you finally have the hang of it, the game changes. The game is not meant to be understood and wont be, it will always be one step ahead of you.The amount of self reward granted from the game is immense, that feeling of, ""I just did that"" ""I figured it out.""Yes, that must sound lame but play the game and you will understand how much it wreaks your brain.JUST DONT GIVE UP I know there are many people who have this game and they get bored of it because it is ""too hard"" it is not hard it just requires you to think, think into, away and outside the box. You can't tunnel vision. This isn't your typical puzzle game, if it were on ranking; Portal 2 would rate 4, and Antichamber would rate a 10.And please dont look up walkthrough, you are damaging your enjoyment, practically letting someone else play the game for you and so you wont get the self congratulation.For a game based on mixing your brain around by showing the impossible, sometimes attempting to do the impossible (creating a box which then fills itself in) is impossible and causes the game to crash. Just dont fill in all the walls of a roomAlso just wait until it is on sale and pick it up, although I have heaped all this praise onto Antichamber it isnt worth $20 (bought mine when it was 90% off not realise what a treasure it was) but get it and dont let it gather dust.

												Want to get mind effed in a hurry? Antichamber is one of those games you hear about from time to time, but never really bothered to really check out. When you do, you cannot shut up about it, believe me, I know. What starts out as a simple first person exploration of this seemingly monochromatic puzzle world quickly turns into an unbelievable concept game defying the normal laws of physics and reality. The further into the games non-linear progression, the more unusual the puzzles become, requiring some un-orthodox ways of thinking. Things really start to get interesting as new ""guns"" are unlocked, allowing the user to manipulate matter in different ways, upping the puzzle solving possibilities, all while maintaining the stark no-nonsense interface. And get used to redoing puzzles, because one false-step can send you back to the beginning to have to progress through multiple puzzles multiple times.Good luck!			"

												Antichamber is definitely one of the most intriguing puzzle games I have played. It takes all you believe to know about how puzzle games work, and turns it upside-down. There will be a lot of moments when you are so confused that you will need to take a break from the game, just to suddenly notice the solution to a puzzle come up in your mind without you even thinking about it.The game is logical, yet messes with your logic in a way that will leave you in awe, slowly realizing the scale of the entire thing.As you progress, you will unlock more and more powerful tools, allowing you to solve more complex puzzles, but also backtrack and find alternate paths and solutions to previous puzzles. But only a portion of these tools will be actual in-game upgrades, while the rest is simply knowledge you gain while solving the puzzles. Seriously, this game can be beaten in about 20 minutes, but it took me more than 10 hours, and might take you even longer, because I had some puzzles spoiled for me.Oh, and regarding spoilers: Don't watch any videos, except for the trailer on the Steam store page. Every bit of every video might possibly spoil something so important it can cut your game time in half and leave you wishing you never found out about it.To decide if you want the game, ask yourself the following:Does the trailer look interesting, even if it's just a tiny bit?Are you fine with the game's visual style? (personally, I love it, it's simplistic and effective, but some people seem to be feeling nauseous after playing the game for a bit, so you might want to watch out for that... again, the trailer should be enough to figure that out)Are you interested in puzzle games?If you answered yes to those questions, definitely get the game.

												If somebody would doubt that videogames are art, I would show him this game.To me, Antichamber was a whole new gaming experience; It forces you to really immerse yourself in the game. In order to solve the hard and challenging puzzles you really have to ""absorb your surroundings"" and pay attention to details.However, this game might not be suited for everyone. It is not a action game and very slow-paced. It also has no replay value once you solved every puzzle.I would definitively recommend this game to anyone who is willing to take his time for a new experience and is not be daunted by hard puzzles.

												This game is amazing!It's an fps puzzle game, and although it's really nothing like the Portal series, that's all I can really compare it to in terms of a genre of game.  I wasn't going to buy this only based on the graphics alone (I really dislike the unreal engine), but then I noticed a handful of my steam friends were playing it, and most of them straight up said it was an amazing game, so I bought it for myself to see what it was all about.  I still don't like the graphics, but the ambiance and the difficulty of the puzzles made this game absolutely astounding.  Don't expect some intricate story either, because this game is carried by its puzzles alone!If you have ever done brain teasers where you have to think outside of the box to solve anything, then this is basically those types of puzzles all wrapped up in an fps styled game.  The gameplay is pretty long for a puzzle game (it takes people on average ~6 hours to beat if they're rushing to find the end, although it took me around 8 hours after being stumped a ton of times), and there's still more to do if you're a completionist like me.If you want to have your mind♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by puzzles, and feel like a genius whenever you solve another room, you'll really enjoy picking this game up!

Actually, this one breaks pretty much every mold. What starts out as feeling like a series of completely random adjustments to real world physics actually starts to make some kind of weird sense. There definitely were some frustrating areas that took me a long time to get through, but it really isn't as random as it first appears. You'll need to be willing to try the stupidest of your ideas (the good ones probably won't work) and get ready for some serious thinking outside of the box. If you're into that, the game is well worth the time it takes to adjust. It isn't very long, though; I'd watch for it on sale if you're thinking of picking it up.			"

												This First-Person exploration game encapsulates life lessons. It is about the journey, not the ending. Just like life, you will make mistakes, but you can never take them back, you can only make the best of the situations and move along.			"

												Thoroughly addictive, puzzle-maze game that messes with you head. The player is introduced to game quite well, the mechanics of the Block-guns are easy to understand and pick-up and the atmosphere from the music is very good. Did not really know what to expect coming into this game, but have seen a similar version made in minecraft on youtube - I have to say I was definitely impressedFor such a simple game, it requires a lot of thinking, memory and is very enjoyable, with enough puzzles to keep you entertained - or frustrated - for a good amount of time.I would definitely recommend this game.

												tl;dr: Instabuy this gameAntichamber is a big mindfrak, well sort of. It makes you do it to yourself.And every time you get the feeling you're near the end of it, it stops you and shows you a better way to do it. And makes you want to have your mind frakked all over, and bit more.And the best part is, you know it's comming.But it'll still hit you in the face when it does.Antichamber is a fantastic first person puzzle game. The best i played since portal (if you thought portal II was better because it had lots of story you should also instabuy The Stanley Parable) To be honest i haven't played many in the mean time, but if i have to compare the two, portal is just a game that makes you think in portals and jump through hoops (yes, phun intended). Antichamber is all about cubes, but makes you think in points, lines, cubes and tesseracts and makes you think ouside the box, and in the box and next to the box and about the box. And it will take away your box and show you how to make a new one.On first glance the game might look a bit raw and unfinished, but in fact it's very, very complete. It will tempt you into thinking there might be some weak spots which can be exploited, and you will try.You will try, when you inevitably get stuck somewhere on something which, you have yet to realize, is a puzzle.I dare you, try...And you will get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, on a plate, by yourself.The level design, the gameplay, the ambiance, the challenges are just perfect and combine into a puzzle game which sets a new standard.

												Mindboggling, braintwisting, logicmelting.This is a first person puzzle maze ish thingy. You start somewhat in the middle and gotta get out. The only problem, the maze isnt respecting the rules of physics or any logic.You see a hallway? Look away. Look back at it, its another hallway. Sucks to be you.Or in other words: Its amazing. The game challenges what you are used from every other game and makes you apply entierly new rules to your problem solving methods.After some time (takes 2 minutes for some, 30 minutes for others) you will find your fist ""gun"". As there are no enemies and no death, this is used to pick up and place small blocks.Over the course of the game you can find better versions of it multiple times, allowing to reach further into the antichamber and solve more puzzles and maybe even find a way out. Each upgrade comes with new ways you can solve puzzles with, keeping the game interesting on a different level.Portal wished to be as good as Antichamber.The game is on sale frequently, so if you doubt you might like it, wait a bit.But believe me when i tell you, this game is exceptional and unique. You should own it.'nuff said.			"

This game makes you make mistakes so you can learn and go forward, puzzles are a binary; right and wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I hope more people play it.			"

												To be honest, I feel the word 'game' berates antichamber. It's art in it's most purest form. It's about learning to think in non-linear paths, about approaching situations in different ways and memorizing and advancing in ways you're not used to. In more ways than one, this game is absolute madness, playing tricks with positioning that no sane mind would be able to memorize.However, in that process, it does offer a whole array of puzzles that make you feel good once you figure them out (okay...most of 'em. There are one or two really frustrating amongst them). The pictures and text feel better than all superfluous ""achievement unlocked""'s combined.The aesthetics may take some getting used to. It's all white, white and more white, but it grows on you. Coupled with the soft music, it really puts your mind at ease.At first, I thought the whole game would be about brain puzzles. And while that was true, the block gun (and variants) do a good job of spicing things up without sacrificing neither the puzzle element nor the atmosphere.I normally take the time to point out some the game's flaws, but in this case it would be a shame. Yes, some puzzles are frustrating, but is it because they ARE frustrating or because it requires the sort of thinking I personally am not accustomed to? It's probably the latter. And I really can't bring myself to criticizing the confusing structure of the whole, as it's that very structure that I come to adore. I mean...how many other games do you know where there's a 7-floor tower, complete with a sort-of-elevator shaft in the middle...where those seven floors are rooms that are located directly next to each other?I just finished it for the second time (first time being a few years ago). As expected, I had sort of forgotten the harder puzzles, making it all the more challenging. And I'll probably replay it again in a few years from now. For puzzle games, that's a pretty unique feat. Take it for what it's worth. If there was a contest for best puzzle game ever, I'd not only nominate this, but criticise everyone who doesn't at least considers it.In summary: best puzzle game ever. And I don't throw these nominations around lightly. ABSOLUTELY recommended.			"

It is a very fun, fairly challenging maze that punches your spatial reasoning in the gut for fun.  The graphics are simple but they work for this game.  If you like to solve puzzles and love to think as you play through a game, this is for you.  If you become easily frustrated and hate things that just do not make sense, please avoid this game.  You will end up smashing your computer.  But if you are the type who's dad had them playing chess at 2 years old, you should have already bought the game.  Just do it.			"

												Gaming has become a realm where expectations rule, and Antichamber has a way of upsetting all of them. From the non-confrontational gameplay to the soothing vibe to the utter existential horror of trying to piece together an overarching meaning all the while thinking your way through the mind-bending puzzles, at every turn Antichamber delivers everything you didn't know you wanted to see. Utilizes the game world to deliver impossible geometries and tricks of the eye that open your mind to solving problems in new ways. Not kidding. It actually does that stuff.BUY THIS GAME!			"

												The most intriguing aspect of Antichamber is that the game teaches you how to play it, rather than telling you. The game is essentially all about learning its rules as they develop and interact with different objects and situations. I've had more play out of it than I expected and it's proved to be one of those games that hovers around in the back of your brain even when you're not playing, with solutions to puzzles coming like bolts from the blue.

												This game is absolutely amazing in so manhy aspects that it's hard to believe. • Interface is magnificent, It's the first time I see  when all interface elements (except for the crosshair) are actual game objects.• Story telling is incredibly different from what I've seenin other games. There is no actual story nor narration, only pictures and proverbs suitable for every puzzle solved, yet somehow there is a feeling that you are being guided and all puzzles are leading you to a very certain goal• Graphics are as basic as you can get, everything is made of cubes, amount of polygons is minimal, and there are little to no textures, yet somehow everything is gorgeous and pleasant to look at• Puzzles are inventive, innovative and unique, but all of them has logical solution. It's far from impossible, yet you WILL have to change the way you think more that several times throughout the game. Last (and only) time I was so impressed with game puzzles is when I played Braid.• Game mechanics is just like everything else in this game - simple and awesome. Whole experience reminds of a lot Portal, but not as linear, you actually have several paths to choose from and there are lots of puzzles you can find if you explore the map.What I love the most about mechanics is that you are free to experiment with the game physics and features. Personally I'm not sure if I solved some of the puzzles correct way, it sometimes feel as if I found a workaround that wasn't intended by developers. Which is an awesome feeling for me.So hell yeah, I recommend this game. It's a MUST for every puzzle lover. "

												This is a great and challenging puzzle game which sees you try to escape from a maze of connected puzzle rooms that all feel like they were designed by MC Escher. You'll need to mess with perspective and experiment with the tools that you have in order to figure out how to conquer each room. If you're playing it for the first time and you're stuck then make sure you go back and try another route instead of just hammering away at the one you're stuck on. It's entirely possible that you need a tool you haven't acquired yet and there's no penalty for leaving and coming back later.			"

												This is one of the best designed puzzle games I've ever played. It does a great job of easing you into the puzzle mechanics slowly, giving you plenty of time to master each new mechanic and build up some confidence before introducing the next mechanic. The Escher-like level design contributes heartily to a constant feeling of surprise and delight as you traverse the various rooms, solving puzzles and earning upgrades. Yes, this game will mess with your mind, but it will do so in the gentlest, most enjoyable way possible. Get this game.			"

												You probably heard of this little gem, if not, here's a brief summary:It's a first person puzzle game... no, not like Portal... this is one of those games that encourages you to break traditional thinking with what you already know/use when playing these kinds of things and think outside of the box (quite literally at times). Depending on how well you can adapt to and do this, this game should eat up about 4-5 hours of your time if you are above average at recognizing and adapting to the concepts and ideas each room will present you with. At its regular price, this unique little game is very much worth your money, if you catch it on a sale, it is a real steal.			"

												There aren't many puzzle games with a reputation of being awesome. I think this game deserves to be included.Antichamber is a puzzle game like no other, because you can't solve it like you would do others. The main interest is that you need to redefine your logic, your way of thinking, in order to find your way through this maze.Note that you don't need to solve all puzzles in order to get to the end, but with those you might access to hidden rooms describing the game itself. The number of puzzles and the toughness of some will keep you hours.

There will be alot of backtracking, but figuring out your way through the various puzzles and mind bending paths is satisfying. Not to mention the variety of Signs dotted around the game that could open your mind into ways you can get around in life, it made me think about my life and how I could achieve my goals through different methods that I could never think of my self.If you have motion sickness, I hear that this game will trigger it, so do proceed with caution.

There is extreme amount of thought put into the level design and world as a whole.

												I want to recommend Antichamber, a puzzle game.This game will mess around with your mind as things might not work as you are used too. You will encounter Escher-like rooms where simple physical laws may not apply. As you progress you will discover (probably known) wise sayings. Interesting part is how the game reveals them. You will recognize that a newly unlocked saying often is connected to the puzzle you just come to solve and you may think about its meaning in your life. These few elements paired with some animations already manage to create a ""story"".Of course the game isn't exclusively about the way of life. It has nice graphics and contains details you just want to look at. Also the sounds fit in this environment. Of course this game will reward you with that feeling of success after having solved a problem. Some puzzles may appear completly new. They might be described like seeing an optical illusion which you never saw before and finding out what is ""wrong"" with them.			"

												Like modern enigmas ? This is for you ! This game is brilliant, the gamplay is made to be absolutely with the main thing about the game, and having a gameplay coordinate to the main idea of a game, it's not that simple for a game based on enigmas and solving puzzle... Definitely a really good job, even if you're not good with that kind of game, this one is a perfect harmony of gameplay and puzzles AND without being boring ! There's always a kind of mystery thing that you absolutely want to discover, just wrtitting this makes me want to play it again !			"

												Antichamber. It looks and sounds so simplistic. But it isn't.Antichamber is a puzzle game that challenges your mind. What seems simple isn't so, and what seems complicated is easy. Return to places different than you remember. All of what Antichamber is as a game, is to screw you mentally. That's why I love it.You are in a pseudo-sensory-deprivation chamber. You navigate your way through a simple world. W for forward.A for left. But wait. It gets way more complicated. Some pathways are straightforward and simple. Some require meticulous observation. Some require you to take a step back, look in a certain area, move in a certain way. As the game moves forward, the complexity increases.Pick up and move blocks.Solve puzzles.Turn around.Shift blocks forward.Destroy them.Multiply them. Fly. Soon, your ability augments even more: you learn more new tricks, but continue to use the old. Swap perspectives. Expand.Solve.Extract.And finally, presented with the final problem. you need to outsmart it. You need to use everything you know, from the basic WASD and jump, to the complex techniques that you have learned from the Manipulator. To destroy the final dark force. To escape.10/10 - IGN.While I wouldn't say it has too much replayability, it certainly is possible. It's fun! You can stretch your brain to its limits, and spend hours upon hous figuring out one piece to the worldly puzzle. It has a pretty short campaign, though the speed all depends on how fast it takes you to figure out each puzzle. There are hidden secrets in-game, hidden perspectives, and hidden meanings. Pick up this game now, and understand everything!Explore. Play. Observe. Destroy. Antichamber.			"

												Antichamber is a mind-bending game, with a very unique artstyle. It teaches you to look at things from many different angles. It's truly a game, which will make you think about stuff multiple times until you've found the answer. Going into it, I had a an idea of what it is going to be, since I've seen a first impression video about it, but even then some puzzles had me questioning my general understanding of things. Be warned, this is not your normal puzzle game like Portal or something, this is a complete different experience. I would recommend it to anyone, Puzzle and non-puzzle fans alike!			"

												I want to recommend Antichamber, a puzzle game.This game will mess around with your mind as things might not work as you are used too. You will encounter Escher-like rooms where simple physical laws may not apply. As you progress you will discover (probably known) wise sayings. Interesting part is how the game reveals them. You will recognize that a newly unlocked saying often is connected to the puzzle you just come to solve and you may think about its meaning in your life. These few elements paired with some animations already manage to create a ""story"".Of course the game isn't exclusively about the way of life. It has nice graphics and contains details you just want to look at. Also the sounds fit in this environment. Of course this game will reward you with that feeling of success after having solved a problem. Some puzzles may appear completly new. They might be described like seeing an optical illusion which you never saw before and finding out what is ""wrong"" with them.			"

												As someone who naturally gets lost all the time, this game makes me feel right at home by making me feel lost in even a straight hallway by violating the laws of reality.The vibrant color changes can hurt your eyes for a while if you're not used to such things.In conclusion, I'd judge this game as an excellent first-person puzzle maze game, as well as a getting-lost-walking simulator.

												When I saw screenshots, the game did not seem to be of much interest to me, especially because I don't like puzzle games.I did enjoy Portal though, so I decided to give Antichamber a go. This game has no story, and a very simplistic visuals. Audio does add to the atmosphere though. The game begins with extremely easy tasks, but the difficulty slowly raises the further you go. What surprised me is that this is not a portal clone at all, whatever screenshots suggest, but it's a puzzle game nonetheless, and the chaces are that if you enjoyed Portal, then you will also enjoy Antichamber. To every puzzle you encounter there is a hint provided. Hints are philosophical reflections, which also give solutions to puzzles - but they are not straightforward and require some logical thinking (you may figure out every puzzle the first time without trial & error style of play - which was the case in Portal too many a time - but as the puzzles become more and more complex you will finally encounter ones that are too difficult for that, unless you are smarter than the developer or me at least). Fortunately, the philosophical reflections are not of 2deep4u kind, so you are not constantly molested with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff. They are very simple and kind of cute. It's like the guy who made this game wasn't a typical recluse indie developer suffering from affective disorders and egocentrism, but actually a reasonable and smart dude. The gameworld consist of multiple corridors, which branch in many ways and it's the player who chooses which way he prefers to go (or rather - how he solves puzzles, because they often have multiple solutions). At any time you may come back to any previously encountered puzzle and solve it again, perhaps in a different way leading you to another branch of the ""chamber"". Overall, I enjoy this game a lot, despite my inner prejudice towards puzzle and adventure games.			"

												Gran juego de puzles. Bajo una estética chocante, se oculta un título que bebe en parte de Portal 2 y que, al mismo tiempo, es capaz de mantener su propia personalidad, con una serie de retos que desafían a la lógica habitual y que nos invitan a ver los problemas desde una óptica distinta a lo acostumbrado en la mayoría de juegos. Antichamber es un título minimalista, sin historia explícita, sin diálogos, sin banda sonora (sólo sonidos ambientales) pero por momentos es un gran desafío, sin ningún tipo de ayudas ni pistas que nos indiquen qué camino seguir, más allá de breves mensajes dispersos más parecidos a reflexiones casi filosóficas sobre la vida que a soluciones ante los retos planteados. Y todo ello creado por una sola persona. Fantástico.			"

That is why having a friend who approaches games from a different angle is super helpful in this game. Tons of fun, Great Game!			"

												Antichamber is a rather unique puzzle game, where you go around a maze like area, exploring vague life lessons, and getting your mind blown by impossible objects and geometry. There's not much in ways of story, as the main theme is to complete a wide variety of puzzles in order to reach the end, but the game is fun regardless.Gameplay and Visual wise: Everything about this game fits the tone of one word: unique. The game looks unique to say the least, as well as simplistic. If you're not a fan of bright colors, or bright colors hurt your head, you may want to tone down the brightness just a bit when playing through 85% of the game. The puzzles are quite unique, with some puzzles being rather challenging, while others can be easily accomplished with late game items (or item rather). There really was never a time I felt absolutely stumped on a puzzle, as the mechanics and the ""cube ray"" are demonstrated in a straightforward manner to the player. Story and Completion wise: Really there is not much to say for either of these. There isn't much of a story in the game, other than life lessons that can be seen as collectibles, and completing the game is as simple as getting to the end and finding every life lesson. There are the purple blocks, yes, however you may easily find most of the blocks when exploring the various rooms. Keep a look out in every room you come across, and completing the game is easy.Recommendation: For a puzzle game, this game does stand out with rather unique mechanics and looks, with life lessons being shown to the player along the way. If you want to have a relaxing time, solving puzzles and exploring, I would highly recommend this game.			"

												Antichamber has blossomed from an Unreal Tournament 2004 project into a deceptively minimalistic puzzle game. It is an excellent addition to any gaming library thanks to its challenging puzzles and its psychological manipulation of common expectations. While the basic cell-shaded graphics may be down to the game's budget, Antichamber pulls them off brilliantly. Bright primary colours blanket areas where other games might use high quality textures, and interesting particle effects stand out as a visual cue rather than as something to be expected. This adds to the game's poignant art style, as well as making it run smoothly on less capable computers.Antichamber's gameplay mechanics switch between bending the fabric of reality and rule-oriented cube placement. Many puzzles' currencies are doled out as these collectable cubes, with different colours representing possible hints towards a solution. Other puzzles involving movement, physics, and even view orientation are welcome additions that are interspersed regularly. The pacing flows nicely between areas, and each puzzle is unique enough to stay fresh. Rooms that seem inaccessible earlier on will eventually be attainable once new techniques of manipulating cubes are discovered. While this does make for a lot of back-tracking, Antichamber's theme revolves around revisiting the impossible.Aside from teaching the basics of how to utilize its tools, the game leaves interaction with its cubed building-blocks up to the player. The imposed experiential learning leads to many “Eureka!” moments during Antichamber's journey. The game balances them perfectly with some of the more difficult challenges; each solution is just enough of an ego boost to keep spirits high before perplexing players with a new situation. Even the more stupefying tasks never seem arduous, in part because of their basic elegance but also thanks to the omnipresent musical atmosphere.Excellent sound effects are probably the main reason why Antichamber maintains such a calm ambiance. Whether splashing through a shallow pond or standing on a windy mountaintop, the sounds of nature are always present and never get tedious. This contrast between the game's claustrophobic interiors and its superb outdoor soundscape is very mentally stimulating and adds to Antichamber's aloofness. Thankfully, the oddly juxtaposed soundtrack avoids over-complicating itself, which keeps the focus on exploring and solving puzzles.Depending on how thoroughly it's completed, expect this journey to last between eight to twelve hours. Although certain puzzles are inevitably stumping, pulling through them is what makes Antichamber so satisfying to play. Its engrossing atmosphere and frequent instances of disbelief combine to form one of this generation's most appealing puzzle games.			"

												Duck. Did I say duck ? Yeah, because that's what the game feels like. Wibbly wobbly duckin' duck. Whoever enters this place, leave here all your preconceived ideas about what games are, along with your definition of logic. Might as well put your sanity in a box and kick it goodbye until you finish Antichamber.  That's what I did after 10 minutes, and it felt great. For the 5 hours it lasted, I enjoyed being toyed around by an unending flow of pseudo-philosophical panels, a weird mix of portal-like puzzles and weird thingies, made of cubes, eyes and colors. I came sceptical, I shouldn't have. I came thinking forward is forward, that up is up, and that I was smart. Turns out I was wrong. So, what is Antichamber ? Definitely not a game that'll make you laugh. Definitely not a game that'll make you feel accomplished. Hell, I don't even know if I can call it a game. But if you are willing to take a probe up your try something new, something that will challenge everything you know, then go forward. You won't understand everything. You won't like everything. You probably won't play more than 30mn at a time. But this is probably one of the only game I've ever played that I will remember, not because of it's gameplay, but because of it's meaning and contents. What are you waiting for ?			"

												Antichamber is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time. The puzzles themselves are not what makes this game unique, but the line being constantly crossed between what's real and unreal. The game isn't ""oh so crazy"" that trying to navigate logically will screw you over, but it also does not obey the rules of space. I wanted to keep playing, to the end, without stopping, and I do believe that would be the best way to do it for the experience. The ambient track is slightly unsettling/calming, and the whole concept and execution has loads of meaning which is up for you to find yourself. I do believe this was very well done, except I do think it could've done without the signs everywhere with cliché life lessons for hints. That's my one gripe, but other than that, this game seems to have accomplished its goal and is truly complete and something to consider.			"

												STRANGE!!!! This game is bizarre and I love it. It takes all the great features of games like Portal and throws it into a drug-tripped paradise. I haven't figure out the point of the game or even what the storyline is but in reality the entire game seems to be more just to get you thinking than anything. Highly recommend trying it out at least. Might not be the top of your list of favorites but it's definitely a great time killer if you need that sort of thing. I plan on playing it until I figure it all out....I have a feeling it might take a while.			"

												This game is an incredible trip, full of opportunities to be stymied by your own preconceptions of how things should go.  You will get stuck.  Often.  My advice?  Do the unexpected, backtrack, look for unconventional ways through obstacles.  The tool you are given is usually the key, often in ways you can't readily imagine.			"

All this before you even begin toying with the block gun.Few games I've played have been able to evoke so much with so little and for anyone that wants to try something truly new, Antichamber is your best bet.

												Calling 'Antichamber' a game either says too much or says too little. Yes, you can succeed in 'Antichamber,' sometimes on accident; there are puzzles to solve, and there is a goal. But the goal doesn't really matter; 'Antichamber' is definitely about the things you see on the journey rather than the destination or even the journey itself. The puzzles should be maddening, but they're not. There is a soothing, peaceful detachment to the game, as you wander around the impossible, intricate maze. The mechanic of the space around you warping based on your perception doesn't get old, though there are times when you just really, really want to get past a door - and have absolutely no idea how to do so.It's definitely not for everyone, but it's worth a look for no other reason than just to see it. Clever, strange, and created by accident (the origin of 'Antichamber' was a mistake by its creator while building an entirely different sort of game).			"

												Not a fan of the minimalist art style since you get lost and dizzy on the first hour, but after that you get used to.The strong point of this game is obviously the puzzle and the crazy particle, portal and perspective views which is extremely well done. The difficulty of the puzzle isn’t with the logic but having to take a different approach most of the time.This game is one big labyrinthe that most chambers are interconnecting, so there’s multiple way to advance to the end, which is nice.This game force you to think outside of the box compare to the traditional videogame.Making a game with multiple paths, multiple ways of solving a puzzle is impressive. So, kudos to the developer for making one hell of an experience.Well worth it in my opinion.“We can appreciate the entire journey by looking back at how far we have come.” -AC			"

												antichamber is one of the best puzzle games ive ever played, this game constantly blows your mind away and its one of the very very few games id call ""artistic"" such as Braid, Ico and Shadow of the Colossusi consider this game should be played knowing as little about it as you can, that being said i suggest you read no futher since im going into detail of what makes this game great and its main faultI CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING SPOILERS, ID AVOID READING IF I WAS YOU:one of the most impressive things about the game is how it can be similar to portal and completely different from portal, both are puzzle games in first person where you use a ""gun"" to solve the different puzzles in the environment, also both use a lot of white hehe. however once you dig depper into antichamber, you realize its actually the complete opposite of Portal, Portal makes you feel like you are part of something big, it also makes you feel like theres a world out there, an entire universe beyond aperture labs walls, antichamber does not do this, for all we know those halls you tread in antichamber might be all there is in the universe. Portal makes huge emphasis on science and logic, everything about it makes reference to this often in a very humorous way, the world of antichamber is governed by non-sequiturs and absurdity, it is a non-euclidean plane in which running in a straight line can make you end up going in circles, you can fall 50 meters off a cliff down a hole, turn around and find yourself at the top of the cliff again, among other mind bending things. if the world of antichamber abides to any sort of laws they are fundamentally different to the ones our universe abidesmost puzzles in the game are solved with the aid a ""gun"" that allows you to take and place cubes in different places, you can activate laser tripwires with those cubes, use it to create platforms to stand up, etc. as you progress through the game, your gun acquires new functionsusually i consider a game art when the setting and gameplay of the game combine to tell a story with almost no exposition, or is used to push ideas into the mind of the player by the use of gameplay alone, antichamber is one of those games, everything in the game pushes the idea of a world of complete nonsense or governed by laws completely different to the ones we have come to expect, both from our universe and games in general, ive already explained how the game takes place in an non-euclidean plane, but theres also the fact the game is a non-linear succession of puzzles, you will very often solve puzzles only to find yourself in previous rooms, and yet the game very subtlety lets you know youve made progress, such as by taking you back to a puzzle you could previously not solve because your gun wasnt upgraded yet, or something like that, you will only reach the conclusion of most puzzles if you let this unorthodox place get into you and you start developing unorthodox solutions to the puzzles. most puzzles games work like this: the game puts you in front of a table places a jigsaw puzzle on that table and asks you to solve it, antichamber puts you in front of a table places a jigsaw puzzle on that table, takes a few pieces and hides em somewhere in the room without telling you and then asks you to solve the puzzle, you MUST think outside the box, but the game always finds a way to subtely hint at the solution, hell im sure a couple of times youll find a solution by accident just by going ""meh ♥♥♥♥ it"" and doing something that in normal circunstances would be a futile exercise, such as jumping agaisnt a wall you cant reach or something like thatthe downside to this puzzle design is that it commits one of the biggest capital sins of puzzle games, some solutions take too long to implement, you see, most good puzzle games make sure that you take a good time coming up with a solution for the puzzle, yet they make the process of implementing this solution fast, this is why portal is so great, after youve come up with the solution the actual process of implementing it is fast and usually involves exhilaratingly flying through the air. this is where antichamber falls short, many solutions take a long time to implement and might even leave you questioning yourself if you are doing things rightthe sounds and aesthetics of the game are nice, the latter deserve special credit for being unique and striking, using little detail and a significant amount of color, however is a bit too bright sometimesit took me 8 hours to finish the game and i havent completed it 100% (tough im very close) so it has a good length for a puzzle gamei very strongly recommend this gameUPDATE: completed the game 100%, took me 8.7 hours, as i said, good length for a puzzle game			"

												6/10I had a good time for a while but quickly grew bored with the game. It does it’s best to create an interesting environment and creative gameplay but it has no real hook to keep you playing beyond about an hour or two. In the Portal games you constantly keep playing to see what happens next and what new challenges await, this game does not have any of those creative archetypes and simply presents familiar challenges over and over again in stale and uninteresting scenarios. If you find it on sale, get it, otherwise it’s not worth the money. I am really borderline recommending this game – if you enjoy unique worlds and puzzle gameplay you might have a good time; for a while.			"

												Easily one of the best puzzle games ever created. This game pulls off the trick of creating a 3d environment out of an Escher drawing. The game takes place entirely in what is like a maze of puzzles and all the while twisting back on itself and bending the rules of reality to both mind boggling as well as enchanting levels. The puzzles do get challenging and while there is no real story, the cryptic messages found on the walls throughout the game sort of give the sense that you are being watched, not by some character but rather by the antichamber itself. It is a beautiful concept of creating a sort of relationship with the environment and unlocking its secrets and learning that there really are some rules, is an incredibly rewading experience. Do yourself a service as well as partake in the pleasure of playing this hallmark of game design.			"

												A mind-twisting experience that will force you to constantly think outside the box. Only the box is 4 dimentional. Or is it? Antichamber throws all conventional puzzling out the window, and constantly forces you to improvise, observe, and think. Sometimes the solution can be as simple as 'look in a specific direction'. Because in Antichamber, rules of physics do not apply. Or they do, and you just do not understand how. The experience is the definition of non-linearity and is pretty much one of a kind. If you like to challenge your mind and are not repulsed by somewhat unpleasant art-style, if you'd like to expirience something unique, get Antichamber. And remember - the sings may help you more than you think.			"

												Cool puzzle game, with nice aesthetics. I was hoping for more surreal spacial awareness based puzzles, but about an hour in most of the puzzles become resource management type, involving the block firing gun, This was still really fun, and also really surreal in it's own way (which was exemplified by the the lack of handholding), but not really what I was expecting. The game was challenging, but usually with branching paths, so you're seldom completely stuck (though it does happen). The high difficulty, and the secrets to be found would give you upwards of 8 hours of playability, which may be a bit short for the price, depending on your budget. However, the aesthetics and soundtrack were big pluses, immersing you in the game, despite there being no narrative.If you're into puzzle games for their own sake, I'd definitely reccommend.

												I think my favorite part about this game is how it interacts with you; how it teaches you subliminally the rules of the world. It is a very fresh experience that promotes self-investigation. The closest thing to the game telling you its actual rules are these parables you come across. Antichamber does not play out in strict Euclidean space, and the laws of physics are not expressed the same as we experience them in real life. This produces a world with its own flavor and intrinsic beauty. Learning the way the world works in Antichamber IS the driving force of its gameplay, and WOW is it done well.			"

												Reality-bending first person puzzler. On first play, I thought it was interesting and clever but also very frustrating. Second time I played, I found the first manipulation device and it all started to click. The puzzles are often hard but always logical within the rules that antichamber lays out (so far at least).The introduction of new concepts is well paced. The only thing I'm not sure I like is the fact that you'll encounter plenty of puzzles that cannot be solved until you revist them later with a new manipulation tool. There are positives to that approach but I also think it leads to a lot of confusion and frustration that could easilly put someone off.Overall, I highly recommend this. Just make sure you're willing to stick at it for a while and you'll find a great puzzle game with some very satisfying moments.			"

												STRANGE!!!! This game is bizarre and I love it. It takes all the great features of games like Portal and throws it into a drug-tripped paradise. I haven't figure out the point of the game or even what the storyline is but in reality the entire game seems to be more just to get you thinking than anything. Highly recommend trying it out at least. Might not be the top of your list of favorites but it's definitely a great time killer if you need that sort of thing. I plan on playing it until I figure it all out....I have a feeling it might take a while.			"

												Antichamber, a game which hardly makes sense, except that sense is not required here, because all you have to really use is your brain, making your way through your ""life"".Basically this game is to teach some meanings of life, in a fun way, you have to make through various puzzles using tips used in real life, like for example: If you only think of right now, you won't have enough for later. Things that you mother and father would tell you during the course of your life.I can say that this game is not really supposed to have a story, I could say that this is mostly a game to think to solve the puzzles, and maybe learn something which is going to be REALLY useful in your life, in a fun way, until you are able to finish your ""quest"" or as it can be seen in this game, your ""life"".Graphics: I'll say that the graphic is quite simple, but yet very attractive and colorful (I love colorful games!) in some parts, and the block gun look very interesting and ironically, reverses the conditions colors I like to use specially in survival games (Blue for perfect health, Green for little damage, yellow for medium damage and red for heavy damage), being the first on the blue and the last the Red gun, as a little downside, I think most of the corridors were a little lifeless, the walls were all white, it gives you a strange feeling of lolyness, maybe it was the intention of the game (9.5/10)Story: Like mentioned before, I believe this game wasn't really made to have a story, except for learning some meanings of life in a fun way, and the player (which the appearance is unknown) must pass the challenges in his ""life"", none of the happenings made any sense at all, like, why (s)he was there, who was (s)he, and what happened in the ending (I'll avoid making spoilers). The story didn't make much sense, so I'm afraid the story will get a so so rating, but hey! Just because the story is confusing somewhat doesn't mean the game is bad! (6/10)Sound: Whoa, how I did like the sounds in the game, the sounds gave quite a good touch to the game, when you are falling at a very high speed, that good sound of the air passing on your ears, when you land, and the sounds of you moving, absorbing and firing the blocks, gave a great touch to the game, in any moment I never got tired of the sound effects, and the music was very calm, a perfect music to let the player think through the puzzles, I simply have nothing but good things to say about the sounds (10/10)Depth: Depending on how well can you think on the solution of the puzzles, the game can take quite a while to beat (I almost beat the game 100% in around 20 hours, being some of those hours idle), and having various different paths, including some deadends, if you are looking to explore everything in the game, it's going to take a while, if you are just aiming to find the exit, the game will be a bit shorter, looking at the map (there is a map of the rooms explored on the wall of the game start chamber), the game seems to have needed to have a few more rooms. (8/10)Addictiveness: Awesome, I can safely say that until I could find almost all the black signs (you can see all the black signs you found during the game on the game start chamber), I never got tired of the game, but after I've given up to find the last 5 black signs, I didn't really feel like playing again. (8/10)Difficulty: I can say that the difficulty is at it's exact point to the human mind, the challenges fits exactly accordingly to a smart person, I had to put a lot of thought through the challenges, to solve 'em, some were simple, and some you had to be more experienced and have more ""Tools"" to work them out. (7/10 = Tough)			"

												Although confusing, I find it as an attractive puzzle game. The ingame menu is unique, and the gameplay style is extraordinary. Sometimes, you really have to think before your solve. The guns that you retrieve in Antichamber give you abilities to retrieve things like blocks, and can allow you to duplicate them. The color that was put into the game fits perfectly with each step of life you take. The ambience in Antichamber goes with everything that happens, like the flying dots have pigeon sounds. This is a really great game, and it's worth spending money on.			"

												Mindf***ing first person puzzler with lovely visuals and intriguing ""story"", if you can call it that.It's an experience, a journey, a slap in your face. It's a satire to traditional gaming tropes and forces you to forget what you learned from ""normal games"".PErsonal experience: I found some puzzles to be really really cryptic and strange. The 2nd half of the game got a bit duller since most puzzles involved the ""guns"".With that said I still enjoyed it a lot and recommend it to any puzzle game lovers. Be warned though, this game WILL make you flip tables.			"

Not an npc against you but a whole game. If you cant think outside the box (sometimes literaly), you'r done for. But when you finish the game you are more happy than with other games.

												I don't think I've fallen in love with a game more instantaneously than I have with Antichamber. While I'm far from considering myself a ""classic gamer"", one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.I also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.At a glance, the game could easily be describled as ""Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.This game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.Overall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts.

												Antichamber is a first person puzzle game set in non-euclidean space. Each area has its own internal logic, but some of the mechanics of the various guns which you get can take a little bit to figure out - this game can be VERY hard at times. It's difficult to describe in greater detail without spiling some aspects of the puzzles itself, so I would simply recommend that you check it out if you like difficult puzzle games and/or things which break the logic of reality as you're used to it.I will note that the saturated colors of the graphic style can take some getting used to, but it ends up being rather charming.

												On the surface, this game doesn't have much to boast: it's mostly in black and white, and the graphics are far from optimized, which can actually cause motion sickness. However, once you get into the game you're in for hours of entertainment and mind-bending puzzles. You'll encounter situations that would otherwise occur only in an M. C. Escher painting, and the first casualty of the game will be your basic sense of geometric logic. Your mind will twist in a way that puts even Portal to shame, that you can't help but wonder in amazement how the developers even got the engine to behave like they wanted it to. And when you do finally end up solving the puzzles, the sense of accomplishment you get from it is like almost nothing else.If you don't have this game in your Steam Library, you should fix that problem ASAP, because this game really is that fun. It has an extremely simple control scheme, but the game is so complex and deep that it definitely beats many other titles out there.			"

I would highly suggest this to anyone who likes this genre of games, and have to say if i didnt catch it on the sale i would have still bought it for the full 20 dollars. Worthwhile in my opinion.

Anyway, it's a really fun first-person puzzler with a lot of ""rooms"" to explore and solve, each room is designed to either teach you what you can do with the tools you're given or to apply what you've learned from other rooms (or both).The only real downside is it felt like it was too short for the suggested retail price.Still, any fan of Portal can't go wrong by adding this game to their library.

												I went through a very unique experience in this first person shooter puzzle game. The graphic is simple yet it is appropriately used with all the traps that will bend your perception and mind. The music and ambiance sound is also made me absorbed to this other world. It's not a relaxing game when you try to beat the time or something, but when you take your time and enjoy the riddles and the puzzles, you'll have a good and relaxing time.Gameplay : 10/10Graphics : 8/10Sounds : 9/10			"

												The game is awesome, it makes you think out of the box, and inside the box too. It's not a LARGE game, you can finish it and see everything in like 6 or 7 hours (or a little more too). It's entertaining, and addictive too! I can't say more, you MUST play it, I totally recomend this.(ADVICE: ONLY PLAY IT IF YOU LIKE PUZZLES, BUT HARD ONES)			"

												I don't think I've fallen in love with a game more instantaneously than I have with Antichamber. While I'm far from considering myself a ""classic gamer"", one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.I also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.At a glance, the game could easily be describled as ""Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.This game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.Overall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts.

												This is one of the toughest thumbs-up decisions I've made.  I bought this game because it looked interesting and different, and had some good reviews.  And it IS interesting.  The word ""different,"" however, does not fully convey the magnitude of its strangeness.This is a game with which I have a love/hate relationship.  I love the concept -- a game that subverts physical rules and creates its own completely bizarre and disorienting (albeit very very minimalist) world.  I love the break from conventional big-name first-person games that do nothing but show you pretty scenery in which you run around and kill people.  And I initially loved the challenge of solving these weird, brain-teasing puzzles.That is, until I started to hate it.  I hate the fact that the gameworld very very frequently loops back on itself and you find yourself solving the same puzzles that you went through quite a while ago.  Perhaps there is a way to play this game so that you avoid all of these loop-back pitfalls; I don't know.  But all too often, I'd fall through a hole that suddenly materializes, or I'd turn a corner, and I'm back at a place that I had passed a long time ago.  This is enough to make me turn off the game in utter frustration.I also hate the save-game mechanics, which are completely checkpoint-based and not controllable by the player, and do NOT let you save  wherever you want to save.  The checkpoints are too far apart, for one thing.  For another, because of the way that the game loops back on itself, and the fact that the gameworld is so completely disorienting anyway, these checkpoints are rendered fairly useless.  So I'm back at this weird eye in the wall.  For the 29th time.  Except something might be a bit different about it this time around.  You see the problem here?This game is like a practical joke on the player.  Still, after these long periods of utter frustration and downtime (quitting the game in disgust), after a few days or a week there is a strange compulsion to give it another go.  To see if any progress can be made THIS TIME.  It's masochistic in a way.  The fascinating, mindbending puzzles keep calling me back, my frustration with the game notwithstanding. I have not finished this game yet, not sure if I'll even be compelled to make it that far.  We'll see.			"

												If you liked Portal, or just puzzle games in general, buy this. It is quite the puzzle game with very counterintuitive solutions at times, and one that promotes exploration. The game will introduce some very unique puzzle pieces, without explicitly telling you what they do and why they are important. Trial and error is key!That being said, I would recommend playing this blind. Otherwise it will be a very short experience and an unfulfilling one.  "

												Extremely fun puzzle game, with a very different take on the genre. I enetered this game expecting it to be akin to Portal, and while it was in some senses, they are two entirely different experiences. Portal gets you to think with...portals, and Antichamber just simply requires you to think outside the box. While it is a simple concept, some of the challenges can prove to be quite difficult.I really cant find many problems with this game. The only thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the  game can  double up on the solution to puzzles. This is quite noticable around midway through the game, when around 2-3 of the puzzles have the same solution. That being said, the sheer uniqueness of some of the other puzzles more than make up for this. Some may find that the game isn't extremely replayable. However, for me this wasn't too much of a problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed the game even on my second playthrough. Overall, amazing game, an extremely unique game to the genre, and a must-buy during sales.9/10			"

												Duck. Did I say duck ? Yeah, because that's what the game feels like. Wibbly wobbly duckin' duck. Whoever enters this place, leave here all your preconceived ideas about what games are, along with your definition of logic. Might as well put your sanity in a box and kick it goodbye until you finish Antichamber.  That's what I did after 10 minutes, and it felt great. For the 5 hours it lasted, I enjoyed being toyed around by an unending flow of pseudo-philosophical panels, a weird mix of portal-like puzzles and weird thingies, made of cubes, eyes and colors. I came sceptical, I shouldn't have. I came thinking forward is forward, that up is up, and that I was smart. Turns out I was wrong. So, what is Antichamber ? Definitely not a game that'll make you laugh. Definitely not a game that'll make you feel accomplished. Hell, I don't even know if I can call it a game. But if you are willing to take a probe up your try something new, something that will challenge everything you know, then go forward. You won't understand everything. You won't like everything. You probably won't play more than 30mn at a time. But this is probably one of the only game I've ever played that I will remember, not because of it's gameplay, but because of it's meaning and contents. What are you waiting for ?			"

												It's a first person puzzler that screws with your head. Unlike Portal, which gave you brain-bending ways to explore the physics of the real world (flinging, wheeeeeee!), Antichamber dispenses with the real world altogether. Turn around and you may not see the room you just came from. Turn a corner and find yourself where you were. Rooms overlap, you can go up by going sideways, and things disappear when you stop looking...All of this sounds like it doesn't make sense, but very pleasingly it does. The place runs on logic and self-consistency and everything (well, I suspect most things) has a well-reasoned solution. The puzzles are solid, polished, and nothing's so hard that you can't solve it. The game took me about 8 hours to beat (across three nights), and I liked all of it.Play this game and feel your mind being turned inside-out.			"

Portal 1, for the best results.Then multiply that by two.  Then take that, and mutiply by two again.  And then do it again.  And again.  And again.And you do this until you get to the point in which you stare into a blue room of white and smile and say ""Yes.  1 + 2 = Fish"" and step back through a solid wall of thin air into a room of green that actually purple which holds a black panel with a fortune cookie saying on it.And then you smile again at the fact that you think you understand the meaning when you really don't and fall down a hole because you looked at a painted eye.Then you start all over again.TL;DR:  LSD.

They are simple but the colors and patterns are just incredibleStability: Game play is smooth.  It runs on the Unreal 3 engine so everything works wellGame play:  Everything is totally original.  You will see so many game making innovations from the menu which is literally in first person mode to the crazy colors that make you feel like you are in space odyssey 2001.  Its kind of like a psychedelic Portal.  The little mementos on the walls are really clever and I wish I could put them up on the walls in my home.Issues:  I'm not very good at solving puzzles and I really have not been able to finish the game.  This is disappointing to me.  When I finally get around to revisiting antichamber I have typically forgotten how to go about the game and its basically like restarting.

												Immersive. This first person puzzler caught me by surprise. It boggles your mind, taking away what typical physical limitations you have in games. By that, I mean it goes beyond Portal by modifying the landscape. The audio is well thought out to your environment. The graphics so far are like lightly saturated, ultra constratsted feel like Borderlands series. The menu at first isn't very intuitive, but it gets useful rather quickly.			"

												Cool puzzle game, with nice aesthetics. I was hoping for more surreal spacial awareness based puzzles, but about an hour in most of the puzzles become resource management type, involving the block firing gun, This was still really fun, and also really surreal in it's own way (which was exemplified by the the lack of handholding), but not really what I was expecting. The game was challenging, but usually with branching paths, so you're seldom completely stuck (though it does happen). The high difficulty, and the secrets to be found would give you upwards of 8 hours of playability, which may be a bit short for the price, depending on your budget. However, the aesthetics and soundtrack were big pluses, immersing you in the game, despite there being no narrative.If you're into puzzle games for their own sake, I'd definitely reccommend. As I do, I'll give it a 8/10			"

												6/10I had a good time for a while but quickly grew bored with the game. It does it’s best to create an interesting environment and creative gameplay but it has no real hook to keep you playing beyond about an hour or two. In the Portal games you constantly keep playing to see what happens next and what new challenges await, this game does not have any of those creative archetypes and simply presents familiar challenges over and over again in stale and uninteresting scenarios. If you find it on sale, get it, otherwise it’s not worth the money. I am really borderline recommending this game – if you enjoy unique worlds and puzzle gameplay you might have a good time; for a while.			"

												No doubt, Antichamber is a hard game. It's not so much that it challenges the skill of a player, his reaction times, his ability to multi-task or, as you might think from the screenshots with the gun, his precision with a crosshair. Antichamber throws the player into a labyrinth of wisdom for life, one that will sometimes force you to take a step back and see the greater scheme of things, one that will throw you back for you to start over again and make you learn from unforeseeable mistakes. It's what makes this game immersive. You don't know what to expect, what you'll encounter around the next corner or even better, what you will encounter after an endless set of corners. What is the sense of this? There might be no answer to that question. This is Antichamber, a metaphor for life.			"

												A fantastic first-person puzzle game.To call it an absorbing experience would be to do it a disservice. It does everything it possibly can to mess with your head... or at least, it makes you *think* it's done everything it possibly could, until you enter the next room and something else happens to confuse things even further.Some of the mechanics can be a little inconsistent in their behaviour at times, leading to some frustrating moments, and a few times it felt like my solutions to some things cheated the system a bit -- but all the same, I highly recommend this one.

												antichamber is one of the best puzzle games ive ever played, this game constantly blows your mind away and its one of the very very few games id call ""artistic"" such as Braid, Ico and Shadow of the Colossusi consider this game should be played knowing as little about it as you can, that being said i suggest you read no futher since im going into detail of what makes this game great and its main faultI CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING SPOILERS, ID AVOID READING IF I WAS YOU:one of the most impressive things about the game is how it can be similar to portal and completely different from portal, both are puzzle games in first person where you use a ""gun"" to solve the different puzzles in the environment, also both use a lot of white hehe. however once you dig depper into antichamber, you realize its actually the complete opposite of Portal, Portal makes you feel like you are part of something big, it also makes you feel like theres a world out there, an entire universe beyond aperture labs walls, antichamber does not do this, for all we know those halls you tread in antichamber might be all there is in the universe. Portal makes huge emphasis on science and logic, everything about it makes reference to this often in a very humorous way, the world of antichamber is governed by non-sequiturs and absurdity, it is a non-euclidean plane in which running in a straight line can make you end up going in circles, you can fall 50 meters off a cliff down a hole, turn around and find yourself at the top of the cliff again, among other mind bending things. if the world of antichamber abides to any sort of laws they are fundamentally different to the ones our universe abidesmost puzzles in the game are solved with the aid a ""gun"" that allows you to take and place cubes in different places, you can activate laser tripwires with those cubes, use it to create platforms to stand up, etc. as you progress through the game, your gun acquires new functionsusually i consider a game art when the setting and gameplay of the game combine to tell a story with almost no exposition, or is used to push ideas into the mind of the player by the use of gameplay alone, antichamber is one of those games, everything in the game pushes the idea of a world of complete nonsense or governed by laws completely different to the ones we have come to expect, both from our universe and games in general, ive already explained how the game takes place in an non-euclidean plane, but theres also the fact the game is a non-linear succession of puzzles, you will very often solve puzzles only to find yourself in previous rooms, and yet the game very subtlety lets you know youve made progress, such as by taking you back to a puzzle you could previously not solve because your gun wasnt upgraded yet, or something like that, you will only reach the conclusion of most puzzles if you let this unorthodox place get into you and you start developing unorthodox solutions to the puzzles. most puzzles games work like this: the game puts you in front of a table places a jigsaw puzzle on that table and asks you to solve it, antichamber puts you in front of a table places a jigsaw puzzle on that table, takes a few pieces and hides em somewhere in the room without telling you and then asks you to solve the puzzle, you MUST think outside the box, but the game always finds a way to subtely hint at the solution, hell im sure a couple of times youll find a solution by accident just by going ""meh ♥♥♥♥ it"" and doing something that in normal circunstances would be a futile exercise, such as jumping agaisnt a wall you cant reach or something like thatthe downside to this puzzle design is that it commits one of the biggest capital sins of puzzle games, some solutions take too long to implement, you see, most good puzzle games make sure that you take a good time coming up with a solution for the puzzle, yet they make the process of implementing this solution fast, this is why portal is so great, after youve come up with the solution the actual process of implementing it is fast and usually involves exhilaratingly flying through the air. this is where antichamber falls short, many solutions take a long time to implement and might even leave you questioning yourself if you are doing things rightthe sounds and aesthetics of the game are nice, the latter deserve special credit for being unique and striking, using little detail and a significant amount of color, however is a bit too bright sometimesit took me 8 hours to finish the game and i havent completed it 100% (tough im very close) so it has a good length for a puzzle gamei very strongly recommend this gameUPDATE: completed the game 100%, took me 8.7 hours, as i said, good length for a puzzle game			"

												This game is first person adventure game in which you manuever around a series of chambers tryingto get to ""The End,"" which always seems so close yet so far.  The game beings with chambers/rooms that are more mind-bending and riddle-based, relying on manipulation of your senes, namely what you see and your sense of direction.  Sometimes you'll hear sounds which can serve as clues.  There is no dialogue in the game except for the brief life lessons attached to small images scattered before and after many of the rooms and puzzles.  Some have found these to be a little patronizing, but I found them to very charming and they provided a narrative to an otherwise silent and minimalist game.  These bits of wisdom and the ability to appreciate them I think is crucial in the enjoyment of Antechamber as a game.  This collection of images and messages are added to the ""antichamber"" which acts as your base throughout the game and to where you can escape to at any point by clicking ESC.   This room gives you access to somewhat cryptic map of where you have traveled so far and allows you to quick travel to the puzzles so you do not have to waste time finding them again in the brain boggling realm.  The game quickly (or not so quickly, depending on your pacing), moves from a game that relies on manipulating your perceptions to a game that relies on more understandable puzzles (not necessarily easy to solve, but easier to see what your objective is).  This transformation happens when you find a gun that allows you to manipulate cubes in the world around you that you use to solve puzzles.  Of course, puzzles still test the limits of your imagination and your ability to think outside the box   These puzzles till test your ability to see things in different ways and give you more easily discernable objectives in which you have to cultivate novel ways to get to.  The game is still non-linear and puzzles can be solved in different ways or bypassed completely by taking another path.  Some have found the game frustrating in that it seems intent on forcing impractical and unthinkable solutions on the player, but the game is ultimately about learning.  In this mini-universe, you have to learn and find new skills, which is what many of the messages try to convey.  For this reason, I want to describe this as a sandbox game, not in that you can change the rules of the game as you see fit, but that you are in this sandbox, and you are given a certain set of tools and rules, and with those tools and rules you can do anything you want in trying to navigate your way through the dungeon crawl.  The game is definitely a learning experience and a lesson in keeping you rmind open to new ideas.			"

If you can't solve some puzzle, just go back and find another solution, may be you will return there later with enough experience and/or abilities to proceed further. Sometimes you can find more than one way to get where you want to. Also you can find secret rooms and other fun stuff if you dig deeper. And of course many nice advices on the black paintings.So, if you like puzzles and mind♥♥♥♥ games, you should try this one.

												I cannot stress this enough, do not look online for tutorials, don't let someone else guide you through this game. As easy as it would be to have a complete stranger guide you through your life and tell you what is correct and what is not, you don't let them because life is about making mistakes and finding solutions. This game parallels that in so many regards. It guides you through a story that only you can narrate, it helps you learn and gives you direction, but not once does it allow you to take advantage an glide right through. The game offers constant challenges and forces the questioning of what you are doing. The solution rarely is clear until you have found it, and there's no fun in allowing someone else to find it for you.AntiChamber is a downright fascinating game and a beautiful strain on the mind, I urge anyone with the patience to pick up this game and let it take you on a strange and perplexing journey			"

												Antichamber is a mind-bending puzzler. The closest I can get is ""it's like Portal but while tripping on at least 3 different drugs."" It defies description. Don't spoil it for yourself, don't watch Let's Plays, don't ask for help, just get it and go. Beat it in one sitting if you can; it's better that way, and assuming you don't go for 100% completion (if there even is such a thing) then it only takes about 4 hours.While some parts of the game can be a pain and some parts will cause headaches, there are only a few puzzles that you *MUST* complete to progress through the game. That said, the more you skip, the harder the remaining puzzles will be.The first time I played it was a spiritual experience. I enjoyed watching some friends struggle through the asinine challenges and watched their minds repeatedly blown. It's a brilliant exercise in thinking so far outside of the box that you escape the bounds of reality and end up back inside the box.And here's a hint: Pay very careful attention. Move slowly and take your time - you'll spot the solutions much more quickly.			"

												If Portal's sense of humor was directed at its environment instead of its narrative.If Obsidian's developers turned their minds towards puzzles instead of point-and-click.Your steps bend space, space bends time, time bends you. The walls expand and contract and rearrange. Your memory is irrelevant, your skills and powers of logic are tested. Your ability to learn from your mistakes is emphasized. Consistency was left behind ages ago.Take the Manipulator. Take the boxes. Find the right way down through the maze, to the food, then find the exit.  Push the exit button.   If the food tastes awful, don't eat it, go back and try another way.They want the same thing that you do, really, they want a path, just like you.  You are in a maze in a maze, but which one counts?  Your maze, their maze, my maze.  Or are the mazes all the same, defined by the limits of their paths?Existence is simple: find the food, push the button, hit the treadmill.But sometimes it gets much harder.  Sometimes the food makes you sick, or you can hear nearby feet racing you, urging you on.  Sometimes the button only gets you landed right back in the beginning of the maze again, and the food won't satisfy.There is only one path and that is the path that you take, but you can take more than one path.Cross over the cell bars, find a new maze, make the maze from it's path, find the cell bars, cross over the bars, find a maze, make the maze from its path, eat the food, eat the path.

												I should never have waited for this to go on sale. This isn't a game that you'll have to worry whether or not you spent your money well. If you like Portal or The Stanley Parable, it's going to be right up your alley. You'll want to play through the whole thing, and you'll be sad when it's over until you realize there are more secrets out there. Ways to skip parts based on your new holistic understanding of the game's mechanics. Seems like a great game on which to start learning how to speed run. One of my favorites of all time. Can't recommend highly enough.			"

												Awesome Game!I admit I had to have some help to complete the game. A friend of mine and I played through together and between the two of us we were able to complete each puzzle. This game challenges the way you think and so if you tend to approach problems from the same way everytime you'll get stuck fast. That is why having a friend who approaches games from a different angle is super helpful in this game. Tons of fun, Great Game!			"

It's a game that has made me think about things, even beyond the puzzles they present, and quickly became my absoltue favorite game. There is no real way to describe Antichamber in a paragraph such as this one, and there is nothing wrong with that in the slightest. All I have to say is give it a try.			"

CAUTION: MAJOR HEAD TRIP AHEAD!Be prepared to have your brain hurt as this game defies most standard logic about the world!Antichamber is a puzzle platformer that can stand with the likes of the Portal series.  While the 3D graphics are minimalistic,  the challenges that are presented will force you to rethink HOW you approach the problem.  There's no enemies or creatures to defeat, only puzzles with a special block gun (& upgrades) that you'll find as you explore from room to room as you eventually find your way out of the space known as ""The Antichamber"".Armed with only the basic controls & a target timer (which is something you can COMPLETELY IGNORE, as taking longer than what the game notes is perfectly OK... it's just a challenge that you can partake in), you explore the various rooms & the unique challenges they can present.  The game has a very surreal feel as it takes advantages of things that cannot be done in reality (like endless coridors & instant teleportation through forced perspectives).While the game DOES NOT have any save support, it DOES offer shortcuts to players who are perceptive to find them... as well as secrets for those who wish to uncover every secret The Antichamber has to offer.If you love the Portal series, you'll definitely enjoy Antichamber as well!

												I give Anti-Chamber a 9/10.  I really like this gameGraphics: BEAUTIFUL!  Yet they are really not demanding at all, I can even run this on my work computers Intel HD 3000.  They are simple but the colors and patterns are just incredibleStability: Game play is smooth.  It runs on the Unreal 3 engine so everything works wellGame play:  Everything is totally original.  You will see so many game making innovations from the menu which is literally in first person mode to the crazy colors that make you feel like you are in space odyssey 2001.  Its kind of like a psychedelic Portal.  The little mementos on the walls are really clever and I wish I could put them up on the walls in my home.Issues:  I'm not very good at solving puzzles and I really have not been able to finish the game.  This is disappointing to me.  When I finally get around to revisiting antichamber I have typically forgotten how to go about the game and its basically like restarting.  If there was some sort of hint system for us dummies, I might like it 10/10.			"

												This game is not meant to be described into words. But into emotions and ideas. It has made me feel smarter just playing it, and made me think of concepts I didnt decide to think of. This game WILL ruin other games for you! A definate must play if youre into a Portal-esk mind set. The concepts while playing are very uniqe for as far as i can tell, and are great mind melters on your idea of ""reality"". Although I had beat it in about 8 hours, and I wish the game was longer for me to enjoy thinking REALLY FREAKING HARD about what I am doing, it was well worth the money and time. YOU MUST NOT watch any videos on it, it does not feel the same at all and is very cheaty c;. I HIGHLY reccomend this game to ANYONE, but the extreme thinkers will apreciate this more in my opinion.

												This game will REALLY mess with your head, as it does not obey the basic principles of 3D space: you can have halways that wrap around themselves or rooms that exist in the same cartesian coortinades as another room you visited. So you end up tracing ""paths"" more than physical location. Even how you look at the walls, and what direction you face while you walk, determine what will happen in many cases. The game's simple mechanics are used and usable in very clever ways that will keep you scratching your head for a while. Even if you cheat a little with a guide you will have fun just seeing this wonderful creation unfold for yourself - even if you rob yourself of one or two ""aha!"" moments. If you can avoid it though, do :)			"

												Antichamber is a very cognitive experience, an almost perfect example of the thoughtful puzzler, abstracted away from even a framing narrative.  It's a novelty that I exulted in, one of the most beautiful states of mind that I've recently had the chance to enjoy.  You play this game by leaving all external cues behind, and you learn to move through the not-a-world by applying internally consistent rules.  Yet, for all that abstraction, it offers graceful pointers, where the lessons learned are themselves collectibles.  It is a game about the game, which is not like other games...  I love it so much;  11 hours and an absolute joy to return to.  This.... this is what finely crafted thought looks like, when it is turned into a shared world for others: Abstract Art  that I can really walk through.  It creates a monument of inquisitive perception in the mind of the player.			"

												Extremely fun puzzle game, with a very different take on the genre. I enetered this game expecting it to be akin to Portal, and while it was in some senses, they are two entirely different experiences. Portal gets you to think with...portals, and Antichamber just simply requires you to think outside the box. While it is a simple concept, some of the challenges can prove to be quite difficult.I really cant find many problems with this game. The only thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the  game can  double up on the solution to puzzles. This is quite noticable around midway through the game, when around 2-3 of the puzzles have the same solution. That being said, the sheer uniqueness of some of the other puzzles more than make up for this. Some may find that the game isn't extremely replayable. However, for me this wasn't too much of a problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed the game even on my second playthrough. Overall, amazing game, an extremely unique game to the genre, and a must-buy during sales.9/10			"

Yes, it's often compared to Portal and I'm not going to be any exception because the way you move from point A to point [who the heck knows?] feels very Portal-esque a lot of times. Anyway, it's a really fun first-person puzzler with a lot of ""rooms"" to explore and solve, each room is designed to either teach you what you can do with the tools you're given or to apply what you've learned from other rooms (or both).The only real downside is it felt like it was too short for the suggested retail price.Still, any fan of Portal can't go wrong by adding this game to their library.

												Antichamber is a first-person puzzle game. It's not like anything like you've seen before. Looking at the game screenshots you can clearly see that its graphics are awesome. But if you will buy this game, you will experience something more than just brilliant game. Throughout the game the very matter of your mind will change and you will look at things around you differrently. Every room you will encounter will require you to forget all you have learnt throughout your real life. The game itself will crush your common sense just as you will notice that there are no such thing as x, y and z axis. walking through the door can lead you to the room that was above you seconds ago. Besides messing with your brain with mind-twisting puzzles Antichamber guides you through your life with signs you can read after completing each challenge. (Shhh! Antichamber is also full of easter eggs!)  Antichamber is a clearly philosophical game as it doesn't have a plot. (Yes, that's right. You just spawn in the dark room and follow instructions how to enter the Antichamber.) The Antichamber shows the whole life cycle. For example, if at first you knew nothing about the game and the very simple element of the game puzzled you, at the end of the game even the most complex mind-breaker will not take more than five minutes to solve. Antichamber is a definite must-play.10/10			"

												I'll admit I went into this game expecting some type of Portal knock-off. I was very surprised by what I found.Right off the bat, huh no menu? No ""click any button to begin"", just in a room with a depiction of second trimester fetus....with some kind of fortune cookie caption? ""Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey.""I won't spoil anything else.You will find yourself questioning things, seeing the world from a different perspective, perhaps you'll even take something valuable away from this experience. Although this might not happen in the way you expect it to...This game not only removed me from my comfort zone it made me like it. Not in a forceful way, not by punishing me, not by rewarding me, but by simply letting me play.The music is good. A somewhat ambient theme. Controls are good and simple. I like the visual style, some might not though, view some screenshots. Lastly, if you're the kind of person who plays to win, or can't just let go and immerse yourself in a game, I wouldn't recommend this for you.Everyone else, BUY THIS GAME!!			"

												My loco, lo recomiento, me encantarion los puzzles, lindo nivel de dificultad. Lo único que me molesto un poco es el excesivo uso del color blanco, me hacia doler los ojos.Update:Un juego que rompe muchas convenciones. Todo es lateral thinking, nada es lo que parece a simple vista. Resolver cada puzzle da una sensación de satisfacción especial, te ""hace"" sentir especial. Muchas cosas oculta que a simple vista pasan por alto, pero al ir avanzando se hacen mas evidentes. Recomendado			"

It does everything it possibly can to mess with your head... or at least, it makes you *think* it's done everything it possibly could, until you enter the next room and something else happens to confuse things even further.Some of the mechanics can be a little inconsistent in their behaviour at times, leading to some frustrating moments, and a few times it felt like my solutions to some things cheated the system a bit -- but all the same, I highly recommend this one.

												The single best puzzle game since 'Portal 2'. Confusing, Intriguing, Captivating, and still Fun.  Very similar to Portal in its presentation (a basic white 'testing' environment), however - game play mechanics are a bit different.  The best description I've found is a cross between Portal and Minecraft. Each new puzzle 'room' forces you to re evaluate what is being presented versus what is possible, forcing you to constantly re-analyze your possibilities. Walkthroughs are not recommended, just patience - as leaving the game to come back with fresh eyes is the BEST way to overcome that obstacle, and reap the benefits of being proud at your own abilities. Sound FX are good and interesting, providing environmental specific background noise, but it is not intrusive. There are no themes to sing along with, no dialogue to pay attention to. In the end, the audio sets a relaxing, unobtrusive mood, and nothing more. Graphics are simple, yet refined. Due to the amount of individual 3d 'objects' you can have in the game at once - perhaps a simple graphic presentation is by design. It took a while, but with some effort, Ii WAS able to eventually crash the game by spawning enough objects to overwhelm my video abilities. Lots of enjoyment for any puzzle enthusiast. If you liked Portal, then this game is for you - and at the right price too!			"

												I really enjoy puzzle games, but oftentimes, they're so inspired by each other that it becomes difficult to find one that really stands out and forces you to think around problems.  That rare sort of innovation is what made Portal such a wonderful game, and the same goes for Antichamber.  It takes some time to get used to wandering around Escher-like rooms, and by the time you think you've got the mechanics figured out, the game throws entirely new challenges at you.The art style, both audio and visual, is a pleasant contrast to the challenging gameplay.  Ambient rainfall or forest sounds accompany bright, contrasting colors, helping keep you calm and focused.  Quite a nice choice for a game like this.If you enjoy games that force you to exercise your reasoning skills, Antihamber is not a game to miss.			"

The rest is just situational stuff.It also has those slightly trippy, topologically impossible space manipulations (turning 8 square 90º corners to the right)The basic mechanic of the game is a ""block gun"" as shown in the trailer, which has upgrades that might sound trivial but in fact are very useful.Sometimes, a few mechanics can get a bit broken and let you through what you weren't supposed to,but in the first playthrough, you'll basically never encounter them.

This game, oh this game, god damnit lmaoIt's like life lessons put into a progressive, ""freeway"" puzzle game,that is also a ""serious comedy"" that examplifies by itself said life lessons.For example:Fake floor -> drawing in the wall that says ""Sometimes we fall into things when we least expect it""It has some basic mechanics, and it makes great use of them. The rest is just situational stuff.It also has those slightly trippy, topologically impossible space manipulations (turning 8 square 90º corners to the right)The basic mechanic of the game is a ""block gun"" as shown in the trailer, which has upgrades that might sound trivial but in fact are very useful.Sometimes, a few mechanics can get a bit broken and let you through what you weren't supposed to,but in the first playthrough, you'll basically never encounter them.

												Antichamber may just be a perfect game. The visuals are simple but immersive, the ambience and subtle use of music brilliantly adds depth to the game, but the puzzles ... They are just exceptional. It is quite a task making a game that deliberately messes with your expectations right up to the end and yet remains internally consistent. And what a surreal ending. Antichamber is amazing.			"

												Antichamber, a game which hardly makes sense, except that sense is not required here, because all you have to really use is your brain, making your way through your ""life"".Basically this game is to teach some meanings of life, in a fun way, you have to make through various puzzles using tips used in real life, like for example: If you only think of right now, you won't have enough for later. Things that you mother and father would tell you during the course of your life.I can say that this game is not really supposed to have a story, I could say that this is mostly a game to think to solve the puzzles, and maybe learn something which is going to be REALLY useful in your life, in a fun way, until you are able to finish your ""quest"" or as it can be seen in this game, your ""life"".Graphics: I'll say that the graphic is quite simple, but yet very attractive and colorful (I love colorful games!) in some parts, and the block gun look very interesting and ironically, reverses the conditions colors I like to use specially in survival games (Blue for perfect health, Green for little damage, yellow for medium damage and red for heavy damage), being the first on the blue and the last the Red gun, as a little downside, I think most of the corridors were a little lifeless, the walls were all white, it gives you a strange feeling of lolyness, maybe it was the intention of the game (9.5/10)Story: Like mentioned before, I believe this game wasn't really made to have a story, except for learning some meanings of life in a fun way, and the player (which the appearance is unknown) must pass the challenges in his ""life"", none of the happenings made any sense at all, like, why (s)he was there, who was (s)he, and what happened in the ending (I'll avoid making spoilers). The story didn't make much sense, so I'm afraid the story will get a so so rating, but hey! Just because the story is confusing somewhat doesn't mean the game is bad! (6/10)Sound: Whoa, how I did like the sounds in the game, the sounds gave quite a good touch to the game, when you are falling at a very high speed, that good sound of the air passing on your ears, when you land, and the sounds of you moving, absorbing and firing the blocks, gave a great touch to the game, in any moment I never got tired of the sound effects, and the music was very calm, a perfect music to let the player think through the puzzles, I simply have nothing but good things to say about the sounds (10/10)Depth: Depending on how well can you think on the solution of the puzzles, the game can take quite a while to beat (I almost beat the game 100% in around 20 hours, being some of those hours idle), and having various different paths, including some deadends, if you are looking to explore everything in the game, it's going to take a while, if you are just aiming to find the exit, the game will be a bit shorter, looking at the map (there is a map of the rooms explored on the wall of the game start chamber), the game seems to have needed to have a few more rooms. (8/10)Addictiveness: Awesome, I can safely say that until I could find almost all the black signs (you can see all the black signs you found during the game on the game start chamber), I never got tired of the game, but after I've given up to find the last 5 black signs, I didn't really feel like playing again. (8/10)Difficulty: I can say that the difficulty is at it's exact point to the human mind, the challenges fits exactly accordingly to a smart person, I had to put a lot of thought through the challenges, to solve 'em, some were simple, and some you had to be more experienced and have more ""Tools"" to work them out. (7/10 = Tough)			"

												Although confusing, I find it as an attractive puzzle game. The ingame menu is unique, and the gameplay style is extraordinary. Sometimes, you really have to think before your solve. The guns that you retrieve in Antichamber give you abilities to retrieve things like blocks, and can allow you to duplicate them. The color that was put into the game fits perfectly with each step of life you take. The ambience in Antichamber goes with everything that happens, like the flying dots have pigeon sounds. This is a really great game, and it's worth spending money on.			"

												A lovely puzzle game that makes you really think outside the box, Antichamber was a very interesting experience to me. It achieves this strange yet appealing balance with its puzzles by warping our basic perceptions of space. You think there's going to be a floor there? Think again. Added to its minimalistic nature, it was a very enjoyable to play through it and see how far the puzzles would push me.The use of colors is an interesting thing in this game, in that everything is very flat. Mostly, it is black and white, but when there are colors they're colors that vibrantly pop out against the background, like neon green, or cyan blue. It gives a sense of direction at times, as well as keep the player from being visually bored. The colors also aid to accentuate the atmosphere of the game itself. In particular, there was a hallway that I had to walk through that got progressively darker, and while I knew that this game would not have any scares, I was still slightly creeped out by it. The music itself is very ambient, with many natural sounds, so most of the time you will probably feel calm as you solve the puzzles.Speaking of puzzles, you will solve most of the puzzles with a special gun given to you. It allows you to create objects such as blocks to guide your way through an area with a bottomless pit, or as a key to activate a door. However, it is limited in its use in that you need at least one source block of the color in order to use that specific color in the puzzles, and trying to get to that block can be tricky. One puzzle takes you through a hallway filled with a space that destroys any and all blocks you have, but you need to progress with that specific color block. So what do you do? The puzzles for the most part were not too challenging after you get a hang of the mechanics and begin to explore your imagination, though I admit that there were a few that were challenging enough I had to look it up.There is no story to this game. Well...saying that might be a little misleading. There is a story, but it is more like a story that many of us share. Throughout the game little inspirational life messages and lessons are scattered about, usually pertaining to the puzzles. I know some have found these a little pretentious, but I thought they were a nice complement to the task at hand, as well as a good way to reflect on my own life. It is unobtrusive, but they can give you good clues for the puzzles you are working on at the time.Overall, Antichamber was an excellent title that I enjoyed for its minimalistic design as well as puzzle uniqueness. Due to it's rather unique style, I wouldn't recommend this if you're not a really puzzle gamer because the puzzles would only serve to frustrate you. However, if you like doing puzzle platformers or just solving puzzles, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Extremely fun puzzle game, with a very different take on the genre. I enetered this game expecting it to be akin to Portal, and while it was in some senses, they are two entirely different experiences. Portal gets you to think with...portals, and Antichamber just simply requires you to think outside the box. While it is a simple concept, some of the challenges can prove to be quite difficult.I really cant find many problems with this game. The only thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the  game can  double up on the solution to puzzles. This is quite noticable around midway through the game, when around 2-3 of the puzzles have the same solution. That being said, the sheer uniqueness of some of the other puzzles more than make up for this. Some may find that the game isn't extremely replayable. However, for me this wasn't too much of a problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed the game even on my second playthrough. Overall, amazing game, an extremely unique game to the genre, and a must-buy during sales.9/10			"

												This is simply a great puzzle game. Period. There is no other way I can put it out there. This game challenges you and messes with you the most it possibly can before you either sit there either in confusion on some puzzles, or squishing your brain inside of your skull from the use of many planes within planes and switching dimensions as well. It's very unique, and the guns you can aquire only give you even more possibilities. The first time you play this, you will become perplexed and spend hours on end trying to just get to the end. Then you start to realize that you could have done it within a few minutes is when the true beauty comes to be.			"

												It's been a while since I played a puzzle game that felt as right as Antichamber did. Not mind-numbingly difficult, but it made you think hard about your abilities and asked you to use them in creative ways. On more than one occasion, I thought of an idea I figured would never work, only to find it did--sometimes hours later, after getting an improved tool that would let me execute the crazy solution I had concocted. Antichamber is a head trip that's well worth taking.			"

												Antichamber has blossomed from an Unreal Tournament 2004 project into a deceptively minimalistic puzzle game. It is an excellent addition to any gaming library thanks to its challenging puzzles and its psychological manipulation of common expectations. While the basic cell-shaded graphics may be down to the game's budget, Antichamber pulls them off brilliantly. Bright primary colours blanket areas where other games might use high quality textures, and interesting particle effects stand out as a visual cue rather than as something to be expected. This adds to the game's poignant art style, as well as making it run smoothly on less capable computers.Antichamber's gameplay mechanics switch between bending the fabric of reality and rule-oriented cube placement. Many puzzles' currencies are doled out as these collectable cubes, with different colours representing possible hints towards a solution. Other puzzles involving movement, physics, and even view orientation are welcome additions that are interspersed regularly. The pacing flows nicely between areas, and each puzzle is unique enough to stay fresh. Rooms that seem inaccessible earlier on will eventually be attainable once new techniques of manipulating cubes are discovered. While this does make for a lot of back-tracking, Antichamber's theme revolves around revisiting the impossible.Aside from teaching the basics of how to utilize its tools, the game leaves interaction with its cubed building-blocks up to the player. The imposed experiential learning leads to many “Eureka!” moments during Antichamber's journey. The game balances them perfectly with some of the more difficult challenges; each solution is just enough of an ego boost to keep spirits high before perplexing players with a new situation. Even the more stupefying tasks never seem arduous, in part because of their basic elegance but also thanks to the omnipresent musical atmosphere.Excellent sound effects are probably the main reason why Antichamber maintains such a calm ambiance. Whether splashing through a shallow pond or standing on a windy mountaintop, the sounds of nature are always present and never get tedious. This contrast between the game's claustrophobic interiors and its superb outdoor soundscape is very mentally stimulating and adds to Antichamber's aloofness. Thankfully, the oddly juxtaposed soundtrack avoids over-complicating itself, which keeps the focus on exploring and solving puzzles.Depending on how thoroughly it's completed, expect this journey to last between eight to twelve hours. Although certain puzzles are inevitably stumping, pulling through them is what makes Antichamber so satisfying to play. Its engrossing atmosphere and frequent instances of disbelief combine to form one of this generation's most appealing puzzle games.			"

												I really enjoy puzzle games, but oftentimes, they're so inspired by each other that it becomes difficult to find one that really stands out and forces you to think around problems.  That rare sort of innovation is what made Portal such a wonderful game, and the same goes for Antichamber.  It takes some time to get used to wandering around Escher-like rooms, and by the time you think you've got the mechanics figured out, the game throws entirely new challenges at you.The art style, both audio and visual, is a pleasant contrast to the challenging gameplay.  Ambient rainfall or forest sounds accompany bright, contrasting colors, helping keep you calm and focused.  Quite a nice choice for a game like this.If you enjoy games that force you to exercise your reasoning skills, Antihamber is not a game to miss.			"

												Antichamber is this borderline experimental game whose only purpose seems to be frustrating intuition-based efforts, and subverting your understanding of space. And if this opening statement sounds enticing albeit annoyingly vague and unhelpful, then it resonates with the philosophy of Antichamber - where almost nothing is as it seems at first glance. Its deceivingly plain aesthetics conceal a devious challenge that may intrigue the casual onlooker for a short time, but which can only be fully conquered through no small amounts of exploration and experimentation. Sometimes you'll get a glimpse of the cogs turning inside the machine as you follow a certain path and earn your access to an entirely optional area. Oftentimes you'll be stumped, and forced to backtrack and consider a different approach. The fascination of Antichamber is in the mystery of its workings. It's a test of your curiosity, cunning, and perhaps most of all your ability to experience the unforeseen and learn from that experience. In the words of Samuel Beckett: ""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.""Antichamber may confuse or even frustrate you, but it's never disappointing. It's a mesmerizing, intricate gem of a game.			"

It also gives you advices on how to live your life, most of them are obvious things and it just kinda reminds you.It also teaches you a very important thing that is necessary these days in life.... thinking out of the box.I can only recommend it, life lessons from a game 10/10.

												If Portal's sense of humor was directed at its environment instead of its narrative.If Obsidian's developers turned their minds towards puzzles instead of point-and-click.Your steps bend space, space bends time, time bends you. The walls expand and contract and rearrange. Your memory is irrelevant, your skills and powers of logic are tested. Your ability to learn from your mistakes is emphasized. Consistency was left behind ages ago.Take the Manipulator. Take the boxes. Find the right way down through the maze, to the food, then find the exit.  Push the exit button.   If the food tastes awful, don't eat it, go back and try another way.They want the same thing that you do, really, they want a path, just like you.  You are in a maze in a maze, but which one counts?  Your maze, their maze, my maze.  Or are the mazes all the same, defined by the limits of their paths?Existence is simple: find the food, push the button, hit the treadmill.But sometimes it gets much harder.  Sometimes the food makes you sick, or you can hear nearby feet racing you, urging you on.  Sometimes the button only gets you landed right back in the beginning of the maze again, and the food won't satisfy.There is only one path and that is the path that you take, but you can take more than one path.Cross over the cell bars, find a new maze, make the maze from it's path, find the cell bars, cross over the bars, find a maze, make the maze from its path, eat the food, eat the path.

												Antichamber is a mind-bending puzzler. The closest I can get is ""it's like Portal but while tripping on at least 3 different drugs."" It defies description. Don't spoil it for yourself, don't watch Let's Plays, don't ask for help, just get it and go. Beat it in one sitting if you can; it's better that way, and assuming you don't go for 100% completion (if there even is such a thing) then it only takes about 4 hours.While some parts of the game can be a pain and some parts will cause headaches, there are only a few puzzles that you *MUST* complete to progress through the game. That said, the more you skip, the harder the remaining puzzles will be.The first time I played it was a spiritual experience. I enjoyed watching some friends struggle through the asinine challenges and watched their minds repeatedly blown. It's a brilliant exercise in thinking so far outside of the box that you escape the bounds of reality and end up back inside the box.And here's a hint: Pay very careful attention. Move slowly and take your time - you'll spot the solutions much more quickly.			"

												This is one of the toughest thumbs-up decisions I've made.  I bought this game because it looked interesting and different, and had some good reviews.  And it IS interesting.  The word ""different,"" however, does not fully convey the magnitude of its strangeness.This is a game with which I have a love/hate relationship.  I love the concept -- a game that subverts physical rules and creates its own completely bizarre and disorienting (albeit very very minimalist) world.  I love the break from conventional big-name first-person games that do nothing but show you pretty scenery in which you run around and kill people.  And I initially loved the challenge of solving these weird, brain-teasing puzzles.That is, until I started to hate it.  I hate the fact that the gameworld very very frequently loops back on itself and you find yourself solving the same puzzles that you went through quite a while ago.  Perhaps there is a way to play this game so that you avoid all of these loop-back pitfalls; I don't know.  But all too often, I'd fall through a hole that suddenly materializes, or I'd turn a corner, and I'm back at a place that I had passed a long time ago.  This is enough to make me turn off the game in utter frustration.I also hate the save-game mechanics, which are completely checkpoint-based and not controllable by the player, and do NOT let you save  wherever you want to save.  The checkpoints are too far apart, for one thing.  For another, because of the way that the game loops back on itself, and the fact that the gameworld is so completely disorienting anyway, these checkpoints are rendered fairly useless.  So I'm back at this weird eye in the wall.  For the 29th time.  Except something might be a bit different about it this time around.  You see the problem here?This game is like a practical joke on the player.  Still, after these long periods of utter frustration and downtime (quitting the game in disgust), after a few days or a week there is a strange compulsion to give it another go.  To see if any progress can be made THIS TIME.  It's masochistic in a way.  The fascinating, mindbending puzzles keep calling me back, my frustration with the game notwithstanding. I have not finished this game yet, not sure if I'll even be compelled to make it that far.  We'll see.			"

But given enough creativity and patience anything is possible. And when you get though even the simplest puzzle, boy, does it feel gratifying.

												If you liked Portal, or just puzzle games in general, buy this. It is quite the puzzle game with very counterintuitive solutions at times, and one that promotes exploration. The game will introduce some very unique puzzle pieces, without explicitly telling you what they do and why they are important. Trial and error is key!That being said, I would recommend playing this blind. Otherwise it will be a very short experience and an unfulfilling one.  "

												This is an interesting game to say the least.  To say that you have to think outside of the box to solve the puzzles presented in this game is an understatement.  Because the entire environment of the game exists in non-euclidian space there is no box to begin with, at the very least not a box in the normal sense. . .At it's heart Antichamber is about discovery: discover what is possible in the game, discover a little bit about the creators, discover a little about yourself, discover what freedom is when you don't have to worry about directions.I will let you know that there will be a lot of times you will be stuck.  Stuck with no hope at all of getting anywhere.  Stuck with no idea how you got there and no way of heading back.  The esc key is your friend.  At any time you can hit esc and jump into the lobby of the game.  From this lobby you can pick any point you've already been to to restart your adventure.  Also here, you can view all the pictures and sayings you've gathered over your exploration.Explore, think, discover, and have some fun in the process.And maybe eventually I'll make it to that blasted end!

												I give Anti-Chamber a 9/10.  I really like this gameGraphics: BEAUTIFUL!  Yet they are really not demanding at all, I can even run this on my work computers Intel HD 3000.  They are simple but the colors and patterns are just incredibleStability: Game play is smooth.  It runs on the Unreal 3 engine so everything works wellGame play:  Everything is totally original.  You will see so many game making innovations from the menu which is literally in first person mode to the crazy colors that make you feel like you are in space odyssey 2001.  Its kind of like a psychedelic Portal.  The little mementos on the walls are really clever and I wish I could put them up on the walls in my home.Issues:  I'm not very good at solving puzzles and I really have not been able to finish the game.  This is disappointing to me.  When I finally get around to revisiting antichamber I have typically forgotten how to go about the game and its basically like restarting.  If there was some sort of hint system for us dummies, I might like it 10/10.			"

												I kept Antichamber on my wishlist for several years before I finally decided to purchase it.  My decision was made based on what little gameplay I'd seen in trailers and my tendency to prefer games that think outside the box.  In that regard, Antichamber did not let me down.When I went into the game I was fully expecting not only Escher-like rooms, but also Escher-like physics.  The mechanics of the game are often unexpected and unexplained, which I sometimes found annoying, but also easy to rectify.  The draw for me as I got deeper into the game was the overarching philosophy, which I will leave unexplained so as not to spoil the game.  The game is not without its drawbacks, however minor they may be.  There is a significant amount of backtracking, because it is fairly likely you'll need one upgrade or another to discover all the secrets in a particular area, and sometimes in a particular room.  The game compensates by utilizing a very good map system which keeps track not only of which rooms you've completed and which you haven't, but also of which room you were last in before warping back to the main hub, which room you started in the last time you warped out, and what path you took to get there.  The developer was fully aware that the physics in the game allowed for various paths per room, and took the necessary measures to facilitate exploration of each path. The main issue I took with this game is an unresolvable problem with the game's settings.  There is no way to change settings for FOV and other visual options.  In most games I've played, this is more an annoyance than a serious issue, but in Antichamber, I could not play for extended periods of time without experiencing serious motion sickness.  This was more of an issue in the beginning of the game, as I was getting used to the mechanics and exploring every room to its full extent, rather than focusing on a specific puzzle, but it meant that I could only play the game for periods of 1-2 hours at at time before I had to take a break for the day.Because of the motion issues, I almost gave up after my first several hours playing the game.  However, I decided to give it another chance because I enjoyed what I had played and wanted to see more.  The hand-drawn graphic style is a nice change of pace from most other first-person puzzle games out there, and the minimalist, ambient soundtrack does a nice job of drawing you in to the otherwise alienating atmosphere.  If you can get past the issues presented by the significantly limited options and settings, do try to beat the game.  The ending sequence and significance presented within are nicely worth the effort.			"

												Antichamber is this borderline experimental game whose only purpose seems to be frustrating intuition-based efforts, and subverting your understanding of space. And if this opening statement sounds enticing albeit annoyingly vague and unhelpful, then it resonates with the philosophy of Antichamber - where almost nothing is as it seems at first glance. Its deceivingly plain aesthetics conceal a devious challenge that may intrigue the casual onlooker for a short time, but which can only be fully conquered through no small amounts of exploration and experimentation. Sometimes you'll get a glimpse of the cogs turning inside the machine as you follow a certain path and earn your access to an entirely optional area. Oftentimes you'll be stumped, and forced to backtrack and consider a different approach. The fascination of Antichamber is in the mystery of its workings. It's a test of your curiosity, cunning, and perhaps most of all your ability to experience the unforeseen and learn from that experience. In the words of Samuel Beckett: ""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.""Antichamber may confuse or even frustrate you, but it's never disappointing. It's a mesmerizing, intricate gem of a game.			"

												This game is a trip! Yes, it's often compared to Portal and I'm not going to be any exception because the way you move from point A to point [who the heck knows?] feels very Portal-esque a lot of times. Anyway, it's a really fun first-person puzzler with a lot of ""rooms"" to explore and solve, each room is designed to either teach you what you can do with the tools you're given or to apply what you've learned from other rooms (or both).The only real downside is it felt like it was too short for the suggested retail price.Still, any fan of Portal can't go wrong by adding this game to their library.

												Oh boy, what do I say? No spoilers of course.Antichamber is a puzzle game unlike literally anything you've ever known. It's got the same 'how did I not get that, I'm so dumb' feeling as Portal/Portal 2, but also has the feel of the Stanley Parable. Like the Stanley Parable, the secret of Antichamber isn't what happens, but the underlying meaning and denseness of what's going on. It's hard to explain, but that's what it's like.The Good:Antichamber is something just fantastically mental. While it has the just puzzle elements of other games like Portal, the rest of it depends on your understanding of what the bloody hell is going on. The messing of perspective and non-euclidian nature of shapes and things is totally new and bonkers. Also it looks very nice too. While not particularly graphically exiting, it does have a nice colour scheme, base white with other colours painted onto it. And the exploration of the one HUGE  level (No loading screens!) and manipulation of 'stuff' with your four guns opens possibilities. Sometimes to go fowards, you have to backtrack, get something and try again.The Bad:The puzzles can certainly be very weak. After obtaining the guns, rather than being perspective neural nightmares, they just become block puzzles. Some can be very, very difficult, so you'll either wonder around aimlessly for while for something to do, or just google the answer. And also it doesn't support some resolutions, like 1600x900. Finally, I would say for £15, I think it's a little overpriced. Maybe £10 pounds would be more reasonable.The Verdict:If you just want something new and ingenious, just buy it. While you may forget it after you get stuck on one puzzle for 1000 years, the 999 years beforehand will most likely be fantastically bonkers.			"

												So, have you ever played Portal and thought, ""You know, this game makes way too much sense."" And the only way you could make it more surreal was to do shrooms right before playing? Well THIS is the game for you! Antichamber is Portal on acid. An FPS puzzle game. BUT unlike Portal, it makes no sense. None. In portal you see the rooms change. Here, it just happens. It's like the movie Inception with dream physics. Walls and floors appear and disappear. Endless staircases. The game will tell you EXACTLY how it's going to ♥♥♥♥ with your head, and then it will still do it!			"

												hahahAHAhaaHaHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAHA!What? I don't even. There was a wall there. And now there's a pit. But that's okay, because the pit doesn't actually exist. There's an invisible floor. But also an invisible wall. Let's jump over it. Nope, the floor just fell through. I guess no jumping then. So goes the first puzzle you will encounter in this mind ♥♥♥♥.This is a fantastic puzzler. I wouldn't call it a great piece of art, but I'm sure you'd find a pool of people who would tell me I'm wrong in that regard. It did provoke some thoughts, but it also felt a little bit patronizing, so it was usually easier for me to just ignore the words and continue to work on the puzzle elements of the puzzle game.It both felt a little long, and a little short. I don't know if that makes sense, but then again, when did anything in this game make sense. Yet, it still does. I think. Somehow. Possibly.I dunno. I suggest you give it a try if you like a game that challenges your brain. And maybe also ones that challenge your patience a bit. But mostly your brain. It was a fun experience. I would do it again if I could forget all the puzzles. And I don't say that often about puzzle games. I hold them to a damn high standard.I would say worth 10$. And if you're not sure, pick it up when it's 5$. It's really a good deal of fun if sitting in contemplation is your thing.			"

												In the beginign of 2013, it was a groundbreaking achievement. Basically it changed how people play puzzle games. Four years later, we have a handfull of amazing next gen first person puzzle games, but it shoudl still be able to keep its own. Actually, it's hard to imagine somebody creating something like a sequel for this, because it would take a monumental amount of work to come up with a similar amount of new puzzle mechanics. Using the same ones would simply not work. A must for any smart-first-person-game fan.			"

												This just might be my second favorite puzzle game next to Portal 2. Everything about this game just manages to screw with your head, with logic seeming to just be defunct in the strange complex in which the game takes place. The puzzles (once you have the tools for them) force you to use what I find to be a perfect balance between logical analysis and creative guessing. I have nothing but praise for this game. 9/10, would definitely buy again.			"

												Antichamber is an incredibly fun puzzle game, just be warned, your logic has no meaning here. The game uses your 'common sense' against you, and forces you to think in new ways. It can be challenging at times and rewarding at others, and the quotes you find along the way magnify the experience and can clue you in to the solution. Overall I think this game is less about solving puzzles and more about realizing the way we naturally think, and how this can lead to oversights (if only in video games)			"

												Antichamber is in my opinion a fun puzzle platformer. Now it's puzzles aren't the generic type and with basically no direction you wander through the mind boggling maze that is the map layout with tricks and hidden things everywhere. You learn how to solve the puzzles by playing eventually leading up to the end. If you hate getting frustrated at puzzles or hitting dead ends etc don't get the game but if enjoy tough puzzles and figuring out labrynths try the game. Most games I would pick apart and at least give a few bad parts but I honestly fully enjoyed this game and despite not ever restarting and replaying the game I have kept it installed since I got it. This is usually something that would come to mind first if someone asked if I had a game I'd recommend them so I decided to recommend it here as even now I love this game.Also I understand it's not everyone's thing and some people are bound to dislike it but I'd say get your own opinion playing it instead of taking someone elses opinion if you can afford to.

												I could write ten thousand words of praise for Antichamber and still not sufficiently express how deeply I love this game.  It's a first-person puzzler in the vein of Portal and Quantum Conundrum, with a catch: surrealism.  Much of the game takes place in impossible space.  Rooms are bigger on the outside than on the inside, walking through a doorway and back lands you in a different room than the one you started in, and sometimes walking backwards is the key to moving forward.  The minimalist visual style is clean, the music is ambient and soothing, and the puzzles are works of mad brilliance.  Antichamber won't scratch an actiony itch, but fans of puzzlers and/or weird games ought to check this one out.  And wear good headphones, because seriously, that soundtrack is phenomonal.			"

												This game is phenomenal. I can't stop playing it. Without any narration, player development, or any real plot, it drew me in.  It makes you think more than most games would. The game is designed in such a way that most of the time you overthink the solution to things. The game holds your hand for the first little while and teaches you the basics, but then it throws you out. The ambience is a nice touch. It isn't just the same track throughout the whole game, it's different tracks in different parts of the game. The game is mostly non-linear and will frustrate you a lot. I would compare this game to the Stanley Parable and Portal, but a lot harder. The only thing I would like to change would have some hints as to who and where I am. Other than that, I love it.			"

												Completely mindblowing and challenging! This puzzle really tries to break your sense of logic in multiple ways, however the puzzles are interesting. While you likely will hit a roadblock occasionally, the most important thing is to avoid the temptation of looking at walkthrough. Close the game instead and try another time. You'll get some new ideas. This is how I played it and enjoyed all the experience without frustrating myself. But this game had so many awesome moments when I figured out a cool thing to do and perhaps even got in a place I wasn't supposed to get yet (the game doesn't have any artificial limitations or walls), that I would recommend to enjoy the experience for everyone. It's one of a kind.			"

												Oh boy, what do I say? No spoilers of course.Antichamber is a puzzle game unlike literally anything you've ever known. It's got the same 'how did I not get that, I'm so dumb' feeling as Portal/Portal 2, but also has the feel of the Stanley Parable. Like the Stanley Parable, the secret of Antichamber isn't what happens, but the underlying meaning and denseness of what's going on. It's hard to explain, but that's what it's like.The Good:Antichamber is something just fantastically mental. While it has the just puzzle elements of other games like Portal, the rest of it depends on your understanding of what the bloody hell is going on. The messing of perspective and non-euclidian nature of shapes and things is totally new and bonkers. Also it looks very nice too. While not particularly graphically exiting, it does have a nice colour scheme, base white with other colours painted onto it. And the exploration of the one HUGE  level (No loading screens!) and manipulation of 'stuff' with your four guns opens possibilities. Sometimes to go fowards, you have to backtrack, get something and try again.The Bad:The puzzles can certainly be very weak. After obtaining the guns, rather than being perspective neural nightmares, they just become block puzzles. Some can be very, very difficult, so you'll either wonder around aimlessly for while for something to do, or just google the answer. And also it doesn't support some resolutions, like 1600x900. Finally, I would say for £15, I think it's a little overpriced. Maybe £10 pounds would be more reasonable.The Verdict:If you just want something new and ingenious, just buy it. While you may forget it after you get stuck on one puzzle for 1000 years, the 999 years beforehand will most likely be fantastically bonkers.			"

												To start, it has a FEW similarities to Portal and Portal 2 but is unique in its own way. It mostly deals with cube excursion and teaching lessons that do not alway follow the general laws of nature. The game is something that should be played by any puzzle game fan. It definitely makes you think and promotes the idea of anything is possible and just leaves you confused sometimes but that is why you are able to work at different locations of the place when you choose. It gives you a wide variety of puzzles as well as plenty of them to solve. The gameplay is solid and enjoyable, at least if you are not stuff on the same puzzle for a hour or more. The graphics are not amazing but that was openly expressed by the developers that they did not want to distract from the experience with fancy environments or graphics. Even without flashy effects and realistic atmosphere, the game still makes a fine puzzle game. I have had no trouble with any bugs or anything that break the game so it is good all around and I recommend it to puzzle video game fans mostly but still fun more most people I would say.			"

												Set without narrative, the game is a series of puzzles designed to bend your mind.  It's filled with puzzly gimmicks, but in the way that every one seems to press forward and forward in challenging your notions of logic.  Some puzzles take hard work, some are so insanely simple that you will feel like a genius and a moron simultaneously, while enjoying every moment of it.But make no mistake, the puzzles in this antichamber are *not* linear.  Once you step in, it'll be your job to make sense of it.  Good luck.Makes my list of top 5 games of all time for its unique approach to puzzles, clever programming, lightheartedness, and TRULY enigmatic atmosphere.  Must have for puzzle lovers.			"

												What a brilliant game! It does a wonderful job teaching the player new and incredibly fun skills, giving hints without giving too much away, keeping track of progress and achievements in a unique way and making the player not just feel smart but feel like a genius! The only thing that I don't absolutely love is ... the blinding white. If the color was a little calmer, this would be one of the smartest games ever made.

												This game is possibly the best puzzle game I have ever played, if you have any interest in puzzle games at all you should pick this game up. At the very start of the game it is very difficult but as you get further into the game you understand how it works and start thinking by its rules, you start seeing easier and faster routes that you didn't even think of looking for the first time around. Outstanding and gorgeous game. Highly recommended.			"

It does a wonderful job teaching the player new and incredibly fun skills, giving hints without giving too much away, keeping track of progress and achievements in a unique way and making the player not just feel smart but feel like a genius!

												Antichamber is in my opinion a fun puzzle platformer. Now it's puzzles aren't the generic type and with basically no direction you wander through the mind boggling maze that is the map layout with tricks and hidden things everywhere. You learn how to solve the puzzles by playing eventually leading up to the end. If you hate getting frustrated at puzzles or hitting dead ends etc don't get the game but if enjoy tough puzzles and figuring out labrynths try the game. Most games I would pick apart and at least give a few bad parts but I honestly fully enjoyed this game and despite not ever restarting and replaying the game I have kept it installed since I got it. This is usually something that would come to mind first if someone asked if I had a game I'd recommend them so I decided to recommend it here as even now I love this game.Also I understand it's not everyone's thing and some people are bound to dislike it but I'd say get your own opinion playing it instead of taking someone elses opinion if you can afford to.

												Set without narrative, the game is a series of puzzles designed to bend your mind.  It's filled with puzzly gimmicks, but in the way that every one seems to press forward and forward in challenging your notions of logic.  Some puzzles take hard work, some are so insanely simple that you will feel like a genius and a moron simultaneously, while enjoying every moment of it.But make no mistake, the puzzles in this antichamber are *not* linear.  Once you step in, it'll be your job to make sense of it.  Good luck.Makes my list of top 5 games of all time for its unique approach to puzzles, clever programming, lightheartedness, and TRULY enigmatic atmosphere.  Must have for puzzle lovers.			"

												To start, it has a FEW similarities to Portal and Portal 2 but is unique in its own way. It mostly deals with cube excursion and teaching lessons that do not alway follow the general laws of nature. The game is something that should be played by any puzzle game fan. It definitely makes you think and promotes the idea of anything is possible and just leaves you confused sometimes but that is why you are able to work at different locations of the place when you choose. It gives you a wide variety of puzzles as well as plenty of them to solve. The gameplay is solid and enjoyable, at least if you are not stuff on the same puzzle for a hour or more. The graphics are not amazing but that was openly expressed by the developers that they did not want to distract from the experience with fancy environments or graphics. Even without flashy effects and realistic atmosphere, the game still makes a fine puzzle game. I have had no trouble with any bugs or anything that break the game so it is good all around and I recommend it to puzzle video game fans mostly but still fun more most people I would say.			"

												Completely mindblowing and challenging! This puzzle really tries to break your sense of logic in multiple ways, however the puzzles are interesting. While you likely will hit a roadblock occasionally, the most important thing is to avoid the temptation of looking at walkthrough. Close the game instead and try another time. You'll get some new ideas. This is how I played it and enjoyed all the experience without frustrating myself. But this game had so many awesome moments when I figured out a cool thing to do and perhaps even got in a place I wasn't supposed to get yet (the game doesn't have any artificial limitations or walls), that I would recommend to enjoy the experience for everyone.

												This game is phenomenal. I can't stop playing it. Without any narration, player development, or any real plot, it drew me in.  It makes you think more than most games would. The game is designed in such a way that most of the time you overthink the solution to things. The game holds your hand for the first little while and teaches you the basics, but then it throws you out. The ambience is a nice touch. It isn't just the same track throughout the whole game, it's different tracks in different parts of the game. The game is mostly non-linear and will frustrate you a lot. I would compare this game to the Stanley Parable and Portal, but a lot harder. The only thing I would like to change would have some hints as to who and where I am. Other than that, I love it.			"

												You take one block place it down, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT DUDE? GRAVITY? Of course, that's where you are wrong, why would there be gravity? Why would doors open? Why would falling down mean falling down? Why is down not up, left not right? Why does logic have to be logical? It doesn't. Well, in this game at least. Afterall, this is Antichamber. A game where nothing makes sense, at first. Sure, it makes sense later, kind of, if you imagine it sideways, or inside-out. A puzzler that doesn't need an solution but a puzzler that needs a puzzle. The solutions already there, or is it? Probably not, best just do both. Sure, the graphics style is a bit annoying and hurting on the eyes sometimes but you get used to it. The game is mostly based around placing blocks in positions using your magic block gun to complete puzzles (most having multiple ways to complete), gaining new mechanics to the gun as the game progresses effectively unlocking new areas that previously confused the hell out of you. Get it if you want a game that makes you think, makes you want to find all the puzzles (and attempt to solve them) and sometimes, makes you want to tear your hair out. A out of 83			"

												I have always been fascinated by seamless illogical spatial loops in video game maps, and Antichamber is a swirling labyrinth of insanity and madness. It reminded me of The Stanley Parable. You walk down a corridor and suddenly it's a different corridor. You turn around to get your bearings, and you see a totally unfamiliar area, completely different from the place you walked by only seconds ago. Repeat again and again and again. The level design is simply genius, because this feature works great with the minimalistic styling. As for the puzzles themselves, they are really clever and intrinsically rewarding, although some of them can be quite mind-bending, but it's always deeply satisfying when you manage to wrap your head around them. The only thing missing is a specific narrative, and it's a shame, because it seems like they found this amazing set of mechanics and then didn't really know what to do with it. 9/10			"

												Antichamber - игра, о которой сложно сказать что-то кроме того что она похожа на Portal под LSD. Игра разрабатывалась шесть лет и за это время успела получить двенадцать наград, а также кучу восхительных отзывов от игровых журналистов. Игроку обещают незабываемые психологические ощущения, мир с непонятной логикой, оружие умеющее создавать, уничтожать и изменять материю, а также сложные и интересные головоломки. Игра представляла собой серию комнат и главной целью было открыть их все (и уже потом взять пушку, которой beta и заканчивалась). Изюминка игры заключалась в том, что каждая разгадка сопровождалась философским размышлением, отображённым на стене и каким-то образом связанные с решённой проблемой, а путь из одной комнаты в другую был ""тернист и долог"", ибо пространство в них не является Евклидовым.

												I've no idea what actually went on in this game...So, you are this little ""The Cube"" like lab rat and have to find a way through the mace to escape. You got a series of ""guns"" you have to find in order to get more abilities, like duplicating blocks or moving blocks, which is the time consuming part.Once you got the last gun you can use the hidden exits to get to the end. The thing about this is that your straight forward thinking won't work here. Sometimes you have to look at something to turn it on. Sometimes you must not look at all. You get absolutely no hint about what you have to do, except the name of the room, maybe.All in all my brain hurts now... Completion time way too long with about 4 hours.			"

Definitely requires some patience when figuring out what to do or where to go, but if you can handle that then it's sure to make you go ""whoa"" while forcing you to change your way of thinking about things using puzzle mechanics and rules you've likely never seen before in other games.

												Absolute brilliant piece of art. I have replayed the game a couple of times and it never gets old being puzzled by newer sections you might have glanced over the first few times. It's even better when you show the game to people who have never seen it before. The atmosphere itself is great and the game leaves it to you to experiment around.Absolutely love it and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice novel mind bending puzzle game.			"

												Okay... Where to begin. I am not a fan of puzzle games but this is amazing. The grahpics and the abstract...everything...made it a very nice game experience. Even after the end there is still more to explore. In-game game devlopement pictures and creators' notes...

												Antichamber is an incredibly fun puzzle game, just be warned, your logic has no meaning here. The game uses your 'common sense' against you, and forces you to think in new ways. It can be challenging at times and rewarding at others, and the quotes you find along the way magnify the experience and can clue you in to the solution. Overall I think this game is less about solving puzzles and more about realizing the way we naturally think, and how this can lead to oversights (if only in video games)			"

												This game truly is amazing.  I've always enjoyed games that bend physics, logic and perception, but simply none of them have done as well as Antichamber.  The entire game is a logically impossible connection of many different rooms and passageways and pitfalls that will either make you tear your hair out in frustration or scream with joy when you discover the absurd answer that needed Einstein to figure out.  Hats off to the creators of Antichamber, a game with amazing perception twists and ridiculous answers.			"

												What a brilliant game! It does a wonderful job teaching the player new and incredibly fun skills, giving hints without giving too much away, keeping track of progress and achievements in a unique way and making the player not just feel smart but feel like a genius! The only thing that I don't absolutely love is ... the blinding white. If the color was a little calmer, this would be one of the smartest games ever made. The architecture freely departs from reality, but the game invites the player to suspend their disbelief so well that not only do you not mind, you actually look forward to the rabbit holes and even getting one over on old Newton.All in all, this game made me, a very indifferent gamer, feel like a total screaming genius. Well done and both thumbs up from a pretty hard game critic! I make educational games, and I know how hard it is to teach intuitively with just the right amount of help and encouragement, challenging the player and not frustrating them. This game gets a big A plus!			"

												An unforgettable puzzle game that continually challenges your preconceptions..about everything. With a very steep learning curve, it's definitely a smart game made for smart gamers. The minimalist soundtrack of natural sounds, from bird calls to the crackling of a fireplace, really lulled me into a sense of immersion, curiosity and peacefulness. The art style of Antichamber starkly contrasts the hyperrealism of blockbuster games like Call of Duty: environments are sparse, with deliberate use of color and contours, but very little detail. Furthermore, the few visual cues available serve as hints or teach new game mechanics, even if their meaning is ambiguous at first. What I enjoyed most about Antichamber, after reading several interviews with developer Alexander Bruce, is that the game serves as an allegory for life's vicissitudes - sometimes you're up, and other times, you're down. The cartoon plaques in each of the game's rooms are captioned with pithy quotes (e.g. failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress) that serve not only advise the player about how to solve each puzzle, but also how live more gracefully. A must-play for gamers seeking a cerebral, but rewarding challenge.			"

												Antichamber is a puzzle game based around warped reality (walk through a door, turn around, the door now leads somewhere else) and moving coloured blocks to trigger switches. If you intend to play this game, the most important characteristic you need is patience. For the first half of the game I spent alot of time confused, sometimes even frustrated. I often complain about games that are too hand holdy, but I felt that Antichamber was too far on the opposite end of the scale, giving almost no indication of what I was supposed to be doing. The non linear progression didnt help, because I was often unsure if I was supposed to solve a particular puzzle now or come back later with new equipment. However the second half of the game became much clearer, and I did start to have fun. I got to the end in under 8 hours, without using any external help, so I guess the game must have done enough to teach me the rules, even if I didnt notice it was happening. Best to pick it up on sale.			"

The only thing that IS explained are the controls. Lack of explanation is usually a bad thing, but it works REALLY well for this game. This game will push you to your limit when it comes to puzzles. A first playthrough takes about 4 to 8 hours, depending on your puzzle-solving skills. If you want to get to 100% (Yes, 100% in a puzzle game) it'll take you about 8-12 hours. However, I've seen a few people do speed-runs of this game, and without using glitches, it'll take 8-10 minutes. With glitches, I think the record is 2 minutes.The only bad thing that I have to say is that the ending is a little disappointing, and it IS possible to do some sequence breaking.

												Antichamber is one of the weirdest games I have played in a long time. You start out with no idea what to do and for the most part, that's how you feel for the rest of the game. It's such a refreshing break from current triple-A games that force-feed you instructions and directions. My brother got this for me as a gift and I'm still trying to find something equally amazing to repay him. I feel like this game deserves nice things said about it, and I don't want to spoil any part of this game, so I'll just leave it with this... Play this game. I've logged something like 16 hours on the game and I think about 10 of that was just from my first playthrough where I managed to beat the game after somehow skipping about a quarter of it. Then I had to replay it for 100% completion. After that I went back and tried to beat it as fast as I could (somewhere around 15 minutes, because I watched guides), then I found out that my 100% completion wasn't actually everything in the game.Even though I know how it works and how to solve the puzzles, it's still a terrific experience and well worth purchasing, if for no other reason than to play through those moments when you know that what needs to be done is 100% impossible.Seriously, I can't recommend this game enough. Play it now.			"

And, like most first-person puzzle games, it has a conceit – some sort of fundamental gameplay mechanic that makes the game enjoyable and provides an interesting foundation for puzzles to be based off of. For example, Portal has the portal gun, and Quantum Conundrum (which, full disclosure, I haven’t played), has the dimension-shifter. Antichamber’s conceit is the world itself. You see, Antichamber’s world does not follow the standard rules of geometry. Four rights will not get you back to where you started. Hollow cubes have six insides, one from each face. And so on. You will never forget the first time Antichamber turns its world on you. It is one of the finest gaming moments I have ever experienced. And for a game that relies primarily on two colors, Antichamber is stunningly beautiful. The stark color palette only serves to enhance to the incredible feats of geometry that the game pulls. The soundtrack is similarly well-used, and what little sound design there is also follows the surreal-yet-fitting trend. If that was all the game was, it would still be a stunning experiment. But Antichamber’s puzzles are some of the best I’ve ever come across. Even the most seasoned puzzle fans will find something new to appreciate here. You will get frustrated, but only at yourself. The little hints the game provides in the form of drawings seem cryptic at first, but will make perfect sense once you figure out the solution. Things only get more intense with the introduction of what I like to call the “cube gun”, which allows you to use little voxels to open doors, use switches, et cetera.  And just when you think you’ve mastered the mechanics, Antichamber will throw something else at you. To say anything more would be to betray the best parts of the game. Rest assured, Antichamber is well worth your time and money. --- Played on Intel Core i7-920, GTX 260 w/ 1.8 GB VRAM, 10 GB RAM, from 7200 RPM HDD. No performance issues. Smooth 60 fps.			"

												One thing is for sure, try to avoid looking up anything about the game before you play it.Even at full price i easily find this game easily worth 20$.The game likes to break everything you think logically about basic first person navigation, and really urges you to think outside the box. It's like a exploring a puzzle, and the puzzle itself completly imploded and your trying to figure out this twisted, paralell katamari of confusion.If you like tripping out get it.If you like thinking get it.If you want something that's immersive yet simple get it.If you like games such as portal get it.If you like being completley confused get it.Overall this game is honestly, a work of art.

												Think Portal. Remove the banter of GLaDOS and Cave Johnson, put flashcards with messages picked from a quotes porn site but aimed to mess with your head and smirk at your approach. Take the bright and dreamy texture of Aperture and replace with vivid colors. Then take the puzzles of portal which as much hard they might be are designed to be solved and replace them with challenges mind twisting yet solvable with a ""tiny change"" of perspective.  It is a puzzle title which challenges you to keep your thinking straight. And no matter how much prepared you are, you cannot stop the game from laughing at your face from your fumbling attempt to solve it.			"

												Antichamber is like Portal's twisted and insane counterpart. It's filled with puzzles that mess with your mind and challenge your perception of reality. There's an unique in-game logic that you have to try to understand to solve some of the puzzles. Pretty much every trope is thrown out of the window here, and your expectations are constantly subverted. Antichamber is not inviting like Portal is. Antichamber doesn't want you to finish Antichamber. Even though the exit is in front of you at all times, Antichamber will do its utmost best to prevent you from getting there. Antichamber is a tease, a harsh mistress. Even though this doesn't sound inviting, you have to give this game a chance. Especially if you're a fan of Portal and you're ready for something more advanced (and downright cruel at times). One of the best games I've played in 2013.			"

												This game is Probably the most intense and Overwhelming experince of my life. From Start to finish this game is Engaging, the story is incredibly deep and spiritual and is really immersive. THe game makes u love the characters, all of em. The first 15 mins will make u cry with sad emotion and WHen u see the little girl that u smuggle she is like ur daughter but more Immersive and YOU! the main Protagonist will love her by the end and The COmbat is Incredibly immersive and deep and u will get ur socks Rocked right off with immersion, naughty dog really hit a home run on this Immersive Horror that will effect ur mind in ways u never in knew. It was like Jesus himself Made this immersive game and he looked at u just as it finished and Winked with a thumbs up and then some. Ps. this game is probably the most intense and Overwhelming experience of my life. from start to finish this game is engaging, the story is incredibly deep and spiritual and is really immersive. the game makes u love the characters. Oh waut i already said that sorry.10/10 would Replace my daughter again in this immersive Masterpiece that will get u immersed in a world That u never knew could be so close to reality and so far at the same time thats how immersive this Game is. The game has an incredibly Rich and immersive soundtrack and world and character roster and uj will love it. This game is as if Chuck lee himself came down from heaven and made it its truly a game that u must play and i believe u will get so immersed that u will forget to feed ur cat (daughter) and the game is soo cool and great that YOU! the protagonist of this immersive game will indeed be Blowin away. My favorite part of this game is when The little girl reminded me that she is not my daughter and im all like ""Youre right, ur not my daughter and i shore as hell aint your dad and we a partin ways. And then Just before u leave her u hear screaaaaming and ur like whaaat and u go back to her room and she killed a guy and he was a black guy and ur like why do that for? and shes like ""Im not a fan of the fresh prince"" and ur like ""Ur not even a fan ur a woMAN!"" thats the twist *Spoiler alert*. If i were to rate this game out of 5 it would probably be Oh and that other moment when Ur fighting the zombies and they are all scary cause if they get to clolse ur dunzo but u dont give up because just behind is the little girl that reminds u of ur daughter just after she reminds u that shes not. ANd she tells u that ur selfish because shes lost people to in this pOst apocyluptic world and ur character is like ""UR TREADING ON SOME MIGHTY THIN ICE HERE!"" and she pushes u and says ""IM NOT UR DAUGHTER IM JUST A GIRL! and ur like ""Ur right ur not my daughter and i shore as hell aind youre dad. and then some. I also Love the dramatic moments like when ur in a buidling being chased by people and u kill them and the helicopter destroys the building and u jump to the other one and that girl that dies in the start *Spoiler alert* is like ""Ur gonna miss this♥♥♥♥♥quot; and YOU! the Protagonist is like ""what♥♥♥♥♥ u aint got one white trash"" and then some. 101 dalmations outa of 5 would play again.

												I got stuck for a really long time walking down the same hallways a thousand times. Each time I thought I was finally out, I found myself walking into the room I had just exited- on the other end of the hallway. I would turn around, to see myself looking at the hallways as I had seen the first time when I walked out of that room. My mind shaken, I went once more on what I believed to be a different path- only to end up at the same room once again. I finally made it out (I have no idea how I did); and when I did, I took a huge sigh of relief, overjoyed to be freed of the nightmare of impossible hallways. I walked into the room I had just discovered, curious to see if I had finally reached the end.I found myself in the room I had started in.I had a borderline mental breakdown and started crying, shivering, and breathing panickedly while playing this game.  10/10 best mindfuk ever			"

												Antichamber is a delightfully challenging first-person brain-tease. Calling it a puzzle game feels misleading, It doesn't merely *contain* puzzles; the entire game is the puzzle, and a viscous one at that. After throwing you headlong into a bizarre and confusing environment to explore, the game gradually introduces you to new concepts and mechanics. However, it never shies away from introducing you to puzzles, gates, and dead-ends that you are not yet prepared or equipped to solve. Part of the game is learning how to overcome these obstacles. Another part is simply remembering where those obstacles are -- and how to return to them -- once you have the means to overcome them.Antichamber is one of the most enjoyably maddening games ever. You will be stumped and confused. The game expects and wants you to be stumped and confused, and will do almost nothing to help you. It's not bad design, but rather the entire point and intent of the design. It's at once incredibly devious and incredibly rewarding.I highly recommend it.			"

You really have to think outside the box to solve puzzles in this one. It's as some say a game you have to get out of your comfort zone to clear. 8/10. 'Nuff said.			"

												Antichamber is, it may come as some surprise, my Game of the Year for 2013. It bears the hallmark of its creator's idiosyncrasies and is all the stronger for it. Antichamber is one of the few truly personal games that maintains the seeping scope of a title developed by 10 times as many people. The puzzles are on the whole taxing, but fair - which I find to be a rare gift in a cohort crowded with either too-simple telegraphing or obscurantist head-scratchers. Antichamber respects the players mind and their heart, and the more I played it the more I felt I came to know Alex and the way he thinks and feels, through the game. It is a singular achievement, and though I give him crap for how long it took to develop, the way the game shines with an incredible degree of polish is extraordinary. Well done Alex, this game is a triumph.			"

												Antichamber is a delightfully challenging first-person brain-tease. Calling it a puzzle game feels misleading, It doesn't merely *contain* puzzles; the entire game is the puzzle, and a viscous one at that. After throwing you headlong into a bizarre and confusing environment to explore, the game gradually introduces you to new concepts and mechanics. However, it never shies away from introducing you to puzzles, gates, and dead-ends that you are not yet prepared or equipped to solve. Part of the game is learning how to overcome these obstacles. Another part is simply remembering where those obstacles are -- and how to return to them -- once you have the means to overcome them.Antichamber is one of the most enjoyably maddening games ever. You will be stumped and confused. The game expects and wants you to be stumped and confused, and will do almost nothing to help you. It's not bad design, but rather the entire point and intent of the design. It's at once incredibly devious and incredibly rewarding.I highly recommend it.			"

												This is not a game. You play a game. This is a player, and you are it's plaything. - Prepare to hate yourself for taking that one step too far and removing access to the bountiful room of cubes you created.- Prepare to laugh with joy when you figure out a useful mechanic, then scream in frustration as you can't remember how to bring the needed cubes to the room to use it.- Prepare to fall down holes.- Prepare to fall up holes.- Lose your Faith in the laws of Physics.- Lose your Faith in your Logical Reasoning Skills- Yell ""WHY WON'T YOU WORK"" at everything.- Gain Understanding of why it didn't work.- Gain Understanding of the Game.- Realise the Beauty of it all.- Win.This game is destroys you. And then rebuilds you. It's monstrously abstract puzzles will require you to bang your metaphorical head against a metaphorical wall. But then the Wall will come down, and the rush of excitement and joy in understanding is unlike any other game I've played except one:This is Dark Souls for the Brain.			"

I would not reccomend this though to people who like relaxing puzzle games as this kind of messes with your head to much to be relaxing, there may or maynot be a time limit >v> but there certainly isn't anything coming to kill you.

												This game is amazing. It uses frustration to force you to think ""outside the box"".  I know people nowadays love to call games like dear esther and thirty flights of loving an ""expierience"". But this game really is. If you manage to forget what you know about game mechanics and if you are able to overcome a bit of frustration. You will be stunned how clever this game really is. There will be moments where you feel like a cheater because you think you ""tricked"" the game just to realize a few moments later that this actually was the way it meant to be done.It is genius.WARNING: Do yourself a favor and avoid all kind of spoilers. Even avoid gameplay videos becasue they might spoil you some mechanics you should (in my opinion) discover by yourself.			"

												By FAR one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. I would highly, highly recommend this game. At first glance a lot of the puzzles appear to be cheep tricks but they grow to be rather fun and most importantly, intellectually stimulating (what puzzle games are supposed to do).One of my favorite aspects of this game is that the puzzles can be solved in a plethora of ways. Where as in most puzzle games, each puzzle only has one solution: the developers intended solution. Which may be quite obscure and therefore difficult to disconcern (which DOES NOT make for a good puzzle game). Here however, there are many ways to solve a puzzle here and the skills you learn along the way are being constantly tested and reapplied in a perfect balance that neither sees intense reptition (of practicing skills) nore far reaches (i.e. learning algebra I then being expecting to jump straight into calculus).Futhermore, theres a very limited factor of aggravation- most puzzle games like to have a few puzzles that require you to do something very precise within a very limited window and when you fail, require you do to the whole puzzle over again. While there is SOME of that here, the amount that you have to redo is significantly shorter than most other puzzle games (as youll see when you learn to properly wield the transport system).My ONLY complaint about this game is that you need a pair of sunglasses to play it, really guys, turn down the brightness which you cannot do in game. The options you can configure in game are quite limited (mostly resolution), you have to go into the config files to manually rebind keys and lower the intense brightness (EVERYTHING is vibrant, VIBRANT colors, usually pure white).While not being stone set linear like most puzzle games, there are multiple paths to take especially if you cannot figure out a particular puzzle, but ultimately you have to have completed a central goal (the weapon portrayed in some of the SS's) to progress on to additional paths. So its not entirely free lance- carve your own path but, its close. As such It has very limited replayability, especially as most of the puzzles revolve around learning a central key hidden method (quite satisfying when you find them on your own). Now its not the mind f*** that all the reviewers claim it to be. However its very fun to explore, and can be sort hard to follow spacially, but you'll get it rather quick off the bat. I *HIGHLY* recommend this for puzzle game lovers.			"

You can choose different ways to solve each puzzle, leaving you with a branching ""storyline"". You can easily move around the different parts of the game, so there isn't a need to replyy the entire game just to make a new choice. Most of the puzzles are great, but sometimes they just aren't logical. Its a lot of trial and error, but still very fun.			"

												This game is amazing, seriously. One of the best puzzle games I've played. This game you acually have to think hard and figure out what to do next. You have to go through some freaking awesome puzzles. Plus, you get a gun, that shoots blocks, and the further you get through the game the better the gun gets. Sounds crazy but it's pretty cool.I really reccomend this game if you like games like Portal or if you like to be confused. You can go one direction and decide to turn around, but once you turn around you're in a completely different place. You can start over and even try a speed run, or maybe you missed a few signs and need to go look for them. This game has decent playtime, unless you're insanely pro at solving all sorts of puzzles and thinking outside of the box. Anyways, if you're thinking about getting this game, just get it.			"

												This game is very interesting. It can be confusing at times but I think that if you poke around long enough, you will notice patterns in the first apparent madness of getting your mind messed with. This game is non-linear by the way.The worst I have experienced was doing things the hard way. It bit me in the butt later. Mid way through my playthrough trying to find all areas, I was struggling to grasp what to do next. That was all fixed once I obtainedthe yellow gun and shortly after the red gun (best gun, no down side). That made things easier than what I was attempting to do.Overall, worth the time to play. This game didn't mess with me as much as I thought it would, primarily because I am very used to the concept of ""world portals"" (look it up, real entity of Portal 2) from map makers from the Portal 2 Workshop thinking they are being clever or funny with it when really they are just wasting my time, being annoying with it, and trying to confuse me. This game knows how to do such a concept right.			"

												Perhaps one of the best puzzle games ever made, Antichamber is a thrilling addictive challenging game which tests your abilities to think outside of the box to overcome the seemingly impossible. You will be faced with many challenges althrough out the game and the only way for you to survive and not loose your mind is for you to try everything. And by everything, I mean even things you wouldnt even think to try. But even with saying that, you will still come to some rooms were you just wont succeed. The game is best played if you do everything by yourself and do NOT use any help from outside sources. Although difficult to do, it is possible. If you enjoyed Portal and want even more of a challenge in a strange abstract world, and also have 5-7 bucks laying around, this is the game for you.			"

												AntiChamber is one of those games that you know will become a ""Hidden Jem."" Though it's very hard to say what kind of game it is, it's not a hardcore game, nor is it easy enough to be for super casuals, and on top of that is it a puzzle game?; platforming ? even after playing I have no idea. It takes old video game topes and completely ♥♥♥♥s with them, and this is one of the true power of game. You cant make a panting or movie like this. It would be completely confusing to have a movie with this style of non-euclidean geometry. Also thats what this game is, non-normal nor ""real"" geometry. This game, much like the Stanly Parable, breaks the fourth wall, it knows where you look, how you move. Every step is preplanned in this amazing level design, not once is your movement or possibilities taken account for. That is the power of this game.TL;DR Should I buy it?♥♥♥♥ yeah! =D This game will screw with your head and will give you a lot of fun.			"

Posted: January 20
												First off I just want to say: Wow, this game is amazing.My Basic Overview:Lets get down to it, this game is a first person puzzle game that focuses around a ""Gun"" that shoots and picks up cubes or messes with them in particularly interesting ways. Using this you go through a series of chambers and puzzles that on a scale of 1x1x1 Rubiks Cube to 92 Thousand Piece Puzzle of a white picture lies around the range of ""Do-able, but it will mess with your mind pretty hard""For a game that has such a simple mechanical design on solving puzzles I'm rather impressed on the vareity of ways it was implimented and actually provided an awesome challenge that a puzzle enthusiast like me greatly enjoyed. Even If I have beaten the game its still doesnt mean I've found every nook and cranny of the game and there's penty more to do.Breaking it down a bit:This game is best enjoyed going into it 100% blind and not knowing what to do, it gives a sense of wonder and curiosity as you try to rip apart this game, however, sometimes it seems the game is 3 steps ahead of you and sometimes things dont make sense at all, but rest assured, you dont have to make sense of everything to beat the game. Plus there are more than just one path to solving a puzzle, I'm about 99% sure i totally cheesed or broke some kind of rule while playing this game and beating the puzzles, and the fact it allows these methods that seem horribly unorthodox is a testament to the fact you can think so far out the box you're half way to the edge of the universe yet the plan can still work if you're clever enough.As mentioned before the game relys around a simple principal of using cubes that you can move around and place to solve various puzzles, be it hold open doors, activate switches, or use them as means of mobility. While completely simple the extra mechanics that come with this concept make it incredibly fun (and frustrating) to use and the game will gladly explain new mechanics as you stumble upon them, and if you dont know how to do it, then you're not ready to do so yet which adds an interesting sense of flow that can result in you feeling like you hit a dead end, but just keep one peice of advice in your mind when you play this game: Not everything is how it seems, and rules of logic are both flimsy and unstable in this game, so try EVERYTHING you can think ofDifficulty:This game may legit be difficult to the extent where it can turn some people away from it. So lets get this clear: If you're someone who doesnt like a challenge or something that forces you to break logic, then this game may not be for you. It can be difficult, and you have to be willing to go to extreme lengths and leaps of logic to complete various tasks, however the majority of puzzles I completed all at least had a solution that after I figured them out Made a ton of sense AFTER i figured them out . Some however made no sense at all, and its ok because thats what this game is about.Gamplay:The way this game is handled compared to others is what makes this my favorite puzzle game to exist. The point of this game and its playstyle is to essentially make you feel uncomfortable or dumbfounded at times. It will without a doubt no matter who you are make you go ""Well I didnt expect that"" or ""Whoah!"" at some given point in time. If not from the puzzles, then from the visuals. The game has a very minimalistic underlying design but the world you travel around in is so intense it makes up for everything.Final Thoughts:While this Review may seem kind of repetitve and simple, it was that way for a reason, I did not want to post any spoilers about the game or much information about it at all. This game gains immense amounts of value from just learning on your own and going in blind. So if you like puzzles and your mind being messed with. Play this game. You will never regret it.			"

												Incredibly overpriced, but worth it if you can pick it up for a few pounds or in an Indie Bundle. There's only a few hours of gameplay in this, including if you do all the puzzles (which is not at all necessary to finish the game). However what's there is very good, and stands out as a very unique puzzler that constantly challenges your perception of puzzles, set with a distinctive setting and aesthetic. The rooms flow seamlessly together, and their transitions are done in a way that is unlike any other puzzle game. The game is very much of the 'if you can't solve this, come back later' mentality, with the Esc button transporting you back to the starting hub at any time, allowing you to select another room to go to. In fact, some puzzles that you may have access to will not be able to be solved until others have been. The puzzles are generally entertaining, with a few being a little awkward or just plain confusing. A great little game by itself, but simply not worth the hefty pricetag, as it is neither long nor spectacular.			"

												If you haven't played Antichamber, you are missing out. This was probably one of the top games of 2013.  The gameplay and puzzles are very well done, and often make you think about 3d space in a game as you've never done so before. The hub based exploration style of the game is also something that is of stark contrast to most FPS games or puzzle games these days. This is one of those games I wish everyone had a chance to play.			"

												Nothing you've ever played before. This game will make other parts of your brain work. First steps teach you new ways of thinking, building new patterns of game-play, purposefully counter-intuitive to the way classic games are played. Then difficulty progresses and you'll be pleasantly surprised to approach Antichamber with ways you'd never have thought doing in a game. At some point, you get addicted and don't stop playing, even though you don't even know what  you're trying to achieve and why! Very clever and bold from the devs to have come up with such innovative game that competes with nowadays gaming standards.			"

												Quite simply the most refreshingly different game I've played in years!Antichamber stands like a beacon shining brightly in the mediocre mire of the modern games industry (eg: carbon-copy, modern military, zombie-themed FPS). It's a bizarre, mind-bending, phsyics-defying romp through a serious of well thought out puzzles and challenges, all wrapped in a stunningly bleak yet somehow vibrant environment.A bit like Portal 2, it's one of those games you SHOULD have in your library for a bit of mental exercise.

												Antichamber can be described as a gargantuan mindscrew. It's a first-person, puzzle-oriented Metroidvania that teaches life lessons and creates an environment that should be impossible. The Penrose Triangle kind of impossible. The game also utilizes a block-gun of sorts, that allows certain blocks to be picked up, placed, moved, or generated, although this can be slightly buggy. No plot, and a significant lack of logic make for one of the best experiences I've had with a game. Overall, this game is very good, and definitely worth purchasing.			"

												This game is very special and should not be missed. It is a puzzling, logical, and confusing, exploration game. It has puzzles that requrie you to thinks in very unusual ways. There are movable blocks, invisible path, walkways through solid objects, other things that mess with your brain. With every puzzle is a charkboard with a hint on how to solve the puzzles and a fact of life. It is unlike any other game in more ways than one and should not be forgotten.			"

												Mind blown, not due to bleeding edge graphics or a moving story, almost literally blown. Blood from your ears blown. A game specifically designed to mess with your mind and it does just that in spades. It is the sort of fresh take on first person puzzles that the original Portal was.A great, subtle, sense of humor, a surprisingly immersive yet simple world, and of course great puzzles keep the non-Euclidean setting, and often mechanic, from feeling gimmicky or stale. Also this game probably has the best set of tutorials I've ever seen, mainly because I didn't see them (Once you play you'll know what I mean).Unless puzzlers are a particular favorite or speed runs keep you coming back to a game waiting for this to go on sale is probably recommended but you should play it at some point.One note: If you are at all interested in playing this DON'T watch any game play videos or reviews. Experiencing this game without previous knowledge will make it that much better.

Deeply enjoying being a rat in a maze, if you like games like portal but a million times more confuzing and without rules AT ALL (so not like portal then?) buy it. Playing this game is the only way to describe it. Definitely reccomend, great to pass the time. Game's even better when you're high too.

												This is a puzzle game that really works the mind. Now I'm stuck on a small bit for a moment so I'm giving my head a rest and to write this review. After I exited the game it felt like I was just day dreaming and that everything was going on inside my head. The game's artistic style is something that I really enjoy, it has a nice feeling to it with both vibrant colours and darkish areas. The music and sounds sort of enhance that feeling of daydreaming as well complementing the visuals. At the start you feel a mix of emotions as you don't know what really to expect (if you haven't researched the game at all like me). Things will freak you out but curiosity will get the better of you so many times in this game but it will both reward that curiosity and punish it. Navigation at first seems random and it looks like it's in a random format but once you get the hang of it you can sort of navigate around the levels. The gameplay is fun and the puzzles have a range of difficulties which I will not spoil for you. Controls are alright and pretty easy to use. Should you play this game? Yes, I recommend it. Will I continue to play this game? Once my head recovers.			"

Antichamber, --the main protagonist -- goes through overly convoluted maps as you attempt to traverse the never ending sea of white walls and eye-straining color pallets. I purchased this game in the hopes that Markiplier would play it with me, but he never did.

												One of *THE* best puzzle games in gaming history. The effort the developer put into this completely shows, and I can only pray to whatever God that allowed a game like this to exist for an Antichamber 2 to come out. It seems upon research that this is unlikely, which truly makes this game one-of-a-kind. This game completely outshines Portal 1 & 2.Do not look up the answers to the puzzles in this game. You WILL get stuck. Drop it and come back to it later. If you beat it, try to replay it in a year. This game presents a true puzzle, and a very rewarding sense of achievement once you actually progress to uncharted areas. I congratulate anybody who gets through this game, or even a 100% completion without a guide or research of any sort.TL;DR: This game is a work of art. Buy it. It's even worth it if it's not on-sale. It's ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful in every way, shape, and form, and the miniature stories related to the puzzles are the icing on the cake. I'm being 100% serious when I say this: 11/10. It's a MUST-BUY.			"

												TL;DR First person puzzle game with unique mechanics and atmospheric music. Really enjoyable. Easy 9/10Antichamber is a game where you have this one gadget* to help you travel thought this mysterious chamber. Don't be fooled, this game gets really interesting really quickly. Chambers can change without you knowing. Making 4 right turns doesn't guarantee you'll end up in the same spot. Looking at something for a while and looking back might make you see something differently. It's really unique.The tool you have initially just lets you take and place colored blocks you find and move them around. As you progress, you upgrade your tool to be able to intract with blocks slightly differently, perhaps clearing many at once or  making them move through an area. Overall, I can't stress how unique this game is and how I really want everyone to give it a shot.			"

												Let's set this straight: Antichamber is two things at once. On the one hand, it's a Metroidvania in non-Euclidean space, deliberately and often deliciously confusing to navigate. On the other, it’s a surprisingly traditional puzzle game with some great ideas, but also some extremely clumsy mechanics. Those two things rarely intersect; while there are puzzles that utilise all the freaky geometry, most of them do not, which seems a shame. If anything, the game feels a bit too easy considering the brain-melting potential it had.It’s definitely worth picking up just to experience all the funky corridor spaghetti and the occasional good puzzle, but I also feel the need to warn about the game’s often frustrating and pigheaded determination to not tell the player anything at all – particularly early on, it’s very hard to tell if you’re making any progress or just running around in circles (or indeed, if running around in circles doesn’t actually mean making progress). It’s not a particularly difficult IQ test, it’s just that someone took away the instructions sheet.			"

												Where do I even start with Antichamber?Wear headphones. It's important. Also, be prepared to be frustrated, because this puzzler is puzzling. It took me a while to get through everything, but it was worth it. I'd pay exactly what I paid for it again, and I'm glad I bought it.Antichamber is really one of a kind, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played from a first-person perspective, and I'm glad I had the chance to spend some time in this graphically enthralling, beautifully jarring mind teaser.

												One of *THE* best puzzle games in gaming history. The effort the developer put into this completely shows, and I can only pray to whatever God that allowed a game like this to exist for an Antichamber 2 to come out. It seems upon research that this is unlikely, which truly makes this game one-of-a-kind. This game completely outshines Portal 1 & 2.Do not look up the answers to the puzzles in this game. You WILL get stuck. Drop it and come back to it later. If you beat it, try to replay it in a year. This game presents a true puzzle, and a very rewarding sense of achievement once you actually progress to uncharted areas. I congratulate anybody who gets through this game, or even a 100% completion without a guide or research of any sort.TL;DR: This game is a work of art. Buy it. It's even worth it if it's not on-sale. It's ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful in every way, shape, and form, and the miniature stories related to the puzzles are the icing on the cake. I'm being 100% serious when I say this: 11/10. It's a MUST-BUY.			"

												This game is like no other. Summed up, it's like trying to take a driver's test while taking LSD, and in the end, you discover the meanings of life from a floating cube♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from the hood. You often will get stuck, wondering around the map for about 30 minutes, until you finaly solve a puzzle and your body congratulates you with a little bit of dopamine, then about ten seconds later you're stuck again. This process repeates until you find a different gun, then you feel like winner winner chicken dinner because you can solve like five more puzzles and then get stuck for another decent amount of time. The game ♥♥♥♥ed with my mind so much that even my mind now is farther in the ♥♥♥♥♥ game than I. Also something something motion sickness.10/10, would get stuck again.			"

												Similar to ""The Stanley Parable"" this is a puzzle exploration game where all you basically do is try to find new paths to take that are different or unique to what you have previously completed.The game itself is not all the ""fun"" or ""exciting"", but Antichamber does a good job of psychologically ""breaking the mould"" that other games have put onto the player.For example, when a game tells you to pick a path typically as a player you will choose one or the other. This game however likes to play mind games and will show you there is always another path. (back the way you came)Then the game gets more complicated as you progress and turns into a ""Portal Like"" game where you have a gun that can shoot blocks that you can use to hold doors open or block lasers to solve various puzzles.As an experience this game is great, especially if you enjoy watching your friends fail seemingly obvious puzzles.As a game...it's lacking on many levels. - no story- no objectives / goals- no death / failure state- not much to do besides walk around, and sold various block puzzles to get to more puzzles- no replayability once you solve everything- puzzles get extremely complicated causing the user to just stop playing after a whileIn short....This is a game you experience once, and only once. It's a great experience, and you will love it at first, and want to show your friends, however... you won't want to ever play it again, and you'll likely just forget it even exists.NOT worth $19.99 IS worth $1			"

Game DetailsComposed by: Siddhartha BarnhoornDeveloped by: Alexander BruceGenre: Puzzle-platform gameRelease Date: January 31, 2013Completionist Gameplay: 20+ HoursThe Gameplay“Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward.”To fully understand Antichamber you must first let go of the idea of object permanency. You know, the thing you learnt as a baby? If you turn around in Antichamber, the corridor behind you will have changed to something else. There are rooms that seem to exist in the 8th dimension and staircases that go in opposite directions that will take you to the same room. You can fall for ages only to end up only a meter from where you fell from. You have a block shooting gun in order to create platforms and hold doors open for you, but it doesn’t always work straight-forwardly. You’ll need excellent pattern recognising skills and you’ll have to be very good at thinking outside the box.The GraphicsAntichamber is mostly black and white with occasional bursts of rainbow colour. There are also cute posters lining the walls that give you hints on how to complete the upcoming puzzle and also give you life advice. The graphics are a little cartoony, but nothing bad.The SoundtrackThe soundtrack gets a little repetitive and annoying after a while. It’s decent, but with the added frustration of having to repeat puzzles over and over again, the combined experience makes you want to never hear those particular songs again.Overall VerdictThis is a mind-melting, frustrating puzzle game that will have you playing for hours. Antichamber is definitely worth the buy and the hours you’ll use playing it!If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group! "

												The greatest puzzle game i have played so far. At first, the game uses a lot of visual tricks and impossible structures to confuse you, and it's more of an exploration game. Then you get the blue gun, and begin completing actual puzzles. Along the way, you can also find secret areas that give great insight into the development of the game.Although this game is not very replayable, as the tricks can only have their desired effect once, i highly recommend you purchase this game if you like puzzles and illusions!

												Masterpiece is not a word that I often use to describe games, but this would have been one of them. Fantastic gameplay, extremely well made puzzles, and intensely thought provoking. There have not been many games that I couldn't put down when I started, but in a five hour straight playthrough I completed the game. This game not only gives well thought out brain teasers, but lessons every step along the way that both pertain to the game and can be taken to the real world. Antichamber is definitely one of my new favorite games.			"

												There isn't much to be said about this game that will tell you more than actually playing it will. I started playing it during a muddled time in my life and only completed it once I had escaped the pit I was trying to climb out of.This game teaches you how to think introspectively about problems and build upon the foundations of knowledge previously learned to achieve goals previously thought impossible. ""Out of the box"" is an understatement; this game will teach you a whole new way to look at the world.I'd rate it 10/10, but that wouldn't do it justice. Just be prepared to quit in frustration before reaching the finish line; the game is more about the experience than the results. A fine lesson, to say the least.			"

												I honestly couldn't suggest a better puzzle game, the combination of FPS/puzzle is something that is rarely (if at all seen with the exception of this), but wow, the simplicity yet intangible need to explore further will have you repeat the game until it is complete. Controls are very fluid, graphics are somwhat better than shown above on the gallery too! My only suggestion would be to add a non-timed mode where saves can be made at any point, but maybe that is just me since I haven't managed to complete the game yet!Overall a brilliant and unique game, well justified for the price (even more so in the sale!)

												I've played through Antichamber many times. This is but my latest run, and I'm still enjoying it. I love every bit of it. From the challenging puzzles to the inspiring messages laid throughout the game. It's absolutely wonderful. 100/10, will play again and again and again. Highly recommended.			"

												This game is a complex single player FPS puzzler, it will throw you in at the deep end with no idea what's going on. You must explore the 3D world from a first person point of view and learn the game mechanics for yourself. The best way to enjoy this game is to not have any outsider knowledge of it, but only if you are into a challenging game with interesting visuals and good exploration. This game is at first somewhat reminiscent of the Portal franchise as has a similar creepiness about it as the sci-fi world of Portal, this strangeness about the game comes from the simplicity of certain surroundings mixed with the signs in game with life morals written on them. The gameplay smooth and nice due to the game being on the Unreal Engine 3. The game's visuals are a very colourful, contrasting and vibrant, making it aesthetically pleasing to play.The game's empty feel isn't perfectly executed and doesn't feel the best, there is also minimal audio in the game; there is also only so much fun to be has from a FPS puzzler.Overall this game is one of the best indie games out there and there isn't too much bad that can be said about it.12/15 - ""Portal on crack""			"

												Note: I've played and finished this game long before I got another Steam copy for myself to get the achievements.This is such an incredible puzzle game.I would even go as far as saying that it's better than...Portal and Portal 2Ok, go ahead and bash me, I'll wait.But seriously, it is absolutely awesome. Great, deep storyline, excellent puzzles that require you to think multidimensionally and often remember some of the clues from previous puzzles and an incredible progression that allows for multiple replays, meaning that if you want to finish this game completely, you have to play through more than once.Antichamber, if you end up playing and finishing it, will blow your mind.It also has incredible atmosphere, excellent sound and music and a top notch delivery.Incredible title!

												A unique first person puzzle game. Definitely worth checking out. Do yourself a favour and don't look at any guides for the first 30mins at least.NOTE: I personally found myself feeling sick (motion?) after playing for more than 30 or so minutes at a time... but I believe this to be caused by massive expanses of solid colour and the particular character movement being so fast and smooth.

												Nearly 3 years after I first played it and it's still my favorite game of all time.Calling it a game doesn't even feel right, its more of an experience the likes of which you have never seen.To give you an idea of how powerful this game can be, I was severely depressed for 2 weeks after I finished it because I knew there wouldn't ever be anything else quite like it.If I could erase the memory of me playing it just to do it again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

												I don't often feel obliged to write reviews but this game. Wow. It has been a long time since a puzzle game has been able to confound me so easily yet not make me feel stuck. The pacing is incredible. The game is tricky, forces you not to think outside the box, but question whether the box even existed. The tweaks to the laws of physics, the colourful geometry and the cute anecdotes make this game brilliant and gripping from start to finish. Kudos Alexander Bruce. 9/10			"

												This is one of the best games i have EVER played. Very unique game which will draw you in to it's world of mind-melting puzzles with an amazing ""story"" and clever mechanics that will cause you to think you know the game, but then everything changes, drawing you in more and more with each puzzle. As you try to figure out why you're in the chamber and the mysteries that lie just beneath the surface, you will find yourself hoping that you find the end but, at the same time, hoping this amazing game won't end. We need more games that are willing to take as big of steps as Antichamber does. No matter the cost, this is truly a must-have. Thank you for creating this masterpiece!			"

												An incredible exploration of the psychology of natural puzzle solving. In real life, puzzles do not present themselves to you fully and wait for you to figure out the riddle or mathematical solution. You have to think creatively and sometimes throw things at the wall to see what sticks if you're in unfamiliar territory.So yes, what people say about you stumbling on to puzzle solutions after trying random things is absolutely true, and I think that's part of the beauty of the game.

												Honestly I don't have very much to say about this game, I think my quick sentences and opinions show very well how much I LOVE this game. The mindfuk simulator is real and AntiChamber is here to deliver it: Imagine a game where nothing can be taken for granted, you must think outside the box to solve simple problems. You should and/or must try different approaches to difficulties.Usually, when people talk about this game, 90% of the times it is said: ""The less you know about the game, the better"" and this is correct. I am not going to talk more about the game since it will ruin your experience, If you are into the game i recommend not watching any playthrough and buy this (during a sale recommended - I got mine with -90% aprox. 1,99$).Any other way, this is my 2º favourite game of all time and you should really play this aswell if you like puzzles and tripping on acid (second part not required)			"

I haven't finished this game yet, and I want it to last as long as it can, but I also want to find my way out. The only thing that ruins my experience is my 10 years old PC... I run this game at 10 FPS. I am now sad that I bought this game on a sale (85% off) because the devs deserve every cent of the full price. Only if you are not into puzzle games, you should consider your purchase, but otherwise- go for it.10/10 would get mindf***** by this game and low framerate againEDIT: Finally managed to beat the game and I can say you, that mindbanding part... you'll get used to it.

Throughout the game, you'll come across mind bending optical illusions to Portal grade puzzles. And, if you love easter eggs, then welcome to easter egg heaven, as there's TONS of easter eggs and secret places to find. I literally spent around 6 hours afterwards just finding secrets. Really, this is the first game I ever played on steam, and still is in my top three games of time. This is a mind-blowing game that will leave you with an unforgettable experience. 10 out of 10.			"

												This game is pretty darn cool. There are no enemies or allies. It's you in what feels like a surreal, impossible test chamber that goes on a long way. You can press Esc at any time to teleport back to the main room, where you have a little map that lets you pick which puzzle area you want to go to. The objective is to get different ""guns"" that let you take and place blocks. The guns look the same, but they are different colors, and those colors are hints to point you toward blocks of the same color, to let you know you can solve that puzzle now. Each new gun you get replaces the last, and you get them in order (doesn't seem possible to get them out of order if you tried).There are a variety of other puzzles which are solved using the same methods, but each becomes a -piece- of another puzzle, sort of like solving one thing in a Portal test chamber doesn't get you out of the test chamber itself, but just gives you progress. The game does have an ending, and I will admit I had to reference a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but I still enjoyed the game and will likely play it again. If you can get it for 5 bucks or so, it's great.			"

												One of the best ""Puzzle"" games i have ever played. Take everything you know about logic and throw it out the window. You can walk into a room, turn around, and you're now in a new room. If you like puzzle games and want to try something new this is the game. Original. Fun. Addictive			"

												This game is pretty darn cool. There are no enemies or allies. It's you in what feels like a surreal, impossible test chamber that goes on a long way. You can press Esc at any time to teleport back to the main room, where you have a little map that lets you pick which puzzle area you want to go to. The objective is to get different ""guns"" that let you take and place blocks. The guns look the same, but they are different colors, and those colors are hints to point you toward blocks of the same color, to let you know you can solve that puzzle now. Each new gun you get replaces the last, and you get them in order (doesn't seem possible to get them out of order if you tried).There are a variety of other puzzles which are solved using the same methods, but each becomes a -piece- of another puzzle, sort of like solving one thing in a Portal test chamber doesn't get you out of the test chamber itself, but just gives you progress. The game does have an ending, and I will admit I had to reference a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but I still enjoyed the game and will likely play it again. If you can get it for 5 bucks or so, it's great.			"

												Well, how to start?This game will put your mind to a very difficult test- you will not know where to go, desperately searching for a new path. I haven't finished this game yet, and I want it to last as long as it can, but I also want to find my way out. The only thing that ruins my experience is my 10 years old PC... I run this game at 10 FPS. I am now sad that I bought this game on a sale (85% off) because the devs deserve every cent of the full price. Only if you are not into puzzle games, you should consider your purchase, but otherwise- go for it.10/10 would get mindf***** by this game and low framerate againEDIT: Finally managed to beat the game and I can say you, that mindbanding part... you'll get used to it. It is still magical to me but I just learned how to expect the unexpected			"

												I don't often feel obliged to write reviews but this game. Wow. It has been a long time since a puzzle game has been able to confound me so easily yet not make me feel stuck. The pacing is incredible. The game is tricky, forces you not to think outside the box, but question whether the box even existed. The tweaks to the laws of physics, the colourful geometry and the cute anecdotes make this game brilliant and gripping from start to finish. Kudos Alexander Bruce. 9/10			"

												I have never felt more disappointed finishing a game as I did when I reached the end of Antichamber, if only because I will never be able to re-experience the wonderful weirdness of playing this game for the first time and being utterly lost, confused and disoriented.The puzzles are challenging and rarely straightforward. Navigating the chambers is challenging and never straightforward. You will get stuck. You will get lost. You will wander around in circles for hours. You will bang your head against the wall for hours, only to realize you know exactly where you need to go and how to manipulate the blocks to unlock the next door.If you like puzzle games, I highly recommend this one. The puzzles are fun, the mechanics are interesting, the atmosphere is incredible-- the simplistic graphics, the creepy ambient noises and music, the bizarre geometry-- it all comes together to create, in my opinion, a completely unique experience.My major complaint is that the collision with the blocks can be a bit weird. Climbing on top of a block I placed often resulted in me getting launched in a direction I did not intend to go. It could get pretty frustrating. That, and of course, it had to end. But the 8 hours it took me to reach that point were very, very well spent.			"

												An incredible exploration of the psychology of natural puzzle solving. In real life, puzzles do not present themselves to you fully and wait for you to figure out the riddle or mathematical solution. You have to think creatively and sometimes throw things at the wall to see what sticks if you're in unfamiliar territory.So yes, what people say about you stumbling on to puzzle solutions after trying random things is absolutely true, and I think that's part of the beauty of the game.

As you try to figure out why you're in the chamber and the mysteries that lie just beneath the surface, you will find yourself hoping that you find the end but, at the same time, hoping this amazing game won't end.

												Either I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing genius or this game isn't as SUPER MIND BENDINGLY CRAZY as it's been hyped up to be!It's kind of like Portal, in many ways. A first person game where you get a tool that you'll progressively learn to use in more and more kinds of ways, all for the sake of solving puzzles. After a bit of playing, you'll figure out how to 'think with portals', ie; how the game's puzzle logic works, and then it's just a question of trial-and-error'ing and applying the logic you learn to the puzzles!So despite the game not living up to the hype, it's still a fun first person puzzler, recommended for people who like those kinds of games.

												This game is pretty darn cool. There are no enemies or allies. It's you in what feels like a surreal, impossible test chamber that goes on a long way. You can press Esc at any time to teleport back to the main room, where you have a little map that lets you pick which puzzle area you want to go to. The objective is to get different ""guns"" that let you take and place blocks. The guns look the same, but they are different colors, and those colors are hints to point you toward blocks of the same color, to let you know you can solve that puzzle now. Each new gun you get replaces the last, and you get them in order (doesn't seem possible to get them out of order if you tried).There are a variety of other puzzles which are solved using the same methods, but each becomes a -piece- of another puzzle, sort of like solving one thing in a Portal test chamber doesn't get you out of the test chamber itself, but just gives you progress. The game does have an ending, and I will admit I had to reference a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but I still enjoyed the game and will likely play it again. If you can get it for 5 bucks or so, it's great.			"

												(Originally posted April 14 2014)I just finished playing through Antichamber, a ""psychological exploration game, set within an Escher-like world."" I've been meaning to play this since I picked it up in a Humble Bundle back in February, but I've been so tired lately, I didn't feel like I had the mental juice to tackle it until recently…This game really is all that and a bag of chips, and totally deserving of the high praise that it's been receiving since it's initial release over a year ago. This first–person game teaches you, step by step, the solutions to a wide variety of puzzles, and then finally, how to solve the puzzles that it DOESN'T teach you the solutions to. There were more then a few times that I thought I'd reached the end of what I could figure out, but I always managed to keep going…No, I didn't plumb this game's full depths and explore every possible avenue, but I did reach the game's ending, and feel quite satisfied with myself for doing so without any outside spoilers or help. I may have to revisit this in a few years and try to peel back another layer.			"

												Do you like puzzle games that convince you that your brain is as uselful as a potato? Your answer of course is irrelevant, Antichamber is still a great game no matter what your mental capacity is. Ambient music attempts to relax your nerves as they are constantly being tested, annoyed, and enraged while embarking on this brain melting escapade. One thing I do advise however is to buy it when it goes on sale, it's a little pricy otherwise. Nevertheless, if you want to be confused for 20 minutes, give up, try again for another 20 minutes after having a cold cup of apple juice while contemplating why you got the game, then looking up a guide to the part your stuck on, only to repeat this cycle indefinetly until you beat it, then Antichamber is the game for you.

												Very good, reasonably satisfying conclusion, the commentary isnt overbearing, though it doesnt partically add much. The main beauty is in the level and puzzle design, and general aethetic.Good stuff, if you've seen video and are like ""well that seems pretty awesome"", you're right, it is, and I'd reccomend checking it out. One note is that you should play a long first session if at all possible - like around 45min-1h, just so you get introduced to some of the directions the mechanics are going - a short experience will lead you to think there's much less to the game than there actually is.

												This game is hard to describe in words, but I'm going to try my best to do it anyways.Antichamber is an incredibly unique and vivid experience. The atmosphere pulls you into what seems is a dreamlike state, having you solve puzzles in a strange but soothing enviornment set to calming music and sound effects. As you progress farther into it, you start to have your own thoughts on what the meaning of the game truly is, while everything else around you unravels beautifully. Originally I bought this game on how psychedelic it looked, but I was not expecting this. When you first play Antichamber, forget everything you know about conventional physics and logic, and become ready to be immersed in a new world where anything is possible. This game made it to the top of my list, and probably will stay there forever. Alexander Bruce created a work of art, I give Antichamber a 10/10.			"

												Most people think this game is similar to Portal. In some ways, yes, I suppose it is. But it's also very different. The game utilises an interesting block gun mechanic which is actually really fun to use and makes for a unique puzzle experience (similar to how Portal's mechanics make it unique). Another mechanic used in this game involves, basically, thinking out of the box. One may come across a wall which isn't really as it seems. You may have to look at the picture from a different angle before you can make sense of your area. These blend together well to create a fulfilling experience that doesn't tug at your nerves and can be solved at a leisurely pace.Now, having said that, there are some points in the game which I felt to be...less of what I wanted the game to give. For example, one would have to time him/her-self at just the right time to get past the puzzle and that, I feel, removed me from the experience the other puzzles gave. It felt more like a game (which is a good thing!) but I was already satisfied with the uniqueness of simply thinking my way out of a puzzle. Adding a trivial game mechanic into it felt disjointed but these instances happened so rarely that it may simply be overlooked when taking the whole game into account.I won't spoil the story but I just have to say that it was pretty...decent. Not great by any means but not dull either. It was satisfying and open to interpretation (which, depending on perspective, is either a good or a bad thing). All in all, I felt that Antichamber was money well spent (though I got this at a very cheap price). It's an experience that most people would want to go through and I certainly didn't regret giving up my two assignments to finish the game in two days.			"

												this game is actually pretty rad. The first 20-30 minutes of the game are pretty much just a funhouse. Everything is just illusions and headgames and trippy stuff and you just figure out how to progress by doing weird things. Then it kind of gets a little lame and turns into a LOT of block puzzles. Boring block puzzles. Although as you progress even more, the block puzzles do get a lot better and a lot more difficult. sometimes too difficult and a bit frusterating. Then you'll get a lot more cool illusion funhouse kind of stuff too as you go on. There is some backtracking though and sometimes you actually can't progress without a ""powerup"" which is really lame.If you like puzzle games, you should really play this one. It was a really good time. There's no story, just wander through a really weird mystical kind of world and try to understand the weird logic it has. And if you got it in a bundle for a dollar, just play the first 20-30 minutes at least since it was a good time. Don't spoil it by looking up videos cuz honestly half the fun (all of the fun) was not knowing what to expect.			"

												Antichamber is awesome, it gives you such a massive feeling of accomplishment when you figure something out after bashing your head against it for so long (but not long enough to make you hate the game and life itself). It's actually kind of sad how accomplished I feel after solving a video game puzzle, but its at that perfect balanced difficulty level where it is extremely fun for an experienced, imaginative adult. This game is easily worth 10(or even 15) bucks to me, I have no idea what I paid for it, but I'd guess 5 bucks. The other awesome thing is just the constant introduction of new tools and methods, its like a really hard tutorial for block shooting if that was a thing, and it is a seriously beautiful game. Seriously, it looks so pretty, there is even a weird (slightly creepy, but in a misplaced era kind of way) gallery of art placed in a room of the game. I couldn't help but browse it most of the times I found myself lost and walking back through that room.The main thing you should think while playing this is, ""Just get to the next part"" don't worry about the point of the game or the game as a whole, just keep pushing and striving to make it to new rooms and you'll eventually begin to see more and more structure and even some amount of storyline in the end. Its neat.Trippy though, ♥♥♥♥ing wicked trippy.This game makes it into my top 3 games of my steam library thus far.Overall: 10/10 (It's more than I ever expected it to be and my favorite games can be tied with 10/10s, so deal with it.)

												I like puzzle games. That's who I am. The first game I started on was Portal, back when I was around 12 or 13. I loved Portal and I pre-ordered Portal 2. I love tetris, and VVVVVV(which has puzzle aspects to it). I have always been a fan of puzzle games and I believe they have the most potential to be the best games out there. Gameplay, story, you name it.So when I had heard about Antichamber, I gave it a shot, I am into puzzle games and honestly it has a really cool aesthetic. When I started I was playing on a ""totally legitimate copy"". Which as a trade off, I couldn't save. I had been saving up my spare dollars to pay for the game when a friend of mine bought it for me a week or so ago. I played it on and off, running through the motions and all that. But when I beat the game, I looked back to determine what my opinion was. I beat it around 10 minutes ago, and I must say that it is the finest puzzle game I have ever played, I sat back in my chair as I watched the credits roll by and thought, ""Holy s***, that was a d*** good game.""In conclusion/TL;DR: Buy this game. 100% worth your dollars.

												Most people think this game is similar to Portal. In some ways, yes, I suppose it is. But it's also very different. The game utilises an interesting block gun mechanic which is actually really fun to use and makes for a unique puzzle experience (similar to how Portal's mechanics make it unique). Another mechanic used in this game involves, basically, thinking out of the box. One may come across a wall which isn't really as it seems. You may have to look at the picture from a different angle before you can make sense of your area. These blend together well to create a fulfilling experience that doesn't tug at your nerves and can be solved at a leisurely pace.Now, having said that, there are some points in the game which I felt to be...less of what I wanted the game to give. For example, one would have to time him/her-self at just the right time to get past the puzzle and that, I feel, removed me from the experience the other puzzles gave. It felt more like a game (which is a good thing!) but I was already satisfied with the uniqueness of simply thinking my way out of a puzzle. Adding a trivial game mechanic into it felt disjointed but these instances happened so rarely that it may simply be overlooked when taking the whole game into account.I won't spoil the story but I just have to say that it was pretty...decent. Not great by any means but not dull either. It was satisfying and open to interpretation (which, depending on perspective, is either a good or a bad thing). All in all, I felt that Antichamber was money well spent (though I got this at a very cheap price). It's an experience that most people would want to go through and I certainly didn't regret giving up my two assignments to finish the game in two days.			"

												Antichamber is awesome, it gives you such a massive feeling of accomplishment when you figure something out after bashing your head against it for so long (but not long enough to make you hate the game and life itself). It's actually kind of sad how accomplished I feel after solving a video game puzzle, but its at that perfect balanced difficulty level where it is extremely fun for an experienced, imaginative adult. This game is easily worth 10(or even 15) bucks to me, I have no idea what I paid for it, but I'd guess 5 bucks. The other awesome thing is just the constant introduction of new tools and methods, its like a really hard tutorial for block shooting if that was a thing, and it is a seriously beautiful game. Seriously, it looks so pretty, there is even a weird (slightly creepy, but in a misplaced era kind of way) gallery of art placed in a room of the game. I couldn't help but browse it most of the times I found myself lost and walking back through that room.The main thing you should think while playing this is, ""Just get to the next part"" don't worry about the point of the game or the game as a whole, just keep pushing and striving to make it to new rooms and you'll eventually begin to see more and more structure and even some amount of storyline in the end. Its neat.Trippy though, ♥♥♥♥ing wicked trippy.This game makes it into my top 3 games of my steam library thus far.Overall: 10/10 (It's more than I ever expected it to be and my favorite games can be tied with 10/10s, so deal with it.)

You will feel real satisfaction of progressing in a game. For the first time you won't be thinking ""why am I wasting my best years on stupid video games"".10/10.

												Still one of the best puzzle games I've played. the cube gun gimmick doesn't feel too gimmicky and may get slightly tiresome, but doesn't quite get there. Fairly relaxing game too, which I like. It's also definitely one of those games where you can let the puzzle ferment in your mind, come back to play the next day, and just know what to do to solve the puzzle. Reaching the end of the game is cool too - you see all this weird stuff teasing you about the endgame, and the puzzles take such a long while, that you really want to know what's at the end. And once you get there, you feel so accomplished it's not even funny.			"

												Antichamber is a frustrating game, and I don't mean that in the way that it might sound. Its not so much frustrating in the way that a bad game or poorly designed game is, but more in a misguided or lack of potential.The game sets itself up to intentionally be a confusing and ""mind-screw"" esque experience, and while its rule-breaking asthetics are curious and clever upon first inspection, once you abandon all good logic and figure out the ""rules"" of the game world as opposed to your own, that novelty wears thin fast, especialy since the game rarely does anything particularly interesting with them. It mostly boils down to ""Hey thats not phisically possible wat?"", or ""Oh wow that was kinda weird and disorienting, but I think I get it?""The real frustration, however comes with its puzzle design. Some of them are genuinely clever and creative that can realy get your brain to think outside the box. But a lot of them are you being completely lost and lacking information simply because you don't understand. There were several cases when I had a puzzle in front of me and was unable to solve it, only to come back later and realize what the solution was simply because I knew something I hadn't before. Or, in a worse scenario, I accidentlaly ""cheated"" the system simply because I had equipment to solve the puzzle in a diferent way and hadn't learned anything.Speaking of cheating, the game sends a mixed message when it comes to the more open-ended puzzles. Several times I had completed a puzzle and was left wondering ""Wait, was I Supposed to do that?"" Its never quite clear except in a few cases when the game essentially blocks you from performing cheesy or out-of-the-box solutions to problems. Its a conflicting message, one that seems condecending, almost. Combined with the asthetics and those unhelpful ""Life advice"" Posters that only give you usefull tips AFTER you've already figured the puzzle out, it makes the game feel like it thinks its above you. As if the game is in a perpetual state of ""I know better than you, Your lowly brain can't comprehend my genius unless you prove otherwise by solving these CONFUSING AND CRAZY PUZZLES!""Not to mention the story, which is almost to vage and abstract to even mention. Something about a floating black cube that's supposed to be interesting and compelling, but just comes across as lazy and boring. I honestly felt more curiosity towards the little purple cube ""Companion"" that you occationaly bump into. That, in esscence is the biggest problem with antichamber. No matter how crazy it seems, no matter how weird and smart it looks, its ultimately a boring, pointless distraction that both demands too much and gives back too little.In short, confusion and puzzles don't mix well, and a pointlessly abstract and vague story don't captivate nearly enough.

												I have never felt more disappointed finishing a game as I did when I reached the end of Antichamber, if only because I will never be able to re-experience the wonderful weirdness of playing this game for the first time and being utterly lost, confused and disoriented.The puzzles are challenging and rarely straightforward. Navigating the chambers is challenging and never straightforward. You will get stuck. You will get lost. You will wander around in circles for hours. You will bang your head against the wall for hours, only to realize you know exactly where you need to go and how to manipulate the blocks to unlock the next door.If you like puzzle games, I highly recommend this one. The puzzles are fun, the mechanics are interesting, the atmosphere is incredible-- the simplistic graphics, the creepy ambient noises and music, the bizarre geometry-- it all comes together to create, in my opinion, a completely unique experience.My major complaint is that the collision with the blocks can be a bit weird. Climbing on top of a block I placed often resulted in me getting launched in a direction I did not intend to go. It could get pretty frustrating. That, and of course, it had to end. But the 8 hours it took me to reach that point were very, very well spent.			"

												I will recommend this game as a quick brain teaser only. The game's visual design is what intrigued me into buying the game. However as pretty it is to look at via screenshots it is equally painful when playing. The game doesn't offer much after finishing it, i spend an additional hour finding all the dead ends and while there are hidden cubes to find there is no way to keep track of how many you have found or how many are left to find without pulling up a guide. I don't regret buying it but it is not something I would purchase again.			"

												This game is a non linear puzzle game that bends your mind in ways you didn't think it could bend. This is a very good thing. If you want a challenging puzzle game and something that provokes thoughs about our world and problems we face, buy this game. I will amend that there are some control issues with the red gun but once you get the horizontal and verticle positioning makes all the difference, its all good. Overall,This is a truly fantastic game.			"

The strange white corridors and beautiful music create a unique atmosphere that keeps you playing in an almost hypnotic trance of pure logic, until you have solved just one more puzzle. And another, and another.The puzzles are just right. Hard, but not unfair, which is kind of rare for this type of game. Not as easy as the walk-in-the-park puzzles of Portal, not as hard as the brain-torture of the RHEM games.Highly recommended for fans of puzzle-adventures.			"

There are a lot of varied puzzles, from small standalone ones to ones that requrie multiple areas.This game has a lot of mind-bending puzzles, but it also has a barely adequate tutorial system.  You have to often come back to a puzzle in the future, but you don't know when.  The map also would have been more helpful if some icons where explained.  In spite of that, this game is still good.Requiring observational and analytical skills, this game is a delight to the mind.			"

It offers puzzles not of the usual types, but a whole 'what the heck do you do' over and over that's very immersive.I haven't finished it yet, but I've made some progress, it's a game where you get stuck and coming back can help you come up with a new approach.I think it really stands out as a piece of art in the puzzles, and is quite unique. The fact its visuals are compared to the excellent Portal doesn't mean the gameplay is really similar.			"

The Good:When you're just starting out and you don't know what the game expects of you there is a definite sense of wonder and satisfied surprise at the curve balls the rooms throw at you.The rooms (and puzzles within) are great. The game plays with your expectations successfully and forces you to think in creative ways. Until you get your first 'gun' and the game begins to devolve.The rooms ARE still good, however, until you get the third gun. After that point the game begins to fall apart completely in terms of impressiveness and mystery and becomes fairly repetitive - turning into a metroidvania with puzzles instead of enemies.Controls are responsive and simple although there are no rebinding options.Hitting escape to warp back to the hub lets you teleport to any room you've previously visited. It's sleek, fast, feels good, and works well. However, there's a glaring problem detailed in 'The Bad' section.There are some rooms that flat out lead to a dead end but the game always tells you to teleport back to the hub to escape. Generally the game avoids these kinds of situations completely by having rooms link back on themselves.The game does a good job of teaching the player the new mechanics with just simple button prompts painted on the walls and the obstacle in front of you serving as a means for experimentation for the player. However, there's one key mechanic with the third gun that is NOT taught or even hinted at to the player and is completely necessary to complete the game.The Bad:Sometimes you find yourself just mindlessly 'pushing buttons' without knowing what your goal is or what you should be aiming for other than pushing the buttons the game wants you to.The game punishes you near the end for trying to apply the lessons you learned earlier in the game because suddenly mechanics have been reversed.The way rooms are linked together makes it a lot harder to keep track of the rooms you have and haven't cleared (as there are a lot of one-way trips down corridors that teleport you). The map gives you NO indication of which rooms you have and haven't cleared - only showing where you've been. The map does have icons but there's no key for this map and the player just has to figure it out on their own.The rooms do all have different names to distinguish them but the names are only ever shown to you in the hub and the player is disincentivised to return to the hub unless absolutely necessary (as the next point below covers) which means that if you solve a lot of rooms in a row only to misstep and teleport back to a room at the start of the game it takes a while to figure out where you actually were to teleport back there.Rooms (solved or not) reset when you warp back to the hub or (sometimes) when you travel a certain distance. This is obviously necessary for some situations where you need a room to reset because you made a mistake. However, when you're solving a puzzle at the end of a sequence of rooms and make a mistake that causes you to warp out and back in you more often than not have to repeat the entire sequence of rooms from scratch. This also slows down your progress when you're searching for the 'next' room, as you have to re-visit old ones with new guns, and have to keep re-solving puzzles you solved hours ago. Overall this wastes a LOT of time and it would be nice if the game saved the states of completed rooms.There are cool 'bonus' rooms that are like museum exhibits (they're usually at the other side of some of the most challenging rooms or puzzles) but there's no indication you're solving a 'bonus' puzzle and finding out you just wasted a lot of time making progress that doesn't help you finish the game can be frustrating.One section puts you in a huge open area with multiple branching paths and elevations. The game gives the player absolutely no direction or objective here and expects the player to know exactly where to go and what to do.Soundtrack ranges from generic calming track such as thunderstorms, sea waves, or tropical noises to horrible ones like pigeons constantly flapping their wings in your ears while you solve a room.The options are pretty sparse: mostly just limited to resolution, fullscreen or windowed toggles, and some for mouse control. The game lacks any graphics settings but I can't see it affecting anyone, even with slow machines. The game focuses a lot of importance on color but there's no color blind options. It's a first person game but there's no way to change the FOV.Overall:I enjoyed my experience with the game until collecting the third 'gun'. At that point the player can (and sometimes must) brute force certain solutions and the game turns into a metroidvania with puzzles instead of enemies.You revisit old rooms with new abilities and have to defeat the re-spawning puzzles while using a terrible map.

 This is no Portal It might be harsh to compare this game to Portal, given that Portal isn't an Indie game, but this game shows me why Portal is such a fantastic game. While Antichamber has a great sense of exploration and you  often  sometimes feel surprised by the ingenious ideas the devs came up with, this game left me deeply frustrated. And I can give an  example  why: During the game I came to a puzzle called ""Being an Entrepeneur"" (by the way, this game doesn't have a strict route to follow). I only had the Blue Gun to my avail and I didn't even know about other guns. I mean how could I, this game doesn't really explain anything, which to some people might be the whole appeal of the game. So it appears that without the Red Gun you are not capable of solving the mentioned puzzle. But how could I know this? I don't want to look up the solutions online, so I spent half an hour in roomnot knowing that I can't solve this puzzle. After a while I gave up and went online and then it struck me. You can basically never be sure if you are ""allowed"" to solve a puzzle at any given time.Imagine having a book full of Sudokus, but half of them aren't possible to solve. This is no fun, this is gambling. (not the Vegas gambling, more like csgolotto gambling)In Portal or many other puzzle games this is a no-go. Also I feel like this game would have been a great exploration game, since the puzzles really aren't that great to begin with.So do I recommend the game? No. But nonetheless this game has some really great ideas in it and my opinion is only one of many. P.S. I'm ready for your pitchforks and torches.Edit1: Formatting			"

												After playing a some 3d puzzle games like Portal a few years back, I've been itching to find a something similar that's genuinely tough and really makes me think as a player. This game definately scratches that itch and is genuinely fun to play, but there are some pretty deeply-rooted flaws with it as well. Antichamber is an incredibly challenging puzzle game - but unfortunately some of that challenge comes in the lack of explanation of the simplest mechanics. There's some solid and challenging puzzles there that are very enjoyable, but unforunately there are a many moments when the difficultly surpasses the fun, and objectives are not always clear, which slows pacing, leading to some very frustrating moments.The blinding-white minimalistic environment and asset design is a style which fits the puzzles well and doesn't distract the player, which is a positive. The color scheme is simple, and consits of a few very bright colors. However, it is incredibly tough to look at for long periods of time.  The lack of actual light or visual smoothness on surfaces is difficult to process and understand spacially. There's also no real music or sound beyond a few ambient beach or wind noises here and there - a HUGE missed opportinuty.The other gaping flaw (and my biggest complaint) is that the game itself has little easter-egg rooms that, (while are fun to look at) are poorly scattered throughout, and bring the pacing to a disapointing halt. There is no way to tell whether solving a certain puzzle may be the path to progress or to another dead-end easter-egg room, and finding out you've wasted 20 minutes solving a completely useless puzzle while making no real progress is incredibly frustrating and annoying. And the dizzying overall layout doesn't help this in the slightest.It would have been nice to have some kind of story, something that would make the player feel compelled to continue other than just the satisfaction of winning.  The only thing remotely close to a this are little one-sentence notes which are placed on the walls occasionally. Instead of offering little hints, they're simple and on-the-nose, but the biggest problem is - the notes always come AFTER the puzzle, making them completely irrelevant and near meaningless.Now despite ALL of these flaws I just mentioned, Antichamber is fundamentally a very interesting, unqiue, and fun puzzle game. It's enganging, challenging, and will have you learn its mechanics inside and out if you want to master it. It's a little tough and times, and it'll test your patience, but it is very fun, and rewarding. That being said, I really can't recommend this game to a lot of people, simply because it's just so difficult, and not always in the ways that it should be. If you're looking for a real-head scratcher though, and you're willing to put up with it, this game might just be worth checking out - that is if you find it on sale.			"

												Not sure what the hubbub is about.  For all the hyperbole about ""OOOH IT'S SO MINDBENDING"", Antichamber is actually pretty straightforward, and quite frankly, dull.  Early on, the game has nothing to offer but a handful of obvious tricks, which you'll see through immediately.  At one point the game recreates  the Lost Woods from Ocarina of Time (NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY GUYZ).  I'm not sure why a puzzle game with absolutely no consistency is a good idea,  because it ultimately boils down to futzing around until something new happens.  I was expecting some kind of puzzle game where the laws of  physics/reality are altered in some way, but Antichamber is really a set of disjointed illusions for the first hour, until you get the BLOCK GUN.Upon finding the block gun, the ""mindbending"" aspects of the game vanish entirely and lead to an endless series of boring block puzzles.  There's  really nothing particularly clever, challenging, or interesting going on here.  Some of the early block puzzles are alright, but it quickly gets  out of hand.  One ""puzzle"" literally has you soaking up zillions of blocks to build a giant staircase like some boring version of minecraft.  It's  just tedium.Most of this is just mediocre, but Antichamber really becomes offensive when all the frustrating parts become apparent.  The dangers of having a game centered on changing the rules and warping reality jump out at you when you realize you're missing crucial information.  Here we have a game that challenges you to ""accomplish the impossible"", and ironically it's impossible to tell what IS possible.  You'll spend 10 minutes on one puzzle only to discover that some puzzles are literally unsolvable without some new gadget.  I get that the game is meant to be exploratory and somewhat confusing, but some things are explained upfront, and other things are never made clear.There's very little consistency to the puzzle design.  When a game's design depends on unintuitive logic, the challenge usually comes from discovery: observing cause-and-effect relationships so that you can extrapolate the mechanics.  Antichamber fails because the puzzles are solved upon the first observation, and since there's no consistent puzzle design, the player just stumbles along without having learned anything.  Unfortunately, the lack of direction is compounded by the winding and open-ended nature of the level design.  There's really no obvious path to follow, so you spend a lot of time hitting dead-ends, never knowing whether you're missing something, too thick  to figure out the solution, or need some new ability.And the levels branch a LOT as you move along, especially early on when you're exploring everything for the first time.  Things tend to close off  behind you, so after you pass by a dozen points-of-interest/corridors, your mental ""come-back-to-this"" list is overloaded.  It doesn't help that Antichamber is visually quite bland.  Yes, the screenshots on the store page make it look very cool, as if the game were built in Matlab, but 90% of it consists of blank, white, square corridors.  Rare splashes of color don't add much and don't distinguish different areas.  Every door is identical.  Wandering around and backtracking become doubly irritating when the ""map"" is inconsistent, sometimes showing you places you should explore, but not always.  Thus you'll spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering around trying to figure out where to go next.The irritations don't stop there.  Traveling around almost always requires you to re-solve the same annoying puzzles again and again, many of which use the equally annoying block gun.  Even worse, Antichamber has an irritating habit of warping you to some other part of the game without warning, often forcing you to teleport again to an earlier area and re-solve the same boring puzzles once more.  Again, I get that the game is supposed to be confusing, but there comes a point where it's no longer for the sake of challenge.On top of it all, there's really no ultimate goal or progression.  There's no plot or any real sense of place.  For a standard puzzle game, I normally wouldn't complain, but Antichamber is definitely reaching for something more.  There's some real effort put into the sound design.  The ambiance mostly involves odd nature soundscapes; sometimes it works but generally feels out-of-place for a game that is otherwise totally abstract.  The game also loves to bask in its own stupidity with truly awful morsels of wisdom it feeds you constantly.  In many ways, Antichamber feels like it's aiming for Portal a bit too much, including some blatant puzzle mechanics lifted directly.In the end, I really can't recommend Antichamber.  I think some folks are too easily impressed by a few, admittedly unusual, cheap tricks.  Just play Portal.  Or The Stanley Parable.  Or Echochrome.  Or anything else, really.			"

												I logged 22 minutes and it was enough to make me nauseated. The game looks interesting and it's definetely promising, but I just cant phisically play it. The extreme contrasts, bright colors and dizzying environments in a first person perspective make the game hard to the stomach. I was uncomfortable in the first five minutes, but I kept playing because I was interested. Evenually it gets really hard to take.I know that the whole concept needs the extreme looks to work, but for me that made the game unplayable, unfortunately.			"

												I've spent an unusually long amount of time trying to decide whether I would recommend this game, but ultimately I wouldn't feel very good about myself if I did.  It isn't a bad game — it's rather enjoyable and has a good sense of exploration and progress for the most part — but there are simply other games of this genre that do it so much better that I wouldn't be able to sincerely point someone to this one in particular as a standout. The minimalist art style of the game may be one of its most distinct selling points, but the impression it left felt more dull and uninspired than anything.  Where a game like Kairo has a very basic design that worked well to create a powerful and cohesive atmosphere, Antichamber's minimalism just seemed like a result of uncertainty and lack of direction.  I can't say that I think of Antichamber as a game that has its own distinct personality, and I don't see myself going back to play it again for its visual design.As far as the gameplay goes, some of the puzzles were genuinely interesting, and it was amusing to find solutions to puzzles that I was surprised I hadn't thought of before.  Many of the rooms have simple solutions that are easily overcomplicated when they're thought of in a conventional way, and it's fun to manipulate the game's different rooms to get somewhere new.  Unfortunately, the labyrinthian architecture of the game made it a chore to find the puzzles that I hadn't completed, and a large portion of my time playing the game was spent wandering around looking for the next way to go, solving the same puzzles over and over in the hope of finding another path that I had missed.  This also caused me to solve a few later puzzles in ways I wasn't supposed to and running into more dead ends.  Many of the necessary paths are ambiguous and resulted in confusion, and the game would have benefitted from more clear direction.  While I appreciate that it doesn't patronize me like many other games do, wasting my time with disorienting design can get just as annoying.  On top of all this, some of the rooms are simply time-consuming and unsatisfying to get through, and the game probably would have been stronger with some of them removed.Ultimately, Antichamber kept me occuppied for just over six hours and I don't think that I'll be playing it a second time.  For a game that costs $20, this is a disappointingly short experience, especially when considering that it didn't leave much of an impression.  If this game looks interesting to you, then I would strongly advise that you try a game like Kairo or FRACT OSC instead, as they are much stronger and more enjoyable examples of first person explorative puzzle games.
