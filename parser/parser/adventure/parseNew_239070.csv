												If you're looking for a retro style, dungeon-crawler game with roguelike elements, then Hammerwatch is the game for you. Either solo or with a 2-4 member party you hack and slash your way through 4 unique acts which have levels (and bonus levels) within them. New enemies are progressively introduced as well as having a boss level at the end of each act. There are five character classes for you to choose from (Knight, Wizard, Ranger, Warlock and Thief) and each character has its own unique trait specific to its class. With all of the above being said, the game can be quick to get repetitive unless you switch it up often with the characters and the pre-game options. (Such as, shared mana pools, no hp pick ups, no extra lives etc.) I found the game to be most fun when at its most challenging. However, even though the game is repetitive, you can definitely burn quite a good few hours with it: I've played around 60 hours and I still plan on playing more.Another problem I encountered is more of a community issue. Unless you have friends who want to play with you already or if you happen to be lucky at a certain time of day, jumping into a random game doesn't often get you very far. People are quick to just kick you instantly - which once or twice isn't so bad but I've actually given up on playing the game completely on a number of occasions because everyone that was online just kicked me. However it's not all bad, as I have made quite a few good friends that I wouldn't have had before without this game. I recommend this game to anyone wanting a fun dungeon-crawler to play that you can enable or disable the roguelike feature at will.			"

												I picked up a four pack the other day and tossed the extra copies to my friends. At one point about two hours in we found ourselves in a situation where we had to deal with one of those lurkers that shoot spikes from the ground. To give our ranger the space to kill the lurker we needed to clear away all of the giant worms that were guarding it. Our thief ran in, threw his knives to get the worms' attention, then ran back around the corner where my paladin was waiting. As the worms circled around the corner to chase our thief they ran into my sword, and while a couple managed to poison me, our priest standing behind me had his healing beam running to keep me topped off. We killed off the horde and the ranger gave us the all-clear that the lurker was dead and the rest of us joined him in the lurker's lair to clear out to the booty.It was at this moment I said over voice chat to my friends, ""This game is awesome. Do you want to know what dungeon-crawler I believe Hammerwatch is ten times better than?""My friends responded ""Diablo 3?""""Yeah, Diablo 3.""			"

												Hammerwatch is definitely a game with a lot of effort and a lot of potential. From the comfortable pixel-art visuals, to the simple Gauntlet-style gameplay, I spent a good number of hours playing just through half of the game's basic campaign with a few friends and enjoyed it. Each choosable class feels different from one another, and as you progress, you can further your abilities to defeat swarms of tougher monsters. There's a few problems with the game, such as graphic bugs here and there, but they're few and far between. Top it off with a map editor that has as much potential as a set of dev tools, and Hammerwatch is definitely worth the $10.			"

												So, I was impatient and bought Hammerwatch before I could find a 4 pack last night and now after spending a couple hours in it, I don't even care!  Game is fantastic!  It's so simple in setup, yet so god damn challenging in execution.  I find it super addicting.  There's so many game types combined here, I think that's what makes it so addicting to me.  In some aspects, it's pure hack and slash dungeon crawler.  Then you run into another type of monster, and it's a bit like a bullet hell shooter.  Then you get your exploration jones.  You get some simple puzzles.  Spike mazes.  All sorts of stuff!  They change it up a bit in that you're not gaining xp and levels, but you're hunting every shiny gold piece you can find to level up your skills, keeping it from being bogged down in stats and number crunching.  I've played just under 2 hours and I think I'm on floor 2.  My only slight concern is that everything keeps looking the same in the further levels, as in the drab green and brown pain job.  This isn't even that big of a concern though, since the exploring's done pretty well and just the sheer fact of pressing on so you can find a save state is a pretty strong drive.  I just hope there's some other even cooler environments later on!			"

												It's not perfect, but boy is it fun.  It's old-school gauntlet with a few updates (like leveling and more differentiated classes).  It's great with a few friends, the only problem is it doesn't really do add/drop of players very well.(At the request of someone who wanted to know why it doesn't do well with add/drop):You can't add or drop players in local games, which is a shame, because having a few buddies over, playing with controllers on the big screen TV is pretty much the ideal way to play this game.If I am wrong and someone has found a way of doing this, please comment and tell me how.  I asked the developers on their forum and they didn't respond.			"

												Rating: 8/10 Overview: Top down Hack and SlashThe Good+The game has 6 main characters: paladin, ranger, wizard, warlock, priest and thief. Each character has their own unique combat traits, skills and passive abilities. Playing with different characters to see how they play differently is part of the fun. Collecting gold throughout the game allows you to unlock new skills and abilities from shop vendors. +The main game is split into 4 acts. Each act contains 3 dungeon levels. Each level contains a seal that you have to unlock to fight the boss for each act. Every level on the dungeon contains secrets and hidden passage ways. Exploring and finding these secrets is rewarding.+The bonus campaign is handled differently and just as fun. This bonus campaign is much less linear and allows you travel back to previously visited levels, it is also much harder. Sadly, you cannot transfer your main character to this campaign. +The game pushes a ton of enemies on screen. The pixelated graphics work really well in that regard.     +Cool boss battles+Steam workshop support means there are plenty of custom maps you can play+The multiplayer community is still active and I was always able to find and join a game easily. The Average-difficulty achievements do not stackThe Bad- The game can get very repetitive at times. Unlike most ARPG's this game doesn't have a robust character creation making things somewhat boring after awhile. This game has no loot providing little incentive to kill all the enemies. I found myself playing in short sessions simply because the game play formula started to wear thin the farther I went along. ConclusionThis is a game you play to try out different characters that fit your play style and then kill wave after wave of enemy as you progress through the level. If that excites you then this is a game for you. This game is ARPG lite and for the most part, works very well but if you are looking for something with a bit more depth you may be disappointed with what this game has to offer. "

												TL;DR - Brilliant dungeon crawler, simple yet fairly strategic. Play with others if you can.          Choices with pernicious consequences call for sacrifices to be made from the very start of Hammerwatch. It is a rich blend of HnS and RPG. Superbly it preserves the riot of strategic elements within role playing games while maintaining non-complex arcade-like features of any good hack and slash through making use of basic skill upgrades and combat, loot usage and simple story progression alike (the patch expansion, Temple of the Sun is a bit more story orientated). Choices must be made, and self-sacrifices be willing.        An openly avid indie game collector and player, my dirty little secret is an obsession with enjoying indie co-op and multiplayer games (online and local). It's dirty and a secret (well, up till now) because I'm a sporadic multiplayer and don't consistently play with other people. Hammerwatch is of a select few which lure me out of the mole hole, blinking against the raging sun. And this is one furious Sol as people will curse you for your mistakes if not careful. Like I have mentioned, sacrifices and choices must be made and other than a secret puzzle in the game, Hammerwatch should not be played reliant on chance (unless you want a quick but painful death). Nothing here is eternal (unless you cheese or cheat for some wild reason). Though Hammerwatch has solid single player, and campaigns can be beaten at a similar difficulty level to that with any number of players in a team (2-4), it's a game which shines when you're fighting off the baddies together. It will also feel less tedious as being all alone in a dungeon can get mighty lonely, long and arduous. Co-op forces you to make choices that directly affect your teammates and may free or crush them. This makes it crucial to comprehend early on the definition of teamwork as you cannot just play as you please with friends and hope they'll clean up after you or that it won't matter as long as you keep eating fruit and meat and hoard lots of gold by cheesing between dungeon entrances (nooooo). You will literally get into altercations with friends if you do not pay attention to what you're doing and why. Gold is divided equally between each player but lives are pooled together. If you waste your lives or gold for selfish reasons your team will die. On the bright side, for such games reliant on skill, efficiency and the cost of your actions, Hammerwatch is relatively forgiving. Had it not been made so forgiving and added procedural level generation and perma death* it undoubtedly would have made a flawless roguelike. *Note: You can add challenges through the modifiers menu to make it seem similar to a roguelike with perma death at least. Crutches on the other hand aren't needed.        If you enjoy games like the Diablo series and have a fond memory of the more classic action adventure games in The Legend of Zelda series you will thoroughly enjoy Hammerwatch. I play this smashing title with my SO and expect we'll get plenty more hours than we have so far at a measly 15. There are two separate main campaigns and survival/custom modes as well. It is fun to go through the different classes to compare play tactics as they differ for each level and boss. Although my SO is rarely sold on any game I bring up (I play some odd indie games...), the moment I described Hammerwatch as dungeon crawling, he was on it in a heartbeat and never looked back. The mechanics are simple but by the end of a level, both hands will be aching like heck. This arises from the downside of this game where players are often required to press four keys together or in close succession and not much better variation from key binding to relieve this especially for some classes. Though I've only ever tried medium level so far and even on that the last level of the first campaign went a bit crazy because we had to press the bloomin' button, hard mode still sounds like great fun and will definitely be played.          On the subject of balmy levels, the uniformity of blazing energy balls, poisonous spit, spike traps beneath your feet and arrows whizzing past your head every second as well as ever spawning ticks nipping at your ankles and minibosses that don't seem so mini when clumped to excess will frequently lead you to reminisce the non-stop craziness of shoot 'em up games with lasers blazing in all directions trying to kill you. Oh yes, the shooters we'd mastered so cleverly only for being an eight year old too poor to play much else at the arcade... ah no... wait, so deprived of pocket money (from spending it all on crisps?) that we'd honed our own expertise by ever watching the screen of the older children bashing the keys like maniacs with little skill. At least the knowledge will aid us in Hammerwatch while all the bad guys focus all their energy on you, all at once. But soon enough you'll snap back from your nice little stroll down memory lane and WHAM, you'll be dead and your bodily remains will decorate the ground in a pile of fizzled heroic dungeon crawling, like a bomb blew inside you. The death reminds me of how vampires die in the HBO version of True Blood, a neat pile of gore on the floor which is quite adorable in an 8-bit influenced game such as this. The zombie-like skeletons will literally surround you in a tight circle *shivers* if your mind ever drifts and you will be mauled to death and ripped to shreds in the manner of season 5, episode 14 of The Walking Dead (RIP Noah and Aiden). Leaving more popular culture references aside, with everything considered Hammerwatch is delightfully difficult as you progress yet will never make you rage quit because it is merely too entertaining. The secret rooms and Easter eggs will also add to the fun so you can keep your eyes peeled for the walls and buttons as well, and not just kill, kill, KILLL.　　Extra Tips for Hammerwatch- Rangers are great to start off and the most versatile against enemies and traps for beginners. Personally I like warlocks as their power increase is much more intense further on, helping make swifter and heavier attacks for large mobs and swarms which more combat based classes just cannot pull off. Obviously this depends on your style of play so test everything in single player. It is also fun to try many different combinations with friends as it will change gameplay extensively. - If you're an experienced player, start off in co-op rather than flying solo. Proficient as a single player game, but with many games that have an excess of multiplayer excitement, Hammerwatch is such an addictive co-op game that you'll likely prefer it as one if you have someone you'd like to play with. It's easy to get into and forgiving at the beginning so definitely a blast for players to jump in even without knowing a thing.- Use port forwarding, Hamachi or Tunngle. Hammerwatch has local multiplayer which means you or a friend may need to host a server or you'll need to join someone else's server (hosted by them) unless you're playing alone. This requires port forwarding, which if you can do you probably wouldn't have read this far. It is handy for a lot of fantastic multiplayer games which do not offer online multiplayer. But don't fret if Googling port forwarding and not getting too far hinders your progress in having some fantastic time with friends. I'd suggest trying LogMeIn Hamachi as it is quick and easy for tech dummies (you'll need to download and create an account), and clean and efficient as long as everyone legitimately owns the game and you're not stealing someone else's connection to begin with. Tunngle is also a great option as well as is just sticking to port forwarding.　　Edited for format and note			"

												The story of Hammerwatch truly is a modern masterpiece in storytelling. As the campaign begins, the line ""The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!"" is displayed. And that's it. That's the plot. Hammerwatch isn't the type of game that really needs a plot, however. The fact that the bridge broke and there is probably no way out is actually a decent introduction to the game as a whole: a light-hearted, if not a bit shallow, romp. In addition to the campaign, there is also a wave-based defense mode and the inclusion of a level editor for creating custom levels.oing its best to harken back to classic Gauntlet, Hammerwatch is a cooperative hack-and-slash action game. There are four classes to choose from: Paladin, Warlock, Ranger, and Wizard. Each class starts with a regular attack as well as a special attack that drains a certain amount of magic points. More special attacks are eventually unlocked, though it takes a bit too long to actually earn them. In my experience, nothing comes close to the effectiveness of a Ranger since their default attack pierces through enemies - continuing its trajectory to harm even more enemies - and their bomb special attack is perfect for kiting and killing large groups of enemies at a time. t's also possible to strafe while moving, which is perhaps the most important thing to take away from this review if you buy Hammerwatch, as it’s not immediately apparent within the game. Mastering the strafe-and-attack is crucial for any class' survivability, since moving diagonally while attacking is so freaking useful.There are a handful of secrets, puzzles, and obstacles that don't necessarily require fighting at all. Hidden rooms permeate each floor, and if the player keeps an eye out they should be able to find just about all of them. Puzzles are never too difficult, and in fact sometimes they are insultingly easy. These variants do a good job of breaking up the monotonous wave-clearing gameplay that makes up most of Hammerwatch. Playing alone feels hollow, since a large part of the difficulty comes in the form of more and more of the same types of enemies being thrown at the player - a challenge that's far easier to enjoy when in the company of friends. Single-player reveals the game's shallow mechanics; movement and two attacks don't really make for the most compelling gameplay.Progression comes from a variety of vendors throughout the levels. Early on it is a very linear progression since only certain vendors are available. The first upgrade is the ability to combo, which allows players who kill at least 10 enemies in a row very quickly to gain a temporary boost to their stats. Later upgrades will build off of this, making it easier to combo and giving better benefits for comboing. By the end of the second act, players will finally have access to more special moves as well as having a little more open-endedness to their character's build.The problem is that the end of the second act is a decent chunk of game away -- especially for players going it alone. While the level design is very open-ended and non-linear, the character progression is the exact opposite and takes way too long to become interesting. It can feel like forever when slogging through the seemingly endless waves of enemies with the basic attacks, waiting for something cool or interesting to happen.This is where the bosses come in. After a pretty easy time mowing down countless enemies, the first boss steps in and SMASHES YOUR FACE INTO THE GROUND. Seriously, the difficulty shift from regular enemies to boss fights is gigantic! The bosses are quite challenging, but don't cross the line into becoming unfair (though this can easily depend on the player's class). The bosses utilize genuinely interesting mechanics for the most part and are a real blast to play through cooperatively.Besides adjusting the difficulty, there are a variety of modifications that players can include to make the game way harder or way easier, or both! Things like limiting all players to 1 HP per life, removing mana regeneration, and allowing no extra lives can make the game super difficult if that's what you're into. On the other hand, you can add infinite lives, HP regeneration, and double damage if you just want to breeze through the entire game and not worry about a thing. The amount of options, gameplay or otherwise, is really delightful and a beautiful sight to behold.Playing cooperatively can be done locally or online, the latter of which doesn't require sharing the same screen. Playing online does tend to stutter a bit, but never so much that it affects the gameplay in any meaningful way. The worst thing that seemed to happen was that it would look like my buddy got hit by those spikes, but on his end he was just fine. Just be warned ahead of time: you may need to open router ports if you want to host a game.The default controls for the keyboard are okay, but if you've got a controller you're going to want to use it. The keyboard uses WASD for movement and the arrow keys for attacks. However, the arrow keys don't attack in their respective direction; they just each perform a different attack in whichever direction the character is facing. So, the up arrow will always use the basic attack in front of the character. It can get confusing since naturally players will think that the up arrow attacks upwards, but I suspect that most people will get used to it easily enough. Plus, the controls can be remapped, so everyone can find something that works for them.The game does look very nice, as the pixel art is some of the best I've seen. It's basic enough to allow me to reminisce about the old NES days while providing enough detail and animation to really look fluid and alive. The enemy design is generally nothing special, but I love that it is immediately apparent when a stronger version of a previous enemy arrives just by looking at it. The audio is likewise great, but there is no fading in and out of music tracks; one will end abruptly and another will begin, causing a very rough and noticeable transition.The deciding factor for Hammerwatch depends on if you’re planning on playing it cooperatively. If you've got a buddy or two who would play through the game with you and you enjoy some mindless hacking and/or slashing, then it will not disappoint.As a solo venture, the game can feel boring and tedious as it starts off way too slowly, despite throwing in some interesting boss fights later on. My recommendation is that you play it with friends, chat over some third-party voice program, and forget about your worries as you mindlessly slay hundreds upon hundreds of worms and skeletons and bugs and bats.

												Much like NES Gauntlet, Hammerwatch has you playing the role of a select number of heroes set to traverse through 12 floors on a quest.There are six character classes ;Paladin ,Wizard ,Ranger ,Thief ,Priest, & Warlock. Each sporting their own normal & special attacks.Upgrading abilities & obtaining new ones come from vendors. Wiith no armor upgrades the gold & silver you find is spend only on ability & skill upgrades. Not the usual but it works with hammerwatches pacing.Each act comes with a host of traps,secrets, enemies,mini bosses and bosses alike.The music changes as well match the floors theme.There is a toggable overlay minimap, save points can be found throughout each floor & the game autosaves between floors.Up to 4 people can play via online or local with hosted servers easy to find via a lobby.Direct ip hosting is available with a host of difficulty tweaks the hoster can choose or not. No native voice chat, but ingame text exists via hitting enter button.The game comes with controller support,mod support,mod tools, & steam workshop making getting mods simple. Graphics are well done,ost is good, A.I. is challenging. For a fun game that you can enjoy with 4 people it's a must have for any co-oper.Best thing? No need to port forward for majority of people \o/. Get full price, or on sale, either way its a great fun game.			"

												9 out of 10 If you run a  HackTop  or a  CrapTop  and need a multiplayer co-op to mess with, this is your destiny.It plays like the old Gauntlet game, not the new one with updated graphics. Get this game. This does not need any crazy 2015 computer hardware. I play this game with four friends on a 2004 Dell Latitude, 2.0Ghz 4gb RAM integrated graphics, at coffee shops on the crappiest bandwidths.I have a horrible mouse for traveling so I stay away from the mouse games.This one strictly works the keys.I think it is hella fun by myself and even better with friends, Dude grab a 4 pack ASAP.You won't be disappointed. Just don't get lost in the game.Update: 6/19/2015I should have mentioned this in the original review. Because this game does not have a central server you will need to make a local server on your machine for multiplayer. It will be listed as a joinable server to the public and people will join. Please let them play and make new friends. Sometimes it is hard to find a server to play on as people will sometimes kick you for no ryhme or reason. So when you pick up this game let others play on your server. This really doesn't take away from the fact this game is a lot of fun to play, just an inconvienience.			"

												Excellent game! Has that old school rpg look while incorporating smooth and responsive modern day controls. I'm sure this is a good game to play solo. Though I'd highly recommend playing it with a friend. As any shared experience is always the more fun one. And with this game dropped down to £1.74 on winter/summer sales. There really is no reason not to treat a friend to this game (Though you're really treating yourself to a more enjoyable experience).Hammerwatch currently has six classes with ranged and/or close quarters attacks. With each having a magic spell or ability and other ones unlocking later in the game. Multiple upgrades including health, mana, armour, damage, and many more. Seven dungeons which include multiple layers and have seven challenging bosses to go with each. This game has all of the tell-tale qualities of classic dungeon crawler with a few secrets & Easter eggs thrown in there to.			"

Hammerwatch run on Windows, Mac or Linux, so everyone can join the action. The game feels amazingly epic, with charming 16 bit graphics and one of the best soundtracks of the genre. Levels aren't randomized but are extremely well made, with a lot of secrets to discover. Keep in mind that this isn't a mindless hack and slash, and it's hard. You'll need to fend a lot to survive, but that's good, 'cause it encourages the player to plan the attacks and fight with strategy, not blindly.The game it's great to play solo or with friends, and has classes different enough to please everyone. Also, the devs are active in the forums and are always listening to the players and releasing new content.You don't need to wait for a discount. Hammerwatch is worth the full price!			"

												Hammerwatch came out just a few years ago via steam's greenlight and is extremely good. It offers you exactly what you would expect from hack and slash genre plus a few extra things. I am yet to find more enjoyable game where all you do is run around and kill stuff. The secret areas are a different thing though. I believe this is my first game of its genre and I must say I enjoyed it a lot. There are 6 classes to choose from. All give you different abilities and game strategies. There are no skill trees, instead you can purchase your skills and stats from the shopkeepers during the game. There are different possible combos for every class. You will have to look for hidden doors, which is not always easy. Sometimes you have to go around 1 level a few times to actually see everything and find out if something moved due to your actions. Game keeps you in pace. Closer to the end the pace of killing enemies and you dying becomes a bit faster. I must say that the game is actually not frustrating at all. You enjoy every gold coin you find to spend on yourself.  The sound is very not friendly to new users. You have to install a program yourself, which is actually located in the files, but it does not tell you where and why. Without sound this game would actually suck. But, once you get it going it's just amazing. It makes the gameplay so much better and gives you a feel of really old game. I found a bug, when you get to special are the sound from previous area plays together with the new area's sound. Otherwise, the music is very pleasant and I have not grown tired of it at all.Graphically the game looks like it was made for SEGA during 90's, but it's still a modern game. You can actually adjust the post effects so that you game looks not even 90's but 80's. You can get a rounded yellowish screen, how about that for a change on your nice flat screen huh? Everything you see is perfectly understandable and there are no visuals artifacts because the graphics are so simple. In all, graphical solution adds up to the feel you get while playing Hammerwatch.Controlls in general are a fine, but can be a bit wonky for some classes like range for example. Shooting and walking can be a bit of nuisance sometimes. There's only like 8 buttons to push, so you should be fine with any character to be honest. Replayabilty is under question. I guess once you finish the game with every class there's not much to do unless you gather friends to play online. In the end the game is so good for the offered price. I would even say that buying the game at a full price is not going to disappoint you.			"

												A hack and slash action adventure, set in a fantasy pixel art environment. With amazing music composed by Two Feathers, plus the Online Multiplayer Co-op Adventure, this game hands down is one of my favorite pixelated dungeon crawler still to this date! IMPORTANT: This is more of a informational review that won't be going into the game-play.There are now two campaigns that you can play-through in this game.Castle HammerWatch: The first and original campaign. Recommended to playthrough at least once before moving on to other campaignsTemple of the Sun: The second campaign or Expansion campaign made by the HammerWatch developers. With lots of new mechanics compared to the first one.There are 3 different difficalty settings. Easy/Easier: Enemies do less damage and die easier.Medium: Standard difficulty.Hard: Only for very skilled players.There are now currently 6 Very unique classes all that play an important role. There is the Paladin, a melee fighter with good mobility and high defense. Wizard a ranged spell caster with good area of effect damage. Ranger a versatile fighter with long range. Recommendd for new players.Warlock a melee spell caster who can replenish health.Thief a high damage melee fighter with low defense.Priest a ranged spell caster with good defense who can heal. (Copied from the character select screen)Like I said all these classes play an important role when playing multiplayer and is recommended not to have more than one of each class, one is enough. My take on the game:I play Paladin 95% of the time and I am at the best of my game when I play as him, He is a good class to have on your team of adventures. His shield can block projectiles which can be very helpful for your teamates who don't have a shield. As the name says, the Paladin does have a healing ability, some may say that his healing ability is better than the Priest's, but that is another arguement for another day. In general the Paladin is a ""Hero"" among the other characters and I reccommend that you always have at least one Paladin on your team.  But, this is coming from some who almost always play Paladin and this is just my opinion, but remember it's your choice whether or not to have one.Conclusion:In my opinion I recommend this game to anyone who loves hack and slash action adventure games. It's an amzing game well done. And before you could argue that the price was not worth it because there was only 1 campaign but now there are two to playthrough. If you buy this game, I guarantee you will have a fun time playing it. It's one of the best hack and slash adventure games of all time in my opinion. ;)I hope you found this review helpful. It took a large amount of time to compile this information for this review.~BomberNut			"

												I don't want to give a bad review to this game, because it seemed fun enough, but it got far too droning and repetitive far too quickly. I guess games are supposed to be ""addictive"" but they're also supposed to somehow veil or eclipse the sensation that you're wasting your time, which this one failed to do after a certain point. Sorry.			"

												A while ago it was the most painful game of all time to play because you had to hammer the attack button infinitely. They put in auto attack but it was too slow to benefit. I gave up on the game and just recently installed it again to see if they fixed it and yes, now auto attack is very fast. On the surface this is one of the most amazing indie games that has ever been made with some outstanding music. However it can get pretty repetitive. The graphics remind me of a Final Fantasy NES game. The best way to describe this game is basically 8-bit Gauntlet. This game is good though, pretty much a 8-bit copy of the newer Gauntlet game with newage retro graphics. A very well made top-down dungeon shooter that I can highly recommend.Graphics 9/10Effects 9/10Controls 9/10Music 9.5/10Gameplay 8/10 (albeit somewhat repetitive)Enemy variety 3/10 (some of the least amount of enemy types I have ever seen in a game)Repetition 500/10Overall 8/10			"

												Hammerwatch is a game that feels like an old school (and intentionally looks like one) hack-and-slash game similar to Gauntlet. The story consists of one box of text at the beginning: ""The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!"" From there, your job is to kill and collect anything in your path and stay alive. When I was younger I used to play the hell out of the Nintendo 64 version of Gauntlet, it was fun when I took on the levels alone, but things really got going when a friend or three joined. Hammerwatch is similar. Due to the non-existent story, your motivation for moving forward is take your selected character from a choice of a Paladin, Warlock, Wizard and Ranger and take them to the end.Playing alone, Hammerwatch is fun enough, fighting large groups of enemies as a lone Ranger, wiping out hundreds of bugs and creatures. The first act of the game is quite lengthy, where the constant killing and exploring for secrets slowly turns into looking for the way out. Fortunately there are save points around the world so when I began to burn out I could come back later refreshed and ready to go on. There are RPG elements in the game in the form of upgrading your attacks and adding in combos. At times I forgot that I could alter my skills, as it felt way too long between finding the vendors that I can purchase the skills from. Initially you have a basic attack and a special attack that feeds off of your magic meter. With combos added you gain bonuses such as health regeneration after killing 10 enemies in short time.Going with old style pixel art, Hammerwatch pulls it off well and feels like a game you could have been playing in the 90's. The music works as well. For controls you can use the keyboard or controller. I recommend using a controller if you have one over using the keyboard. Not that the keyboard is a bad way to play, but I found dual sticks the way to go.Playing co-op can be done by sharing the same screen or online. If you can, plug your computer/laptop up to a TV or have a big screen - sharing a screen can be good fun with a group of friends together. Online is great for if your friends aren't nearby or it's hard to get people together. The online experience isn't always smooth, there is stutter at times and a few graphical hiccups but neither really impact on the game and really I can't remember the last time I played an online game that ran super smooth so it's hard to knock Hammerwatch for the same.If you feel that you are up to some level editing that is available too, you can tailor make levels that you and your friends will enjoy. If you just want to make the game harder or easier there are sliders to adjust.There's not much to dislike about Hammerwatch unless you hate having fun, it's a fun Gauntlet style game; great fun with two to four people and fun enough playing it alone. Combined with some nice 'retro' visuals and good music to quest to, with the game editor you shouldn't run out of content anytime soon.Highly Recommended "

												This game is really grindy and the archer class is the only class that doesn't get damaged as often as the warrior or wizard. You'll be picking up tons and tons of gold but when it comes to getting an upgrade you'll only have enough for one then you're back down to being poor. The game generally goes: room of monsters, pull group, spam attack, pull group, spam attack, kill monster spawner, loot room. Repeat 100 more times for the rest of the game.			"

												This game is a lot of fuuuuuuun! It's like an oldschool Gauntlet game with RPG elements mixed in. It's great for co-op gameplay, but perhaps too difficult in singleplayer. The way they balanced the different classes is quite amazing - each one has strengths and weaknesses that go beyond arbitrary mathematics. For instance, the Warlock has great AoE spells, but struggles to kill spawners, turrets, and bosses. The Ranger is great at killing spawners, turrets, and bosses from afar, but has trouble taking on enemy archers in large numbers. The Paladin can block enemy projectiles (archers? no problem!), but can't cope as well with masses of enemies and turrets. The wizard has very little health, but is great at taking out groups of enemies and their spawners, as long as he's not overwhelmed. It's a bit tough to put into words how great the variety between the classes feels, but these strengths and weaknesses are one reason why it helps to bring friends.My only gripe with the game is that the levels are all manually created (no random generation option), so they might not be as fun to play through multiple times. They're still adding content to the game, so it looks like there will be more to play in the future.  There's a level editor so the community can create additional content for it, but it's a bit more difficult to use than I expected - you can't just whip up some new levels with minimal effort.Overall, it's a great experience with friends. Fun for couch co-op or online multiplayer. Definitely worth playing, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Hammerwatch is a very addictive hack and slash, multiplayer dungeon crawler. Fun singleplayer,  Amazing  with friends! The game provides 6 classes, Paladin, Wizard, Ranger, Warlock, Thief, and Priest. Once you have you and your friend(s) playing the game, each and every one of you can pick one or the same class and just talking and killing monsters with skype is just a hilarious time. Overall it's a very unique and amazing game. Would spend another 15+ hours on this easily.			"

												I just beat this game after 27 hours, and I haven't felt that relieved to best a game in ages. Hammerwatch has all the best bits of the old 2D age of dungeon crawling, with scant few of what was terribly bad. The game will leave you to eat through droves and droves of enemies that could easily kill you in but a second if they get closer, if you're not careful the game will beat you down with it's cruel and unforgiving policy on health recovery. If you're wise and cautious, you'll be rewarded with large swathes of treasure and the satisfying feeling you get when the enemies finally crumble before your ire.I'd highly recommend this to any person enthusiastic about the ""golden ages"" of dungeon crawlers. The main campain will take at least 20 hours to clear if you search far and wide for all the secrets; and there is even an expansion offering an entire additional dungeon. The game may only sport 8 stages, but they will take more than a bit of effort to clear.			"

												a highlight of the greenlight. This game isn't super deep, you aren't going to be engrossed in a moving story, there's no beautiful graphics, there's not infinite replayability, and it's not a 300 hour campaign.... But this game's a gem in every sense of the word. Single player is nothing great, but the feeling of getting 3-4 friends for a few hours of wild and ridiculous fun is hard to replicate. The controls are smooth, the game is simple enough for a non gamer to pick up and understand, and the mayhem of dragging a few hundred monsters in a loop around your friend, only to run to them to have them surrounded on all sides... is priceless.

												I really, really, really want to thumbs up this game, but I can't. The game feels good, the atmosphere is there, but the game feels like its in early alpha. There is no ranom dungeon generation, seriously limiting replayability. This is partially made up for by the map editor, but it's just not enough. The character progression is too limited for a long playthrough and there is no inventory. I am open to the idea of innovation, an RPG without these elements, but it leaves the game bland. I wouldn't buy this game unless it's at least 75% off or there are some serious updates.EDIT: I have finished this game; I played through it using the DRM free version from Humble Bundle. v1.3 came out, it's time for a re-review, I'll check it out sometime this week.

												This game is most fun when played with 1-3 friends, but I also had a great time doing a few solo runs. I recommend playing it blind (as in unspoilered) because spoilers will take away quite a bit from the game (that's also why I keep this review short and don't talk too much about the game). There are tons of optional secrets to explore, so you probably keep finding new stuff even after completing the game a few times.As a downside, the game requires you to press many buttons to the point where it might hurt after a longer session, so keep that in mind and do a break every now and then.

												If I could give this game a thumbs-sideways, I would.  Hammerwatch is a fun game, especially if you're able to get some friends together to play, but it has a number of glaring issues that really keep it from shining and, in fact, make it frustrating or a chore to play.  To keep myself from writing a multi-page review, I'mma just do bullet points.  Though, I'll go ahead and say, this isn't a roguelike like some may say and it is barely an RPG.  It's really more kinda of a dungeon crawler or hack 'n slash.  Think of titles like the Gauntlet series.The Good-Six classes to choose from with a number of possibly upgrade paths means each run can be pretty varied.-Multiple built-in game modes:  two campaigns, an old version of the first campaign, a survival mode, and a sort of tower defense-esque mode.  ...except you have yourself instead of towers.-Online co-op play, either private or public.-An editor and Steam Workshop support means there's dozens of user-made levels to go explore, potentially increasing the replayability of the game a hundredfold.-Multiple settings for difficulty and modifiers to tweak, allowing you to customize the experience at the potential cost of not being able to earn achievements if you make it easier on yourself.-Music is pretty darn good.-Most of the time, it's pretty good about introducing hazards and monsters in ways that don't require you to die to them.-Lots of secrets to find.The Bad-Planks in the first campaign.  The things are well hidden and, if you don't get all of them, you don't get the good ending.  And the game does not give any hint to this until you need them at the very end.  And if you miss one in a campaign, that run is doomed to failure.-Game gets a bit repetitive.  The levels drag on for about a floor too long each and enemy variety is incredibly tiny for their size.  -Like many games of this type that try to be difficult, melee classes get shafted significantly harder than ranged classes do.-It bears repeating, but the acts last a bit too long.  I'd rather six acts with two floors each as, currently, you'll be tired of seeing the same enemies by the third floor.  Especially in Act III, which has massive and open second and third floors, and Act IV, which spams the heck out of spawners and spike turrets.-Some upgrades are pretty downright useless.  For example, the Warlock can spend gold on a passive that gives him a chance to heal off a kill.  He also can get an active skill that's a large AoE that's guaranteed to heal him for at least 1 HP per non-boss enemy hit.  Why bother with the passive?-Most bosses are kinda BSy, such as one that will randomly teleport next to you while firing multiple high damage shots.  If you happen to be walking in the wrong direction, you'll die instantly with no chance to react.  -Exploration is practically mandatory.  Gold drops are super common, but teeny tiny, and upgrades are expensive.  So you'll spend a lot of time hunting down and busting every crate for every penny so you can buy an upgrade.  Also, planks.-Low randomization.  Other than enemy drops and the locations of some secrets in the second campaign, everything is pre-set.  This game could really benefit from a mode with randomly generated dungeons but, sadly, they don't exist.-Compared to the music, the sound effects are pretty weak.  It's a little jarring.-Multiplayer is very trollable.  Everyone shares lives and, with a certain setting, HP.  So there's little stopping someone in public from connecting to the game and skewering themselves on instant-death traps over and over until you're out of lives.-The endings are really, really lame and feel unrewarding.  I know the game isn't big on plot but, still...  I wanna feel a bit more accomplished for an 8 hour run than a ""Game ends in 15 seconds, you win!"" deal.So yeah...  It's a fun game, worth some time, but it's hard to recommend unless you really like this genre.  I got enough fun out of it to give it a thumbs up over down, but, again, I'd rather give it a sideways.  My experience with the game was enjoyable but... I could also live without it and I'm not sure I'd invest in a sequel unless they really addressed all of the game's shortcomings.			"

												I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Hammerwatch that I love so much. The endless dungeon crawling should get tedious, but it doesn't. The lack of variety in enemies should get boring. The oh-so slow grind of upgrading powers should be faster. The huge difficulty spikes of boss battles should be frustrating. But somehow, Hammerwatch manages to be more than the sum of it's parts, and provides an answer to all of the potential failings I've mentioned.  The lack of variety in enemies is offset by the fact that there's an enormous number of them, which come at you in various combinations, and the interaction with the level design keeps each encounter fresh. While the character upgrades are very slowly drip-fed, that means that you have ample time as the player to master nuances of each before having more powers laden on. The boss difficulty spikes are offset by the fact that the game provides you plenty of extra lives, notably handing you a stack of five at the end of each boss fight, presumably to make up for the slew of them you lost during said fight. It's that balance that only starts to shine through a few hours into the game. Hammerwatch rewards and demands careful, smart play. Wade into a battle without an exit strategy in mind and you'll quickly be swamped by 50 enemies. Get surrounded, and you're toast. But go in knowing that you've cleared the hallway behind you so you can retreat that way, kiting the enemies into a more manageable grouping, and that you can trigger a combo with one power and use a combination heal/AoE with the other. and you'll stroll through the encounter. The only possible downside is that once you've got your build mastered and your careful approach strategy down, the challenge can slacken off (with the exception of the punishing boss battles). Though to be fair, there are harder difficulty levels that I've not yet explored that may solve that issue. I'll also note that I haven't even tried the co-op, which I expect will change up the feel of the game dramatically.			"

												In a castle full of (lots of) monsters, with secrets hidden in each floor, the objective is to defeat bosses and advance ...Hammerwatch is a 'hack'n'slash' cooperative game inspired by a medieval world.You can choose between 4 classes: Paladin, Mage, Ranger and Warlock, who each have 3 spells, and a 'right-click', in addition to specific statistics.…but explain all facets of the game… sucks. That is to you to test it, and fall in love with !in general, Hammerwatch is this:

												Hammerwatch is an excellent Gauntlet-style game with very clever level design and its own interesting mechanics.The game offers two main campaigns for roughly 10 to 15 hours of gameplay combined, 6 playable classes with their own gameplay style, a couple extra maps (survival and defense), as well as a variety of crutches and handicaps to ease or spice up your game.There also is a level editor and Workshop support for custom campaigns for additional hours of gameplay. I must admit I was expecting a little more maps than what is available right now, but most of the ones available are top-quality and very creative.Game itself can be quite challenging and won't hold your hand that much, and the two main campaigns are ridden with secrets and hidden passageways you most likely won't notice on your first playthrough if you're not careful.As far as game mechanics go, I'll only talk about the three things I think are worth mentioning in terms of originality (the gameplay itself is nothing too fancy for this type of game, but it works fine as is). 1- There is a progression system, but it doesn't come in the form of XP earned by completing objectives or killing ennemies. Instead, you'll have to collect treasures around the levels and use that currency at traders scattered about the game to buy various upgrades (health, armor, move speed, damage, class specific active and passive skills). The Temple of the Sun campaign adds an extra layer to that system as all the traders will be in the starting zone, but you'll have to find ore in the levels and give them to the traders of your choice in order to unlock their upgrades before you can even purchase them.2- There is a combo system (combos must be purchased at the Combo traders) where when you kill 10 ennemies or more in quick succession, your overall speed and damage will increase for as long as you can sustain the killstreak. This can be upgraded to also give you health regeneration or a damaging projectile aura while it lasts. This adds additional strategic depth as sometimes you'll have to ponder whether to combo the heck out of ennemies or hold it up if the whole mob actually is out of your league.3- You begin the game with several lives. When you die, you just get kicked back to the last checkpoint you activated and keep on moving without reloading your game. Extra lives can be collected along the way and after you beat bosses. The interesting part is that in multiplayer games, the whole party shares those lives, which means playing recklessly will affect your teammates too.While I warmly recommend this game for those who like the genre, it will be a lot more enjoyable if you can get to play with a group of friends. Solo play isn't that bad, but this is the type of game clearly designed for multiplayer mayhem and co-op fun.My only pet peeve right now about this game should only be taken into account by achievement hunters.While there are challenging and interesting achievements, if you want to 100% the game you'll also have to get through some stupidly grindy achievements as well (kill x monsters and collect x gold) that can only be achieved in the main campaigns (anything done on custom maps doesn't count towards the achievements). Since the main campaigns are the same on each playthrough, it really gets boring after the 20th run or so if you're going the legit route.ʕ •ﻌ• ʔฅ			"

												A straight-up homage to Gauntlet that scratches that co-op, top down, dungeon crawling, loot collecting itch.A couple of observations:1. This game is way better as online co-op than living room co-op. With multiplayer on the same screen, you're always forced to stick together, but online you can split up and join back together through the multitude of passages.2. All loot collected is shared! Hooray! I don't have to hate my partners, a la Four Swords, for stealing all my treasure.3. This game brings back the ""bad end"" from the days of Ghosts n' Goblins and Bubble Bobble, and is too repetitive to crawl through twice. It should be more upfront on the importance of a certain item.3. Re-map the autofire trigger to your main attack button, so it is both attack and autofire simultaneously. Your cramped hands will thank you. "

tl;dr -> Play this with friends and leave them to die when the enemy mobs get too overwhelming. 11/10 great friendship tester.A very generous friend gifted this to me, and I found a satisfying cooperative multiplayer experience.If you like old-school dungeon crawlers (arcade-style), light RPG elements, and cooperative action, then you will enjoy this game. The aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the levels and character models is decent. The various skill effects are also nice. In fact, there is enough detail in the levels to reward explorers and those with attention-to-detail - there are a large amount of secret areas to find. The music is very good and reminds me of Japanese-RPGs. The controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. Personally, I prefer using a controller, but the game is perfectly playable with a keyboard & mouse. There is no tutorial, however, information stones will give you enough information whenever a new gameplay element is introduced. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with dungeon crawlers - one of the most difficult parts of the game is being able to effectively micro and dodge enemy attacks (especially since you will encounter endless amounts of mobs throughout the levels). The game plays a lot better if you are playing multiplayer, but singleplayer mode is still a lot of fun.Gameplay consists of you navigating through (what seems to be) non-randomized levels, killing enemies and picking up many collectibles like gold, keys (bronze, silver, gold), health and mana, and a variety of other things. There are secret rooms that may give level shortcuts, allowing you to bypass a decent section of the map. The game is fairly linear, however, it really rewards exploration. You will encounter merchants that provide mana/health bonuses, combo enhancements (achieve a kill combo to produce numerous effects), new abilities, etc. These merchants will offer you a % discount based on how many shop tokens you have, and many of these are located in secret areas and secondary routes. There are also a number of puzzles and traps, requiring you to manipulate pressure blocks most of the time in different ways. There are different classes to play, easily warranting multiple playthroughs. This also makes playing with a group lots of fun because watching the different abilities massacring mobs of enemies can be really satisfying. There is some varying degree of difficulty depending on who you choose to play as. For example, the thief deals massive melee damage, but is also extremely weak with low health. The warlock (my favorite) has a melee attack that also poisons the target, causing damage over time and a weak explosion upon death. He starts off with a chain lightning ability for clearing mobs. The variety of shop upgrades offers a bit of strategic diversity. For example, one of the first upgrades is a combo enhancement - so achieving 10 consecutive kills will cause your character to move faster and deal more damage (very short amount of time). You can then upgrade things like health and mana, or you can choose to make your combo timer longer. You can also buy things like bonuses to offence (a rapid-fire nova when you achieve a combo), or a healing buff instead. Upgrades are initially expensive, so exploring a lot will help you upgrade effectively - especially when you find more shop discount tokens.Overall, the game is a lot of fun - especially if you play with other people. If you are the least bit interested in the dungeon crawling genre, then you must give this a try. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												While exploring a castle dungeon, the collapse of a bridge have left you (and a few friends) stranded on your own. With the main party lost without your presence they decide to wait for you to find your way back to them. So off you embark on a journey of fortune and glory as you travel deeper into the dungeons of Castle Hammerwatch.Set in a beautiful pixel-art world, Hammerwatch provides a challenging hack and slash adventure offering a fun solo and local co-op experience with a nice selection of classes to choose from, each with different abilties and playstyles. With plenty of hidden secrets and Easter Eggs, there is plenty to explore. With an extended campaign to the Sun Temple as well as user-created campaigns with the workshop, Hammerwatch offers a fun, but challenging experience.Pros:+ Beautiful pixel artwork+ 2 campaigns as well as workshop support+ Several classes to choose, each with their own abilities+ Character progression+ Hidden secrets and Easter Eggs+ Controller support for a great couch co-op experience+ Different difficulty modes (as well as extra challenge/help settings)+ An auto-attack toggle in the settings (I found out about this way too late)Cons:- The main campaign's level layout is always the same (can be considered good and bad)- The Sunwatch Temple campaign has pretty unfair bosses that may cause some frustration (while soloing at least)- Online co-op community is quite inactive- The Millionaire and Genocide achievements can be quite grindyMy Score: 7.5/10 "

												Equipped with two very different campaigns and a thrilling survival mode, Hammerwatch provides a lot of adventure for people who like killing huge mobs of monsters and making their way through the crowds in order to achieve a desired goal. Hidden secrets, three difficulties, a variety of crutches and challenges, six possible characters (three ranged and three melee adventurers), a single player and multi player mode, a map editor and a workshop community with the possibility for exchange of custom maps ensure that this game won't even become boring if you play it more than 50 times. Four color sets for the character's clothes you can choose from offer the comfort of individuality - and besides this means you can play with three friends and everyone can pick the same character, if you like to do so. Of course you have graphic settings, too, allowing very nice atmospheric lighting. The soundtracks are beautifully composed underlining the dramatic atmosphere in the sourroundings of your slaying hero. Playing time is about 5-6 hours for Campaign1 and 3 hours for Campaign2. Big and bigger bad guys will try to hinder your process - will you die or will you return?After nearly 400 hours of Hammerwatch I can strongly recommend this game. Beautiful detailed work, loads of fun and quite an amount of riddles to be solved!			"

												Hammerwatch is a great game if you aren't bothered by the old-school graphics. It is really addicting and VERY fun to play, solo or with friends. The setup of the multiplayer is really easy and there are different game-modes in the default pack and you can download a few more on the official site. The only thing i was bothered by is the imbalance of the classes. I have 3 other friends who played it solo or with each other and we all agree that the ranger is the class you can easily get very far with. The second one but still immensely weaker is the wizard. The melee classes(paladin and warlock) are just way too underpowered.But I still have 30h+ playtime already, mostly with the ranger and the wizard. I do not regret buying this game AT ALL.9/10			"

No randomizing of dungeons, no leveling up, no inventory, sorta confusing overlay map, and very basic gameplay (for the time I played it, at least), with very generic graphics. Might be better in co-op, dunno, but for a solo experience, not a really enjoyable game, alas.			"

												This is a 'perfect game', the old school feel is balanced out very nicely by permissive difficulty settings that make it playable for small children and challenging for the most seasoned gamers, something which you almost never find!The pixelated graphics don't feel clíche or forced and the whole thing feels quite natural with an extremely eddictive edge akin to games like Diablo or Torchlight.Each of the playable characters has a very different play-style and make for at least 6 playthroughs of the vanilla campaign before trying anything on the Steam Workshop. The levels are MASSIVE and once or twice had me surprised at the scale and complexity of the labyrinths.My only minor complaint would be the amount of back-tracking you have to do to solve some puzzles on the packaged levels but in general it's negligable. I highly recommend this game.			"

												About half an hour into this game it dawned on me: I was having more fun than while playing Diablo 3. This game is what I've wanted all dungeon crawlers to be since the day I first played Zelda and Diablo 1: light hearted multiplayer exploration of a massive dungeon filled with traps and secrets. Having a voice service like Razer is a must; countless times my friend have saved me by yelling ""The floor!!!"" and thus stopped me from walking into yet another spike trap. This game does not hold your hand; several of the secrets require a good eye to notice. And plenty of them have the feeling of a real DnD session. Like the first time you walk into a small secret room and a rune lights up beneath you... I won't spoil the fun. Instead; grab a friend and journey into the depths of Hammerwatch!PRO'S:+ Multiplayer Dungeon Crawler+ Tons and tons of secrets, traps and puzzles+ Varied classes that shines when you play with friends+ Massive waves of enemies+ Massive game maps+ Excellent graphics+ Adjustable difficultyCON'S:- Same map every time- Watch out for the difficulty: the game ends when you're out of lives (unless you set yourself to Unlimited Lives at the beginning of the game)- Map can be hard to navigate since there's no real mini mapI don't want to end on CON's though; to the game makers: thank you for all your work with this game! It was 100% worth the $10,- This is the kind of game I've been looking for forever. Thank you!			"

Hammerwatch2D Dungeon Crawl Action RPGDeveloped and Published by: CrackshellReleased: Aug 2013General Impressions:Hammerwatch is a well crafted and entertaining traditional top down 2D action game in the style of Gauntlet.  Alone or online with up to three friends, choose one of 6 different classes and work your way through Castle Hammerwatch, filled with traps, secrets, and of course thousands of monsters to destroy, while spending your hard earned gold on upgrades for your characters.Hammerwatch is at its normal or hard difficulties a punishing, yet rarely unfair game that gives a real sense of mastery as you get better, but it also has an easy difficulty as well as custom mutators you can set to tailor your game experience exactly how you like it.The game is presented in simple top down 2D sprite graphics that have a retro feel to it, which may be offputting to some but I personally adore the art style.  The controls are simple, the action is fast and the Castle itself is very well designed with tons of secrets and puzzles to solve between all the killing.I'm having a great time playing this game, at time of writing having finished the main game in a private co-op group and just getting started on the (free) expansion.  While the game is fun if you're going it alone, it definitely shines the brightest in multiplayer, especially if you want to play a melee character as certain situations are very, very tricky to pass without proper ranged damage.While I haven't looked at it myself yet, there is also a level editor included and the Steam Workshop has a whole bunch of community created adventures you can play, potentially adding a heckton of hours to the longevity of the game.If you see the game at a discount somewhere I can safely recommend a purchase if you like some throw back, uncomplicated dungeon crawling action.  Especially so if you have a few friends you can pass around 4 pack copies to and drag along for the fun!			"

												I really, really wish I could give a neutral rating.This game is so cool in its premise, graphic, music, concept, etc but falls down hard in its execution.Tedious, repetitive, unbalanced classes (only archer/paladin are enjoyable the rest just kite), needing to break a million objects for gold which is non-optional if you wish to progress and stand a chance.It's just ... ALMOST THERE.  In local co-op my friend and I vacillated between ""let's keep going"" and ""lets uninstall"" so many times.  Ultimately it's just not fun.  I finished it because I'm a mild completionist but I did so grudgingly.			"

												Fantastic old-school dungeon explorer! You start off by choosing from four classes, each being completely different and requiring different strategies to win, and then you go off into a fun, yet challenging game where you run around, find secrets, kill monsters, collect coins and buy upgrades!Not only do you have the base game, but you also have co-op and multiplayer mode where you can play with other players, essentially making things even more fun than they were. And if that wasn't enough, you can create your own levels and mod the game! To top it off, you can make it to look like a true oldie by changing the settings to make the screen looked curved like on an old computer and having old-styled graphics!Simply a magnificent indie game, worth your time AND your money! 9/10			"

Not only the big possibilities of making the game easier or harder (whatever you like more) does make it that good. Besides the fact that it's one of the best multiplayer games I recently found, it also has the possibilities to create your own maps and play them with your friends. Doesn't that sound awesome? So get it as fast as you can! 8/10			"

												Hammerwatch provides a player with a nostagic throw back to the days of Gauntlet (the original) and other similar top down multiplayer action games.  The game starts off by allowing players to pick between 1 of 4 classes and from there they begin to progress through the dungeon in order to achieve...well that goes unsaid.  There's plenty of enemies to slay which come from spawns, each 'hero-type' has a unique ability unique to them that comes some mana.  What I enjoyed about the game was its simplicity yet ability to punish the player for simple and silly mistakes.  Its also a good game in the 'time killing category' as the player can continue from the last checkpoint without too many concerns.  Another part of the game I enjoyed was a lack of leveling systems.  To upgrade your character one must collect gold and then find the respective vendor to upgrade a stat such as health, movement, armor and ability to execute combos (combos are created when you kill 10+ enemies in a row within a time frame and can be enhanced with difference effects such as self-heal or aoe radius attacks)Some items I was not a fan of was movement speed.  I honestly wish there was an built in button of some sort to allow for a dash (aside from one of the character specific skills).  Some points might be spent back tracking and as large as the maps are that can take a considerable amount of time.  This is particularly difficult when trying to locate switches or button that may have been overlooked.  The other element I didn't enjoy was the amount of boxes that required to be broken to find currency.  Currecy in this game is a finite source (as far as I know for the base campign) so you want to gather as much as possible.  In terms of connectivity I really can't say much.  The standard port opening/forwarding or utilizing a VPN may need to be done in order to connect to a server but I haven't really experience the game online.  In terms of controller support I didn't experience any real issue.  Set-up DS3 Tool configured it to recognize PS3 controllers as Xbox controller and was good to go.I'll have to give some of the level editors a go in the future.At this time I really can't recommned or not recommend this game.  I would recommend it to those that enjoy grindy style games with a bit of customizations in terms of dungeons or if you want a quick game to play with a friend...but I wouldn't recommend it if your trying to play with a friend across the net if your not familiar with using say Hamachi or Tunngle or some other VPN protocol.

The fun really starts when you get a couple of friends together to play, and the game is simple enough that pretty much anyone can pick up the controls right away and just have fun with things.

												You play as one of four incredible medieval ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the kind of people who are willing to murder an entire ecosystem of monsters inside of a castle just because the widdle bridge behind them broke in half! This is a fun co-op game with single player that I found fun for once, even though the game's pacing is pretty damn slow with a solo character. So if you pair up with friends and go for some speed murdering, it will likely be pretty damn fun. On the other hand, the characters are not evenly matched, the game uses static dungeons, and there really isn't much beyond the Gauntlet mixed with Quake motif to check out, which kind of puts a damper on things once the game is actually done.

This game has everything from 2 solid campaigns, drop-in-play matches, fun and challenging character classes to learn, varying difficulties, multiplayer co-op, and even user made content which is also very enjoyable!I have played a handful of rogue-like games and this one by far is the most enjoyable one I have played. I would highly recommend you pick this up if you are itching for a solid rogue-like game.If you do decide to get this, I would recommend you play it with a controller, it makes it that much more enjoyable, but it is entirely playable with the keyboard. Also grab some friends to join you, it is a lot more fun learning and failing with friends!			"

												Don't let the 72 metacritic rating fool you. With all of the recent updates, hammerwatch has shaped to be one heck of a fun game. The basic premise of the game is that your trapped in Castle Hammerwatch and must find a way out. You have a choice between the Paladin, who focuses on close range, tanking, and healing. The Ranger, who focuses on long range, explosives, and just being extremely mobile in combat. The Mage, while fragile, has the potential to become extremely powerful with his fire magic and the Warlock is kind of a mix between the Mage and Warrior.The sense of progression in this game great. Enemies will sometimes drop small upgrades that up your stats and throughout your journey you can purchase upgrades to damage, health, and new skills. It happens often enough that after while, that one enemy you had trouble with suddenly becomes nothing to you.Each act consists of three floors with one boss waiting at the end. The game actually requires a bit of strategy going through these levels in terms of how you upgrade, how you approach enemies and bosses, the works. Simply diving into a swarm of monsters will get you killed if you aren't strong enough.The best part is this game has online multiplayer! Bring all four of the heros through the whole journey and make use of each ability to assist eachother and just wreck everything in your way. The only thing to watch out for is that lives are shared in this game and if you aren't careful, they'll go down quick and it'll be game over just like that.I highly recomend you get the game if your looking for a fun multiplayer experience. Its pretty darn difficult so if you need a challenge, this will provide it!			"

												A great, fun, and challenging hack n' slash RPG with co-op and rouge-like elements. You can get more lives and respawn to the nearest activated checkpoint if you die, and if you run out of lives and die you can restore an earlier save which is activated by checkpoints/entering a new floor.You kill tons of enemies, preferably while strafing and avoiding projectiles/melee because most of everything hits fairly hard, and traps are as scary as ever. Gather lots of money, HP/MP/Attack/Defense upgrade pickups, keys to open certain doors, potions, and buy upgrades, abilities, and potions from varying merchants, and discover secrets.Pretty cool game, bring friends. Preferably ones that don't constantly die.Also, cool soundtrack.			"

												Didn't play this game for a year or two. Decided to play with same friends I did as last time as we were wanting to do all plank run (100%?).Start the campaign, play a couple of hours, about 5 or 6 hours in, on the floor 11 puzzle friends and I run over the runes like  the rampant smaht people we are. Turns out it bugs out the puzzle. So we google around making sure we got all the puzzles connected to this puzzle, wasting another hour or so ♥♥♥♥ing with the other puzzles. Turns out ""It's a known bug. Issue is, we don't really have a good solution for this afaik.""10/10 would play for known bug again.[Edit] I originally made this in a joking manner kind of review. This actually is a really good dungeon crawler (better played with friends in my opnion). The graphics/gameplay remind me of a smash up of Legend of Zelda (16 bit) and Gauntlet (Also with a gauntlet style bonus level). I can't remember what dificulty we played on but really good balance, not too easy and not horribly hard either. I'm terrible at actual reviews so there you go haha.			"

												At first, I started playing this game solo. Since there is any kind of tutorial (you have to press ESC -> Help to see the commands and stuff), it was a bit hard to understand the mechanism.Once you get to know how to play, you are going further deep to the dungeon and realize that this game is hard (note that I only play in Hard difficulty). It requires quick hand and a lot of strategy when facing enemies. Game has a great depth. There are traps, secret doors, bosses, NPCs with which you can upgrade yourself, and you scarcely find extra lifes around. It might be a little bit frustrating or repetitive when playing alone, but it shines at it's maximum on Multiplayer.Playing this game on skype with 1~3 friends is really nice and recommended. It's easy to connect through IP or just invite directly from Steam.Music is awesome.The only thing I'm maybe missing is the capability of getting new gear (the fact of improving your skills is great though).Overall I would recommend this game to play with somebody, and wouldn't recommend it much for the solo play.8.5/10.

												This game is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, it's an interesting dungeon crawler with big maps.On the other hand is literally everything else.The class system is really unbalanced. Thief, for instance, is basically unplayable for the first two thirds of the game before being on par with the Paladin, and even then it takes lots of skill to out-DPS him. All in all, the classes feel extremely unbalanced in comparison, especially in multiplayer games. As my friend - who played a Paladin - said: ""So basically I am useless while you carry the game""The level design is mediocre. While I enjoyed the idea of going back and forth through the level, the key-system they use always make me feel as if I am missing something, as if I'm not going the optimal way. To do that, I need to play with a walkthrough next to me - which is an experience I really don't look for.Further, the game often teases you by showing secrets in impossible-to-reach places and wants you to find a switch /anywhere/ in the act to make it accessible. Personally, when I hit a switch and it just says ""Something happened"" I feel really disappointed and frustrated.Finally, the secrets. The game has several secrets hidden throughout the ""scenarios"", in the form of planks. What are these planks used for? Well, the game doesn't tell you. You'll see in the very last boss fight. Afterwards, you will need to use the planks to escape. If you missed only one, then you basically get the bad end. And I'll be honest, basically telling me ""you ♥♥♥♥ed up"" for not consulting a walkthrough while playing is a middle finger to the face.All in all, the game's negative sides outweigh its positives - at least for me. If you really want it, pick it up at a sale or refund it after an hour.			"

												This game’s probably a lot more fun with friends, but I played it by myself.Anyway, I didn’t find anything particularly good about Hammerwatch. It’s just a very simple dungeon crawler. Too simple and repetitive to stay interesting for long.I actually gave up because I got lost; I think I forgot to activate a switch somewhere. But the switches aren’t marked on your map, and they’re very bland looking, so they’re very easy to miss. I got fed up with that, and just ragequit forever. Also, the map obstacles like spikes and arrow traps are very frustrating, as they often insta-killed me while I was backtracking and not looking out for them.The bosses were pretty fun I guess.			"

												Hammerwatch is a very modern version of Gauntlet under the pixel graphics, and is just as challenging without the dumb ""always needing food"" mechanic that the old arcade Gauntlet used to coax more quarters out of players. There's a campaign mode, survival mode, and a mode that is sort of like a tower defense, but the game supports custom content, so it really doesn't end there. Hammerwatch supports couch co-op (so it's an excellent Steam Machine candidate) and online co-op.The classes are: Warrior, Wizard, Archer, Warlock and Thief. They all have their own upgrades that can be purchased in the various modes that improve their specialities, such as the Thief earning more money to use for skills, and the Warrior being able to upgrade their projectile blocking radius. Character upgrades persist through a campaign, but when a new campaign is started players start from scratch. The average campaign time is a few hours, and progress can be saved mid-campaign and resumed later.The game is fun as a single player game, but it's at its best when when friends are involved. Any group of players looking for a modern, challenging Gauntlet with a couple of modern mechanics should look no further!			"

Fun with friends, many different classes with unique upgrades, funny secrets, and the game provides a real challenge. Try survival on hard.

												Gauntlet style action with great classes and online multiplayer, a must for any game these days (what is with those local multiplayer only games), my only complaint is that as the boss battles continue they get easier and easier, with the final boss being a joke and boring and just not as well thought out as the previous. I wish the developers would consistanly make new content. Either way its great for a play through with friends. But not so great for replay unless you are all switching classes.A new update is here with a new area(s), so Im replaying through for that. Im excited. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Hammerwatch is a great top down dungeon crawler if you're into fast and easy gameplay. There is no inventory to manage, no skills to juggle and the visual style is clean and easy to parse. The gameplay moves fast, and each of the classes is unique enough to keep the game fresh enough to replay. Chaining combos gets really fun and exciting, especially at higher levels.The music is really nice, but does get a bit repetitive after a while.Local co-op is possible, but kind of a pain unless you and your buddies stay fairly close together. Online co-op is a little confusing at first, and I see that others have had issues with it, but my friends and I have been sucessful and getting a party together. Once you're in the game, it's smooth sailing.I suggest that you play the game with a controller. Keyboard controls are kind of uncomfortable, but this may just be my personal preference.			"

												Hammerwatch, for some reason, is one of the most fun and awesome games on Steam. It's very clear from the start that it pays homage to many games (in the form of easter eggs, too), including old classic arcade style games such as Gauntlet. Alone or with friends, it's a game like no other!From the start, it's a delight for the senses. The graphics have a retro yet ""modern"" look to them, featuring dynamic shadows and ambient occulsion that have absolutely every right to be there to enhance the crispy pixel visuals. The music, oh lord the music, is some of the greatest music I ever heard in a game. I don't know why it's so good, but ""Two Feathers"" is a brilliant composer and makes some of the best ""epic retro game orchestral pop"" music I've ever heard. Rolls off of the tongue, right?The gameplay is a button mash fest. A very fun one! There is very little delay between attacks or abilities, making button mashing your way through hordes of enemies or pesky loot hiding crates an absolute dream! It's not even an easy game in the slightest, positioning and ability usage play a key role in your survival. Otherwise, you are going to get wrecked in this difficult game filled to the brim with monster hordes! When you aren't throwing yourself into a massive army of creatures, you will find tons of secrets, upgrade your abilities with money, and stumble upon a brilliant game design decision: Tease the player with loot that they can clearly see on screen but can't reach! All of this in huge, sprawling levels that might take hours to finish!Hammerwatch is just a breathtaking little game. I swear to god that this is one of the best indie games of all time!			"

												This game feels like it could've been made a long time ago, but is not unwelcome in this strange era where retro style games are cool. It's sort of a cross between the non-3d Zeldas in gameplay and a mild Diablo in theme, with some generic but enjoyable RPG elements.

												This game is awesome. Somehow makes me remember of BoxHead flash game. However, this game is more difficult than that. If you like to go with some friends do do a co-op where you explore fight for survive, this is the game that you and your friends are looking for (if you are thirsty for a co-op game). Note again that, in this game, you must CO-OPERATE with your friends. Which means if you go rambo you will easily die (like what happened to us, so try to communicate with each other, go Skype, etc). (I've only tried co-op, since I haven't played the single-player mode I won't talk about the single-player)			"

												I picked this up as part of a bundle, and I have to say, I would have bought just this game for the price of the bundle.Playing single player, I didn't think much of it - it's quite difficult and takes a long time. I went into the reviews and had a look, and read that it's much more fun playing multiplayer. I wasn't really sure how that could be for this type of game, but decided to try it anyway. I wasn't disappointed. It really is a lot better multiplayer, especially when you work together as a team and do things together. It helps to have everyone as a different class, and an experienced player to show the ways to get the secret passages.Plus, everyone is really talkative and fun to play with - which really makes what multiplayer is about.Enjoyable indie game, would recommend to all types of gamers.8/10			"

												It's fair to say that when one sees an Indie game (especially when for sale cheaply) one can lower one's expectations a bit. You might forgive some length of the game, or quality, or clunkiness in mechanics. This is one of those rarer games where NONE of that applies. It's extremely polished.As others may well have commented, there's obvious parallels here to the old classic Gauntlet. I'm probably going to commit gaming heresy here, but I'll confess that Gauntlet was rather a mixed bag to me. As an arcade game that certainly popularised hack'n'slash (and there was so very little DnD related stuff in the arcades up until then), I loved it. I also loved the merits and fun in having 4 players crowd round the unit, each with their own controls, and I also loved the fact you could stick another 10p in to just add HP to your character, extending your progress.However, I disliked that it was obviously an arcade game, written with the emphasis of milking coins from you as quickly as they could get away with. You would often think ""that was a fairly good and long game"" only to realise you'd stuffed a quid's worth of 10p's in, where you'd probably get the same amount of game time on another game for half the price. This ias the main reason why I felt it never really translated well to home conversion.Thankfully, Hammerwatch takes the best bits of Gauntlet, throws away the coin-stuffing problem, and improves on a few things too, making it very much it's own unique thing. It is, of course, very retro in nature - older, large-pixelled graphics, 2D view, low HP and more old-fashioned gameplay. However, these are not done for the sake of nostalgia - they perfectly fit, and are indeed designed very much around these premises.Where the game truly shines are in mechanics - it's not-too-fast offers fluid movement, and solid nimble attacks. You soon pick up the distance from enemies which are best for bashing them, and the time-honoured tradition of funneling enemies works so very well here. In a nutshell, it just plays so beautifully.There's no levelling up of character through XP. However, your character can be improved through amassing the tons of coins thrown around the place (you'll need them), and by visiting specific vendors. One quite lovely trick of the game is utilizing where these vendors are - a 2D map can easily fall prey these days to being quite old-fashioned and tired. Thankfully, due to where these vendors are, and that there are several exits and entrances to each level, you'll need to dart back and forth quite a bit, and it never really feels like a chore.Put simply, this game does very much ""what it says on the tin"", and does it brilliantly. It does adopt a traditional 3 lives system (extra lives can be earned), but you really feel that it is well-balanced, appropriately challenging and I never once felt that a death was cheap or anything other than my fault.If that were not enough credit to it, then there's one massive one that is very dear to my heart, and that concerns difficulty. I openly admit to being an older gamer (I'm nearly 50) and disabled. A lot of the time, it doesn't really hinder my gameplay too much, although my reactions have naturally slowed a bit over the years. But I do have bad days, and there's nothing worse than starting a game, getting many hours into it and then having a bad day which means you simply cannot progress in that game because you're finding it too hard that day (and nothing takes your mind off the bad days better than gaming).So, I'm a fan of the theory that you can NEVER have too many difficulty options. If you select the ""vanilla"" easier option when starting a game, you'll find Hammerwatch still quite challenging, and if you're used to the standard of what easy mode truly means, then you won't get to the end, most likely.However, you can tweak the difficulty even further, with ""crutches"" (strangely appropriate for me) - regenerating HP, double-damage just to name two main ones. Conversely, there are also the opposite - tricks to make the game harder still, such as no earning of extra lives and more. So, a number of options for anybody.It's often a situation that I'll end up modding the INI files of some games due to inadequate difficulty settings, but the downside of this is it can often be a balancing act to get it just right for you without it destroying interest in the game. I found that these ""crutches"" were perfect for me - they made the game much easier, but kept it interesting enough even though only the stupidest of mistakes will leave you in trouble.In summary, I can't recommend this game highly enough. It offers what you'd expect and much more. It is so very well polished and designed extremely well. With those added thoughtful difficulty settings, that really makes it a cherry on one delicate, but utterly more-ish cake.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  It looked like it had so much promise, but the game mechanics were not fun at all for me.  A game like this should be twin stick, and I find it silly that it isn't.  Also the gameplay overall is just sorta boring, I couldn't even get myself to finish the thing.			"

												I bought it for $3.30 in the Flash Sale and I feel that was over priced after having played it. It's worse than some of the flash games I've played of the same type. Firstly, multiplayer is a travesty. They could have used Steamplay and made it super simple but no, you need to port forward to get hosting to work properly. It's not that hard but, an extra step that never needed to happen. Also, you share lives. My bud & I went through, he died a bit due to being the melee tank Paladin while I was the ranger and when I eventually died, the game was basically over because we had no lives left.Secondly, the level design is utter rubbish. I'm adjusted to play Rogue-likes however having to walk very, very slowly back to where you were after dying is just poor design. They do give you checkpoints but they are so far spaced/poorly placed you may as well not bother.Third, while I did not get too deeply into the game, you start each class with next to nothing. A basic attack with a horrid default layout (Up to attack, really?) and 1 spell (Bound to Left, on the arrow keys, okay dev, okay.) It wasn't until far later that we found a shop to buy something new, which wasn't even something really good mind you. It was a combo skill type of deal, requiring you to kill 10 enemies in a very, very short time frame (Which in multiplayer, good luck as the counter only increases with YOUR killing blows) and you'll receive a minor movement speed buff. Wow, neat-o. Fourth, the random death drops. Now, I'm okay with crates and barrels occasionally being booby trapped. In Diablo & Path of Exile, it's a minor inconvenience at best, especially when you start getting a lot of health/resistances. In this game, however, your character is made of wet paper and when you break a crate open to a black bomb (Which, mind you, blends into the environment seamlessly) and it blows up .3 seconds later, taking over half your health on the squishier classes, it's annoying as hell. This got lengthy real quick and I doubt anybody will actually read this but, hey, there you go. I do NOT recommend buying this game. I'm not whining about the difficulty, I love hard games with learning curves, etc but this game has none as you'll just get bored after your first game over.I just now decided to try the game again/collect the trading cards (Which is why I now have 2 hours of this *shudders*) to at least get some minor return on the cost of this steaming pile, it's still utter crap.

												I tried this game a bit before it got greenlit, because I thought the style was great. I soon gave up on it though, because it felt dull.It had been out a while and I decided to get it during the christmas sale. Sadly, I don't think it has improved much. Mind, I haven't played it a lot at the time of writing, so take it with a grain of salt.The levels are designed, not randomly generated, which might hurt when it comes to replay value. The levels are very large, but are mostly empty. Most of the time you are smashing near-endless amounts of containers that primarily contain coins. The rest of the time is spent on effectively killing hordes of enemies in bullet-hell type of situations. There's a littlebit of puzzles and secrets sprinkled around, but not a whole lot it would seem. Checkpoints allow you to try again if you die, but you have limited lives. Reaching a new floor saves your progress.You can select from a few different classes that behave quite differently. You can bring some friends with you in co-op mode if you wish. Sound-wise, there's not much to go on, but the art style is cool. Shops spread out in the dungeon allow you to purchase upgrades.What I find to be the issue with this game is than it's simply not a lot of fun. With an addition of randomly generated, faster-paced levels and more interesting things to do, the game would look a lot more interesting. I think it has potential, but the experience, as it is, doesn't allow me to recommend this game. If you still think you'll like it, or just want to show your support to the developers, consider getting it during a sale. The regular asking price is rather high.			"

												Yeah... I used to have some problems with this game, but patch 1.23 has alleviated all of them. Don't get me wrong, I always enjoyed the game, even through it's shortcomings. Now, it has got to be one of my favorite bargain titles available on Steam. 10$ for this is a steal. The new thief and priest classes are wonderful additions to the game, and really have me looking forward to what the devs have in store for the future. If you have 10 bucks to spare and love a good co-op ARPG with retro flair, get this game ASAP.			"

												Think of it like an old fashioned Gauntlet game. It's simple at first, but the sheer difficulty can be insane.On the other hand, it plays like a dream and will keep you on the edge of your seat as you worry about when the next upgrade shop is going to pop up. You'll be paranoid of missing any secrets as you destroy hoards of mobs who will literally surround you.It's a ton of fun in multiplayer.It looks great and sounds pretty good, too, so I really have fun with this game.

												Absolutely fantastic light ARPG, especially when played in multiplayer, but almost as good when you're alone...I really like the graphic style, the controls are fluid and soundtrack is really nice and reminds me of old games. Monster fights are fast and intense, bosses are interesting, and there are a lot of secrets to find.The game is very hard, but also rewarding.It is not without faults, though... As far as I can tell, saves cannot be deleted (only via file system), story is non-existent (not really important for this type of game, but anything would help), and last, but definitely not least, maps are always the same... Ok, this does make game prettier and cleverer, but every playthrough is the same, which greatly impacts the replayability of the game...P.S. Don't forget to pick up the planks! :)			"

												Play with inifinite lives on or prepare to be demolished for years until you git gud. Run around collecting wood so you can perform the Great Escape after killing the final boss. If you don't get every chunk of wood you ♥♥♥♥ing die at the end anyway which is garbage because you just poured 5+ hours into this game without pausing or saving, and some of them are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard to find. The towers gave me a bad case of the Touhous. Only play this if you have 3 friends who are willing to start playing at like 11 PM and go until way past the point of sanity. This will be the ultimate trial; friendships that survive this experience are the sort that are written of in legends, but the weak will be torn apart at the seams. trial by fire/10			"

												A really entertaining little RPG. It's very basic and that's why this game is so great. Just put your mind at zero and slay enemies maybe while listening to your music or a podcast.

												Hammerwatch is likely one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam. It blends RPG and HnS elements very well. The class progression is well developed which keeps the hack n slash aspect lively throughout the story of the game. All of the game modes are great, but my favorite has to be local multiplayer. Hammerwatch is hands down my favorite LAN party game ever. I wish I could recommend it more! Easily a 10/10 game and I still haven't even found all of the planks...			"

												This is like an over world zelda game. If you get this game you will NOT be disappointed. I highly recommend it and think it's absolutely fun and amazing. It offers 4 player multiplayer co-op and the fun can last for hours on end. I recommend having a controller though as tapping the same button over and over for an attack and get repetitive and fast. The only other thing that this game doesn't have is online multiplayer saves. Say you reach a save point in a multiplayer session and it takes 5 hours to reach a certain point. If you save and then turn it off and then turn it back on try to get back to where you were, it won't let you and you'll have to restart from the beginning which is a super downer :(. However despite that, it's super fun and there is no other game like this on steam! It's fun, unique, and it has 6 different classes you can play as now!!! (it used to be 4 but with updates it's 6). There's plenty of content to explore and it offers a challenge every time you play it (unless you use cheats ;P) and not only that but you can even get mods for this game online making it even better offering different modes of play- and yes they all offer online multiplayer as well. Even if this game is full priced I HIGHLY recommend it, but I would say wait as this game does go on sale, and recently I saw it for .83 on indie gala during the spring sale recently and it also can drop down to other prices too like 2.50 so be sure to pick up this game when it's on sale.

												There's a bit of a learning curve to this game, but if you are able to stick with it you'll find a real gem here. First of all, as many others have pointed out it is very similar to the core concept behind Gauntlet. At it's core, it follows the same 'find all of the keys to get to the exit' formula, but this gameplay is augmented by player progression, special abilities, backtracking, and boss fights. It's colorful, lots of great effects, and has a generally high production value.I'd also like to express a few issues I have with the game, but at the same time point out that these should not necessarily deter you from buying/playing the game, just give you a better idea of what to expect.First, there's no steamcloud support. To me this is a basic feature if you're going to put a game on steam.. it'd be forgivable if it were a roguelike with no persistence, but this is a long-play game. Anytime a game doesn't support steamcloud I have to copy the save to my dropbox before I go to work.The decision to make the paladin the 'default' character for players who just start the game without changing options is questionable. The paladin takes a fair bit of skill and nuance to play effectively- not to mention that just about any other game that has a paladin gives that class some sort of healing ability. This paladin has a charge/dash. It's a great skill, but just not what people are going to expect when diving into the game for the first time. Your average player is going to start the game, get swarmed and die repeatedly. Personally I think the wizard probably would have made a better default character.There is virtually NO onboarding in this game whatsoever. The closest you get to a 'tutorial' are these little 'hint boxes' that you have to attack, but if you happen to take a warp or staircase past the first floor (not as hard as it sounds) you'll never see them. An actual onboarding level or optional tutorial would go a long way to making the game more digestible for the average gamer. After my first 30 minutes of playing this game I nearly wrote an angry email to the friend who recommended I buy it, but I persevered and found the diamond in the rough.The soundtrack is nice, but personally it doesn't gel with the art style. I feel like a retro chiptune style soundtrack would have fit better, but that's just my opinion. What's in the game is good, it's not distracting, so in the end it is what it is. I just feel like it's an area where they could have given the game a bit more personality.A lot of the encounters aren't really balanced for single player. It's clear to me that they are pushing for coop multiplayer for this game, but a bit more thought could have been given to making sure the singleplayer experience didn't suffer. It's not bad, mind you- I have a singleplayer game going right now and as an example- I was able to full-clear the first 3 floors without dying once, but during the first boss battle I died 9 times. It's not so much that the fight is hard, it's just that they spawn you right in the middle of an area where you're going to take damage immediately (and a low armor class is going to die quickly). So that's just an example, but you'll see little hints of it throughout the game. Not a huge deal, still very enjoyable as a single player game.So, TLDR version: It's fun, great, awesome. Hard, steep learning curve. Stick with it and you'll love it.			"

												It's honestly Gauntlet 2.0. Simple, yet complex, Hammerwatch is great alone or with friends.The game is pixel art and scales well. Doesn't have the ""Everything is shiny"" look from Monaco. HOWEVER, With the basic control set up you'll be holding Space A LOT.If you rebind the controls (Or play with a controller. 4P local co-op.) you'll have a much easier time unless you love cramped thumbs.Only thing missing is the old ""WARRIOR SHOT A FOOD"" but I can look past that.

An excerpt from ""Ranger Danger""   ...My three teammates watched nervously from their parent's basements for a ghastly 42 minutes while I fumbled around a great portion of Act III.  As the last man alive, who also happen to be a ranger, it had undoubtedly become my charge to replenish the stock of lives for my noble company.     I grew desperate in my fearful attempt to locate the specific vendor(and enough gold) for which to purchase the extra lives.  However, Act III is not for the faint of heart.. err lives for that matter.  Ha!  I jest, just there.   Now where was I.  Yes!  The fellows who had not played for some time!  I did not know a one of them before our grand adventure, yet they persevered, still!  Upon the completion of my task, I instantly fainted.  The party was merry again and rejoiced!

												Hammerwatch is likely one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam. It blends RPG and HnS elements very well. The class progression is well developed which keeps the hack n slash aspect lively throughout the story of the game. All of the game modes are great, but my favorite has to be local multiplayer. Hammerwatch is hands down my favorite LAN party game ever. I wish I could recommend it more! Easily a 10/10 game and I still haven't even found all of the planks...			"

												This is like an over world zelda game. If you get this game you will NOT be disappointed. I highly recommend it and think it's absolutely fun and amazing. It offers 4 player multiplayer co-op and the fun can last for hours on end. I recommend having a controller though as tapping the same button over and over for an attack and get repetitive and fast. The only other thing that this game doesn't have is online multiplayer saves. Say you reach a save point in a multiplayer session and it takes 5 hours to reach a certain point. If you save and then turn it off and then turn it back on try to get back to where you were, it won't let you and you'll have to restart from the beginning which is a super downer :(. However despite that, it's super fun and there is no other game like this on steam! It's fun, unique, and it has 6 different classes you can play as now!!! (it used to be 4 but with updates it's 6). There's plenty of content to explore and it offers a challenge every time you play it (unless you use cheats ;P) and not only that but you can even get mods for this game online making it even better offering different modes of play- and yes they all offer online multiplayer as well. Even if this game is full priced I HIGHLY recommend it, but I would say wait as this game does go on sale, and recently I saw it for .83 on indie gala during the spring sale recently and it also can drop down to other prices too like 2.50 so be sure to pick up this game when it's on sale.

												I don't like hack and slash games. I really don't, never have. But this game is really amazing, and I'm barely through the first act of the Castle Hammerwatch campaign. Combine that with multiplayer and Workshop and you can easily tell this game has a massive amount of content to do. There's a good balance of crazy enemy slaughter and some puzzles every now and then, completed with hidden switches and areas. The art is really neat, as well. Great game worth fully its price.			"

												Very entertaining and time consuming action game. This is a 2D Retro top-down dungeon crawler with an extremely large dungeon for you to explore. There is a limiting factor, however, in that every playthrough is based upon that same dungeon. But this doesn't stop the game from still being very fun. There are 4 distinct classes to play as, and they each unlock different paths and methods of playing the game, so yet another piece in prolonging gameplay. Lastly, and favored mostly by me, is the level editor, which basically contains as much power as dev tools. It can be a bit confusing at first, and I still have trouble figuring out how to do some things, but it is very possible to continue on with experience. All in all, I highly recommend this game (especially if you get a deal on it) to anyone who likes fast-paced action games. 8.5/10			"

												When i bought this game I thought it looked pretty neat and fun. It was way more than that. It is a game that is a nightmare of purely addicting, chaotic fun! I basically fell in live with this bullet hell/dungeon crawler/puzzle/adventure/whatever the hell else there is after the first 10 minutes of playing. The satisfaction of killing everything like a mass murderer is definiteally there. The joy of collecting loot everywhere you go is there. The satisfaction of listening to that amazing music that fits perfectly everywhere you go is there. It is a great joy to kill each boss and amazing to feel the skill within when you run through a pack of 100 poison spitting worms and...get killed by a bat? But seriously its truly satisfying to weave through the enemies' projectiles and murder them all at once. There is so much more i could say but ill save you from reading a 10 page long report on the greatness of Hammerwatch. Oh and dont forget to look for secrets that are cleverly hidden. This game deserves a 10/10 from me.			"

												It only took me a few levels to realise, but this is actually a really well-done Gauntlet clone. The secret level is even done in Gauntlet-style graphics!Really fun hack & slash action. The amount of loot is huge and sometimes you chew through screens of enemies it's hilariously intense and exciting.Moves fast enough to be varied but lets you explore and rewards you for doing so. A well balanced and just downright fun game.If you like classic arcade games, and especially if you liked Gauntlet, get this.My only gripe is that it really needs a rapid fire controller. It would be nice if they just made the attack button rapid fire to start with.			"

												I'm not even on the third floor yet and i'm already hooked on this game.  I grew up with a game called Gauntlet at the local arcade, and Hammerwatch brings me back to that.  Local coop is starting to appear in more and more PC games and this game does it very well.  A buddy and I spent an hour playing and we'd probably still be going right now if we didn't have to leave for work.Buy this game if you're looking for an awesome action RPG, solo or with friends.

												Even though my brother kept insisting we were missing a plank, I essentially just assured him that 'it can't possibly be that important'.So this is a game and it's a little like old gauntlet. It's not really that much reminiscent of it honestly, but it's still pretty close. Regardless it's quite enjoyable. I'd say that it can be a tad lacking if you're only playing singleplayer, but the four man online mplayer is pretty much where it will shine. I'd say that if you're considering getting it as a singleplayer experience you should make sure it's the type of game you want really.I don't actually have many problems with the game in terms of it's mechanics and the like. It functions pretty well overall, but the 'combos' that some classes benefit from feel a bit awkward. At the same time you are kind of like 'man we need to keep this combo going!' so it can be a tad bit exciting. Still kinda awkward though. I don't really feel great about the lives system. I never really encountered it as being a problem per say, but when you can save and load it feels a little bit more of a second thought.I like the abilities and the fact you can sorta 'spec' into things, but it feels like you are just going to spec broadly because of the exponential increase in cost. It's fine though I feel, just not amazing.Overall the game is solid, but nothing to call game of the year. I'd still recommend it. Make sure you check a gameplay video out before buying!			"

Although the multiplayer is a bit confusing, it DOES work, and that makes it awesome so long as you have some friends to play it :)There's also some pretty insane user content, like levels from Hexen 64 :DHere's my First Look at Hammerwatch's Paladin class!

												Hammerwatch is not a great game, but it is certainly enjoyable.The game itself is pretty straightforward. Choose a hero, hack through waves and waves of enemies, buy upgrades, kill even more enemies, get more upgrades, kill a boss, get to the next level, start the whole process over. However dull that may sound, player will often suffer from the ""one more"" syndrome - ""I will wipe one more floor and I will go to bed"", ""I'll clear one more level and I'm going to do something else"" - which prolongs the time one spends playing it.Hammerwatch has a very pleasant art style. The graphics is pixelated (in a good manner) and generally looks quite pretty and also fits the dungeon crawler theme. The only problem would be some single coins being too small to notice when lying directly behind a wall.The game seems to have lots of content - enemies, levels, secret areas, traps, puzzles, bosses, upgrades. But the gameplay itself is a little too shallow, so playing for more than 2 hours feels like a chore (and makes your fingers hurt for bashing the skill buttons). There is a level editor and Steam Workshop integration, so probably there are more fun scenarios to play rather than the original ones. There's also a multiplayer mode, which I had no chance to test and I deeply regret it because it looks like the game's value shines much brighter with it.The game could use some improvements with loot system being the most important one in my opinion. Currently, there are only 4 things that can be picked up: gold, hp/mana pots, vendor coins and extra lives. Implementing some more interesting loot system could really improve the overall value of the game and increase the feeling of playing a good roguelike (luck based drops that sometimes set you up for a level and sometimes require specific play style to benefit). Lack of randomly generated worlds is also a little bit bummer, as it decreases replayability value a lot, however, it is understandable that some of the current elements (puzzles, secret areas) would just not work with generated floors so devs had to make a decision there.As I said in the beginning, Hammerwatch is not a great game. However, it is often to be found at 90% discount (1€~), which is a crazy good price for a solid game like this one. I bought it on one of such occassions and I don't regret it. Paying the full price might be a bit to steep, though. All in all, I had some fun playing it and I will have some more, because I am not finished yet.  "

And the simple yet challenging gameplay is lovely stuff. Keeps me coming back. I always wonder what these throwbacks and roguelikes feel like to gamers who were born too late to play video games in the late '80s and early '90s, because so much of the wonder of these games for me is reliving those nascent glory days that set the stage for my life-long fascination with gaming. I thoroughly recommend this game, even when it makes me want to Hulk Smash my computer.			"

												At the moment of writing this I have only played about an hour of Hammerwatch, so feel free to disregard my ""review"" if that doesn't seem like enough to get a fair taste.I have always disliked the control-style Hammerwatch uses, but it also implements a few nifty commands that actually makes it work rather well. It does takes a bit of getting used to - unless you're familiar with and/or comfortable with this type of controls - but you should quickly get a hang of it. From what I've gathered this is a game about navigating a labyrinthine dungeon of numerous levels, finding secrets and solving simple puzzles, gathering money-loot and buying skill/ability upgrades, last but not least, it's all about killing hordes of beasts and other foul beings.A keyboard-based (or controller, I think, haven't tested) hack&slash for singleplayer or co-op. If you like the abovementioned concepts and don't mind getting lost now and again, then I'd recommend you Hammerwatch.(If my opinion should change I'll come back and edit this - unless I forget to)			"

												Hi folks,this is not gonna be an in-depth review of the whole game mechanics, but I'd like to make a few overall comments on the game itself. Let's start with the good:The game is certainly a hommage to games like the good ol' ""Gauntlet"" Series of the 1980s and the retro-style ""pixelated"" graphics are done very nicely. The levels are huge, the automap works quite well and there a few classes which have different attributes and skills the user can upgrade and use.The soundtrack is okay (though it can get repetitive when playing through large areas) and the upgrading system including the collectable ""vendor coins"" is okay, too.Generally, playing the game can be fun at first - even if you only play it in single player as I did. Anyhow, I'd imagine that playing together with a friend would be even more fun. So far, the game looks like a solid arcade action retro title.But now let's move on to the things which are not so nice. Unfortunately, those are quite a few.1) The game is insanely repetitive. The level sprites and textures change, agreed, Some new enemies show up here and there, agreed. But that's about it. You literally fight thousands upon thousands of the same enemies the same way. Attack, back off, repeat until end of level. Repat until boss. Slay boss. Repeat until end of game. *sigh* In the end your tactics hardly even matter - since the enemies' moving patterns are simplistic (and so are your own), you won't come up with something fancy. Finally, you'll find yourself strafing and auto-firing all along (if you play a ranged class that is). Initially, this is fun, but after two or three hours of doing it all over again, you wish for some fresh air in the game play. Sadly, your wishes will not be fulfilled...2) The balance between the different classes is completely off. While playing e.g. with a ranger or priest, you can safely attack from afar in most situations without ever breaking to sweat while slaying thousands of pathetic enemies. If you choose a melee-based class instead which cannot heal automatically (and you are playing in single player), you will find yourself fighting for your very life against almost every single mob of enemies (health items are scarce). 3) The level design and ""puzzles"" have a certain way of frustrating you. While solving the puzzles is ridiculously easy, navigating around obstacles and traps on the ground is often needlessly cumbersome and unnerving. Oh, and before I forget: Killing off the player for walking into a trap he cannot foresee / anticipate without giving him a chance to react as in the addon (""boulders"") is ever so annoying.Even when finishing a level, there is almost never a way of turning off those traps. Why bother, when the level is finished anyway, you might ask! Well, I haven't mentioned the secret rooms and power ups, yet. There are alot of them (which I like) and some secret rooms are very well hidden (which I like, too). Unfortnately, this leads me straight to the next ""pain point"":4) Even on ""normal"", the game is hardly easy to beat without constantly looking for each and every power up and without cleverly waiting before you spend your hard-earned money on a shop (the vendor coins give you a cumulative discount). If you do not take the time to look for secret rooms and look really hard, you may have a hard time in the end. Needless to say that looking for secrets after clearing a level while constantly dodging traps sucks a lot. Even that would be okay, but unfortunately upgrading the wrong skills can lead you to a dead end for your character in the final stages or boss fights.5) Having said that, you might wonder why the devs of the game made the questionable choice of not allowing you ""back"" into earlier played levels of earlier ""acts"" to collect power ups and secrets. This can be very frustrating, especially if you know you must have missed something and thought you could go back later just to find out after beating a boss that you actually can't.6) Some boss fights are quite hard - which is actually okay. But some boss fights are simply unfair and it is nearly impossible to beat the boss without losing a lot of lives. Especially two bosses of the addon may be unbeatable with certain classes. This is even more frustrating when you try to prepare yourself for the boss fights, but there is not much you can do: You do not have access to earlier levels anymore and there is no way to upgrade your hero any further. Yep, that would be a dead end. Care to start anew and do it all over again? *ugh*7) I won't spoil the game ending for you, but there is something I cannot forgive the devs of this game, no matter how hard I try: It's a question of honor that beating a game should give the player some kind of reward (and not a slap in the face). Suffice it so say that if you do not collect all (or at least very many) of the ""planks"" in the game you'll get slapped very hard. Oh, right: You're not told this by the game until it is too late (Yes, you are told that you should collect planks but you are not told *how* important they are or what they are for).Oh, right: And even if you do know, you still can't go back to earlier levels - so if you miss a plank (which, of course, you will only know in the end if it is too late), you can do it all over again...Oh, right: This means that you would have to play the game with a walkthrough from the very first level or spend hours of looking for the secrets without ever knowing whether you have really found everything!Oh, right: This sucks the most. After playing 8+ hours and beating the game I realized that there is no way I can beat the game ""correctly"" wihtout having to start all over again and I simply didn't know until it was too late.I certainly can accept that ""better game endings"" or special rewards may be reserved for those playing on higher difficulty levels - that alone would be okay. But blaming the player for not finding every well-hidden secret in the game is simply not fair. There are so many other and better ways of designing a game with ""collectables"" - e.g. take the recent ""Batman"" series which still allow you to collect all hidden items even after defeating the very last boss and beating the game. You can even find ""helper items"" which allow you to better locate the secrets. Why not use something similar here as well? *sigh*So, what's it gonna be in the end?The game has potential and there may be some nice mods around. It may be a lot more fun to play with a friend (and easier, too). But all in all, I will never play this game again after beating it once (also not in multi player). There is simply nothing new which would tease me to do it all over again.When having to judge, I'd give this a 5 out of 10 stars at the most. For the pain point 7) I'll subtract another star which leads me to a 4 out of 10.=> All in all, I'd rather recommend a different game of the same genre - but maybe the game will be more to your liking...

												Well... my personal opinion on this game is right in the ""middle"" ground. But nevertheless, it was just enough fun to let me recommend it... but the limit was nearly crossed. First, the solo game, ""medium"" difficulty. Dungeons are really huge, so huge that sometimes I felt bored. The secrets are sometimes really well hidden, namely hints are not strong enough. After a dungeon ""cleanup"" (namely 100% money harvested and minions killed), I wander into the whole ""floor"" for forgotten secrets... and they are so vast, I was nearly disgusted. On the same level, there is so many monsters and so much money to harvest... for toooo long. The bosses and middle-bosses are really hard (kind of out of phase with the overall difficulty), and not loosing quite many lives is damn hard (or you need to do it many times and find ""the trick"" to avoid loosing even a single life).Online multiplayer: the game does not manage IPv4 UPNP for port redirection (at the time of writing), then if you are behind a IPv4 NAT, your will have to perform port (9995) redirection manually on your router in order to be able to host a game. For the few games I was able to join and not be kicked out... no point. Games were messy and short. The ""tower defense"" map is really a loss of time. I think the right way to do it is to find people on the community forum and organize multiplayer games with them.Maybe that game ""grows"" on you when you try to perfect it, for hardcore gaming. I may give some other tries in the future, who knows. The game worked with the linux radeon open source driver and has a 64bits native build.As usual, achievements were not unlocked for me. Seems to be a steam bug, or ""bugs"" on my internet line...			"

												Hammerwatch is a great co-op experience for two or more players. The game is very skill-based and reminds me of old school classics like Alien Breed or The Chaos Engine, yet it gives gamers the possibility to tweak its difficulty, which effectively lowers the entry level to a point suitable for almost everyone. The graphics are really nice (if you like this stylization) and the OST is really great. The downsides? I’m really missing gaining XP for killing mobs here. This and learning extra skills. The two basic ones you get at the beginning become quite boring after a few hours and new ones come late into the game. Still, Hammerwatch is a really good game that will bring you a ton of fun and I really recommend giving it a shot.			"

												This is game is great if you like dungeaon crawlers.  Hours could be sinked into this game if you decide to play through the campaign (which I have yet to do).  The best about this game(in my opinion) is the co-op.  Its great when ou are able to get a few friends together and play.  However, your multiplayer progress is not saved.  Meaning you will ave to start over each time you play with friends(campaign).  Their are several other game modes that I have yet to try out, but I am sure they are great as well.			"

												Simple mechanics and controls. Visually pleasing. 4 different classes with different stats and abilities. Money is spent on upgrading abilities (pre-determined upgrade types.) Not sure about single-player, but co-op is extremely fun and challenging (you'll probably die a lot.) Save system in co-op is a bit odd, though. The areas in the second half in the game start to wear on you (lots of walking around, tons of enemies.) Took over 6 hours to beat with 3 players on first try. Not a whole lot to say as it's a very simply designed game, but it was much better than expected.			"

												I'm recommending this game solely on the basis of it being fun with friends. It's a decent dungeoncrawler, the challenges and crutches are fun, the fact it has workshop access and occasional updates is great.HOWEVER, and this is a BIG ♥♥♥♥ING HOWEVER, good luck playing it online with people who aren't your close friends. You'll get kicked from 90% of the lobbies and games you join without a word or anyone saying anything edgewise. The most polite way I can put it is that it's like gradeschool physical education all over again. You want teams to pick you. But then they pick you last.

												When I first put this game on my wishlist, I did it for the steam achievement. About six months later I found that the game was on sale for around $1 and so i got it for my friend and I to play on the week ends... we played for 2 days straight. This is the most AMAZING dungeon crawler game I have ever played. The game has the simple aspect to it but still gives you the ""I am never going to get bored of this game!"" kind of feeling. i have had this game for around a year now and have looked and looked and can never find a game compairable to it. I love this game and i would say the only downside to it is the main game ends. I cant find a steam workshop creation nearly as good as the main game and now that I am done with the 2 main games I have been wanting more. If they add another main game i will have satisfaction for another year. This game is incredible and if you havend gotten it, I highly suggest doing so.			"

Now I have surpassed him in the game and have already clocked in twice the number of hours he has.  Hammerwatch is very basic in the way it plays, but the level of difficulty and the different modes of play keep me sucked into the game. I have already convinced two others to buy it so we can have a full crew battle through the dungeon.    Definitely worth the money I paid for it.			"

												I could sum this game up by saying, This game is amazingly addicting.. but I'll tack on a proper short review. There are a variety of things that come together in this game, a mix of of retro-style graphics, with modern conveniences such as a well done musical score, a good auto-map and loads of replayability via the included editor and Community maps made from it. The goal of the game is simple.. storm the evil castle, collect it's tasty treasures, and live! All of that is easier said than done, as you've got hoardes of fun-to-kill creatures intent on feasting on your intrails, various traps, and challenging boss encounters between you and success.Controls 8/10 Controls can be abit sluggish occassionally, but definitely nothing to toss your keyboard through the window over.Movement is with the WASD keys, and your various attacks are with the arrow keys. This game has controller support though I have never used it, I have heard some say the controller support is poorly implemented, but the keyboard controls just work, and they feel right after your first few OOOOH dude moments. Holding Space bar ""locks"" you into whatever direction you are facing while you move around, and holding Left Shift makes you stand in place so you can face any direction you want without moving. F key drinks whatever potion you may have from Rejuvination to temporary Invulnerability.Sound 9/10The music is what happens when 8 bit whackiness meets intense symphonic orchestration. It will be in your head, and matches the frantic pace of the gameplay perfectly. Gameplay 8/10This game is Amazing! You can set various 'challenges' before you begin a map, such as starting with 1 HP, or sharing HP, or set some 'crutches' or handicaps like unlimited lives and health regeneration so you can really tailor the already great experience to your own twisted needs. There are a a number of classes to choose from like the Paladin who is a defensive animal, hiding behind his shield blocking most projectile attacks while slashing away valiantly when monsters get foolish enough to get close to him, the ranger who can shoot from a good safe distance, the priest who can heal or deal damage with a beam of energy and drop some neato energy draining fields that will heal people who stand in it if monsters are getting damaged in it. Warlocks who can poison creatures with their dagger and toss some cool lightning around.. And mage, with his AoE short range fireballs, and ability to call in a meteor shower to rain in some arcane devastation. And each class really brings a different feel to the game. Everything is in a nice top down view which really helps in this type of game. Overall I'd give this game 8½ / 10, and totally reccomend it.			"

												Very good. I have trouble trying to come up with any reason not to get Hammerwatch. It has everything I look for in a game: great level design, fun yet responsive controls, a decent amount of difficulty, pretty visuals, a non-distracting, more inferred than told story and the best coop I've seen in a while. Each of the four classes is fun to play, I found that neither is more suited than the others in every situation, each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the situation at hand. It's very satisfying to master each class, that enough had me coming back even after beating the game once. The secrets hidden in the world of Hammerwatch are a big part of the game and I found that going after all of them adds a lot to the experience, which can be said about very few games. Playing the coop campaign in this game is the best part of it all. Having two or more players of complementing abilities adds a whole new level of combat strategy with the teamwork that arises. Hammerwatch is one of the rare games that come up once in a while and remind me why I love games.Pros:+ fun in singleplayer+ better with friends+ the music, the visuals+ just about everything elseCons:- might be fixed by now but my Creative sound card had a few issues with the game when I started, I got a bsod and the save got corrupted so I had so start over			"

												I've only played this for a short time but I can already tell you it is an amazing little game.It's brilliant if you're looking to run around and kill hordes of monsters and explore a dungeon. It reminds me very much of the old ""Gaunlet"" games. If you were a fan of those, odds are you will definately enjoy this.Built in Controller support is very handy too!			"

												The game is great, very addictive. My only problem with the game is the community itself. They need to update the game to make the private lobby button take up half the screen because people are blind. It's annoying joiing seven games and being kicked from every single one because it's a ""private game."" Or better yet just make the private button auto checked so people won't be kicked from ten games before finding an open server.			"

												Simple but not simplistic, fast paced dungeon crawling little thing with great music. Immensely satisfying killing sounds and coins clinging. The killstreak-combo system makes an aggresive playstyle preferrable. Local Co-Op works very well, the classes are pretty diverse and good teamwork is needed, especially during the boss battles. Great soundtrack, although it gets pretty repetitive (only 1 track per ""world"", spanning several dungeon floors, and tracks for each boss), another reasonsto get through the levels fast and aggressive. Secrets, upgrades, spikes, the good stuff. Adorable skeletons.			"

												Hammerwatch is fantastic!  I only spent 3$ on this and I've gotten more enjoyment from it than most 60$ titles.  There is a vast array of characters to choose from, something to suit everyone's play style.  Characters start off underpowered to give just the right amount of struggle, but survive long enough and get a bunch of upgrades and you will feel unstoppable as you smash through hordes of enemies.There are a ton of hidden secrets and puzzles to solve, giving the game's core campaign's a ton of replay value.   The game also includes steamworks so you can download as many user created maps as you would like, or try your hand at the level editor and make your own.  This game gets even better when your playing with friends, especially the local co op.  I highly recommend trying out Hammerwatch.			"

Do you like the original Gauntlet games?If yes, buy this game and enjoy the heck out of it, like I am, since Hammerwatch is basically Gauntlet 1 and 2 reborn.If not, move on, this game isn't for you.

THe thing i like most about this game is that it caters to all players.IF you want, you can play throuhg the whole thing without having to worry about dying, you do this by enabling one of the ""crutches"", essentaily its a cheat but for those who just like a casual game and dont want to worry about permadeath this is a great feature. You then have standard gameplay modes wiht different dificulty. whch offer you the vanilla gameplay experience. And finaly you can add no end of crazy dificulty modes like shared HP, 1HP, reverse health regen etc. This game is best played on a controler unless you want to break your fingers repeatedly using your WSAD and Arrow keys to move and use skills.Great buy i purchased this game for me and 2 friends during the xmas sales and have no regrets on the purchase at all!

It's a decent dungeoncrawler, the challenges and crutches are fun, the fact it has workshop access and occasional updates is great.HOWEVER, and this is a BIG ♥♥♥♥ING HOWEVER, good luck playing it online with people who aren't your close friends. You'll get kicked from 90% of the lobbies and games you join without a word or anyone saying anything edgewise. The most polite way I can put it is that it's like gradeschool physical education all over again. You want teams to pick you. But then they pick you last.

												Simple mechanics and controls. Visually pleasing. 4 different classes with different stats and abilities. Money is spent on upgrading abilities (pre-determined upgrade types.) Not sure about single-player, but co-op is extremely fun and challenging (you'll probably die a lot.) Save system in co-op is a bit odd, though. The areas in the second half in the game start to wear on you (lots of walking around, tons of enemies.) Took over 6 hours to beat with 3 players on first try. Not a whole lot to say as it's a very simply designed game, but it was much better than expected.			"

												Hammerwatch is a fun game. The graphics are charming, and dungeon crawling element is very entertaining. Although, the 8-direction movement can make combat difficult and choppy, but it is not very hard to work with. Another bothersome aspect is the saving feature. you find places where you can save, and it is also your new spawnpoint, and if your game ends in a game over you may return to your game through the ''load'' section, which is confusing. This section only displays the date you played the game on, so if you play more than one game, it becomes confusing. Also, games played through the ''load'' section can not be played with other people, whether or not the game began as multiplayer. The multiplayer function is easy, flowing and fun. The different hero choices are between 4 characters, each with there own attacks. Overall, the game is fun, and has potential for more maps and possibly characters. One major annoyance to me is that there isn't any type of gear whatsoever, which seems like a standard for rpg games.This game is cute, fun, but seems to need improvement. Honestly, 10 dollars may be a bit steep for this game, but if you enjoy hack and slash classic games, it may be worth it.			"

												Brilliantly done retro Action RPG that is a lot of fun to play with friends. The goal of the game is to get through a number of sprawling dungeons, filled with enemies, loot, obscure secrets and boss fights, with a big emphasis on combat and looting.The gameplay reminds me a lot of Zelda: A Link To The Past in the way you control your character, though instead of fighting one and one enemy, here it is all about fighting stupidly huge hordes of enemies and getting the highest kill combos possible to activate special abilities, while also dodging a large ammount of projectiles, which lend itself really well to this type of gameplay due to it's smooth controlls. However, you do want to play it with friends, as there appears to be little to no difficulty scaling according to the ammount of players, and you are gonna die a lot if you don't have some friends with you to help.Something also worth noting is that despite it's retro look and game style, it avoids going into Rougelike territory and instead opts with premade maps and a extra lives system, which I like myself as I prefer a well designed static map and more tries per game, though if you want your experience to be randomized you might have to look elsewhere for that. However, the game comes bundled with a map editor so you can make your own dungeons to spice things up after beating the official campaign. It's a bit repetitive, but as a pure multiplayer game it's entertaining, challenging without being unfair most of the time and sports a great retro look and feel without having that limit the quality of the gameplay itself. Worth checking out for sure along with some friends.			"

												Do not buy this game. It was a waste of money and time. Abort. Abort. It seems like people use spite animation as an excuse to call themselves artsy and still release a♥♥♥♥♥♥tier game. Legend of Zelda for NES actually had better graphics and stronger art direction 27 YEARS ago.Hammerwatch plays exactly like it looks. Like a cheap LoZ clone with 100% less depth and entertainment value. I actually beat the first boss(3,500 pointless monster kills and two hours into the game) without ever seeing it. The ranger class could hit the boss before it was even on the screen. 10 min later of pointlessly mashing my attack button, the boss died without ceremony. The health of the boss was absurdly high compared to my character's power level. I think the developer might have been one of those people who thought monster health stacking was a great mechanic to increase difficulty.This game was probably the biggest waste of eight dollars I've had in a long time. The only positive thing I can say about this game was that I only got it for eight dollars because it was on sale when I bought it.Did I mention it took TWO HOURS and 3,500 minion kills to get to the first boss?Jesus Christ.

												After reading some of the reviews people had on metacritic, I decided to write a little something here on steam. While this game is both singleplayer and multiplayer, I found it more fun to play it coop then singleplayer.. I have played and seen all the classes. Each ofcourse has his own advantage. The paladin can block arrows, can heal later in the game and hits quite fast, but is bad against stronger or many mage class enemies. The ranger has enough range to kill most spawnpoints without getting near, but has avarage health and mana. The mage has an AOE fireball, but has little health. And finally the warlock has a poison dagger and an AOE shockball (for mana). The downsides of this class is the limited arc of the dagger (compensated by the shockball).The castle is the same every time you go through it, so if you want to have a different map each playthrough you're out of luck. This said, the maps are big. You need a lot of time to clear them and then some more time to find the secrets in this game. These are well hidden and you need a good eye. Also, while there is only one campaing at this time, the game has a leveleditor to make your own maps. Futhermore, the enemies are more of the same all the time. You have ranged, melee and caster enemies, each with certain abilities (faster, poison etc.). One might find this repetitive, but then again this is a hack and slash game; they are always repetative. The coop game I played lasted about 7 hours for me.In general I would give this game an 8 out of 10.			"

												Tons of fun with a friend, lots of secrets to find and hordes of enemies to destroy. Not a huge amount of replayability since the game is the same each time, but four different classes can add some variety. Just remember, make sure not to miss any of the eight boards you find along the way!			"

												A great, classic, Gauntlet-like experience. The first adventure is a linear dungeon romp, but the second official adventure is really where this game shines. Both are quite challenging, though there are special modifiers to gameplay that decrease (or increase) challenge if you so wish. Definitely better when playing hotseat multi-player. And of course, Workshop support! Pick it up, you don't regret it.			"

												Both the premise as the game mechanics are so simple and to-the-point, yet the game manages to be strangely addicting and captivate the player to explore every corner and find every secret while trying to survive horders of enemies.Playing it co-op only increases the fun and the game nicely adapts to more players with more enemies.Be sure to check out the old-school CRT style graphic effects so you can play Hammerwatch on a curved screen on a flat screen :p			"

												I think this game is great for several reasons. First of all, i think that the allows for a wide and varying way to play the game. While you always play the same levels each playthrough, you get a completely different experience with strategy and pacing depending on both difficulty and character class that you choose. Becuase of this, playing the same levels is not much of a problem. Single player is a very enjoyable experience, with the game being balanced for any character to compete the game on their own, at least with enough skill. Multiplayer is also a lot of fun, changing the gameplay by a lot, increasing the ways you can enjoy the game even more. With the hours I've spent playing the game, i do think it is worth buying.			"

												Friend suggested this to me for a variation on our Co-op playing, and well worth it.  The game's retro art style may be a bit pixelated, but it's clean, crisp, artistic pixels.  Gameplay is solid top down hack and slash and every character class feels different with it's own play styles.There does feel to be some balance issues with the classes, at least in solo play, as some classes are decidedly stronger in different stages of the game, but in a team you can balance that out against each other.  For instance, Ranger's abbility to snipe at a large distance is very useful early on, while Warlock in the early game just has a basic dagger and a spell that, while powerful, recharges slowly.   But by endgame the ranger has to pick it's fights more carefully while the Warlock can use it's third spell and run through multiple monster spawners, regaining HP from hits and mana to recast the spell infinitely.The music is solid, though a bit more variation could be nice, the main Hammerwatch Campaign uses one song for each set of 3 floors within a Act, plus a boss theme, and a Retro theme for the Secret levels.   And since each act can take about 2 hours, you'll hear that same song a long time.   It's good but a variation wouldn't hurt.The main campaign is worth revisiting a time or two, but nothing changes aside from difficulty and which character you use, while there's also Temple of the Sun with some differences to the formula.  But it need not end there, as Workshop lets players create their own maps, so the game should continue on for a while.   Only downside is, there's no way to create custom bosses or characters so unless the game gets a update on those, the challenge will come from floor design.All in all a 8/10 experience, and that's only because I'm late to the party.   With maybe some character tweaks or even additional classes, and bosses, this could be a even better game, and since it's already recieved one major patch, I wouldn't rule anything out at any time.

												I still haven't been able to finish this game all the way through, but I have had one hell of a good time so far. Having several classes to choose from makes each runthrough all the more different and having those vendors set up all around the dungeons makes for a seemingly endless number of possibilities of how your run will turn out. Part of me wishes that it was a randomly generated dungeon each time, because I think it would work very well for this game, but it seems to be fine how it is, the dungeons are confusing enough, random generation would make me go insane. And from what I take from the story, you have been separated from your group due to a collapsed bridge and you're forced to traverse the monster dwelling dungeon to reach your goal. Gold, mana crystals, food, keys, and other items will aide you throughout your quest. Fight monsters/bosses, solve puzzles, upgrade your character, you name it! All can be done in the game, Hammerwatch.There are quite a few games nowadays that use pixel-art to stylize their games, but in many occasions, it's not never well done and looks similar to something drawn in MSpaint. HOWEVER this is not one of those games. Whoever made this game should be patted on the back and given a firm handshake for the look of this game. This game is dang beatiful, if I may say so myself. The use of shaders is also very well done. The realistic lighting, bloom/glow effects, dark and colorised lighting makes it just that much better and works well to set the general dark mood of the game.One issue that I have run into is the saving. You save by standing on a checkpoint and it overwrites your previous save to one designated run slot. If you died, you can re-load the save and you'll start back from the last time you reached a checkpoint. BUT, this can be extremely aggrivating if you save at a checkpoint with low health. You'll continue to start back with that same amount of health until you find some food, and if you're in a position where there's basically none, you'll have to die and die and die and die untill eventually you weasel your way through the dungeon on scraps that the enemies drop. Another issue I've found is the difficulty. Bear  in mind I was on the Medium difficulty and you can set it to Easier in-game, I'm just noting my experience. After a few floors have passed you'll find yourself being bombarded with constantly respawning enemies at ""nests"". They spawn so quickly that it's inevitable that you're going to take a few hits while trying to take it out. This is find for one or two nests, but when there are like 15 in one room, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. And I was on Medium, I couldn't imagine doing that on hard mode. Other than those blasted nests, the enemies are pretty fairly balanced, you got slow moving large-healthed monsters, fast moving low-healthed, very slow moving but capable of shooting projectiles. Difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be fine.Other than these two extremely miniscule issues, this game is perfect. I highly recommend picking it up at full price or on sale.

												I first bought this game a few months after it came out and at first I didn't really like it that much... I always said I would give it another try and this is what I did last week with some friends and I gotta say, we all had a wonderfull time. The game has been updated a lot and it is really good now.The gameplay is nice. The controls are tight.  It may look like some kind of numb Hack and Slash like Diablo 3 where all you have to do is hold your mouse button and move, but it's not. The game is really hard and if you don't come up with a good strategy with your co-op partners you will not survive. Any of the 6 classes can come up to be very usefull in a team. Playing different classes over different playthough is the biggest replay value in my opinion. There are different gameplay mods though and they just released a whole new campaign with new maps and new bosses. That being said, the main campaign is not short. I would say it would take at least 5 hours to beat the first time and even more. This is why you need good friends to co-op this game because you might wanna save your state and come back later to finish.The game has epic 16 bit graphics that will bring your child's memory back. Every class you can play are beautifully charming to admire and it's pretty much the same with any mobs, bosses, floors, traps and stuff in the game. There are small details everywhere that makes the look perfect. The music is also awesome.If you are looking for a great dungeon-crawler indie game, this title is for you.			"

I would rate this game a 9\10 it is long if you solo play and actually try to get all the secerts in the game.This is a must buy for any old school gamer or even newer gen gamers, I just finished this game and I have about 40 hours in it. The expansion is long considering the the length of the items you have to obtained, the down fall in this expansion is there is only two bosses, that are pretty easy to kill. I was hoping for the expansion to be alot longer and have more bosses, maybe in the next expansion if they create one. The other plus side to the game is player made maps, I have tried out the editor and feels very clunky for a novice user.  The bonus levels are a trip back to the 80's and I won't spoil that for any new comer, THIS GAME IS WORTH THE MONEY!!			"

												With labyrinth-esque dungeons, deadly traps, and hordes of enemies all skinned with a stylized 16-bit retro flair, Hammerwatch presents near endless hack-and-slash rogue-like action for up to four players to enjoy together. Reminiscent of old classics such as Gauntlet, players are thrown into the bowels of Castle Hammerwatch as one of six playable classes, and must proceed through four Acts of increasing difficulty as they struggle to ascend to the top of the castle and find what treasure awaits them; fighting off seemingly endless enemies and four blood-thirsty bosses as they do.Each class in the game has its own unique traits and abilities along with upgrade paths available for purchase from hidden merchants throughout the various dungeons. Of these classes, the Thief is the one I frequent the most. With high mobility and a wide attack range from his dual wielded daggers, the thief is all about getting in and out dangerous situations while cutting down swathes of enemies with his blisteringly high attack speed. As for skills, the Thief starts out with Fan of Knives, which upon activation throws multiple knives in an arc in front of him, damaging and piercing through multiple enemies. His two other unlockable skills are Grappling Hook and Smoke Bombs, the first of which can be used to hook any nearby wall and then quickly pull you towards it, stunning foes in the process; while the latter acts as a large area of effect (AoE) stun. A unique feature that only applies to the Thief however is that while all his skills cost significantly less mana than the other classes, they also have a secondary cost of gold, which partially balanced by his passive ability to steal gold off the corpses of slain enemies. In addition to the Thief, the other five playable classes available at this moment are the Paladin, squaring off behind his towering shield, the Ranger, which focuses on ranged attacks with his bow and wave clearing bombs, the fireball casting Wizard, the treacherous Warlock, wielding a poisoned dagger and blood magic, and lastly the Priest, who you guessed it, has a knack for healing teammates.A feature that really adds to the depth and replayability of Hammerwatch is it’s accessibility to being modded. This means custom campaigns, custom game types, new enemies, and hell, I’ve even seen prototypes for brand new playable classes on the forums. When the game first came out, it was all about downloading custom files and then manually adding them to the correct file folder the game’s directory for the mod to be installed correctly, but recently this all changed when the game finally got full Steam Workshop support, nearly a year after its initial release. This gives a huge new audience access to the piles of custom campaigns already out there, as well as inspire new modders to create even more content for that larger audience. In addition to its accessibility to installing and using mods, Hammerwatch also comes packaged with its own custom Level Editor/Development Program. With this tool you can do anything from drag and drop existing resources onto your workspace and make your own custom dungeons to even going as far as scripting and uploading your own custom resources. While the level editor program has a ton to it and can be rather intimidating to get into and start working in it, there are multiple Youtube video tutorials on the subject which will walk you through at least the basics.Although at its core, Hammerwatch is a retro hack-n-slash dungeon crawler, the base difficulty and default settings give a very rouge-like feel to the game as well. The players have a set amount of lives shared among them and once you run out, your progress is lost; and on top of that, even on normal difficulty, the game can be incredibly dangerous and difficult, with most traps and some enemies being able to kill you in just a single hit. And even though I happen to find enjoyment in getting dismembered time after time and then drowning in my own pity and incompetence at the game, others who have issues with the initial difficulty of the game can give themselves handicaps such as having infinite lives in the game settings to get rid of these rouge-like elements.With more than 25 hours logged in on it already and more to come once I gather my old group together to tackle some of the new Workshop content, I can say it’s been more than worth the low price point, and even more so if bought on Steam Sale. So if you’re into any game with high difficulty, looking for a game with some great nostalgic vibes, or just an enjoyable easy to get into Co-op game to play with some friends on your day off, then I highly recommend looking at Hammerwatch.

												I still haven't been able to finish this game all the way through, but I have had one hell of a good time so far. Having several classes to choose from makes each runthrough all the more different and having those vendors set up all around the dungeons makes for a seemingly endless number of possibilities of how your run will turn out. Part of me wishes that it was a randomly generated dungeon each time, because I think it would work very well for this game, but it seems to be fine how it is, the dungeons are confusing enough, random generation would make me go insane. And from what I take from the story, you have been separated from your group due to a collapsed bridge and you're forced to traverse the monster dwelling dungeon to reach your goal. Gold, mana crystals, food, keys, and other items will aide you throughout your quest. Fight monsters/bosses, solve puzzles, upgrade your character, you name it! All can be done in the game, Hammerwatch.There are quite a few games nowadays that use pixel-art to stylize their games, but in many occasions, it's not never well done and looks similar to something drawn in MSpaint. HOWEVER this is not one of those games. Whoever made this game should be patted on the back and given a firm handshake for the look of this game. This game is dang beatiful, if I may say so myself. The use of shaders is also very well done. The realistic lighting, bloom/glow effects, dark and colorised lighting makes it just that much better and works well to set the general dark mood of the game.One issue that I have run into is the saving. You save by standing on a checkpoint and it overwrites your previous save to one designated run slot. If you died, you can re-load the save and you'll start back from the last time you reached a checkpoint. BUT, this can be extremely aggrivating if you save at a checkpoint with low health. You'll continue to start back with that same amount of health until you find some food, and if you're in a position where there's basically none, you'll have to die and die and die and die untill eventually you weasel your way through the dungeon on scraps that the enemies drop. Another issue I've found is the difficulty. Bear  in mind I was on the Medium difficulty and you can set it to Easier in-game, I'm just noting my experience. After a few floors have passed you'll find yourself being bombarded with constantly respawning enemies at ""nests"". They spawn so quickly that it's inevitable that you're going to take a few hits while trying to take it out. This is find for one or two nests, but when there are like 15 in one room, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. And I was on Medium, I couldn't imagine doing that on hard mode. Other than those blasted nests, the enemies are pretty fairly balanced, you got slow moving large-healthed monsters, fast moving low-healthed, very slow moving but capable of shooting projectiles. Difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be fine.Other than these two extremely miniscule issues, this game is perfect. I highly recommend picking it up at full price or on sale.

												Friend suggested this to me for a variation on our Co-op playing, and well worth it.  The game's retro art style may be a bit pixelated, but it's clean, crisp, artistic pixels.  Gameplay is solid top down hack and slash and every character class feels different with it's own play styles.There does feel to be some balance issues with the classes, at least in solo play, as some classes are decidedly stronger in different stages of the game, but in a team you can balance that out against each other.  For instance, Ranger's abbility to snipe at a large distance is very useful early on, while Warlock in the early game just has a basic dagger and a spell that, while powerful, recharges slowly.   But by endgame the ranger has to pick it's fights more carefully while the Warlock can use it's third spell and run through multiple monster spawners, regaining HP from hits and mana to recast the spell infinitely.The music is solid, though a bit more variation could be nice, the main Hammerwatch Campaign uses one song for each set of 3 floors within a Act, plus a boss theme, and a Retro theme for the Secret levels.   And since each act can take about 2 hours, you'll hear that same song a long time.   It's good but a variation wouldn't hurt.The main campaign is worth revisiting a time or two, but nothing changes aside from difficulty and which character you use, while there's also Temple of the Sun with some differences to the formula.  But it need not end there, as Workshop lets players create their own maps, so the game should continue on for a while.   Only downside is, there's no way to create custom bosses or characters so unless the game gets a update on those, the challenge will come from floor design.All in all a 8/10 experience, and that's only because I'm late to the party.   With maybe some character tweaks or even additional classes, and bosses, this could be a even better game, and since it's already recieved one major patch, I wouldn't rule anything out at any time.

												Hammerwatch is an extremly fun coop experience. I would not recommend playing it with random people on the intenet, but with three friends this little game really shines at its best. I can't really imagine it being fun played alone though.The combat seems a bit repetetive and simple at first, but the game is really difficult, because of the sheer amount of enemies and everything feels very precise. I never felt bored when slashing through the absurd amount of enemies on the screen. There are some random elements, like randoms crits and stuns, but everything feels really skillbased. Everytime you die you know that it has been your own fault, there are hardly any cheap deaths (outside of the boss fights...).There are some minor flaws in the game though:One being that you have to do portfowarding, which isn't a problem for exerienced players, but may be a problem for some people. Also I could not get a local game to work, but I did not really bother me.Also I didn't enjoy the boss fights all that much, but maybe thats just me, since my friends seem to have enjoyed it. I found them quite cheap honestly.But overall this is a great game with a nice difficulty curve, challenging but not frustrating and it really encourages teamwork.			"

												I had a blast playing this game in a group of four this last summer. From the second I watched the impressive trailer I knew how fun this game looked, and I wasn't disappointed. Spent a number of late nights running through this challenging but thrilling indie wonder, still one of my top indie games of this last year.Edit: Months and months later, I am still playing Hammerwatch. This is a truly amazing game with a devoted indie team that is continually supporting us with new content for free. The new campaign was amazing. Seriously, they could have called it a whole new game and charged more money for it, and I would have been happy. Grab a copy, or much better yet, get a four pack and play with some buddies. I have gotten so much entertainment from this game for the small price I paid. There are few other games on Steam I could reccomend more for co-op fun.			"

The killstreak-combo system makes an aggresive playstyle preferrable. Local Co-Op works very well, the classes are pretty diverse and good teamwork is needed, especially during the boss battles. Great soundtrack, although it gets pretty repetitive (only 1 track per ""world"", spanning several dungeon floors, and tracks for each boss), another reasonsto get through the levels fast and aggressive.

												Honestly, I only bought this because my boyfriend had it and found it to be a fun time killer to play between classes.... Now I have surpassed him in the game and have already clocked in twice the number of hours he has.  Hammerwatch is very basic in the way it plays, but the level of difficulty and the different modes of play keep me sucked into the game. I have already convinced two others to buy it so we can have a full crew battle through the dungeon.    Definitely worth the money I paid for it.			"

												This is literally one of the most entertaining and enjoyable games I own on Steam.  Its fun alone, but best enjoyed with friends.  It is a very large game.  lots to do.  Its hard for me to imagine completing the story.  Not high end graphics, but the visuals are pretty if you ask me.  If you're looking for a game to kick back, and play with your friends, and you can get past/appreciate the dated art style this game might be worth getting.			"

												I bought the game right after its release. To be honest, it didn't really impressed me at the time. After 1-2 hours of playing, something occupied me and I left it there. It is fun, but sort of lack of the hook to bring me back to finish it.Since I got some time recently, and saw that there has been some patch for the game, plus with steam card added, I decide to replay it. And this time I am totally satisfied with what I've played.The game play is really smooth, with a controller support which is awesome.The stage scenes are great. Also offers various of mobs, though it gets a little bit (just a little bit) repetitive when I reached act 4. But for an indie title it is still very good. They also added some mini bosses, which was not included when released. It is nice to see that they are improving the game.I've also played a few hours on local multiplayer with a friend of mine. And it is just fun. (cuz i troll him if he is on a trap :D )The only thing I would like the game to have is to have more stories involved. Currently the plot, or you could say there is no plot... because you just get into the castle and kill everything you see. They do have NPCs through out the game, but there isn't really a interactive with them. So if there's more story involved, I think it would be a nice touch for the game. I would totally recommend the game if you like pixel art style, and if you like to slash through a huge amout of mobs at once.7.8/10 for me.			"

												I still haven't been able to finish this game all the way through, but I have had one hell of a good time so far. Having several classes to choose from makes each runthrough all the more different and having those vendors set up all around the dungeons makes for a seemingly endless number of possibilities of how your run will turn out. Part of me wishes that it was a randomly generated dungeon each time, because I think it would work very well for this game, but it seems to be fine how it is, the dungeons are confusing enough, random generation would make me go insane. And from what I take from the story, you have been separated from your group due to a collapsed bridge and you're forced to traverse the monster dwelling dungeon to reach your goal. Gold, mana crystals, food, keys, and other items will aide you throughout your quest. Fight monsters/bosses, solve puzzles, upgrade your character, you name it! All can be done in the game, Hammerwatch.There are quite a few games nowadays that use pixel-art to stylize their games, but in many occasions, it's not never well done and looks similar to something drawn in MSpaint. HOWEVER this is not one of those games. Whoever made this game should be patted on the back and given a firm handshake for the look of this game. This game is dang beatiful, if I may say so myself. The use of shaders is also very well done. The realistic lighting, bloom/glow effects, dark and colorised lighting makes it just that much better and works well to set the general dark mood of the game.One issue that I have run into is the saving. You save by standing on a checkpoint and it overwrites your previous save to one designated run slot. If you died, you can re-load the save and you'll start back from the last time you reached a checkpoint. BUT, this can be extremely aggrivating if you save at a checkpoint with low health. You'll continue to start back with that same amount of health until you find some food, and if you're in a position where there's basically none, you'll have to die and die and die and die untill eventually you weasel your way through the dungeon on scraps that the enemies drop. Another issue I've found is the difficulty. Bear  in mind I was on the Medium difficulty and you can set it to Easier in-game, I'm just noting my experience. After a few floors have passed you'll find yourself being bombarded with constantly respawning enemies at ""nests"". They spawn so quickly that it's inevitable that you're going to take a few hits while trying to take it out. This is find for one or two nests, but when there are like 15 in one room, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. And I was on Medium, I couldn't imagine doing that on hard mode. Other than those blasted nests, the enemies are pretty fairly balanced, you got slow moving large-healthed monsters, fast moving low-healthed, very slow moving but capable of shooting projectiles. Difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be fine.Other than these two extremely miniscule issues, this game is perfect. I highly recommend picking it up at full price or on sale.

												Hammerwatch is a nod to classic top-down dungeon crawlers like Gauntlet where the player is tasked with exploring, slaughtering monsters, collecting gold, and spending it on upgrades to lather, rinse, and repeat.  Workshop implementation means a huge potential for additional content down the road.The core campaign is pretty meaty.  It is highly recommended to play this game in multiplayer (class synergies will make exploring that much easier), though you can play singleplayer with little issue (depending on what class you select for yourself).Highly recommended, especially those nostalgic for this style of game.

												I could sum this game up by saying, This game is amazingly addicting.. but I'll tack on a proper short review. There are a variety of things that come together in this game, a mix of of retro-style graphics, with modern conveniences such as a well done musical score, a good auto-map and loads of replayability via the included editor and Community maps made from it. The goal of the game is simple.. storm the evil castle, collect it's tasty treasures, and live! All of that is easier said than done, as you've got hoardes of fun-to-kill creatures intent on feasting on your intrails, various traps, and challenging boss encounters between you and success.Controls 8/10 Controls can be abit sluggish occassionally, but definitely nothing to toss your keyboard through the window over.Movement is with the WASD keys, and your various attacks are with the arrow keys. This game has controller support though I have never used it, I have heard some say the controller support is poorly implemented, but the keyboard controls just work, and they feel right after your first few OOOOH dude moments. Holding Space bar ""locks"" you into whatever direction you are facing while you move around, and holding Left Shift makes you stand in place so you can face any direction you want without moving. F key drinks whatever potion you may have from Rejuvination to temporary Invulnerability.Sound 9/10The music is what happens when 8 bit whackiness meets intense symphonic orchestration. It will be in your head, and matches the frantic pace of the gameplay perfectly. Gameplay 8/10This game is Amazing! You can set various 'challenges' before you begin a map, such as starting with 1 HP, or sharing HP, or set some 'crutches' or handicaps like unlimited lives and health regeneration so you can really tailor the already great experience to your own twisted needs. There are a a number of classes to choose from like the Paladin who is a defensive animal, hiding behind his shield blocking most projectile attacks while slashing away valiantly when monsters get foolish enough to get close to him, the ranger who can shoot from a good safe distance, the priest who can heal or deal damage with a beam of energy and drop some neato energy draining fields that will heal people who stand in it if monsters are getting damaged in it. Warlocks who can poison creatures with their dagger and toss some cool lightning around.. And mage, with his AoE short range fireballs, and ability to call in a meteor shower to rain in some arcane devastation. And each class really brings a different feel to the game. Everything is in a nice top down view which really helps in this type of game. Overall I'd give this game 8½ / 10, and totally reccomend it.			"

												Friend suggested this to me for a variation on our Co-op playing, and well worth it.  The game's retro art style may be a bit pixelated, but it's clean, crisp, artistic pixels.  Gameplay is solid top down hack and slash and every character class feels different with it's own play styles.There does feel to be some balance issues with the classes, at least in solo play, as some classes are decidedly stronger in different stages of the game, but in a team you can balance that out against each other.  For instance, Ranger's abbility to snipe at a large distance is very useful early on, while Warlock in the early game just has a basic dagger and a spell that, while powerful, recharges slowly.   But by endgame the ranger has to pick it's fights more carefully while the Warlock can use it's third spell and run through multiple monster spawners, regaining HP from hits and mana to recast the spell infinitely.The music is solid, though a bit more variation could be nice, the main Hammerwatch Campaign uses one song for each set of 3 floors within a Act, plus a boss theme, and a Retro theme for the Secret levels.   And since each act can take about 2 hours, you'll hear that same song a long time.   It's good but a variation wouldn't hurt.The main campaign is worth revisiting a time or two, but nothing changes aside from difficulty and which character you use, while there's also Temple of the Sun with some differences to the formula.  But it need not end there, as Workshop lets players create their own maps, so the game should continue on for a while.   Only downside is, there's no way to create custom bosses or characters so unless the game gets a update on those, the challenge will come from floor design.All in all a 8/10 experience, and that's only because I'm late to the party.   With maybe some character tweaks or even additional classes, and bosses, this could be a even better game, and since it's already recieved one major patch, I wouldn't rule anything out at any time.

												With labyrinth-esque dungeons, deadly traps, and hordes of enemies all skinned with a stylized 16-bit retro flair, Hammerwatch presents near endless hack-and-slash rogue-like action for up to four players to enjoy together. Reminiscent of old classics such as Gauntlet, players are thrown into the bowels of Castle Hammerwatch as one of six playable classes, and must proceed through four Acts of increasing difficulty as they struggle to ascend to the top of the castle and find what treasure awaits them; fighting off seemingly endless enemies and four blood-thirsty bosses as they do.Each class in the game has its own unique traits and abilities along with upgrade paths available for purchase from hidden merchants throughout the various dungeons. Of these classes, the Thief is the one I frequent the most. With high mobility and a wide attack range from his dual wielded daggers, the thief is all about getting in and out dangerous situations while cutting down swathes of enemies with his blisteringly high attack speed. As for skills, the Thief starts out with Fan of Knives, which upon activation throws multiple knives in an arc in front of him, damaging and piercing through multiple enemies. His two other unlockable skills are Grappling Hook and Smoke Bombs, the first of which can be used to hook any nearby wall and then quickly pull you towards it, stunning foes in the process; while the latter acts as a large area of effect (AoE) stun. A unique feature that only applies to the Thief however is that while all his skills cost significantly less mana than the other classes, they also have a secondary cost of gold, which partially balanced by his passive ability to steal gold off the corpses of slain enemies. In addition to the Thief, the other five playable classes available at this moment are the Paladin, squaring off behind his towering shield, the Ranger, which focuses on ranged attacks with his bow and wave clearing bombs, the fireball casting Wizard, the treacherous Warlock, wielding a poisoned dagger and blood magic, and lastly the Priest, who you guessed it, has a knack for healing teammates.A feature that really adds to the depth and replayability of Hammerwatch is it’s accessibility to being modded. This means custom campaigns, custom game types, new enemies, and hell, I’ve even seen prototypes for brand new playable classes on the forums. When the game first came out, it was all about downloading custom files and then manually adding them to the correct file folder the game’s directory for the mod to be installed correctly, but recently this all changed when the game finally got full Steam Workshop support, nearly a year after its initial release. This gives a huge new audience access to the piles of custom campaigns already out there, as well as inspire new modders to create even more content for that larger audience. In addition to its accessibility to installing and using mods, Hammerwatch also comes packaged with its own custom Level Editor/Development Program. With this tool you can do anything from drag and drop existing resources onto your workspace and make your own custom dungeons to even going as far as scripting and uploading your own custom resources. While the level editor program has a ton to it and can be rather intimidating to get into and start working in it, there are multiple Youtube video tutorials on the subject which will walk you through at least the basics.Although at its core, Hammerwatch is a retro hack-n-slash dungeon crawler, the base difficulty and default settings give a very rouge-like feel to the game as well. The players have a set amount of lives shared among them and once you run out, your progress is lost; and on top of that, even on normal difficulty, the game can be incredibly dangerous and difficult, with most traps and some enemies being able to kill you in just a single hit. And even though I happen to find enjoyment in getting dismembered time after time and then drowning in my own pity and incompetence at the game, others who have issues with the initial difficulty of the game can give themselves handicaps such as having infinite lives in the game settings to get rid of these rouge-like elements.With more than 25 hours logged in on it already and more to come once I gather my old group together to tackle some of the new Workshop content, I can say it’s been more than worth the low price point, and even more so if bought on Steam Sale. So if you’re into any game with high difficulty, looking for a game with some great nostalgic vibes, or just an enjoyable easy to get into Co-op game to play with some friends on your day off, then I highly recommend looking at Hammerwatch.

This game will become exceptional when we start seeing more player-made content. The game itself is fun and reminiscent of the older dungeon crawling games. The art style is great and fun to look at.

												My friends and I enjoy playing co-op games together and were looking forward to checking out this rpg.  There are only a handful of characters when we played but they all have interesting powers that really ramp up as you level.  The levels are long and really challenging, so you'll want to play with as many friends as possible.  Sadly death comes easy, and you'll have to start at the beginning if everyone falls without making a save along the way.  What's interesting is that you can choose handicaps to make the game less challenging.  But then it feels like you're giving in to the difficulty. so you'll try to use as few as possible.The level selection is rather limited as well, and you can't choose an individual level within a campaign, which we found very debilitating.  Hammerwatch does have a level editor and community content, though we've never found the urge to try them with the amount of professionally done content the game had to offer.  Overall a fun game if you catch it on sale and are looking for something to play with friends.			"

												When I first played it, I will be honest, I did not enjoy it, but when I took another go at it about a week later... I really enjoyed it! I don't know what put me off on it before, but it's awesome. Classes, shops, abilities, and more! A very fun game, a little too difficult at times, but very cool. I recommend it! :)			"

												If you like Gauntlet-esc games, this is definatly a must have.  The punishing difficulty is well worth getting used to.  The only cons for me is that the mele classes suffer to much from any kind of lag.  Also the classes don't seem to have enough uniqeness to them (but that's probably just me). With only two cons and some of the best pros, it's a must have. 8/10.			"

												Hey Everyone this is my review about the game!This is a Pixel dungeon crawler game.Interface/Settings/MenuYou are able to play Local co-op.You are able to play online.There are many resolution sizes available.You are able to play fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a master volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.About the game.You are stuck inside of a dungeon. The bridge has collapsed and you are on the other side. This is not a rogue-like game. Enemies can be slain quickly but they are usally packed and swarmed. I think characters with ranging range has an advantage in the game. You are able to find money and food laying around. You do have a set of lives and everytime that you are dying. You will be set back to your last checkpoint. There are keys and secret area's. You are able to find some secret area's at cracked walls. Once you have run out of lives. Its just game over, which could happen fast.You are able to choose your class.There is a manual/instruction about the gameGame could be abit boring and repetitive.Game is okay.Gameplay is slow.Secret Area's.Lives.Shops and other stations.Graphics are okay. Pixelated and from topview.Music is decent.Other Things.None.I give this game a 7/10!			"

												Okay, So needless to say this game is great. Hack and slash, run forward with all your friends having shared hp and dive headfirst into a spike trap raising everyone's death count. I'm sure my friends love me when we beat the bosses afterwards. The game is great, its got puzzles and such but that isn't where I think this game will shine. This game will become exceptional when we start seeing more player-made content. The game itself is fun and reminiscent of the older dungeon crawling games. The art style is great and fun to look at. I would suggest getting this game with friends, as it is a little less fun while not able to rush the boss and let your friends take all the deaths.			"

												My friends and I enjoy playing co-op games together and were looking forward to checking out this rpg.  There are only a handful of characters when we played but they all have interesting powers that really ramp up as you level.  The levels are long and really challenging, so you'll want to play with as many friends as possible.  Sadly death comes easy, and you'll have to start at the beginning if everyone falls without making a save along the way.  What's interesting is that you can choose handicaps to make the game less challenging.  But then it feels like you're giving in to the difficulty. so you'll try to use as few as possible.The level selection is rather limited as well, and you can't choose an individual level within a campaign, which we found very debilitating.  Hammerwatch does have a level editor and community content, though we've never found the urge to try them with the amount of professionally done content the game had to offer.  Overall a fun game if you catch it on sale and are looking for something to play with friends.			"

												Game is pretty awesome and highly addictive.  Gauntlet style dungeon crawler gameplay with an auto attack and single special attack on 4 or 5 classes of champion, as well as different upgrades (effectively a simple levelling system) purchasable from vendors throughout game to boost damage/health/armor/mana/whatever you choose. The game has a simple multihit threshold comboing system that can heal you or deal damage in a circle around you, or both.  Overall an incredibly fun game both single and multiplayer. Definitely check it out if you are into retro style games, it's worth every penny!			"

												Three friends and I bought this game, and before we realized what had happened, it was six hours later.This is Gauntlet-style hack'n'slash done right in every way. Just simple, arcade-y action that's as challenging or easy as you want it to be. I can't imagine it'd be particularly compelling solo, but the co-op is fantastic and the classes really are unique and mesh well together (<3 forever my Priest buddy). Workshop integration is a great touch, and the included expansion seems huge! You're not going to find more content for your buck anywhere else. A great investment.			"

												Although I've only recently bought this game, I strongly reccomend it, especially for the multiplayer. I beta tested this game back before its official release, and loved it. I'd been waiting for it to release, and then saw it for sale when the summer sale came. I was hooked from the first secret door I found. This game Is so satisfying when you explore and find secrets. The other nice part about Hammerwatch is that it is actually challenging. I tend to play on medium, and (perhaps due to my skill level) I occasionally struggle with a new area. EVERY time I encounter a new enemy, it is an adventure to discover its capabilities and weaknesses, from the basic cannonfodder mobs, to the minibosses. When a game this cheap is this captivating and fun at the same time, I just HAVE to write it a good review. I hope that you guys buy and enjoy this game as much as I do, as well as send the devs some love.			"

												I was plesantly surprised when I brought this game for $1.50 on special. My thoughts at the time were ""what could go wrong?"" but I found myself spending many a night playing this locally with friends. A very solid rpg for a game night, although the lives mechanic is a little annoying, where you can only die a certain ammount of times before you have to restart... the game... infinite lives crutch plz and thank you. Overall this game is worth the full sticker price and I even managed to convince a few of my friends to get it so we can online matchmake. Very solid game, if not a little bit repettitive after a while of killing a bjillion giant maggots.			"

												This game is great, very reminiscent of the old gauntlet games, but tweaked for a modern age. The classes all feel different and distinct, the attention to detail in the way the world interacts with itself and the graphics/sound is wonderful.Fair warning though, this game has a hilariously sadistic sense of humor at times. I've always come up just short by exactly one in beating this game. You'll know what I mean when you get there.Also, Hammerwatch is a lot more fun as a co-op game than single player, so consider getting the 4 pack and doling out some copies to your friends. : P "

												Easily my favorite dungeon crawler. It's such a simplistic one that there isn't too much to worry about. All the classes feel quite unique and fun. The campaign is a simple concept with a lot of hidden secrets that let you play for hours on end looking for them without getting bored. Whenever i'm at a loss for what to do I come back to this game looking for another clean sweep of either campaign. I have done the whole campaign with one other friend, getting all the planks and escaping the castle, it only took 6.5 hours. Short game but with the different classes and multiplayer option it is easily something that can be played over and over.			"

												More fun the more players you have, with smooth and functional online or local coop that allows you to save and continue your game in multiple sessions. With an emphasis on huge hordes of enemies and traps galore, there is plenty of fun to be had exploring and crushing massive swarms of enemies that fill the screen, and a variety of classes to make multiple playthroughs appealing. An assortment of workshop content can enhance your mileage even more. By default, it can be quite challenging, but there are plenty of options to customize your experience and make it easier or harder depending on your tastes. Infinite lives, no lives. Regenerating health, 1 health. The extra options add some spice and make it a good candidate for multiple sessions even after you finish the main campaign. It's all built on top of a game whose core combat feels fast and satisfying, and that's always bombarding you with rewards just as much as it is with enemies. Well, maybe a few more enemies than rewards.			"

												This is really quite a fun little Gauntlet-esque style game.  I've played exclusively with my buddy, and we made a wild Thief/Priest team.  Battles turned into wild hack fests with me double dagger stabbing everything while the priest fired holy beam healing/death into the fray.  It was just plain old genuine fun.Levelling up by spending coins found is a neat mechanic too.

												If you have fond memories of both the main Gauntlet and it's spin offs like Dark Legacy, you will find that Hammerwatch will honor those memories just as much as you would. The music is one of the best examples of how make Looping music tracks that works, the combat is as fast as your fingers are and will not hold your hand, and the rest of the games mechanics are easily learned just from playing. For the $3 it was during the winter sale, it was a bloody steal at that price, and deinately earns it's full price tag of $10. It's even better with friends.			"

Poison Dagger, Chain Lightning, absorb health makes him (MY FAV) great class.Ranger is best for you if you prefer to shoot enemies that aren't even on your screen. He got bombs (like bomberman), Traps and other stuff.Thief is ownage class in case of skills but VERY SPENDY. All of his moves drain not just mana but also cash. Yet they are spamable and massive. So if you got lots of cash and lots of mana. IT IS best class for you.Overall its good game. Yet sometimes annoying that music always switch abruptly.			"

												This game really reminds me of games like Gauntlet. It's hack n slash with many cool classes, and some really overpowered ones as well. However, the game still has bugs, but that's to be expected. An example of a bug is the spike traps in the second act in the Hammerwatch Castle campaign. The timing is randomized for some reason, when it's supposed to be a set number.But overall, this is a good game, if you can get around some bugs and unfair challenge.			"

												It's a very fun dungeon crawler. It's basically Gauntlet combined with Smash TV, which I don't mind one bit. Progression and upgrades help you keep up with the difficulty. Only thing this game needs is a dungeon randomizer and it would be great, it gets stale at times but the fun is still there, especially with friends.			"

												Hammerwatch is one of those games that is oddly satisfying almost in spite of it's seeming simplicity. It's graphics while retro are quite appealing to the eye. It's music is not overbearing and suits the action. The gameplay is about as solid as it comes. This is worth every penny and is guaranteed to provide fans of castle runners and dungeon crawlers hours of fun. Watch me and a friend enjoy a multiplayer experience.

												Hammerwatch is a very fun dungeon crawler, best played with friends as a co-op multiplayer game.The game shines in its fun and gameplay. It doesn't really provide any story but this doesn't matter. The gameplay is pretty simple, though the devs still managed to keep it from being boring. There are different classes you can take and every class has its own set of skills. You can buy and upgrade these skills along with other usefull stuff. The stages each have their own secret passages and even easter eggs; the game starts to feel like an old school dungeon crawler.The replayability increases with the modifiers: you can play around with these modifiers to make sessions easier/harder/simply weird. For example: a shared HP pool (in multiplayer), infinite lives, max hp = 1, etc.Best played with a controller and friends.			"

												Hammerwatch is a fun dungeon crawler with two medium sized campaigns. This game is even better with friends and has a lot of extra features which add a lot to the multiplayer experience. There's not a lot of replay ability in the game but the abundance of workshop content; good and bad, makes up for this.-The gameplayThe game, while having two good campaigns, is not a story orientated game. Therefore this review will mainly focus on the gameplay aspects of the game. The art style of this game very much reminds me of the original Gauntlet. Top down, pixel graphics. The game has RPG aspect, wherein you have a pick from 5 characters; Paladin, Mage, Thief, Warlock and Priest. Additionally throughout the game there are vendors and NPC where you can upgrade your skills or stats and buy new ones. The combat in the game is simple, you can amass 4 attacks/skills. As you increase your level the base level of the new attack/skill is higher. The combat can get very repetitive and it does come down to button mashing on occasion to clear out the hoards of enemies in front of you.-The ExtrasThe game has a number of different settings you can apply to a playthrough. Such as shared HP pool, infinite live (default is 1 life for each player; where respawn bases can revive dead players) and much more. The extras provide a new type of playthrough to the original campaigns. However this extra alone do not provide a great deal of replayability and that is where the plethora of workshop content comes into play. -The workshopDue to the short nature of this game's short campaigns, yet addicting gameplay (to me atleast). The amount of community made content on the workshop is enough to keep you satisfied, but not too much so you don't know what to get. Some of the campaigns have an incredible amount of detail, making it hard to distinguish some of them from the original campaigns. Personally I would recommend Ravenwatch It's a dark well made adventure; and I shall say no more.All in all if you can get past the eventual repetitive nature of the combat the concept is great and the addition of the workshop content makes for a good throwback to gaming in the early years.

												This game surprised me.   When I first looked at it, I thought it was just another generic 8bit styled game looking to prey onto the 80-90s generation pool of gamers.   However, after actualy playing it, I found it to be more then that.   For the first time in a long time, I found myself actualy trying to survive this game rather then steam rolling it like so many other games.     I quickly learned how to strafe, and that made the base game easy.   But, much to my delight, there are more modes of game play to give those of us who desire a challange a run for our money.			"

												I have played multi-player for about 3 hours with my brother and I played solo thru the first dungeon defeating the first boss. I have tried all the classes for at least 10-15 minutes. So far, it's been a really fun game. If it's on sale, no brainer, buy it. It'll be worth your money and time. If it's not on sale, buy it if you like the original Gauntlet or  any twin-stick shooter (for the record, it is NOT twin stick, but it's very similar). I will say this: have a good graphics card. The system requirements say Open GL 1.4 minimum, but I could NOT get it to work on my laptop which meets the recommended requirements except for the Open GL 2.0. I would say minimum requirement is 2.0. Further, the graphics are really good if you do have the graphics card to support it.Last note for this game and honestly for Steam and PC gaming in general if you like retro games... buy a game pad. This game absolutely requires it. I played on KB and controller. And the difference is huge. Thank you and I hope this review helped you decide to buy it or not.			"

												Just a really fantastic game. I've finished the main campaign and the new Temple of the Sun campaign on regular difficulty and have 55 hours total. Plus a bunch of tries to get Survival mode down. The different characters really all do play quite different, have beat it with the ranger and the priest. The few downsides is that the game tries to beat you mostly with numbers of enemies rather than very intelligent ones, but still remains quite challenging especially on hard (and survival mode is BRUTAL). The other thing is that there is no actual reward for killing enemies, they are mostly just obstacles for you to explore for loot and secrets. That said, I loved this game in single player and it's even miles more fun as multiplayer. Hope they get another new campaign in the next patch. Add me if you want to play!! stewnwt			"

												Someone made an exceptionally ugly and un-fun action RPG. How original. I understand I'm in the minority if you look at the Steam ratings. I just don't agree with them.Hammerwatch is a fairly basic, straightforward action RPG. It's a dungeon crawl that compensates for the few enemy types with an overabundance of them. It's the same game that I've played and seen dozens of times. There are no new mechanics to speak of here. It's spam the attack button and clear out enemies. Rinse and Repeat. Careful positioning of your character and taking care to min/max your build is what's needed.Here's the problem. That sounds like every other action RPG game in the last 20 years. In this case the devs decided that since they didn't have any graphical skills, they should just create ugly pixel blobs for everything and try to pass it off as ""retro"". I saw better looking games on my Atari 2600. I'm not kidding either. I'm all for a unique and interesting art style. It doesn't have to have modern graphics. But I find these muddled and frankly dull. With the same kind of gameplay I've experienced a dozen times before, I'm not finding any joy in Mudville. Why would I want to play this over any dozens of other games that do the same thing, look better and play better? Maybe there's some cool novel mechanic or awesome story later on (though by all indications there isn't), but if there is I can't be bothered trying to find it given the derivative gameplay and horrendous graphics. I get the sense when I play this I should just go play a similar game that does it better and looks better.I hate to hammer on the graphics so much but when they're this off-putting, it's a massive issue. The meal may taste OK but if it looks like a plate of dog doo your dinner guests won't want to eat it. That's how Hammerwatch makes me feel. Then when I play it and get the feeling that I've done all this before there's no incentive to go on.Again, I recognize that I'm in the minority here but I'm not giving bonus points for ugly, derivative games just because they're indie.

-Quick Review-Hammerwatch is a Dungeon crawler that takes you through 4 levels or “acts”. There are several different classes you can play as. The game feels like a throwback from older 8bit video games, while enjoyable to play occasionally, to try to power through the game was a bit excessive for my tastes (the game play was very repetitive).-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn’t much of a story, you start the game out separated from your companions because “the bridge is out!” Because you simply couldn’t jump across that stupid bridge you had to wander throughout the four acts for several hours until you get to the last boss. (and at that point, I really hope you got all the planks, or else you’ll need to do it… AGAIN!) Game Play: Hammerwatch requires excessive spamming of my forward key (it would work better with a controller, or maybe rebinding the attack keys from the keyboard default). I understand that it’s my own fault for not taking the care to get a controller or rebind the key. But I preferred the default set up. I really got tired of spamming my forward arrow, while kiting around and holding down the space bar to strafe.After my 10th hour, it stopped being amusing and fun. I only played as the Ranger class; those of you who know me know I like to play Range classes in video games. In Hammerwatch the ranger seems to be rather over powered as well. There are several other classes that are really fun to try out though.Many dungeon crawlers the dungeon changes shape as you play, or they’re so big you cannot remember where anything else. I found myself getting very bored wandering around trying to get every single thing inside the dungeon. Worse yet; when you play the story mode a second time the dungeon doesn’t change at all. That made “exploring” pretty impossible for me, and finding secret area’s I had missed my first time playing only gives me so much of a thrill. Simply put: I felt like I was grinding, not playing a game.Achievements: The achievements are pretty straightforward. I earned all of them aside from two: don’t plan to get the last two “Slay the Lich achievements” until I have help, or I’m really, really bored with time to burn.The achievements are three categories: 1) Beat the game/boss on _____ Difficulty. 2) Find the secret area. 3) Grind the ____ Amount of NPC’s/Gold. There are good guides in the steam community that assist with the secret areas, which for me was the most work. I had to redo the story mode part of the game Three times.Price: Hammerwatch’s standard price is $9.99, I really didn’t enjoy playing this game solo that much. I’m sure it’s more fun with friends. I guess $9.99 is a fair price, but I think you can get a better game with more enjoyment out of it for that price. I would skip this game unless you really want to try out new games. My recommendation is to wait for a steam sale before you purchase the game. Conclusion: Pro’s: The game was a fresh idea, it was fun to play through once and leave it alone. It was very easy on my graphic’s, I could play it on my laptop (most people could probably play it on their phone).Con’s: The game is very grindy in nature, I was quite tired of spamming my forward key to do attacks, I had to repeat the same story at least three times with no real dynamic differences between the dungeons or NPC’s I fought.I’m not sure if I should be giving this game a recommended or not recommended. I wouldn’t be telling the truth to say I was unsatisfied with the game. I don’t think that most people will get as much entertainment out of the game as I did, and like I’ve clearly outlined I felt like I was grinding most of my time. I would like to say I’m uncertain which way I lean.			"

												If Diablo had been designed for the SNES then it might look something like Hammerwatch: grind your way through hordes of identical mooks, collecting gold to purchase upgrades.It's an even less interesting Skinner box than Diablo, however, with negligible enemy variety and an utterly tedious upgrade system. There is minimal skill development and no fancy equipment to find. There is no XP so no reward for killing enemies per se; they're just obstacles between you and the gold, of which you need to collect thousands upon thousands of pieces to purchase small and usually uninteresting upgrades.This just contributes to the tedium of murdering identical hordes of hundreds upon hundreds of easily-killed enemies: no reward other than a few gold and advancement to the next room filled with the same opponents. (Later enemies do at least use new sprites rather than just pallette swaps, but the behaviour of bugs and eyeballs and skeletons is nevertheless the same.)The only really notable feature is the combo system, which, when unlocked, gives you a temporary boost after killing 10 enemies in quick succession.I kept playing at first because I thought it was just starting off dull -- as most games with level-up mechanisms do -- and then because I was too far along to give up. I regret the time wasted. It doesn't get better.			"

												The controls, graphics, animation, and general quality are really solid, but the content is spread far too thin and the game consists of mostly doing the same things over and over.  Occassionally you'll see old things mixed together in new ways - an enemy spawner next to a difficult stationary enemy, for example - but then that combination will get re-used dozens of times before you run into anything new, and that new thing may very well be a slightly faster version of an old enemy with different graphics. Tough enemies can take a minute to kill even if you're taking no damage and they pose no threat to you, making them more chore than threat, which only adds to the sense of tedium.The difficulty is also extremely inconsistent.  Some enemies plink away with 1 damage and easily avoided attacks, while more difficult to avoid attacks often take half your life bar or more.  The game's first boss was vastly more difficult than the second.I would have been happy to play this same game with levels a tenth as long and a constant stream of new situations, instead of its current form, which feels like mostly padding.

												I'm going to summarize the two main disadvantages to this game (note that these only apply to single player, and I have no knowledge of multiplayer at all):1. The map is terrible.In this game, each dungeon can last literally hours. That may not be too terrible in itself, except it takes even longer because the map screen does not allow you to see the whole dungeon that you've explored at once. The map only shows the areas nearby which you have already seen, and thus is severely limited in its usefulness. This can make exploring the full dungeon a nightmare. It can become a chore trying to find where to go next, sending you running in circles, simply because your map has practically no range beyond you.2. The saving system and game over system are completely horrendous pieces of garbage.You can have several save files, only one per character you start. The game works like this: you have several lives for your character, and if you lose them all, you completely game over and have to revert to your last save or revert to the very beginning of the game. That is complete rubbish. The saving works in that you have one save per character, as said before. You can't revert to old saves of that character. Any time you step on a checkpoint or go to another floor, your game is automatically saved. This hurts you, as if you find you have only one life left and critical health, this game becomes a joke between running to enemies and back to a save point, hoping to God you don't get hit even once. In my personal experience, I went into the first dungeon's boss room during single player. As a reminder, whenever you travel to another floor of a dungeon, your game automatically saves. However, this time, without any warning, the door in which I entered became locked, meaning that I was literally save-locked into the boss room. In a GOOD game, if you found the boss to be too advanced for you, you'd be given the opportunity to backtrack and get more upgrades so that you stand a chance against the boss later. However, in THIS game, since I die in literally two hits to the boss and I can't do anything about it, I have to restart an entire 2+ hours of gameplay, making sure I clear out even more of the dungeon than I did the first time. I'm sorry, game developers, but would it really kill you to take it more like a Legend of Zelda game? In LoZ, if you game over, you get sent back to the beginning of the CURRENT dungeon and all of the enemies are respawned, but you don't lose any upgrades, items, or progress throughout the dungeon. This is still a punishment for losing, but it doesn't make you redo literally hours of gameplay. Even the original Legend of Zelda on the now-archaic NES had this methodology, as Nintendo knew their audience wouldn't want to restart every detail of a long and difficult dungeon. You crazy guys instead, for the far worse, force someone to restart literally the whole game over in the case where they get save-locked into a fight they can't win. This is the kind of design people joke about from the NES era, and it seems you did not pick that hint up. Game-overing someone to the title screen is a joke. Stop using it. It's an easy way to kill a game.Oh yeah, and remember that I haven't even tried multiplayer yet, and I've heard some terrible things about multiplayer. Since I have no experience of it, though, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (or at least exclude it from this review).It's a huge disappointment, as this game actually would be tremendous amounts of fun otherwise. The characters are unique, the fighting style is linear and remarkable, and the dungeons can hold many great secrets. I swear that if you simply made a better map to allow someone to see more of the dungeon at once, a better save system to allow people to revert to older saves on a character, and a better game over system that doesn't literally force you to do the entire game over again, this could easily become several times more enjoyable and popular.Those things above shouldn't even take that much work to fix. If done with actual care, a developer wouldn't even have to edit any campaign levels.Until the above are fixed for better enjoyability, I highly recommend that you, reader, STAY AWAY from this game. You'll find yourself addicted for a few good hours, then curse its name for such a crappy game over and save system. This game is not too old yet, so maybe the developers will take some heart and at least try to salvage it.In short:This game has tremendous potential, but it is horribly ruined by a bad saving and game over system, along with a map that doesn't help you get un-lost. Generally avoid unless you don't mind replaying literally hours over.			"

												I was expecting a challenging retro-esque roguelike game and what I got was one of the most bland and repetitive games I've played. I played through the whole game with friends, and that didn't enhance the fun one bit. A few minutes into the game I realized the soundtrack (at least in the first area) is just some generic and uninteresting chiptune music played on loop that added nothing to the mood of the game, so I muted it. So then I went on my adventure where I spammed the A button on my controller, occasionally the B button, sometimes the X button, and sometimes Y I guess while facing or being in near-proximity to very boring monster types. I'd also like to mention I played through this game while high, you'd think that would make it more enjoyable but no, it doesn't.Oh, and if youre expecting a challenge: don't. This game was stupid easy, at least on the normal difficulty. I can assume that the higher difficulties are nothing intuitive and are just enemies with more health/damage/speed or whatever, basically making the grind to finish this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game significantly longer and more frustrating than difficult. You are hardly punished for dying. You go back to a checkpoint and lose a life, wow, sounds punishing and roguelike right? Yea. Maybe if you couldnt buy lives, they're really cheap too. On the final boss I literally just bought us around 30 lives giving us around 45 and I just ran at the boss and spammed my lame wizard♥♥♥♥♥♥at some dragon balls or whatever, died, respawned, and did the exact same thing until the boss died, and I was doing most of the damage.Expect to run around boring environments trying to find boring keys while fighting boring enemies all while literally destroying every wooden box and barrel around you for money that you use to buy boring upgrades, ultimately leading you to an underwhelming duke out with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragon that can easily be beaten by taking advantage of this games poor mechanics. This game literally has nothing interesting about it other than a level editor.If you feel like sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥mashing A while listening to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chiptune music, then whatever that's your thing. If your someone who expects to get your moneys worth of something, or someone who likes video games that aren't♥♥♥♥♥♥ than this game is not for you. ♥♥♥♥ this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												It just doesn't feel fun to play with the control scheme it has.This game does not let you aim independently from your movement like a normal dual stick or WASD+mouse or WASD+arrows shooter. There are strafe and stand modifier buttons that allow you to lock the direction of either movement or aiming while held down, and that is the only way to do one without doing the other. Furthermore, controllers are more capable than the keyboard setup because the game allows you to disable 8-way aiming on the thumbstick; and since there is no mouse aiming, this is impossible on a keyboard because you are only allowed 8 directions over 4 keys. Same goes for movement, though every game is like that.I'm sure people are thinking, ""Dude, you're just not good enough."" Well, I seem to be surviving just fine, so that's not it. ""It was intentionally designed like that as a throwback to games like Gauntlet."" The games it's throwing back to were from a period where design philosophy wasn't as refined as it is now. It's especially hard to understand such design choices since these problems have been solved for quite some time. I'm going to continue trying to beat the campaign with my friend just so we can feel like we got our money's worth. Maybe I'll have come around on it by then.			"

												A good old fashioned dungeon crawler featuring: drop in drop out co op, several unique characters, and most amazingly NO CUTSCENES.I was pleasantly surprised when I booted up the game as I scrolled through the options, there are resolutions from 600x800 all the way up to 4K. What more would you want? maybe a few post processing options to make the game appear as if it is being played on an old CRT monitor? the nerd in me exploded at the sight.It features a campaign that is designed to last around two to three hours, but could be done quicker with serious practice. There is also a lot of strategy when it comes to which class you have picked specifically, such as when you are a priest in co-op ideally you should stick to your teammates; without them your combat skills are very limited. So you tailor your upgrades to support (levelling up healing, increasing movement etc.) and this really helps the characters actually progress. But as these reset every time you start a new game it still keeps the game fresh and allows new strategies to be tested out. I love playing Hammerwatch and recommend it to anyone who wants to have some fun with friends also.5 Stars! Colours, Soundtrack is spot on, and controls feel great.			"

												This game is insane. Every time I play, I get sucked into it for at least 3 hours. It's incredibly addicting. Like Nomine said, it can be frustrating at the start of the campaign when you don't have any way to heal up and no sustain, but if you can make it past that stage, the game becomes really fun. I like finding all the secret puzzles and theres a map editor which allows peeps to make their own senarios. At the moment, there are only a few maps on their forums, but I'm sure over time there will be more. I really enjoy the Survival Colusseum map if you havent already checked it out...Written by: Oxzgen			"

												My biggest complaints are the lack of enemy diversity (imo the biggest flaw), their A.I and movement speed that takes away the potential threat they could be, aswell as no random/procedural generation. Otherwise, i had fun on it, in MP, and it delivered what i had expected, a retro-styled hack'n'slash roguelike-ish dungeon crawler. Maybe the game could use a bit more depth and be less repetitive/tedious at a time, but if you like the genre, you'll probably enjoy it. Grab a friend though, it improves the experience. I see a good potential in the moddability of this game. If you're highly critical of details or expect an RPG, you should probably avoid the game. At least i was happy finding that i can bind autoattacking on the same key as regular attacks. If devs could try and improve the few issues i've mentionned, it'd definitely make the game much more fun. Still good so far, and the workshop can increase the game's lifespan.			"

												TL;DR: Just buy a 4-pack and play with your friends. Like now.The campaign consists of 8 hours of nostalgic dungeon crawling, full of secrets.Great game, co-op is amazing and the game is definetly worth the price, sale or not.When the campaign is over, there's always the other official maps to play, and then workshop maps after that.I'm not going to lie, the workshop's maps are ""meh"", but still adds a little extra that I can't say no to.The replayability is great: I have almost a hundred hours as I write this, with around 30-50(?) hours of offline time that has not been tracked on record.

												Pretty good, pretty good. Like Gauntlet, but modern.Had a solid 4:37:52 playthrough on Hammerwatch Castle and 2:25:12 for Temple of the Sun, so for the price ($2.49 at the time of writing) it's definitely worth the money. There's some great community maps too.However... survival and hero defense are definitely lacking.For those that are unaware, Hero Defense is a mode where you're basically in a tower defense game... without towers. You fight for some twenty waves (give or take a few) until it's finally over: BORING! Beat it real fast :(On to survival: grind central. Boring boring boring! Spent at least an hour through two games just running around killing things and trying to survive. I'm sure if it looked and sounded like Gauntlet, I would be okay, but it got pretty repetitive.Overall I would have to give this game a 9.5, being generous to a few odd bugs that probably aren't common experience.Play it. Die. Play again. "

												Got this gifted to me by my partner when it was on sale as something to muck around together on. Well worth the 5 bucks he spent for the 2 copies he bought. A decent selction of classes to play, something to suit everyone, and after starting over a small amount of times to find the classes for us we got started. The level layouts are well put out, running around in places you have discovered but can't access as it is locked means that you really have to explore it all, that is where most of the play time comes from. Packs and packs of different types of mobs that change after each boss defeat. Secrets available on every level means that you have to keep an eye out or you miss so much. The co-op game play was great fun for such a simple game, laughs were had about the stupidity of dying to basic stuff, and we really got to work as a team together, something that a lot of our games we play can no longer provide for different levels of play. My one complaint is the boss fights, the first one was epic and we struggled for such a long time trying to get down pat the timing of the mechanics, after that though other bosses were lacking the wow factor.. Though the ending of the game was amusing. I recommend this as something short term to play with friends, definitely a lot more fun with friends than alone.			"

												Easy to get into yet extremely tactical requiring game. It simply is a masterpiece of a Dungeon Crawler, if you're into Dungeon Crawlers and you have friends that are into it as well. I recommend you to buy this game and play with friends!Spent 1 hour and 22 minutes with one friend on the first level, we died at the last 5% HP of the boss. imo time well spent! We then called some help from another friend the next day and showed that boss who the real boss is!A must have Dungeon Crawler Game!			"

												TL;DR: Just buy a 4-pack and play with your friends. Like now.The campaign consists of 8 hours of nostalgic dungeon crawling, full of secrets.Great game, co-op is amazing and the game is definetly worth the price, sale or not.When the campaign is over, there's always the other official maps to play, and then workshop maps after that.I'm not going to lie, the workshop's maps are ""meh"", but still adds a little extra that I can't say no to.The replayability is great: I have almost a hundred hours as I write this, with around 30-50(?) hours of offline time that has not been tracked on record.

												Pretty good, pretty good. Like Gauntlet, but modern.Had a solid 4:37:52 playthrough on Hammerwatch Castle and 2:25:12 for Temple of the Sun, so for the price ($2.49 at the time of writing) it's definitely worth the money. There's some great community maps too.However... survival and hero defense are definitely lacking.For those that are unaware, Hero Defense is a mode where you're basically in a tower defense game... without towers. You fight for some twenty waves (give or take a few) until it's finally over: BORING! Beat it real fast :(On to survival: grind central. Boring boring boring! Spent at least an hour through two games just running around killing things and trying to survive. I'm sure if it looked and sounded like Gauntlet, I would be okay, but it got pretty repetitive.Overall I would have to give this game a 9.5, being generous to a few odd bugs that probably aren't common experience.Play it. Die. Play again. "

												Hammerwatch brings back the retro, dungeon crawler style of games, with the pixel graphics adding to the nostalgic feel whilst not making it look cheap and unfinished. The different playable characters keeps the game diverse, allowing different play styles and skills to come into effect.The few things that I think could be improved upon are:The simplistic character customisation. Whilst this is not crucial to gameplay, it adds a nice touch to be able to make your character unique.The health system. Finding 3 apples evenly spaced in a row inside a dungeon is not entirely realistic and apart from a priest there are no other ways to regenerate health.			"

												Marvellous hack 'n slash game with a touch of rougelike. Hammerwatch is really a nice discover.In this simple yet fun RPG you have to escape the castle Hammerwatch going around and kill everything. Exploration is the key of survival: most of the elements are hidden by puzzles, levers, trapsinvisible walls and various secrets.This game is hard and it's what makes it fun: expect to die, a lot. Also it's important to manage your entire game: don't waste your Ankhs (lives) at the beginning because you'll need it. Same for coins which are basically the only way to level up: you buy your abilities and you have to manage until the end.The only downside in my opinion is each class has too few abilities (4 active and 2 passives) for a campaign that is about 7h (just the main one).Will you escape castle Hammerwatch?

												This game is a great game to play with friends. with every floor almost killing you as you carry your priest to heal you and be your backline you will feel like you are really in the dungeon. The workshop is also a major part of playing this game. If your getting bored of playing the story then you can just download some maps put together by other players or you can just make your own map and have your friends play it. This game has a bit of everything for everyone. like if you want to be on the front lines palidan is great for you. If you just want to lay low and make sure your friends dont use all your anks and die you can play the priest. If you wand to be near the palidan you can play a wizard with lowish health you can spray down clumps of enemies with your flamethrower. Or if you want to be back lines you can play archer and snipe out your enemies from far away and if you find youself facing a crowd of enemies you can drop down your bombs and watch as your combo kills go through the roof. I havent played the other classes so I dont know to much of wat to write for them but they all all well balanced and put together. I think this is the closest game to ""the perfect game"". If you like rouge like games like binding of Isaac you will love this game.			"

Just be warned that if you jump into other people's games you can wreck it for them, and they can kick you out.

												If you are a fan of Gauntlet then this game is for you. The only problem I have is the faulty net code(somewhat laggy but not bad[Example, sometimes the monsters or even your team mates ""teleport"" around but it's so rare that I wouldn't even worry about it.]) and that every time you start a multiplayer from a load save, anyone but the host has to repick their characters and hope you are near the merchants or else you start with the starting stats but you have all the gold you spent. My suggestion for a patch or even if they make a Hammerwatch 2 is that they make it so that you must join a lobby every time even if you do it from a load and have the save file on everyone's computer that has ""their character"" data.Regardless, it's still a good game and using the local co-op has been what I've been using a lot with my brother and friends. Game looks very good on my HDTV when I hooked up my computer and is a good way to use when you have four player local co-op.Oh and this game has a level editor/script maker, so you can use player created campaigns and all.

												Excellent rendition of an old classic, if you have ever played GAUNTLET.Definitely one to play and even more so with friends. 3 things to know before you do buy! IMPORTANT:A. PAINFUL Button masher, i highly recommend finding a way to Auto-Fire/Rapid-Fire your buttons. Else its going to really hurt you in the long run. A program called AutoHotKey is a great one to help you get a auto-fire script working.B. This game for some unknown reason has no frame-rate limit, so expect your computers temperatures to run HOT! VERY VERY HOT for no good reason (silly developers not putting a frame limiter into a 2D game...SILLY SILLY SILLY!!!). Highly recommend you lower the games resolution, and turn down its effects. OR if you know how to and can, underclock your system to stop it roaring up the temps.C. Online game hosting needs knowledge of portforwarding. If you know how to do portforwarding, then youre fine, forward port #9995.			"

												My biggest complaints are the lack of enemy diversity (imo the biggest flaw), their A.I and movement speed that takes away the potential threat they could be, aswell as no random/procedural generation. Otherwise, i had fun on it, in MP, and it delivered what i had expected, a retro-styled hack'n'slash roguelike-ish dungeon crawler. Maybe the game could use a bit more depth and be less repetitive/tedious at a time, but if you like the genre, you'll probably enjoy it. Grab a friend though, it improves the experience. I see a good potential in the moddability of this game. If you're highly critical of details or expect an RPG, you should probably avoid the game. At least i was happy finding that i can bind autoattacking on the same key as regular attacks. If devs could try and improve the few issues i've mentionned, it'd definitely make the game much more fun. Still good so far, and the workshop can increase the game's lifespan.			"

													The search for a game to fill that hole left by Dark Souls continues to go on. Even though I had very much completed the game with about 700 hours of game time in, I still wasn’t satisfied. I’d played Dark Souls 2 for a while, but it just wasn’t the same as the first game. I know I picked up Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and while I’m still playing the game, it doesn’t quite fit the niche of what I was hoping for. I wanted a game which was as unforgiving and just as rewarding as Dark Souls with the same kind of co-op that would make me appreciate the power of friendship. Since there aren’t too many games that copy that feel, I find myself diverging into the Roguelike genre. Just so it happens, the game Hammerwatch seemed to sell me right away.	Now, I don’t usually delve into Roguelikes as they’re known for being intentionally and notoriously unfair and difficult. They’re something I often play to challenge myself but they’re not something I would ever see as a party game. When I bought the game on sale for 8 dollars(including three other copies), I’d initially hoped to find three other friends to traverse the dungeons of the evil castle to fight with. Unfortunately, first impressions really let me down and I had to give away a few of my copies out of pure disappointment. Then, I had one person come up to me and offered to do some co-op to which I gave the one more chance to tickle me…and I’ll be damned if that’s not what happened.	Hammerwatch is a Dungeon Crawler Roguelike in which you are a member of 6 dungeoneers who have made their way into the titular castle. Though some adventuring is implied to have occurred, you have been cut off by the rest of your party and you are forced to find your own way out of the castle to meet up with the rest of the party. Your chances appear to be slim, however, as they deduce you are unlikely to get out alive. With what weapons and skills you have, though, you hack and slash your way through hordes of various creatures.	My initial run through the game was me starting as a Thief on standard difficulty and my first time going through the game could be described as very much challenging going alone. Enemies often come in mobs large enough that you can find yourself easily surrounded and have the psychic kind of AI where they can detect you from a fair distance, even if you were behind a wall. The experience ended abruptly when I discovered that you have that archaic lives system and dying results in permadeath. Upon this discovery, I learned of quite a few other features through research that deterred my desire to play anymore. It wasn’t until my co-op experience that I entered the game a little too harshly.	When you start the game, you have a choice between six characters(two of which were added in later patching), two campaigns, a difficulty setting, and a series of modifiers that make the game customizable to the player’s comforts, making the game experience as hardcore or casual as you’d like. Gameplay is simplified with one button for attacking and three skills to use. Unlike most RPGs, you do not level up by killing mobs. You actually go to merchants scattered throughout the campaign who you use gold to buy upgrades for your character. In most multiplayer experiences, collecting gold and treasure gets antagonistic. Fortunately, however, any gold you do pick up is gathered as a whole by the party and, better yet, you spend it as though it were separate.	If I had any complaints about the game, however, it’s that the save feature can be unforgiving when playing with random players. If they’re especially uncoordinated and uncooperative like two players I’d played with, they basically wandered off and soloed areas, getting killed off and wasting respawns. It wasn’t until I didn’t respawn when I discovered that the other party members had burned out all our lives and had been spending the time upgrading themselves and saving the game before they quit. If you’re playing with friends, this proves detrimental since saving doesn’t reset your respawns or health. If you get game over and reload your save, you start off with the amount of health, mana, stats, players registered, and number of respawns you had from the last save, regardless of who saved the game last. If you’re going to be playing with friends, I’d recommend making the game private. 	Also, while four players are needed to make a balanced party, the ranger and priest are especially unbalanced in that the former is overpowered for going solo and the priest is so completely worthless by himself—this is because the priest can’t heal himself when he starts out. The game was clearly made more for multiplayer in mind rather than single player which may make going through the game on your own a varying experience.	Overall, a lot of flaws and issues aside, the game, while repetitive at best, is definitely worth playing with friends, but I’d hardly recommend playing with random strangers or even the single player if you’re the sort who wants a balanced experience going it alone. It’s definitely got a niched audience who is going to enjoy it, especially those who like Roguelikes. It's just a shame not many of my friends share that taste. Personally, I’m actually planning on starting over the solo mode with features to make it as dark souls-like as possible…but then again, I’m just one of those self-loathing masochists who can’t get enjoyment out of a game anymore if it doesn’t somehow stop to♥♥♥♥♥♥on my face once in a while.

												A simple top-down 2d action RPG. However, you aim with the move control. A twin-stick setup would have made shooting and moving much less awkward, It's pretty easy, though. Though the dungeon looks like a maze, it's fairly linear and the puzzles are not so puzzling. Still, if you only have a few minutes to kill, it's fun.			"

												It is decent entertainment but after a couple hours, the combat feels bland even though it is very challenging. My biggest gripe with this game is how it is designed as a 'roguelike' and resets everything after you lose. This leaves for no checkpoints where you can continue playing the next day and so forth, given how expansive the campaigns are. Playing for hours in one sitting becomes torture. Dying becomes frustrating but at the same time you want the whole thing to just end already.Don't get me wrong, I like a good roguelike game but I feel like Hammerwatch could have been better without meddling into the growing genre.

												If you're not tech savvy, be aware before you buy that you will have to manually configure your router to forward a port for this game if you want to play coop. For most people that's not a big deal, but for some it may be an annoyance.But if you're okay with that, this is an excellent game for coop. Just the right level of difficulty, and reinforcing your friends' attacks (and vice versa) feels very satisfying. When you level up enough to start unlocking those new attacks and powerful upgrades, it really feels like an achievement.The only nitpick (and this is a minor nitpick) is that the dungeon is a huge labyrinth, which occasionally can leave you lost with no clue as to where to go next. It would be simpler if each floor was its own labyrinth, but solving some areas will require you, for example, to take a stairwell from the 5th to the 4th floor, then a stairwell from the 4th to the 6th, and then another stairwell from the 6th back down to the 5th. This takes you to the same floor you started on, but to an area that was inaccessible if you hadn't tried all the staircases. This is better than a dungeon so easy that it's boring, but when you're playing with three other people and all of you are walking in circles asking if anyone has any ideas... the fun level starts to rapidly drop. You'll probably figure it out in a minute or two, but these navigation hiccups do happen.Also, go for the Wizard or Ranger. I don't know why the hell you would ever choose melee over ranged in this game.			"

												I give this game a thumbs up because I do not consider it a BAD game.  That said, I am not especially satisfied with it, and after playing a few hours last night and completing about half of it, I do not intend to play it again.  I guess rather than ""good"" or ""bad"", I would use the word ""standard"" to describe this game.  It is just a remarkably ordinary, run-of-the-mill game to me.  It seems well polished, has fairly pleasant music, but nothing really sets it apart or makes it special.I killed hundreds upon hundreds of identical enemies in rooms that all kind of felt the same.  The game warns you in the beginning that it's especially difficult, but it took around an hour, maybe more, before I even took a single hit (normal difficulty).  The two bosses I encountered were ""difficult"", in the sense that they did hit me a fair bit, but there were so many extra lives being thrown at me that they were never actually a threat.  I'd enter the boss fight with ten lives, lose two or three of them to the boss, and then gain five as a reward.The game seemed alright when I started, but after a while I found myself just waiting for it to be over.  I just spent way too much time essentially repeating the same fight over and over.  Stand still and shoot into a crowd of 100 skeletons until they're gone.  Move to the next room.  Repeat.I'd give this game like a 6/10 rating.  Not what I consider a bad game, as it seems to be polished and do what the devs wanted it to.  But not an especially good game either, as what it does is pretty unremarkable.			"

Is it hidden in this generic set of filthy dark tiles or is the switch underneath that giant mob of copypaste enemies that all act the same way? What's the map for if you won't tell me where to go? Why bother implimenting clever level design when you can toss anything anywhere and call it a maze. It's fun to be lost constantly. Oh boy I can't wait to get chased by 200 of the same enemy until I run into a room and then mash the one attack button at the doorway for five minutes. Blam this piece of crap.			"

												When I picked this game up I was only too happy with my purchase. A simple dungeon crawler with effortless multiplayer and loot, lot's of loot. It's not the most difficult of games, but there's no real hand holding either. It delivered on my soft spot for games that throw ludicrous amounts of enemies your way and lets you wade through them like a hot knife through butter. There's also a healthy dose of secret areas, and shop-bought upgrades...""That's a pretty low score for such a gem"", you might say... and if I stopped playing after the first two hours, I'd be inclined to agree with you...However the game reveals it's hand too soon. If you ignore the new skins, each level contains the same set of monsters, button pushing & key finding tasks and secrets. Once you see the formula you'll watch it repeated over and over. Plus if you start a new game with a different set of people you're destined to repeat even more. There's no randomisation of rooms or key locations, it's all 100% identical every time. Don't even get me started on the ending...If this game is super cheap, and all your mates can get on it at the same time? You'll have a blast for a few hours... just don't take it too seriously after that... unless you're one game behind Reece on the leaderboards and need what you thought would be a quick win. 12.5 hours says I was looking in the wrong place [5.4]			"

												This game gets pretty challenging (especially if you want to unlock the ""real"" ending -- good luck finding all the planks).What makes it challenging though is the lack of walkthroughs -- ugh.Gameplay is a lot of fun, solo or with friends.edit: I realized something. It's impossible to figure out all the switches and locks without a guide (since sometimes a pair can be across a huge map, and often, there's no counter or indication of which lock you opened -- ""Something Happened!"" is just unfair). And it's impossible to figure out the secrets re planks without having beaten the game first.I have to give this a ""no"" based solely on the frustration of not being able to unlock new zones. I can forgive the planks, since it IS a bit of a roguelike, and I suppose part of the fun is NewGame+, but still.			"

												The story of Hammerwatch truly is a modern masterpiece in storytelling. As the campaign begins, the line ""The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!"" is displayed.And that's it. That's the plot.Hammerwatch isn't the type of game that really needs a plot, however. The fact that the bridge broke and there is probably no way out is actually a decent introduction to the game as a whole: a light-hearted, if not a bit shallow, romp. In addition to the campaign, there is also a wave-based defense mode and the inclusion of a level editor for creating custom levels.Doing its best to harken back to classic Gauntlet, Hammerwatch is a cooperative hack-and-slash action game. There are four classes to choose from: Paladin, Warlock, Ranger, and Wizard. Each class starts with a regular attack as well as a special attack that drains a certain amount of magic points. More special attacks are eventually unlocked, though it takes a bit too long to actually earn them. In my experience, nothing comes close to the effectiveness of a Ranger since their default attack pierces through enemies -- continuing its trajectory to harm even more enemies -- and their bomb special attack is perfect for kiting and killing large groups of enemies at a time. It's also possible to strafe while moving, which is perhaps the most important thing to take away from this review if you buy Hammerwatch, as it’s not immediately apparent within the game. Mastering the strafe-and-attack is crucial for any class' survivability, since moving diagonally while attacking is so freaking useful.There are a handful of secrets, puzzles, and obstacles that don't necessarily require fighting at all. Hidden rooms permeate each floor, and if the player keeps an eye out they should be able to find just about all of them. Puzzles are never too difficult, and in fact sometimes they are insultingly easy. These variants do a good job of breaking up the monotonous wave-clearing gameplay that makes up most of Hammerwatch. Playing alone feels hollow, since a large part of the difficulty comes in the form of more and more of the same types of enemies being thrown at the player -- a challenge that's far easier to enjoy when in the company of friends. Single-player reveals the game's shallow mechanics; movement and two attacks don't really make for the most compelling gameplay.Progression comes from a variety of vendors throughout the levels. Early on it is a very linear progression since only certain vendors are available. The first upgrade is the ability to combo, which allows players who kill at least 10 enemies in a row very quickly to gain a temporary boost to their stats. Later upgrades will build off of this, making it easier to combo and giving better benefits for comboing. By the end of the second act, players will finally have access to more special moves as well as having a little more open-endedness to their character's build.The problem is that the end of the second act is a decent chunk of game away -- especially for players going it alone. While the level design is very open-ended and non-linear, the character progression is the exact opposite and takes way too long to become interesting. It can feel like forever when slogging through the seemingly endless waves of enemies with the basic attacks, waiting for something cool or interesting to happen.At the gnarled and gore-encrusted heart of Hammerwatch is a combo system of pleasing simplicity. To trigger it, you must kill a bunch of enemies very quickly, and then once it's in motion, you can upgrade it in a number of straightforward ways - to deal 360-degree damage, say, or to heal. You can build it, too, by killing more enemies. It's action game design at its most basic, and it works.In order to feed the combos, Hammerwatch needs to ensure that you have plenty of enemies to massacre at all times - and this is a favour it's very happy to grant. Grubs, skeletons, wandering eyeballs: these standard fantasy baddies wait for you in packs around every corner, spawning from pits or rotten tree trunks or mysterious fountains. Along with a standard attack, each character has a special that can generally be counted on to do a lot of damage at once, and so, as you move from combo to combo, a pleasant rhythm settles in. Throw yourself into the fray to power yourself up. Get into trouble so you can get out of trouble again.1The early levels drag on for a bit too long, and enemy variety is weak throughout. The thrill comes from the sheer numbers.Around this central relationship is a game of equal simplicity, a straight-up dungeon-crawl in the spirit of Gauntlet. There's a handful of familiar character classes (the paladin's a melee tank with a deadly dash, for example, while the wizard's low on health but just look at the flames he can conjure); there's the lightest trace of a backstory (the bridge has collapsed behind you, so why not keep going, eh?); and the bulk of the game consists of working your way up through a series of stacked dungeons, eviscerating baddies, standing on rune-splattered pressure plates to unlock secret areas or open the path to the boss, grabbing all the gold you can find, and then using your spoils to make you incrementally better at eviscerating baddies.Like Gauntlet, the whole thing's designed around multiplayer, of course, and you should know in advance that if you're soloing Hammerwatch, it's a bit of a slog. Levels are longer than you might expect and the odds are stacked heavily against you from the off. The perks you buy at vendors scattered about the maps take a little too long to get entertaining, and the bosses present roadblocks that will eat through your remaining lives with astonishing speed. On top of that, Hammerwatch goes against the current trend of procedural generation, so you're going to trudge across identical early levels over and over as you get better.2Bonus levels make the homage even clearer. Gauntlet forever!With friends, of course, none of this matters: you bundle around the corridors and arenas in a bait-ball of chaos, letting rip with melee, ranged and specials at anything that presents itself. You'll stop only to glug a potion or to check the map, and in the midst of the carnage, you'll start to realise that Hammerwatch's simple pieces are surprisingly effective at generating moments of proper panic.This is the kiting-est game ever made, for example. Most enemy behaviour is tailored to give chase, so foes quickly form huge pursuing crowds - and this might explain why the best levels on offer turn out to be mazes. Dead ends and blind corners present glorious risks when you can't shoot backwards over your shoulder, and they tend to bring out the best in you as a result - they transform you into the frantic, cornered hero, determined to blast a way out of trouble no matter what. At times, Hammerwatch almost feels like a racing game (at least it does if you're using a pad rather than the surprisingly wretched keyboard controls) as you steer through wandering fiends at speed, gathering a pack of nasties in your wake.Beyond all that? There are wave-based and survival modes and a rather daunting editor, and there's the delightfully grubby pixel art to take in throughout, which offers just the same kind of mead-splattered ambience as the game that so obviously inspired it. There's precious little depth lurking in Hammerwatch, then, but if you've got a few friends handy or are willing to wait around online for the worryingly small community to make itself known, this is genuine old-fashioned skeleton-bashing with a gloriously tidal approach to chucking in the enemies.7 / 10			"

												I can not launch the game. There is a crash related to open audio library for me and other stuff for others. Nothing has been done to fix this issue for over a year. People complaining about an issue for more than a year with no fix for the issue? Consider that for a moment. I have read so many complaints about the game not working and nothing fixing it and the developers are already touting some new game they are working on in the official hammerwatch forum. This is insulting considering I paid for the game it will not work and I am not very hopeful at this point that the issue will be fixed.If there is no reply from someone on how to fix this or that there is a fix on the way in a timely fashion then I want a refund for the software I was sold that didn't function.My biggest regret is not reading more about the game not working or I wouldn't have bought it to begin with.I cannot recommend this unless you like to gamble.Also the game is 7.99 on the hammerwatch website and is DRM free and steam redeeemable and it is 9.99 on steam without the DRM free version. So for steam users we also have that nice little kick in the sack to go along with it.			"

												Simplistic in nature, which should be a good thing, but for Hammerwatch, it isn't. The game's presentation and story, within the first 45 minutes, is nowhere to be found. There's no goal beyond kill pixelated enemies and grabbing coins (which works for some games, but not in Hammerwatch's case). This type of beginning setup is only fun for the first playthrough, and quickly becomes stale afterwards.Also, losing all your lives to an enemy or trap that you haven't yet learned how to overcome, and THEN being forced to start back at the very beginning of the game, is an extremely archaic function and has no place in the modern world of gaming. It absolutely killed my desire to go back and replay. This game isn't randomly generated and offers little incentive to return to it, and trudging through the snore-inducing level design was not going to happen.Overall, Hammerwatch plays just how it looks - a game from 10 years ago.

												This game was gifted to me, but I will review it as if I had purchased it for its standard price of $9.99. This is the definition of a hack n' slash. If you're into that genre of videogame, Hammerwatch is definitely for you. The graphics are poor of course, as it is developed by an unknown indie label named Crackshell. But that doesn't bother me as much as does the world (or lack of world I should say). The whole of a nearly 7-hour campaign took place underground in a single dungeon. I get that it's a dungeon-crawler, but at least change the setting of every few levels or something. Furthermore, it didn't have much variety when it came to the enemies you fought: scarabs or bats, take your pick. The only positive thing I can think to write about this game is the variety in classes. For the limited artwork, each class had an array of abilities that were quite aesthetically pleasing as they tore through hundreds of monsters at once. Also note that the game is planned to have a free DLC available sometime in the near future with implemented changes. Thus, be aware that they may fix some of the negatives I've mentioned above.With that said, it is still not worth the full $10. If you are persistent in trying it, wait for one of Steam's bigger sales.Thumbs down for now.EDIT: The game recently updated and has introduced a new campaign set in a desert of sorts. Feel free to comment whether or not it's any good, as I have not yet had a chance to play it.			"

												Hammerwatch is a nice looking rpg styled action game where you assume the role of a warrior, rogue, wizard or warlock.You venture through dungeons overcoming enemies, solving puzzles, leveling up and finding better loot. This sounds like an rpg but feels more like a fast paced action game. The controls are simple and it's easy to pick up. The game can be played cooperatively up to 4 players which is perhaps the biggest draw to this game. Also the art style is quite nice.Personally, I do not recommend this game because it's really shallow and gets tedious quite fast. The classes don't feel very unique, the fighting is simple button mashing and the puzzles are not that great to begin with. With some friends it's a tad more enjoyable but the horrible lag and netcode makes it hard to enjoy. It is actually quite impossible to get decent servers. After playing a while it just gets boring and it's not worth it. "

												Like someone took the good bits of Gauntlet II and made it a little more complex.  The tower is interesting to explore with lots of secrets and areas you'll have to work to find.  The graphics are charming and there's even optional pixelation and CRT effect overlays.  Local and online co-op are nice but you'll definitely have to bring your own friends as I almost never see available games to join.			"

												I don't understand why people like this game. It's probably because I never play coop.Single-player-wise the gameplay just feels too mashy and boring. If you play without infinite lives it's too easy to die and with the lives there's no reason to care. It's entirely possible I'm missing something. Maybe there's something in the workshop that would help. Idk, I'm too bored to care.			"

												Not a very fun experience. Kiting big groups of weak enemies and blowing them away with your attacks gets old quickly, and that's how almost every enemy encounter goes. Add to that the fact that you can only attack the direction you most recently moved (meaning you have to turn around for every attack) and combat becomes an excercise in tedium. This problem is compounded with minibosses which have a lot of health and do a lot of damage, meaning that the only way to fight them is with constant ""pokes"", moving toward them, attacking, and moving away. And you must do this very quickly and do it a lot. It just isn't fun.Level design looks awkward like in many roguelike games, but it is entirely pre-designed. There are some pretty horrendous ""puzzle"" systems, most of which consist of re-exploring empty areas looking for switches, breakable walls, and de-activated traps to find new routes. Think Metroid-vania but without movement itself being an enjoyable experience. In fact, movement is pretty bad all around. You walk slowly when unhindered and attacking cuts your speed even further. Also, there's a lives system. Why? Lives were introduced in arcade games to keep people from hogging the machines. There's no reason for this to be here in an individually owned singleplayer game. There's no reason to keep players from continuing and retrying in a pre-designed area, It's understandable in roguelike adventures where there's always something new each time you play, but here all it does is add a cheap attribute of difficulty.

												A very fun dungeon crawler, where you kill enemies, find secrets, power up and kill bosses with 6 different characters. There are 2 campaigns to explore, which both offer challenge and replayability, and there are more in the steam workshop.What I love most in this game is the sense of character progression. With your collected gold you can buy a lot of different upgrades, which will make you very powerful the more you progress. Towards the end you're mowing down hoardes of enemies in a good and challenging level design.			"

My only criticism is that it doesn't have randomly generated worlds (which is planned on being added!) but besides that it is a great game and it is at a good price. I would highly recommed playing with friends as you can shout at each other when someone dies or appreciat each other and you will feel great satisfaction when beating bosses. Just to add,I have been able to get people who (for some reason) dont like video games to be entertained for hours. It can get repetitive after a while but you can blow past that with friends and the workshop. Over all a good 8.9/10.			"

I'd also like to be able to attack with the mouse instead of tying movement direction to attack direction. And lack of random dungeons is a big negative as well. The potential is there, but needs a lot of polish.			"

What I liked: Old school dungeon fun Different characters for different styles ( I chose Warlock, poision dagger for up close and electricity for magic) Thought it would be boring playing solo, but was a challenge MODS!!!What You Need to Know: When i first played the game for 2 hours, I gave this game a negative review You don't use the right thumb stick on a controller at all. ( You would think that would be the aim) Beat the game by myself You have only one main attack and 2 secondary attack( they use mana)My Score:BGiftedCompleted the Main Game in: 5.5 hours "

												Single player is boring and tedious. Multiplayer is fantastic... until you run out of lives. Then it feels like single player again with your friends watching. The game doesn't give enough lives to balance out multiplayer and you will eventually end up trying to find lives just so that your friends can play again. This is a horrible setup for a multiplayer experience.			"

												EDIT:Turns out it's pretty fun with friends.  The below applies to solo play.  Recommended for couch co-op.---In Hammerwatch, you'll fight hundreds of reskinned enimies, smash countless containers for coins, and solve simple puzzles.Enemies are beaten in the same way: aggro, attack, and backpedal.   This cycle makes up the majority of the gameplay.  Larger groups can be killed as they vainly attempt to path around a corner.  It's trivial and boring. It's important to be careful.  Groups of enemies can kill you in a few seconds so it's unwise to play recklessly.  Health restoring items are limited and if you run out of lives, you're forced to start all over.  Cautious play is required.Money is acquired by smashing pots that litter the corridors.  It's not fun, but it's necessary to improve your character.  Some pots randomly have bombs hidden in them - what's the point?   It just makes the process more tedious.Upgrades are purchased from shops scattered around the map.  For the most part, they're bland, numerical improvements.  On my Wizard, I increased my range, damage, and blast radius by roughly 20% across the board.  I also purchased the ability to combo.By killing ten enemies in quick succession, your character is granted a buff that increases movement speed and damage.  This buff can be upgraded to provide minor healing and radial projectiles that fire every second.  However, as I previously mentioned, Hammerwatch punishes aggressive play.  The combo system doesn't really fit in a game where health needs to be conserved.Loot consists of money, keys, health pickups, shop tokens, and small buffs to stats.  Shop tokens reduce the cost of upgrades by ~.5%.  Nothing here makes me want to play.Hammerwatch is simply a boring game.  Any enjoyment from killing ememies is lost after the first couple hundred, it's annoying to scrounge for money, and character customization customization is dull.  If you're considering buying this game, watch a youtube video without a voiceover for ten minutes, and decide for yourself if it looks fun.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Hammerwatch is very nostalgic for any gamer. A classic 8 bit dungeon crawler with 4 classic classes: Archer, Wizard, Knight and Necromancer. They all have their own unique skills and fighting style. I must warn you though buyers...prepare to be kicked from games a lot if you decide to join others. I've tried a couple of times to make my own co-op games to avoid this but it seems to have a problem with that. Even with Hamachi in my experience with it. So with that said...there are plenty of losers on this game. I don't think this game is worth a full 9.99 price for how simple it is...I'd say 4.99 max; but you won't regret the purchase. It is really fun when you meet cool people.			"

												This little indie title is great, looks great, runs as it should, battle difficulty can be easily adjusted, it is all of this and it is still being updated! My only criticism is that it doesn't have randomly generated worlds (which is planned on being added!) but besides that it is a great game and it is at a good price. I would highly recommed playing with friends as you can shout at each other when someone dies or appreciat each other and you will feel great satisfaction when beating bosses. Just to add,I have been able to get people who (for some reason) dont like video games to be entertained for hours. It can get repetitive after a while but you can blow past that with friends and the workshop. Over all a good 8.9/10.			"

												Has beautiful pixel graphics and has a multiplayer camaign to go with it, plus the servers are easy to set up and get into. A very addictive game, the only draw back is that it's $8.00, and thats not much. Even though its still in developement, im very impressed.			"

												A very fun dungeon crawler, where you kill enemies, find secrets, power up and kill bosses with 6 different characters. There are 2 campaigns to explore, which both offer challenge and replayability, and there are more in the steam workshop.What I love most in this game is the sense of character progression. With your collected gold you can buy a lot of different upgrades, which will make you very powerful the more you progress. Towards the end you're mowing down hoardes of enemies in a good and challenging level design.			"

												Hammerwatch is a pretty simple retrostyled Action-Dungeoncrawler.The best part of it is that you can play with up to 4people. CONS:-It's pretty short since you can claw your way through the main campaign in 2-4 hours if you rush. And I think the expansion Sun Tower doesn't even need that if you know what you have to do.-The maps are always identical and only small differences in secret rooms differ from game to game. I don't know how hard it is, but a randomized dungeon system like in diablo could be better. ALthough the level design isn't that bad.-The Achievements Genocide and millionaire is a joke! Since you kill about 1-5 monsters a second it would need you at least 13hours just bashing through hordes of enemies... without any down time. If you play the game normaly 2-3 times you would get about 20%-30% done with both achievements so the developer thought it was a good idea to make you play the game 12 times? with just a handful of classes to choose from. I know I ramble just about achievements but for a game with this small amount of content it is frustrating to hit a block. Thankfully there are a couple of guides and you can set up a 10monster/second trap of so you just have to let it sit for 4hours or so... -.- Or recycle the bonus level 4 250 times without saving after finishing.(btw: Xmas-secret-Achievement is still doable with the 1.3 beta version, although tedious).-Playing it alone is only fun the first time and after that maybe a second time with a different class until you learn it's specials.-I don't know if it's just me, but this 250MB Game always heated up my laptop(intel i3 CPU + Geforce 820M GPU) tremendously. And it bothers me very much. I gues the dev didn't take the time to optimize the performance but I would like that he did. Expecially in retro-styled games like this one. Although I admit that it is not nearly as bad as that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The binding of Isaac...  It still crashed on me a couple of times. But thankfully my saves weren't corrupted(as some of my friends').PROS:-It is kinda funny to play in a group. Expecially if the other palyers aren't that experienced with gaming(since you could better play diablo or anything other). But here you could rush through the main game in an evening or so. -The music ties in great into the action and at least for me didn't become boring although you hear it a long amount of time.-The leveldesign is kinda good the first time you play it. But it's sad that it's the same in every play through.-The classes are all kinda different and mostly fun to use. Although I never really tried the priest/cleric.-The price is ok. But I recommend to grab it in a sale, since it preatty small. My playtime is just as high because I lost my saves after nearly finishing both campaigns and because I got both grinding achievements which took my setup about half of my playtime.So yeah, if you search for something 4 people could enjoy for a small amount of time together, grab it! It's better than I thought.TIP: Make some backup saves from bonus levels or before the boss-rooms, so you could check stuff you might miss.			"

												Unless this game gets a LOT better with multiplayer, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a Gauntlet-esque game, with ZERO rogue-like progression to it. Levels are way too long, at least solo, and the game explains absolutely nothing. ""Here's a character, here's a dungeon, get to it."" It encourages skill and strategy, and I guess I've been playing way too much randomization-based games lately to enjoy this.			"

												wtf... what would otherwise be a really cool game has multiplayer ruined by respawn priority always going from left to right (player will 1 always respawn before player 2, 3, 4 if dead)how is this an acceptable game mechanic? (or lack there of)just have a PRES START to join back in once an ahnk is collected and the first person to press start respawns...this is ridiculous... how... how is this possible?			"

												This game is very addictive! What do we have? An interesting pixel graphic, great level design, interesting co-op mode. You are free to choose a hero from 6 different classes. Every class has unique skills, which can be improved later. Moreover, game has a workshop. Some of the maps from workshop are also interesting.			"

												This game is more of a unoffcial gauntlet sequel than the horrible Gauntlet reboot. What makes ""Hammerwatch"" shine is the awesome gameplay,colorful 8 bit graphics and creative dungeon designs. Up to four players can go questing in this awesome game. Don't have friends but want to go questing with people? No problem! There is a Multi Player option that will put you in a open game and you can go questing with strangers with! Or you can go solo and just drown out while leveling up your character while being a badass slaughtering enemies left and right.     I would go as far as saying this game is perfect but there are two things that drive me nuts about it. One is the cost of upgrading your attack,upping your mana/health and combo abilities. Sure Gold is plentiful but when every starts at $700+ starting at level 1...things get pricy but thankfully the balance is there so unless you totally suck at video games you'll survive but I just think it would be better if skills were a tad cheaper. the second is the music.. it's good but is far too repetitive. especially level 2. Hammerwatch is a great game and If you love gauntlet or rouge-like then pick this up! you'll love it!			"

												Hammerwatch is easily one of my favourite games. I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already. It's really fun, the soundtrack is great, the classes start out slow but get more and more amazing as you buy upgradess; hoarding gold is great, the level design is  good, though there are only two campaigns and two more game modes.It gets even more fun when you play with friends provided they don't suck so much that they die 38 times on 1 floor.  The only drawback is that there is no such thing as assists in multiplayer and the enemies don't really scale as far as I know, so combo will only be useful if all of you split up. My one wish is that there were more levels and perhaps classes in the game. The community can easily upload new maps into the workshop seeing as the game has a map editor, though.			"

												Hammerwatch is a pretty simple retrostyled Action-Dungeoncrawler.The best part of it is that you can play with up to 4people. CONS:-It's pretty short since you can claw your way through the main campaign in 2-4 hours if you rush. And I think the expansion Sun Tower doesn't even need that if you know what you have to do.-The maps are always identical and only small differences in secret rooms differ from game to game. I don't know how hard it is, but a randomized dungeon system like in diablo could be better. ALthough the level design isn't that bad.-The Achievements Genocide and millionaire is a joke! Since you kill about 1-5 monsters a second it would need you at least 13hours just bashing through hordes of enemies... without any down time. If you play the game normaly 2-3 times you would get about 20%-30% done with both achievements so the developer thought it was a good idea to make you play the game 12 times? with just a handful of classes to choose from. I know I ramble just about achievements but for a game with this small amount of content it is frustrating to hit a block. Thankfully there are a couple of guides and you can set up a 10monster/second trap of so you just have to let it sit for 4hours or so... -.- Or recycle the bonus level 4 250 times without saving after finishing.(btw: Xmas-secret-Achievement is still doable with the 1.3 beta version, although tedious).-Playing it alone is only fun the first time and after that maybe a second time with a different class until you learn it's specials.-I don't know if it's just me, but this 250MB Game always heated up my laptop(intel i3 CPU + Geforce 820M GPU) tremendously. And it bothers me very much. I gues the dev didn't take the time to optimize the performance but I would like that he did. Expecially in retro-styled games like this one. Although I admit that it is not nearly as bad as that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The binding of Isaac...  It still crashed on me a couple of times. But thankfully my saves weren't corrupted(as some of my friends').PROS:-It is kinda funny to play in a group. Expecially if the other palyers aren't that experienced with gaming(since you could better play diablo or anything other). But here you could rush through the main game in an evening or so. -The music ties in great into the action and at least for me didn't become boring although you hear it a long amount of time.-The leveldesign is kinda good the first time you play it. But it's sad that it's the same in every play through.-The classes are all kinda different and mostly fun to use. Although I never really tried the priest/cleric.-The price is ok. But I recommend to grab it in a sale, since it preatty small. My playtime is just as high because I lost my saves after nearly finishing both campaigns and because I got both grinding achievements which took my setup about half of my playtime.So yeah, if you search for something 4 people could enjoy for a small amount of time together, grab it! It's better than I thought.TIP: Make some backup saves from bonus levels or before the boss-rooms, so you could check stuff you might miss.			"

												Good quality dungeon crawler that actually ends up having much the same tension as playing a retro FPS game. Think Doom, but played from above! Slashing and shooting scores of enemies while strafing around their vast legions.+Solid visuals+Excellent music+Easy to pick up and play+Love that oldschool feeling of hunting for secrets+Good choice for MP with friends-A bit too grindy-More shallow than it needed to be-Some elements feel poorly balanced in terms of risk vs reward-VERY minor niggle but I wish gold had a bit of a 'magnet range' if you know what I mean. Picking up scattered coins can kinda slow the game's pace unnecessarily.I like Hammerwatch, but I don't love Hammerwatch			"

												I would've recommended this game if the enemies weren't just all cannonfodder (at least for the first 1-2 hours). Then we have an overlay map that is quite useless since you can't zoom in or out. Combat is basicly just backpedaling while the enemies just bunch up ahead of you, they also attack really slow, so dying is not an issue until traps appear or you when you get to the boss.I would not personally recommend this, to me it was way to mindnumbing and I playes the last halfhour just trying to find why people like it so much.

While Hammerwatch has a fairly high level of polish and can be a mildly fun multiplayer experience, I ultimately cannot recommend it because it is overly simple - AND exists in a sea of overly-simple hack-n-slash dungeon crawlers. The market is literally saturated. There are a million other games like this, and definately some that do it better. Other than that, yeah, the price is cheap enough and there is even DLC to extend playtime if you are into the game. Unfortunately, I would not recommend friends run out and buy this at full price.

												How can people like this game? First of all many other users refer to this game as ""rogue-like"". Well, it has absolutely nothing to do with a rouge-like, it's just a Gauntlet clone. Seriously, it plays exactly like the original Gauntlet (and when I say exactly I mean it) but it's less frantic and also, you know, 30 years have passed. Gauntlet levels were fast and furious, like a typical arcade game, here instead you are presented with HUGE levels in which your character runs aimlessly apart from continuosly pressing the fire button. Everything feels cheap; ""combat"" is ridiculously unsatisfying, a big problem since it's the only thing you can do in the entire game. When you destroy boxes and environment objects they simply disappear, no effects, no sound, nothing. Do you expect amazing particle effects and animations? Look somewhere else. If the core gameplay of your game is so poor you should at least embellish it with something nice to look at (btw the 16bits graphic is great on its own, a real pity that it has been wasted on this game). If your idea of fun is to move a sprite in a semi-static environment and shoot something at random enemies (something that you can do in a few days using some sort of game maker, if you want) then this is the game for you! Otherwise be warned...			"

												I've been excited for this game since I saw it on TigSource forums and voted for it on Greenlight. Sadly I cannot recommend this game as much as I want to. This Gauntlet inspired game has a lot of potential but I feel it fails to live up to it. The game doesn't feel like it's quite done and lacks polish in several ways. The graphic style is nice but the graphics seem unfinished and the environments seem static and lifeless. The gameplay itself need some improvement as well. There are some issues with balances between the different character classes and certain hazards are way too difficult/dangerous while others are too easy. I found that the character upgrade process a bit uninspiring and didn't really motivate me to keep playing. If the developer continues to improve this game and iron out the flaws. This game does have a lot of potential and I feel is a few patches from being something truely awesome. Hopefully 6 months from now I'll be editing this review and changing my  recommendation.Score: 6/10			"

												Well. I'm rather glad I got this in a humble bundle. It was fun for about 30 minutes. I think that as of late people are seriously misinterpreting the appeal of rogue likes, dungeon crawlers and ARPGs. This isn't any of those 3 things and I don't even really call it a hack and slash since it doesn't have attributes I normally associate with it like an inventory, proper leveling and fat loot. It's basically just a dead simple shooter game with an RPG aesthetic.What was also infuriating is that instead of using the right thumbstick (yes, this is a gamepad game. Not quite what you think of when you think dungeon crawler right?) to aim independently of movement you have to hold down one of the triggers to either change direction and not move or move and not change direction. This is not good when you have a top down shooter of this variety. It leads to very silly deaths when you get flanked.All in all it kind of reminds me of those Ultima SNES games. Which is not a good thing. If it would have just been advertised as a shooter I think things would be fine. But if you're going to call yourself a dungeon crawler you better be a dungeon crawler. I don't know why this fad of misusing names of venerable genres to sell crap started. But please stop. Please.			"

Decent replayability, but fairly awkward controls, and the online play is ruined by the people who don't give a flyin' hoot. But that's not the designer's fault. Regardless, the game could be better in a lot of aspects. I'd for sure like to see a better story line though.			"

												As someone who's played 7 hours, and given the game a fair chance, I would not recommend it to anyone, despite the low price. I wanted so much to enjoy this game, but I just couldn't. It just gets old too quickly. There is almost no variation in enemies - in fact, there are only two kinds: melee mobs that run up to you, and ranged mobs that sit there and shoot at you. All other differences between enemies are just superficial. The AI is just laughable. The only reason the game is hard is because it throws dozens or hundreds of enemies at you all at once, sometimes even including a spawner so that more keep coming. It's very tedious and it's just the same thing over and over. All you really do is run around and kill wave after wave of braindead mobs.The graphics and music are enjoyable but the game is just so mind-numbingly tedious that it is not fun at all. Not even worth the $2 I paid for it on sale.			"

												Very cool concept, but it gets stale so fast. A few small design choices make the game hard to play much of. The game has set dungeons and really slow ability progression, but it kills you by attrition (it's hard to get health back) and kicks you back to the start of the campaign when you die. It can't decide if it wants to be a campaign or a roguelike.There's modifiers you can put into play so that its easier to regain health, and you don't lose all progress when you die, but the damage was done, I can't round up friends to play this game anymore, they just aren't interested.The game doesn't make me want to play it like a campaign anyhow, it's not like I'm fed story or characterization or anything to keep me attached to a particular playthrough -- I really wish they had gone more for a roguelike, with procedurally generated maps and faster class skill progression, so that it's fun to try and fail and try again.Running around and shooting and dodging is fun, and the game is beautiful. I tried hard to like it, but barring a major update I won't be revisiting Hammerwatch.			"

Tudo bem, encontrar os vendedores deve ser um desafio num calabouço, mas quando todo santo lojista tá atrás de um mar de monstros e ao chegar lá os preços são estúpidos de tão altos, não há alma que aguente. Os inimigos não tem variedade, podem vir com skins diferentes, mas são divididos em 2 categorias: melee e dps. Sempre a mesma coisa. Os personagens não tem skills variadas. Além daquelas com que eles começam, normalmente podem comprar 2 na shop, mas como já falei: os preços são ridiculos e normalmente vale mais a pena pra comprar vida, pois o jogo não tem sistema de levels. Apesar do que pode parecer na vitrine, não é um Rogue-Like. E o online é sofrível, não tem ninguém jogando. O ♥♥♥♥ é que se não for por co-op quase não dá pra jogar.

In my opinion the game mechanics would benefit from a mouse aimer and click to attack, but that is something that not everyone may agree on. Overall it's a tops game, something that exceeded my expectations and it is at a glorious price. 8/10			"

You will repeat the same kiting and leading of mobs a million times and never feel like youre accomplishing anything. There arent any fun puzzles or anything that require multiple players, its just a dumb repetative grind fest. Please stay away.

												It's like a larger-scale, more adventure/exploration oriented Gauntlet game. Lots of loot, hidden keys and swarms of monsters pouring out of spawners behind locked doors. Explosive containers, secret passages, item shops with character upgrades, and challenging boss fights. And it's boring.I can't figure out why this game isn't fun. On paper, it does everything right. Good controls, 4 player co-op with unique classes, character progression, handmade levels, secret areas, etc. The art style is pretty nice as retro-pixel styles go. There are fine-tuned options for tweaking the difficulty to your liking. And yet it's tedious; it doesn't feel like a dungeon crawl so much as a dungeon slog. Part of the problem might be that the enemies all feel pretty much the same when you fight them, and that there is little enemy variety within the levels. Another possible issue is that the levels are *huge* with many locked doors and pressure-plate/ switch-flipping puzzles spead across multiple floors, so that if you get stuck, you end up wandering all around the entire level, now mostly emptied of enemies, looking for the secret passage you missed, or the door that has now opened, or whatever, before you can progess any further. This brings the momentum of the game to a halt, and is especially boring in multiplayer. Most rooms in a level look pretty much the same, too, so without major landmarks, interesting room shapes, or different textures for different areas, it's very easy to get lost in the levels. Plus if every area looks the same, it diminishes your sense of progress/accomplishment.Maybe that's the main problem, then: the level design. Levels are too large, contain too little variation both in terms of enemy encounters and color/texture/layout of the rooms, and progress is overly dependent on finding obscure secret passageways (by hitting every part of every wall with your melee attack), or else trigger puzzles which require extensive backtracking through mostly-identical, mostly-empty rooms.The developers have released an update which includes an entire new campaign, plus there are many fan-created maps available online. It seems like Hammerwatch could be a blast to play in co-op multiplayer with the right level design, and I'm almost tempted to give it a second chance. My friends, however, are so soured on this game from the first time I made them marathon it with me (it always seemed like the game was just about to ""get good"") that there's no way I'll ever get another co-op session going, and I don't blame them.

												The most basic bird view perspective hack-and-slash with next to none redeeming factors.First things first, it's by far not an ugly game. The retro graphics of this title seem to work out pretty well as they reflect on its minimalistic nature which btw.is just as absolutely uninspiring as the generic battle music that plays in the background without context.This is dungeon crawling striped down to it's bare bones.No inventory, grindy/slow character progression, beyond-basic combatthat comprises of mashing the same melee/ranged-attack button over and over again.Extremely inconsistent difficulty curve. There are hords of enemies that go down with one or twohits yet swarms of tanky slugs that you will need to run from in order to avoid a barrage of projectiles. Later enemy encounters often feature combinations of previously fought ones untill they are used to death.The level design is somewhat interesting as it's vast with quite a number of secrets to seek outyet involves a lot of fetch-quests and levels are all in all way too long for what little gameplay they have to offer. Having 40 long achievements to unlock (Collect 1.000.000 coins...srsly?...) doesn't help in raising the playvalue/replayability one bit.This title gets -1/10 ""I don't even""s from me.I absolutely recommend to stay away from this title by all means. Avoid like the plague!			"

												Maybe I just need time; maybe that's it. But I have real troubles playing this game. Not technical issues, heck no. The game, despite what it claimed to be was uninspired. Yes, it was obviously a throwback to the classics from the start but my god, was it ever tedious. In singleplayer, you don't get to choose your class. ""Hey,"" I said, ""I'll go with the mage, so what if my health drops like a barrel over the falls. Worth it to hurl fireballs."" Then I was slapped upside the face with the knight, who has a sword and a charge attack, both of which do about as much damage as a gentle fart. Then I was stuck in a dungeon with some maggots. The gameplay then became repetitive, with both killing enemies and breaking barrels for coins becoming repetetive. Maybe this game gets better over time, but I prefer games that are just plainly good. Save your money for Rogue Legacy or something.			"

												This is the sort of game I really want to recommend - but I can't, there are just too-many things which don't work properly.Overall pacing is terrible, progress feels slow, map is tortuousYou collect tonnes of cash only to find it's BARELY enough for a crappy upgrade - maybe.No levelling system whatsoever - but that's OK, just exploit the save system for free health eh?Mana regen is painfully slow - you will spend ages just standing around waiting which isn't much funCharacter movement is slow in a game where backtracking/getting lost is inevitableIsometric view hides enemies/bullets etc.The entire game flies in the face of progress - ignores advances in dungeon crawlers - feels basic and frustrating - maybe you'll enjoy it, I tried to but it just got more and more boringNote: single player is particularly grim, but co-op doesn't solve half-as-many issues as you might expect it would.

												Hammerwatch managed to take good start, but then completely misses the mark and even failed the landing.It's a retro-style dungeon crawler / hack&slash game akin to Gauntlet, featuring a handful of different classes with complementary skills and handmade maps. While this allows for some interesting design and lots of puzzles and secrets, it diminishes its replayability. And replaying it you will a lot if you want to ""really"" beat this game, because for some unknown reason you will have limited lives. Meaning you have to learn the maps and learn the bosses to make it through and find every secret. Speaking of the bosses ...I thoroughly enjoyed the game despite its repetitive combat system (and since every class plays basically the same, it further kills the replay value) right until the first boss. I can get behind the idea of kiting big groups of enemies to survive and I can get behind the idea of learning attack patterns. But what I can't understand is the intention behind turning the game into a bullet hell all of a sudden.It looks a lot like they are designed for multiplayer, in fact the multiplayer is one of the driving factors behind this game. But the maps are far too long for some quick fun with friends and a playthrough will easily take several hours even if you know every nook and cranny. But again: how often can you stand playing the same maps over and over again.So the single player gets old fast and is impeded by adding artificial difficulty and the multiplayer by its low replay value and its length.Unless you have a few friends which can commit themselves to a full playthrough, I sadly can't recommend this game.

												Move along, nothing to see here.I understand it's supposed to be retro looking, that's not my reasoning for giving this a bad review, in fact, the game looks and sounds pretty decent. The problem here is that it's an updated version of the original Gauntlet with more RPG elements in it. And yes there is a secret level on Floor 2 that takes you right back to the first stage of Gauntlet as an homage to the original.Problem is, Gauntlet actually evolved itself as a game to include a character and progression saving system in Gauntlet Legends and that was an Arcade game, so what's this game's excuse? This goes right back to basics... like clear a 100 floor dungeon in a single sitting, if you lose all of your lives or actually manage to get a real life then you have to start over from stratch again... No thanks, I'll pass and find something more productive to do like watch paint dry.Another gripe of mine, that's been occuring all too frequently in indie games lately, is the old school I.P. connection system which is just unaccetable at this point in gaming... I mean really? I have to go open ports on my router because the developers decided to use an archaic connection design for their game... just♥♥♥♥♥♥off already with this nonsense. It's more trouble than it's worth as you'll probably be the last man standing and want to fall asleep after 40 minutes of this tripe.When you're expecting to connect to your friends after first booting up the game and discovering you have to go play with ports... it's a bit disheartening. Honestly if I didn't already have Hamachi installed I would have just closed it and watched a movie instead... or maybe played a game with a server system.I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this game and if you're planning on beating it, hope to God your power doesn't go out or the game doesn't crash while it's minimized because no one has the kind of time or patience to complete this mess.2 / 10Worthless waste of time.

												At first, I was skeptical about this game. Then, I got it on a daily deal for $2.49. Everything changed. The perfect combination of a level editor, intense 2-d combat, pixel art and retro soundtrack makes this game a gem. A really great dungeon crawler. Co-op is fun, custom levels are fun and the single-player campaign leaves me with adrenaline in my veins when I stop.I highly recommend you buy it.			"

												An okay indie game, but much better when played with others.  The classes all handle differently, but archer is by far the easiest.  The controls take a bit of getting used to (especially the strafing) and more health potions would be helpful.  I made it much further into the game the second time I played, but the first boss is a real pain in the rear.  I had over a dozen lives and blew through them in a matter of minutes fighting it.  After that, I called it quits.			"

												As my eyes glazed over and the screen, filled to the brim with the same 4 enemies began to blur, and the unfittingly agonizing music skipped for the 10th time, I realize-This is a boring game. Hammerwatch follows an adventure through another deep dark lair, and it completely fails to encompass any aspects of what should make that entertaining. The only real danger in the game is spikes, which you might not notice as you fall into a sleepy lull of tapping the fire key repeatedly because you have nothing else to do. The game is pretty much just move and shoot and there is little else engaging - Killing enemies isn't even rewarding most of the time because they don't drop gold or food. Getting upgrades potentially means slogging through the dungeon which means, killing more enemies that don't offer up anything of value. It's hard to justify playing this.			"

It's dull,  the game appears to lack any meaningful reason to play it. Running throu' a dungeon killing creatures  collecting coins, thats pretty much the sum of it. Why we were doing it was never really explained. Upgrades? I'm sure they are in there (them coins must be collected for something) but we grew tired of the game long before we got any of them.It needs something more, not sure what.. but it needs it.			"

There are only two campaigns and msot workshop dungeons are jsut terrible.You can continue from saved games and use crutches like double damage, health regen, 5x mana regen and more.This game really shines in multiplayer as long you dont come across an idiot that wastes your extra lives.Worth the 50% off steam sale.

But for the low price, maybe buy a couple copies and play through the campaigns. it's worth exactly 1 playthrough of each campaign before uninstalling it and mostly forgetting about it. It has small moments of fun in between killing the same few mechanically samey enemy types for way longer than you'd want to,it's maggots, flowers and bats for a whole ♥♥♥♥ing hour then skeletons,, turrets and MORE maggots for a whole ♥♥♥♥ing hour. the enemies are annoying, and the game is tedius to the point you'll want to outright quit. the game held my attention and showed diminishing promise aftyer the first 20 minutes.

												I really wanted to give this game a fair chance and push on at least to write a really thorough review but I just couldn't.The gameplay is so bland and boring that I didn't feel any urge to play it past an hour and a half. Does the game get any better? Perhaps but I don't feel determined to push through it, it didn't grab my attention and excitment when it had the chance and that's why I'm giving it a thumbs down.I recommend anyone who sees this review to instead get Hero Siege. Believe it, its more fleshed out than Hammerwatch and its also a lot cheaper and actually allows the use of a mouse.			"

												I don't usually write reviews for games I've haven't played for at least a few hours, but in this case I feel compelled to.  If you don't have several friends who are interested in playing this game, you probably won't have fun with it.  Too much of what makes games like this fun is lost if you don't have others to play with.  I haven't played this game with anyone else, but it seems designed to be played by two or more people.  I'm sure you can get pretty far in the game or even beat it by yourself, I just don't think you'll have much fun doing it.			"

Yet, I gave this game its chance. And God, my first reaction was something like this :O.The art is great, the gameplay is simple & nervous, the music is nice, the classes are great (they newly added the Thief class somewhere in April 2014). Playing this game in solo is fine ! But in coop it is even better. Online coop's netcode is okay/good, local coop is top notch.			"

												This game is bizzarely compelling. It's incredibly simplistic, most of the game is reskins of the same 2 enemies, the bosses are arguably unfair, there's various parts to the game that you'd expect to be there that simply arent there (the ending is practically nonexistent and overwhelmingly anticlimactic)....... and yet it's still so damn compelling, I dont get it. Something about the simplistic unpolish and amusing abilities makes it something I've come back to time and time again since I got it.It reminds me a bit of dungeon siege 2, where every time I play it I think ""well I'm not sure what I saw in this it's nowhere near as good as the first one"" and then all of a sudden it's 8 hours later and the sun's coming up and I begin to consider stopping for the night. This game likely wont suck you into the world in the same way, but it'll definately find its way into your time.			"

												Do you like crisp retro pixel graphics? Can you wrap your brain around a keyboard version of dual-stick controls? And most importantly, do you like Gauntlet?If you can answer these three questions with a sincere ""yes"", Hammerwatch is for you.It's Gauntlet, or at least so close to Gauntlet that it doesn't really matter. You're a lone fantasy warrior archetype and you must escape the titular (castle of) Hammerwatch. Everything on the screen that is not you wants to kill you, so you better kill it first with a basic archetype attack or a special ability. There's also gold for grabs. You get to buy cool new skills with it. And all the while there's an assault of monsters from all directions. It's hilarious. And good fun. And also hard. But you like that, don't you?			"

												This is an old school dungeon crawler. Think Gauntlet graphically scaled down. You can play solo or co-op as one of several classic classes: Paladin, Thief, Mage, Warlock, or Ranger. Each character has a primary melee or missile attack and then a second attack that costs mana. Mana regens, health does not. Well, unless you find apples in the game (or if you enable HP Regen as a crutch in the menu). Crutches make the game easier and subtract from your score. The mission? Find a way around a broken bridge to get back to your friends.Gameplay is a series of wave battles that are stumbled upon in the maze. Once you've cleared an area though, it stays clear. This is good because sprinkled throughout the dungeon are vendors (funny place to do business). They are the source of upgrading your character into a deadlier machine of.. death.This is a much funner game with a buddy, but it's also a rogue game, meaning that you have a finite amount of life and must find more ankhs in the game if you want to keep swinging a sword from beyond the grave. Once the ankhs are gone, they're gone. That makes the game all the more fun.Hammerwatch is cheap. You should get it.			"

A few glitches when it comes to save files-- hopefully they get patched up since it makes making any progress a bit worrysome.

												A fantastic little game with, at the moment, a single developer campaign which is challenging enough to play several times. In fact, I don't think I've ever managed to beat it with my friends. The game has a built-in editor, which provides several community campaigns and survival maps which can be found on the Hammerwatch forums which extend the playability of the game. As the game matures, I'm sure there will be even more community created content available. I think the only thing that might improve the game is Steam Workshop integration, where community stuff can be downloaded straight to the game. Other than that, well worth the money!			"

												Like the soundtrack, this game is epic and satisfying, an enjoyable shmup RPG arcade game, but before long you start realizing that it's quite repetitive and at times tiring, but the moment you see/hear something new the energy returns. Ultimately, Hammerwatch is an enjoyable game with an interesting Coop system that can help you get through the longer stretches but you'll likely have a better time in the beginning (personally the fun really hit a highlight in the second of the four areas, area three was a pain). So I can't say it's better than just ""good"".Hammerwatch also sports an interesting Survival mode that's worth a play once you've finished the main campaign.			"

												80% guantlet, 20% rogue like.Game is a lot of fun with a friend. Love the music. Its very challenging too, even on normal difficulty. Tons of secrets and easter eggs which just adds to the fun.If you are struggling, play the archer. The classes arent really balanced all that well. Archer seems OP, Paladin and mage seem just right, the warlock reliance on gimpy melee slows him down a lot and the thief is just awful (unless you are looking to play the game on super hard mode). The game has difficulty settings already, no need to make certain classes so much harder than others.Lack of steam community content will mean finding new maps to play on will be difficult. The map editor, while robust, is not at all intuitive or user friendly (meaning only the most dedicated fans will ever actually manage to create new content for this game)Id give this game an 8 out of 10 right now. If they ever get around to rebalancing the warlock and the thief, and finding a way to make it easier to get new game content, id easily give it a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												Experience on Linux so far:+ Resolved external dependency problem for Mono.- D-pad does not work with any of my joypads (various versions of the ""PS2"" joypad from Logitech)The game:While I will be the first one to condemn hipster pixel art, I'll give this game a pass. The game is fun enough for me to forget that I'm playing a 1990's looking game in 2014. The music and audio is good while retaining some old-school goodness.Hack and slash RPG with multiplayer support. This is exactly what I wanted when I was a teenager. If this had been released in the mid 90's it would have been the game of games.That said, it's not bad in 2014. In fact, it is great fun if you like old hack and slash games of Zelda-style. (not Zelda 2, obviously, this is top down)When I first tried this game the developers made an error, they had an external dependency for Mono requiring you to install that package in Ubuntu. This is not the way Steam games are supposed to work, Steam is supposed to be your repository for any special library requirements of the game. Since then the developers have fixed this issue and it now runs like any other game under Steam.While I absolutely loath C# and Mono (and deem developers who favour it as ""not good""), it will not affect the score. After all, I am reviewing the game and not developer competence and it's a fun game. ps, I love good olde C.Score:3/5			"

The gameplay remains very engaging and challenging as you progress, and the various class types feel pretty unique from one another. Some rebalancing on some of them here and there would be nice, but that doesn't take away from the fun of the game at all. And if even the easiest difficulty is too hard for you, there's the option of adding ""crutches"" to your playthrough if you need help. Even with them it still remains quite fun. Definitely would reccommend this to anyone looking for a new dungeon-crawler type game to check out!			"

Each class has 3 Active skills to unlock plus their main attack.  Also you can buy weapon and armor upgrades and passive ability upgrades.  No in depth story, but the boss fights are unique in that you need to actually fight tactically to win.  The modding community is really working well on making new maps and even new classes.			"

Bosses are fun and the levels are large and take a fair amount of time to fully explore and find all of the boss locks/seals. Hidden areas for those that like treasure hunting and would like to know the true ending of Hammerwatch.Not too difficult and not too easy either. I've had a lot of fun and for one traps don't do negligible damage but WILL kill you if you're not careful.			"

												When deciding on whether or not to buy Hammerwatch, you need to be clear on what it is. Because for what it is and what it does, it does well. It's an achievement hunter game. You want to get it for cheap and then grind it out for some rare achievements and steam levels, maybe some steam trading cards. It does deliver there, as you can relatively easily obtain the (at the moment) 0,09% achievement.First, if you don't have a gamepad I would strongly recommend either getting one for Hammerwatch, or just not pick up the game. It's not a necessity, but the quality of your time is seriously lowered with a keyboard and mouse. Secondly, where the game starts to fall short is in the actual gameplay aspects. There is very little replayability as it's the same dungeon, same enemies in the same places every time. That in of itself isn't necessarily damning, but seeing as how you do the exact same strafing and shooting for every enemy all game long, you will get bored. It's the same even with the other classes, as you quickly find ""the way"" to abuse the non-existing AI, and after that you just do that ad nauseum for the next couple of hours. There are not enough skills or abilities to make you feel like you're accomplishing anything, and there's no diversity in enemies, puzzles or dungeon design to keep you interested.The music and sound effects are fairly good, but way too short, few and repetetive for prolonged gameplay. During my grind for kills and gold, I turned the music and effects off entirely in favour of my own playlist.The difficulty depends on which class you play, with the archer being the easiest and probably paladin the hardest simply due to being melee. Setting the game from medium to hard doesn't really matter, it's negligible. Playing the archer, I'd put the game at medium going on easy. There are a couple of hairy situations that you can find yourself in, and the Lich level can get frustratingly unfair at times, but doing dungeon runs you'll mostly be spamming your shoot key all the way between bosses, maybe racking up a couple of deaths due to losing patience or focus. You get tons of lives though, so there's no risk of ever actually running out entirely, and there's an all too easy way of cheating the death counter by just exiting and reloading if you're dying.Finally, when it comes to the achievement hunting itself, be aware that the game is unstable to the point of crashing and ruining entire attempts. You can tell when it starts to slow down and lag, eventually insta-closing with an error message window popping up. Doing the crystal lich achievement on hard I had too many enemies activated at the same time with the lich at about 50% hp and it killed a sure win, which really soured my opinion of it.You can definitively get all achievements in two dungeon runs and two lich runs, clocking out at perhaps 20 hours if you're doing all secrets and figuring stuff out as you go along. I went four dungeon runs and did a whole lot of lich fighting, as well as doing the soul crushing grind achievements, clocking out at 69 hours.I would not recommend Hammerwatch to your casual gamer, your hardcore powergamer looking for a bullet hell or insane roguelike. I would barely recommend it for completionists who want the rarest achievements. Barely. The 1 million gold and 250k kills achievements aren't hard to get, they just take hours upon hours of mind destroying grinding to reach. If the game is on sale, and if you can get a couple of friends to play it with, you could pick it up when it's on sale and you have a couple of hours to laugh away with crazy antics.That, however, is not good enough to warrant a recommendation from me.

												Hammerwatch is a game I would definitely buy again. It is fun to play, especially if you play with mates, I play it with one of my friends and it is amazing.I don't know how it is if you play as a group of 4 people but I guess the game is as fun as it is if you play in a group of 2.Hammerwatch has a good graphic (part of the atmosphere), a solid gameplay, and you can play it in a group of 4 people as a local coop, but I can't recommend it for the campaign, all player have to be on one screen and in a group of 4 people it is impossible, because everyone wants to do something on it's own.But the general coop, via Internet so that every player has its own screen, is great.The game has 3 different game modes with 3 different difficulties, one campaign, one hero-defense and one survival map. So far I only played the campaign and the hero-defense in medium. You can play the campaign solo but I recommend you play it with at least one friend. For the hero-defense I tried only one character of 5 and it didn’t work at all, with another character it might work alone, but I recommend the same as for the campaign.I tried to play the game with keyboard + mouse and with controller, I can tell so far that the game is better to play with controller.10/10			"

												Played this game with a few friends and was better than I had anticipated. Just in the first session we spent about 6 hours playing it and beat the campaign. The campaign was short but there are some other modes that makes it look like it could have some replay value. I also liked how there were multiple classes, each with their own unique characteristics.			"

												Charming little dungeon crawler but only buy if you have interested friends. Classes are a bit unbalanced as only 1-2 are particularly useful/interesting and enemies can get repetitive. A fun game but that fun can quickly turn to workmanlike behaviour as you get overly familiar with the enemies and their attacks. Buy at a discount.			"

												Fun 8bit game.Gives you the options for which character you would like to play. Each character has different skills that make it the optimal choice for range, close combat, mobs, or 1 on 1. After choosing a character, your mission is to find a way across a broken bridge by going through various floors of a dungeon, fighting monsters, unlocking gates, finding treasure, and upgrading your skills on the way. It's a long journey to the other side, but if you're up for the challenge, this game will keep you busy.			"

												Hammerwatch is a hack 'n' slash dungeon crawler that starts off pretty strong for the first couple floors. The combat is satisfying and has a nice feel to it, while the levels are sprawling and labyrinthian with lots of secrets scattered about. I'm a fan of the detailed pixel art style and the soundtrack is fun and fits the game nicely. The keyboard controls felt way too clunky, but using a 360 pad instead made for a much smoother experience.The big problem with the game is that after those first couple floors, I started to realize how tedious and repetitive everything was becoming. The basic structure boils down to going from room to room, running past enemies to aggro them and bunch them together, killing off these groups of enemies, then going to the next room and doing it all over again. New enemies are introduced along the way but they're essentially re-skinned versions of old ones. Room layouts also vary and there are the occasional traps that make planning your attacks more interesting, but other than that, there's so little difference between an encounter on the third floor and one on the tenth. The floors themselves are huge in size, which I like, but this can be a double-edged sword since they start to drag on after a while. There is some joy in taking down dozens/hundreds of enemies at once and racking up a huge combo, but that joy is almost entirely gone after doing it hundreds of times repeatedly.I also wasn't a fan of the fact that in order to reach the legitimate ending, you'll need to collect 12 wooden planks along the way. There's never any suggestion that these planks were anything other than optional, so I never sought them out. And since you can't go back to previous floors after completing boss fights, once you miss them, they're gone. It felt like a cheap tactic and left me somewhat disappointed.Hammerwatch has a few things going for it and some really nice ideas. Unfortunately, the monotony of fighting large hordes over and over in the same manner overshadows a lot of them. Instead of being a fun experience, it turns into a grind and stays that way until the end.			"

The handcrafted sprawling levels and fun to explore, and the gameplay is simple enough that it's fun to just sit down and relax to after a stressful day. If you're looking for something like Diablo or Torchlight, you'll want to stay away, but if you like games like Streets of Rage, this will satisfy that desire.Incidentally, gamepad support is superb on the Mac.

												Incredibly dull and slow. I couldn't force myself to get past the first few floors of walking slowly back and forth across entire floors thinking I might get something good from a secret (because secrets are fun, right? Not in this game!). Unfortunately, the rewards for searching and walking and going mad with boredom are mostly just coins and slight discounts and the few vendors scattered around in places that aren't easily accessible. Aside from slowly walking around uninteresting stone... stuff, there's combat! If you like awkward controls and eight-direction aiming/facing/motion then maybe that is fun for you. Otherwise it's probably just as dull as the walking. For anyone considering buying this, I suggest watching someone play for a while first.			"

It seems almost impossible to get through the game without a team due to the random monster hords (stupid bug...snake...beatle...things). The controls are terrible and are probably going to lead your character to their untimely demise. Wished there was a storyline.

												Hammerwatch is an extremely fun old school rpg. Up to four people can play together as very different classes (at the time of writing, Priest and Thief were just added--I wouldn't be surprised if more came along) to fight throngs of enemies through many different levels. The first campaign has some flaws (e.g. can become repetitive, searching the map for where to go next becomes a chore) but overall is fun because of your friends. However, the second campaign--while much shorter than the first--is a legitimate entry into the RPG genre. A hub town, upgradeable skills, backtracking, detail, and most importantly, hordes of monsters forcing you to work together and evade certain death. I would highly recommend especially if you are looking for something that is both difficult and requires teamwork.			"

If you want to try this game out for yourself though, feel free. Also if you're getting this to play with your friends, I'd probably say it's a buy. But for right now, the single player experience is not all that great.			"

												Alright. So let me tell you why Hammerwatch is awesome. Like most of my games I bought it some time back because it was on sale and after watching the trailer I decided that one day I'd like to play it. So in my infinite quest to get more badges I thought it was about time to see if this game was actually any good or if I'd drop it as soon as I got my three cards and left. Boy was I surprised by this one. I soon as I started playing it I could tell the diffrence, this was a game that had the classic spirit of the Rouge-like gerne to it with all the things that made it fun. First off, it was visually very appealing with it's classic 16-bit style of graphics which I felt only added to it's retro theme. Next, was it's simple yet intence combat system, ok I know what you're thinking and running up to a guy and hitting him in the face isn't very complex but when there are hundreds of enemies on screen and dodging them is just as important as getting a super long combo chain of destruction combat becomes just as thrilling as it is desperate. Lastly, the game is full of secrets. I don't know if I spent more time trying to find my way, killing all the monsters, and looting every thing that wasn't nailed down or combing the levels making sure I hadden't missed anything. Also this game is challenging. The first few playthroughs I did were just to figure out how to not die on the first level. All-in-all I like this game. I brought me back to a better time in my life where I played games not to get achivements nobody else had or get a badge saying I spent more time and money on it than others, but because it was not just a game good enough to waste a few hours on and leave once I got what I wanted; but insted actually play it all the way to the end, beat it, and still want to keep playing. Even if it was the same stuff I had just played. This is one of the rare few games I've encountered that not only did I have more fun that I ever thought I would have gotten out of it, but that I know I'll still get every time I come back to play it. 5 Stars all the way.

												A great game. Don't play for the graphics, its the pixelated art that makes this game what it is. Spent almost an hour and a half before the first boss, locating all secrets and such. An amazing game. I would recommend for all ages.			"

												This game is fantastic for the price, lots of fun for a 2D dungeon crawler. I'd compare it to a 2D Dark Souls in that you need to have tactics for groups of enemies, you need to kite and dodge like a boss, and the boss fights are wicked. You buy character upgrades with gold you find throughout the various levels and it's great when you solve a puzzle and end up unlocking a room full of loot. It also has controller support, which is sweet.			"

												It surprised me how much I enjoyed this. Very much an updated Gauntlet for our time, as good as I *remember* Gauntlet being (i.e. better than Gauntlet actually is if I play the original now). Great non-linear level design with lots of hidden stuff. I'm not usually a huge fan of pixelated graphics, but the ones here work really well and are full of colour, detail, and neat lighting and animations. Haven't tried the co-op yet but expect it'll be great. Character classes make a significant difference in play style. I got 9 hours out of the main campaign and still have the free expansion to do. Recommended.			"

												This is a pretty great hack and slash dungeon crawler. The first thing that comes to mind while playing is Gauntlet, which definitely isnt a bad thing, however there are some differences in the formula. For example, there is a simple character progression system in place in the form of upgrades you can purchase from merchants scattered in the levels. Also, each character has a special ability separate from their main attack that drains mana and is usually crowd control oriented. The addition of checkpoints was also a nice touch. The main gameplay though is very Gauntlet like, you have to find keys (bronze, silver, and gold) to open doors, there are tons of enemies to kill that quickly regenerate through spawners, and theres plenty of loot and chests to gather. A very fun and addictive game that only gets better through co-op.			"

												I can't regret of voting this game on Greenlight. I knew it was going to turn into a great game. Those guys have done a great job to create a solid retro game, and they've got that even better than those old games they tried to reproduce. The bigger problem with old games were their dificulty, and they've solved this in Hammerwatch. Put aside all the funny gameplay, challenging bosses, a quite original upgrading system, the well resolved HUD, simple controls and, the game is surprisingly well-balanced! It sometimes feel like Diablo (hit and run) but this fact doesn't make the game boring at all.The only fail, I believe, is the art. It could be way better and more diverse. It wouldn't bother me if there were enemies with the same behaviour with different skins: I just wanted to see more enemies.			"

												People compare this to Gauntlet but it's as much a decendant of Diablo. The cool thing is, it has the kinetic battles of an arcade game combined with the paced exploration and loot collecting of a PC game. You kind of get the best of both worlds.Pros: Hammerwatch is a lot of fun. I like how it plays and I like the art. I really love the atmospheric music, which isn't chiptunes as one might expect.Cons: I haven't gotten past the first boss! The difficulty of the boss fight is way out of balance with everything up to that point. If I eventually get past the Queen, can I expect the same from the rest of the bosses? The devs need to tweak this a bit because the difficulty on this boss is ridiculous.A minor con is there isn't enough variety of loot. It could use weapon and potion drops. The shop system is kind of goofy with lots of backtracking and again, a lack of variety. But these quibbles don't detract too much from the core gameplay.If you love these kinds of dungeon crawlers, pick it up, it's not expensive. If you can get it on sale, it's a must-buy.			"

												It's a really good game that improves your game sense in every possible way. Every class is different, and you'll have to find solutions for all the classes. For example as a paladin you have to face your shiled to the enemies to not get hit. An archer on the other hand doens't have a shield and just has to run, but can do damage over a great distance. As you are playing the game there are lots of secrets that you can find. Most of them are in the walls, but the further you get the less noticable they get. Playing on your own is fun, but with friends it's even more fun. I would really recommend this game for people that are looking for a good dungeon crawler, because this would be one of the best in my opinion. You gotta be quick, you need to pay attention and you need to have skill, what more do you want?			"

												Experience on Linux so far:+ Resolved external dependency problem for Mono.- D-pad does not work with any of my joypads (various versions of the ""PS2"" joypad from Logitech)The game:While I will be the first one to condemn hipster pixel art, I'll give this game a pass. The game is fun enough for me to forget that I'm playing a 1990's looking game in 2014. The music and audio is good while retaining some old-school goodness.Hack and slash RPG with multiplayer support. This is exactly what I wanted when I was a teenager. If this had been released in the mid 90's it would have been the game of games.That said, it's not bad in 2014. In fact, it is great fun if you like old hack and slash games of Zelda-style. (not Zelda 2, obviously, this is top down)When I first tried this game the developers made an error, they had an external dependency for Mono requiring you to install that package in Ubuntu. This is not the way Steam games are supposed to work, Steam is supposed to be your repository for any special library requirements of the game. Since then the developers have fixed this issue and it now runs like any other game under Steam.While I absolutely loath C# and Mono (and deem developers who favour it as ""not good""), it will not affect the score. After all, I am reviewing the game and not developer competence and it's a fun game. ps, I love good olde C.Score:3/5			"

It seems almost impossible to get through the game without a team due to the random monster hords (stupid bug...snake...beatle...things). The controls are terrible and are probably going to lead your character to their untimely demise. Wished there was a storyline. All I know is that my character was seperated from some people (friends?) and there are a bunch of pots to smash for money. It'd be Link's paradise.			"

												This game is very hard but very enjoyable.  The keyboard controls feel clunky but are sufficient.  I would highly recommend using a controller. The gameplay is basic but entertaining. I imagine it would get stale in single player, but I only have done multiplayer with friends.  As for the multiplayer, we haven't had any connection issues and the games are really easy to setup.  It would be nice that when you run out of lives, you could reload without having to reconfigure the multiplayer session.			"

												Surprisingly fun and a great co-op game with the friends. Arranging so you're able to host a game yourself can be a bit tricky though so you may want to look up how to do so before you buy the game.The online community was always pleasant though perhaps a little too helpful at times; often running off ahead of you and getting all the secrets you weren't even aware were a thing. This game greatly rewards exploration and figuring stuff out on your own. It doesn't hold your hand. There are several different play styles available with the characters that make team composition matter... Unless you're rangers. Rangers are wonderful and perhaps a little too awesome to want to play the other classes.Hammerwatch is a fun challenge with wonderful cooperative play.			"

												Super repititive boring gameplay. No storyline AT ALL - all the scenario in the game is what you see in first 5 seconds of the game whitch is like 15 words. Entire game you run and kill same monsters search for same stuff. No unique loot can be found - after first episode it gets so boring to search for secret rooms since there are nothing new could be found in those. Character classes are unbalanced as hell - ranger is OP. Played the game with a friend and after we reached third episode it became SO BORING that we hacked it with Cheat Engine (it works even for multiplayer - all your stats except gold can be hacked on the client, gold should be hacked on the server) and run trough the end of third and all fourth stages with immortality. Got bad ending since wasn't paying attention searching for secrets and it was dissapointing. Deleted the game and watched the Good ending on youtube and... it was also dissapointing.			"

												On Mac OS X there are serious issues with this game. On boot up I noticed two immediate issues. Firstly, you cannot quit the game. That's right. It crashes. This is made worse when in fullscreen mode as sometimes not even the 'Force Quit' option works. To sort of resolve this, I had to put the resolution to 'Windowed mode' and exiting has to be done by the red X in the top left corner of the window (usually still accompanied with a Force Quit to finish off). The second issue I found seems to be an issue with Steam - when attempting to view the in game map (press Tab) the map and game is replaced with heavy block textures, the game is still working but it is unplayable in this state. Once entered, the only thing you can do is... Yep. Force Quit. This does have a sort of temporary fix. In Preference>In-Game you must untick the 'enable the steam overlay' button. So you can play the game. Just not on steam. Sort of defeats the point. What is worse is I couldn't find any information from the developers on if they are even doing anything about these game crippling bugs. I hope they are. This game looks fun. Wish I could play it :( "

												This game is a fantastic throw back to classic arcade coop games. Wicked fun, wicked long, and wicked replay value. Gameplay: The fast paced hack and slash play style is so much fun, nothing compares to the joy I feel when hordes of monsters come flying into my sword or volly of arrows. There is so much game too, I clocked in over 24 hours of game time on this game and finally beat it, not many games have that amount of game to play, so it was a refreshing surprise to find this gem of a game. Coop: There aren't many people playing this game, which is unfortunate, because it's wicked fun, especially with friends. It's similar to Borderlands, or Left 4 Dead in that sense. You can play it alone and still have such a wonderful experience, but you'll never have as much fun playing alone as you will with three buds to back you up. 4 player coop and 4 classes equals one brutal dungeon crawl up this monster filled tower.Content: Another refreshing aspect of the game is that it's not filled with super adult stuff. You have some blood, some pixel gore (does that even count, everyone ponder Frogger, rated E), but there is no decapitations, no limbs falling off, no big breasted bat monster boss fights, and that's nice. It's great to have had so much fun playing a game that I know I'd have no problem sitting down with a kid and playing.10/10. This game is such a rare breath of fresh air, it's super cheap, and it's super fun. Everyone should try this game.			"

Very similar to the classic 4-player 'Gauntlet', although with much more depth, such as player character power and ability upgrades and excellently thought-out puzzles.  As a bonus, the developers have just realeased the soundtrack for free, which is comprised of some really excellent music.  After 35 hours of play I still haven't tired of listening to it.  The game works great with an Xbox 360 controller and the graphics can be tweaked to make it look how you like it.  Such a really really excellent game...and the levels are totally massive by the way!  10/10.			"

												Great game. No apparent story, however great dungeon crawler none-the-less. Good balance of challenging opponents and fun which keeps you entertained without getting too frustrated. Classes are all balanced and the class upgrades are unique and fun. Multiplayer runs smooth and provides a ncie time away from the single player experience.Only thing I did not like was that you HAVE to fetch all of the hidden planks in every level in order to eventually beat the game. So if you missed just one, say on the first level, and you get all the way to the point where you need them youre f***ed and all that time you spent was kindof wasted regardless of whether you beat the boss on that level or not. The game does not explain that you eventually need the planks, but you do. I have yet to find out how to get them all...			"

A game that borrows much from the original gauntlet and improves upon them.The art style makes for a retro appeal while the gameplay has an arcady survival thing going for it. If there were and definitive dungeon crawlers out there then this is it. Fight your way floor to floor navigating puzzels, traps, and mobs of enemies. While collecting and managing your money and health. Its exhilerating when you make it out by the skin of your teeth. My biggest complaint is that it gets a bit dull in singleplayer, the difficulty ramps up to high for one person, and the no overarching progress makes it feel unfulfilling.I recommend this over the modern Gauntlet. Oh and theres workshop for plenty of player made levels and campaigns to try out.			"

												Great game to enjoy with a friend... about 20 hours gameplay before i started to lose interest. However, given it's cheap price and the fact that i could get drunk and play this game in person with a buddy added a lot. Looking for a decent game to plan when your friends come over? This title fits that role fairly well!			"

												This is my first entry in the Hack'n'Slash genre, and it was most enjoyable. The vanilla campaign was a thrill to run through with friends and can be beaten easily on Medium while goofing off. if you are looking for more of a challenge, try the new DLC campaign that comes free with the game as my group has found it requires solid coordination in class choice and playstyles to succeed without crutches.My complaint is that the standard skill tree and skill progression is replaced with vendor upgrades.8/10			"

												The videos really depict very nicely just how fun it feels to play this. Especially in a party with friends or even random strangers. The workshop maps give it pretty much unlimited amounts of playtime as well and since it isn't based on savegames, you can always jump in for a nice round here and there. It doesn't have to be big time sink, but you can just keep coming back to it. It is worth the full price, but it's been around for a long time and you could hope for another 75% off deal to come eventually and grab it for something like 2€ like I did.			"

												This game is a great multiplayer experience to do with friends! Two campaigns and many classes give you variation between each playthrough to an extent. I hope they upload more soon or release some dlc that adds two new campaigns though. Usermade ones just don't feel the same. The music is great in this game! graphics are smooth. It does heat up your computer a lot though. I'd recommend for them to add a few new melee classes because the only ones we have a Warlock and Paladin. And Warlock is already frail. So Perhaps a Warrior? A Valkyrie? Cataphract? All of these would fit in very well. But for the price, the game offers a lot to do with friends. It wasn't made for singleplayer though.			"

												When i was 13 i remember playing gauntlet with my friends and trying cocaine out for the first time.  This game reminds me of the yayo fantisies i had when i played one afternoon in the alpha beta supermarket. I spent more money on the game then the cocaine. This game is beyond spectacular in every way. I did not expect so much depth. playing with firends and having a controller is optimal. I would imagain someone getting hundreds of endless hours out of it. I have only played for 20 plus...but its my morning and late night game after h1z1 or battlefield......its simple and hack n slash. thank god for auto fire.....			"

												TL;DR?Its fun, its as fast as you want it to be, six classes, multiplayer, online, singleplayer, has maps made by other people/steam community workshop support.

You bet your grandma's foot on it!A 2D dungeon delver rougelike hack and slash multiplayer game. Great fun alone and with friends. Online i prefer not to do, as there is not voice chat, but there is text chat. That's fine, just for the people who don't have time to type it would be easier. But for a first game, this is amazing. There's 6 classes in this game, thief, paladin, ranger, warlock, wizard and priest, all with different abilities. Some may be more difficult than others, but I prefer ranger, as this game is brutal for melee players. Overall, a great game for yourself, or with your friends.			"

												This is a fine game for people who want almost endless repetition of a very simple Gauntlet style game loop wrapped in cute pixel artistry and a cool soundtrack. If you have friends that suffer from the same illness, so much the better! Everyone else should stick to ARPGs that evolved from this type of games though.+Nostalgia trip guaranteed by graphics that for once could actually almost pass for a 16bit game...if you disable all the shader tricks of course+Same for sound effects+Fine soundtrack+If you can tolerate the repetition, there is a lot to play and the campaigns have replay value thanks to the class system+The two campaigns are almost like slightly different games-Extremely repetitive (even more than this review) and simplistic to a point where it feels almost obsolete at this point-Primary campaign is quite slow and dull. It doesn't allow revisiting previous areas after a boss fight, it drip feeds upgrades at a glacial pace, making character progress feel non-existent and the levels become too large and sprawling after the first boss to be enjoyable-Game and level design seems to be intentionally geared towards making dying unavoidable. Everything feels ""hard"" just for the sake of it instead of any clever idea or innovation-Too many traps that cause instant death and can't be disabled even after passing through them. This makes backtracking to look for secrets etc. rather tedious-Some enemies are very irritating to fight and have attacks that are almost invisible if you keep shader effects on-Ranged classes seem to have the edge in almost every situation compared to melee classes who have to stick their faces in fire or dance around like mad to get anything done-Too many very long moments in multiplayer where dead players have nothing to do but to watch others play in the hope finding more lives			"

If you don't have several friends who are interested in playing this game, you probably won't have fun with it.  Too much of what makes games like this fun is lost if you don't have others to play with.  I haven't played this game with anyone else, but it seems designed to be played by two or more people.  I'm sure you can get pretty far in the game or even beat it by yourself, I just don't think you'll have much fun doing it.			"

ChallengingHammerwatch is the kind of game which gives you a good amount of challenge, either are you experienced in this type of games or not. The official campaign should give you enough of things to get through, but if not, you can always test your skills at the survival mode, or play some of the community made campaigns. Variety of playstyleIt's not only ""hit and run"" for when you change your class from Paladin to Ranger, or from Warlock to Wizard. It's fairly enough variety of what the four different classes give you, even though I'd be more satisfied if at some point you could create your own classes, or use what the community creates. Who says it wouldn't be possible in the near future?Unlimited funEven when you've beaten the official campaign, and gone through survival and all the currently available community content you managed to find, you can hop on to editor and easily create your own levels! Experience the elements of this game, do a campaign of your own, suitable for your playstyle, made easier, made harder than you can handle, anything is possible!			"

												This game is so much fun and horribly addicting. Controls are very smooth and make sense, I've only played with a controller so far so not sure how kb+m is in the game. Best played with a group of people as it gets tough a few levels in if you're not playing on easy. (Though its sometimes hard to join a game online, I've had to join up to 10 games sometimes before you get a host that isnt autokicking you, when I host I let anyone join as long as they dont go wasting lives on purpose.) The game is a gauntlet/bullet hell mix with some rpg elements. You buy upgrades at random vendors rather than level up, and everyone in the party gets all the gold that anyone picks up. Benefit to this is you can join a game thats been going on for a half hour and your character gets whatever the total gold thats been picked up is. Only downside to the game is you dont have characters you create and level up, you either start from the beginning with nothing or join wherever the game is currently in progress.			"

												I don't know, I played for more than 2 hours (bought in a Humble Bundle so not all time is logged on Steam), and I don't really like it. It feels kind of repetetive. There is also little progression. No real level ups etc. So killing monsters feels pretty pointless. If you die you restart from the beginning, but I didn't find an incentive to redo everything I done up to that point. I don't mind hard games or dying. I love Dark Souls and the like. But in Hammerwatch dying just feels pointless. I don't learn anything from it. So replaying the same parts feels pointless.			"

												Back in the years, I used to play Fire Emblem until the day my precious characters died and never came back... Then I started to really hate all the roguelike games ! Yet, I gave this game its chance. And God, my first reaction was something like this :O.The art is great, the gameplay is simple & nervous, the music is nice, the classes are great (they newly added the Thief class somewhere in April 2014). Playing this game in solo is fine ! But in coop it is even better. Online coop's netcode is okay/good, local coop is top notch.			"

Mana-Addicts TLDR ReviewHammerwatch is a very obvious homage to Gauntlet. For those not quite that ancient or who had a deprived childhood the game works a bit like this:-Step1. Kill monsters. Step2. Kill Lots of monsters. Step3. Destroy the spawners before they come back or else go back to step 1.I highly recommend this game if you have a touch of Gauntlet nostalgia or if you have a friend that loves action RPG's as much as you do. Hours will be lost.Full review available: http://mana-addicts.com/main/stop-hammerwatch/ "

												A fun game to play with friends, the inclusion of the workshop adds a lot of playability to the game and really showcases how many possibilities there are with this kind of game. If you don't have some friends to play with though it doesn't really seem to scale the difficulty so it seems to be kind of unbalanced if you try to solo it. I tried it my first run through and did well up until the final boss which I couldn't beat. Subsequently I got together with several of my friends and we beat the same boss rather handily. It's pretty cheap too, so if you are looking for a cheap game to occupy a few hours I would recommend this one.			"

												TLDR Review:Hammerwatch is a hack and slash dungeon crawler in which you progress through the stages alone or with friends, defeating the many unique enemies and unlocking powerful spells. - Multiplayer is super fun and easy to set up - Price is quite low for what it gives you- Lots of replayability, the levels are huge with many nooks and crannies to explore, along with a second campaign and online level maker.- Music and graphics are really good- Spells and enemies are special and cool			"

												Hammerwatch:Hammerwatch is an awesome RPG game with many secrets, custom map creations and multiplayer up to 4 players (Don't need to port4ward). The game is kind of a clone of another game, but I don't really remember it, the game has unique classes wich you can play as, two different implomented maps + the many custom maps!Hammerwatch controls is WASD for movement, arrowup for attack, arrowleft for firstskill, arrowright for secoundskill and arrowdown for thirdskill. Use F to drink potion and SPACE to lock charecter. (If I've missed controls look it up in settings) The game supports a quite cool video settings, with some unique shaders on it.If you do get it, you are quite lucky, or atleast you can enjoy it. BTW I've got 2 trading cards within first day of playing it, so if you love trading cards deffernintly play it if you like cards! (You got a health bar and mana bar for 1-3rd skills)			"

The gameplay functions really well, the pixel graphics are fun to look at, and the music is excellent.I'm not too hot on in though. It's probably just that MAYBE dungeon crawlers aren't my thing... I dunno. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, I just don't see myself touching this one often. But if you like dungeon crawlers, you'll love the hell out of Hammerwatch.One more thing: I highly recommend you use a gamepad for Hammerwatch. It plays way better with it.			"

												Hammerwatch is a really fun game that follows closely to the methods of past games it pays homage to. So much so that it will more than likely only appeal to the generation of gamer who grew up playing those past games and in that one niche move, Hammerwatch has, in a sense, alienated itself from being a truly great game.Hammerwatch plays a lot like Gauntlet, there are hordes of mobs that appear from spawners. The dungeon has you zigzagging from one floor to the next and back in a winding trek through traps, hidden doors, and other general death dealing tricks. You will need to find keys in order to unlock progression further in the game. You have a shared life pool that all players respawn from. Once all your lives are expended you have to start from the beginning, no savesies. There are even certain times when the game goes full-on bullet-hell. Bosses are a mix of tactics, luck, and putrid frustration that, once beaten, gives you a high sense of accomplishment rarely felt in modern games; yet amid all these great gameplay features lies Hammerwatch's Achilles Heel. To truly enjoy this game you MUST play co-op. Single player is possible, albeit arduous and really slow. To progress deep into the dungeon you really need a coordinated team effort or else you'll find yourself spending a lot of time fleeing and waiting around for perfect opportunities to strike. Two man teams still make this game challenging. To really get progression you almost need 4 players. Team play is great, but ONLY if you have a well managed team. Players who have never played games of this type quickly become a liability and ruin gameplay and progression. When the 'newguy' runs through all your lives, while the rest of the team manages to stay alive, it means none of the 'veteran' players can die or else the whole team could wipe. All the loot in-game is displayed for all players to take; so you have to be willing to share success with your team. Therefore you really need a team of players who are all ranked about the same and can cooperate with each other and not go around ninjaing health, loot, and gold. When you've managed to stay alive with a sliver of health for 15 minutes desperately hoping to find a health potion and someone on your team, who died 2 times in the same 15 minutes, decides they need to top up their 90% health bar with the one health potion you've seen in that time, it can lead to quite the rage face.These are all issues that old-school games experienced and many newer games have found ways to prevent such frustrations by giving each player their own loot, allowing for individual lives, and scaling difficulty for the number of people in your team. Hammerwatch is great fun, but only under a specific set of conditions: 4 veteran players who look out for the team not themselves and have the time to group together for long play sessions. Finding those conditions can be difficult for mature (people with jobs and wives and kids) players. It's sad really, because I have owned this game for 5 months and my friends and I have only been able to find time to play Hammerwatch together for 2 hours. So I do recommend Hammerwatch, it's fun, nostalgic, and difficult. I do wish they didn't go so old school, but my own experience is not what a review should be about. It's about the game and this game is great!			"

												Eh.  Gauntlet-like hack-and-slash dungeon crawler.  Simple-yet-poorly-designed controls give the game a nice, compact feel (but, again, why can't we use a mouse?  Even the gamepad controls are a little wonky).Game has the feel of a roguelike without any of the on-death rewards that make roguelikes entertaining.  When you run out of lives, the game ends, and you're left wondering why you would want to start that whole ♥♥♥♥♥how over again.If you watch the trailer, one of the big focal points is the ability to demolish massive hordes of enemies, and that's true, you can.... but skills are bought with gold, and gold drops mainly off of boxes lining the walls that you have to smash, so... murdering enemies is sort of pointless?  Beyond the visceral joy of just murdering things...I dunno.  10 minutes at the dev table with a person who actually likes playing video games could have solved a lot of the problems, but in its current form, HammerWatch is... a mild distraction at best, with little replayability.  Might be better with co-op?  All the reviews on metacritic were saying so, but I can't in good conscience recommend this game to my friends for the $10.00 asking price.  Wait for a sale and try it out en masse, it might scratch a particular itch for you.			"

												From what little I've played of this game so far, I LOVE it.    Graphics wise, we're talking 16x16-32x32px sprites running around in a gloomy yet somehow warm and welcomeing mass of castle hallways and rooms filled with a handfull of classic and a few non classic dungeon crawling creeps, overall all fairly aesthetically pleasing.    Sound wise, nothing to fancy. basic fx sounds, barrels and some enemies have a satisfieing crunsh to em'. The BGM pool have some gread medieval/fantasy esque tracks with this feeling of determination to keep pushing on to the end, very atmospheric and pleasing to the ear.    Gameplay wise, now this is where it get's fun, literally. the controls handle very smoothly and the killing, oh the killing. there's nothing more satisfing in this game than drawing the aggro of 100+ enemies only to turn around and rappid chain-lighting with a warlock setting off a combo and laying everything in the entire room to ashes.    Overlay wise, a nice and simple health/mana section displaying each player's money and deaths along with whateve potion you migt be carrieing simple yet appealing, but wait there's more. The mini map, this mini map makes me wet. it's only availible in overlay mode(see through, but layered ontop of the screen) but it's very understandable making you feel a little less lost in the expance of hallways, stairways, multiple floors connecting here and there, dead ends, secret passages and the occational puzzle                  Over all, a very appealing game to the eyes and ears,                   fun to play alone or with up to 3 friends (or strangers)                                    and very intuitive. 8.5/10 ;3			"

												Nifty pixel graphics, smooth and swift Gauntlet gameplay, fun enemies... and dull, dull level design, really the downfall of the game. Almost no save points to be found, and shops and ways to enhance your character are very, very far apart. If you can get three other players, the game is suddenly fun, but as a solo game it is very dull, and unfortunately the servers are almost always empty.			"

												This game is basically the original Gauntlet with new mechanics- AMAZING, RIGHT?! Dont play this without a party. For one, the game is quite difficult (unless you play on easy), and the bosses will tear you a new one if you go solo. That having been said, the game is much more fun with a party. One thing that feels out of place, though, is that some of the switches are really difficult to spot if you're not paying close attention. I was walking around for about 20 minutes trying to find the last of four wall switches to unlock a door. Not fun. Overall, the game is really fun and I am seriously looking forward to playing some community created content!			"

Great game to play, graphics are decent (I love them but have heard mixed reviews), very replayable (3 campaigns and countless workshop levels), a multitude of classes to master and play as (each with own play style), great as a single player game or as a multiplayer one. Great design to it (You can never get stuck), varying difficulty so you can learn your way up. Lastly many different modifiers so if you think you've done it all, challenge yourself to go even farther. Great game! You love dungeon crawling RPGs, this is for you!			"

The secret rooms, puzzles and overall level design make the game a very pleasant experience that you just want to keep going and see it through to completion.Only a couple of small issues:Would be nice to be able to see how many planks you have collected so far Would be nice to be able to scale (zoom in/out) the map overlay. Can get a little confusing as to where you are/need to be on such large levels.			"

It is fun to decide what upgrades you get and it comes with an editor! A lot of gameplay for the current rate!

												I *highly* recommend this game for people that like oldschool RPG/Hack N Slash genre style games. You play from a top down perspective and kill as many enemies as it takes to get to the end of each level. It feels much like the old gauntlet games. You eat food/crystals to regen health or mana, gain money to upgrade your spells and abilites, and uncover in-game secrets for a chance at great rewards. You can play as a Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, Archer, or a Wizard. Levels are always the same layout each new game, but with plenty of classes and a lengthy compaign it does not disapoint as far as value goes. You can easily expect 15-25+ hours with both campaigns put together, so if you manage to find this on sale its a no-brainer as far as value is concerned. With Survival mode and plenty of workshop maps to play this game can provide even more hours. I have seen people hit around 30-80 hours before growing bored of this game.---- However, it can get slightly repetitive after long play sessions and the graphics are not exactly cutting edge. Directional targeting can be tricky as well. Online play can be a little frustrating, as people will just kick you for slight mistakes or at their convenience. (Whether you deserved it or if they just wanted to have some fun for kicking you) I suggest you host your own game if thats the case, and just let people join you. I only prefer this game with a xbox controller or equivalent gamepad in mind. PC controls get the job done though if you dont have a choice, the PC controls didnt seem like they were a huge inconvience.			"

												I am really enjoying Hammerwatch. It was gifted to me, but I would definitely pay $10 for it. I love the upgrades for each class that you get to choose, and that each class has a distinct play style. I enjoy the challenge of discovering the hidden passages & secrets. It is also great to play with friends, and I really like the shared loot mechanic.On the downside, people may not appreciate that it is a little difficult to play until you figure it out your playing style - at first you won't know what to level up, how to kite mobs etc. Also some classes are hands-down better than others, and the type of classes are not very imaginative (ie. knight, ranger, mage, etc) when they could have easily reflavoured/reskinned these as something out of the ordinary.All in all it is fun & I will be playing more of it with my friends.

												A simple, addicting dungeon crawler. Reminiscent of the original Gauntlet games, but with a bit more spice to it. You choose from a small selection of classes, each with their own unique attacks, abillities, and power-ups. Each class plays differently: the ranger fires arrows and lays bombs while the paladin blocks projectiles with his shield while slicing up enemies at close range, for example. The recent massive update (Temple of the Sun) added tons of class balancing and an entire new class, the priest, which suggests that more classes may come in the future (this is what I'm really hoping for, as learning all the ins and outs of the classes make the game a really fun experience). Two main campaigns will soak up a few hours of gameplay each. The game also comes with a level editor, and the Steam community has already created some really polished campaigns (some better than others, of course). So there will always be new content coming out.The game really shines with its multiplayer. I bought the 4-pack and gave the extra copies to friends, and we've been really enjoying the dungeon crawl together. Beating the first boss for the first time was a very rewarding experience. Single player is still fun, though can get a bit monotonous once you learn exactly how all the enemies respond to you and how to safely win each battle. It's more fun to have other players watchign your back or helping you pick up all the treasure. The only thing that I want from this game is more classes and more campaigns. Everything else is looking great. Definitely recommend.			"

My wife and I had a blast playing through the whole game twice together.Pros:+ Nice retro graphics and good sound, too+ Combat is fun, TONS of enemies+ Skill-up system is solid and has good progression+ Lots of options to tailor difficulty+ Turn off all the lighting and it will run on an old rigCons:+ NOT recommended unless you gift it or want to play co-op locally with a friend+ Playing with strangers online is a sure way to say goodbye to all your lives+ Some players might get tired of searching for keys and secrets+ No ""endless"" progression or procedural generationAll in all, very fun retro game for local co-op.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Part of me really likes it for being a dungeon themed game, but it is very difficult and it is very annoying if you die, because you have to restart (if you run out of lives). It's an ok game, but I don't like it. I wouldn't recommend Hammerwatch			"

												What a game! I have only played in solo mode and it is awesome! Large level maps, very difficult in hard-solo mode, so totally recommended for multiplayer!			"

												Good game, but gets old after a while. It has rouge-like things in it, but since the levels are always the same it gets rather old. Good game though.			"

												Very fun blend of Rogue-like and classic Gauntlet gameplay. Due to the heavier influences of the latter, many levels/areas tend to get long and drawn out, killing the same monsters over and over again, without much change in flavor/skills. Still, very fun overall, with a variety of characters to play as (and a variety of tactics and play styles that go with each).			"

												This game is like Gauntlet yet 100x better.HammerWatch poses a great challenge with the limited lives or a great worriless adventure with infinite. Want to have some extra fun while also testing your friendship? Throw on shared HP and you'll have a good laugh!I love this game, I played 5 hours and 8 floors with my boyfriend on the first go it's so fun to just run around in a good hack and slash game. I would very much also recommend this for people into Dungeons and Dragons.The upgrades make this game also really cool, I love playing as the Warlock :3You should give it a go!			"

												Fantastic.This game is a ""must-buy"" in my book. A fun and simple 8-bit RPG with all the goodies;  fun campaigns, different game modes and an editor that offers endless possibilities through the steam workshop. Buy it, at the very least, put it on your wishlist!			"

												Secrets. All other gameplay aside, this game will scratch your itch to go secret hunting. Not one secret it based on the chance run-in with a seemingly solid wall - every hidden passage has a telltale discrepancy that you'll learn to watch out for and every puzzle can be defeated with skill and reasoning.

												Good retro dungeon crawler type game. Less bullet-hell than Realm of the Mad God, and more progression. Level progression slowly introduces new enemies and mechanics. Hours of fun, especially with others. Play through the default scenarios, play through workshop content, create your own.			"

												At a lower price, yes I recommend the game. The gameplay is good, the content is thin. It's a fun addictive game that relies on you replaying the same 1 mission over and over, fighting the same boss, and progressing. It gets repetative becuase it does not have more than 2 missions worth of content. There are 2 campaigns, each having maybe 10-12 floors. You can run through a floor in about 5-10 minutes with 4 others, and if you run out of lives, die, which happens often, you start at floor 1 again. This would be fine except most of your time is spent on floors 1-5. (it gets more difficult the higher you go). It's 2.99 right now, that is a decent sale price. Not worth 9.99 for 2 missions of content. The game does come with a level editor, however, opening it up, its not easy to use, and anyone who made a mission, you have to have your own copy local. You cannot download a custom mission from someone, i tried.			"

												Pros:-pixel art style-six classes to choose from-2 campaigns-lots of replayability-best enjoyed with friends-upgrades and new skills-very challlenging, but has difficulty modifiers (infinite lives, ect.)Cons:-not alot of enemy variationHammerwatch is a very fun topdown, hack and slash, dungeon crawler. it can be played with upto four players, and is best played with friends. the pixel fantasy style is great, and the soundtrack is nice. it includes 2 campaings that are simmilar, but have enough changes to feel different. there are six classes to choose from, all with different skills and abilities.9/10would recomend if you are looking for a fun game to play with friends			"

												This game is AMAZING! The expansion takes what you already knew from playing through the first game, slaps it on a bigger world, and adds more mechanics. I loved playing through the campaign and it was very enjoyable, although it is a little repetitive. The multiplayer is great for people because it adds more people to the chaos and it makes it more strategic for people to play. I also loved using the challenges to make it harder on myself to see if I could get any better.			"

												It looked fun to play, but it got really boring fast, a simple hack and slash, with really no variation. Literally, all you do is kill monsters, get some coins, increase your dmg, then go to the next floor, then repeat. The few puzzles that are drizzled in the game are anything but puzzles. I would ONLY recommend buying this game if it's marked down to a dollar or so. I only played it for 4 hours, and I was done with it. Same thing, kill, gold, buy, next floor. Also, you don't really save or customize ANYTHING in this game. It feels more like it belongs in a video game arcade than on steam.			"
