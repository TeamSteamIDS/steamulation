												If you're looking for a fun addition to the Batman franchise, I'd recommend it. If you're looking for a good platformer, hold off on it. For now. Batman™: Arkham Origins Blackgate adds a good story upon Arkham Origins' original one that will keep any Batman-fan interrested to the end. However, in terms of gameplay, it's not too good. Not for a Batman game nor a platformer. The Good:· An interresting story that takes place after Arkham Origins and before Arkham Asylum, set mostly in Blackgate Prison.· Fun and different take on the Arkham storyline. With drawn comicbook-esque cinematics and 2.5D gameplay it offers an entirely different way of playing as Batman. Using Batman's gadgets in 2D is surprisingly entertaining.· Collectibles give fans a reason to return to the game after completion, albeit very linear. That being said...The Bad:· ... the game plays a bit too linear for an Arkham game. The combat and platforming feel a bit too stiff and at points even forced. The series is known for, among others, its Free Flow combat system. Don't expect to see Free Flow combat here. There is combat in the game that looks a little bit like the combat in Arkham Asylum, but it plays stiff and clunky.· Confusing and overly-guided platforming combined with reasonably frustrating stealth gameplay will definately take some getting used to (for example, Batman will switch from one platform in the foreground to another platform in the background using the Batclaw and there is no option to look around while in vents).The Ugly:· For a port its pretty reasonable, with smoothened egdes and overall a slightly better quality but characters will still feel stiff and the environments at times a bit repetetive or downright boring.Final Verdict:Batman™: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a fun game to play through if you're a big Batman fan, but platformer-lovers won't really find anything new or surprisingly interresting. Are you interrested in the game for its story, or are you looking for the series' innovative gameplay? That question is one this review answers.7/10. "

IntroThis will be a review for the game Batman Arkham Origins BlackGate Deluxe Edition, before buying the game make sure to read this entire review(though quite long) as it may impact your decision on buying the game, to start it out lets just get right into the Pros and ConsPros-	Good campaign – this game has a very long and interesting campaign that takes place after the events of Arkham Origins it feels well done but at times a bit strange, each of the main 3 villains that you have to hunt down all have a unique boss fight and a unique mini-boss, each of the bosses and mini-bosses test a Varity of skills such as predator, combat, parkcor and a mix of all of them, but the true gem of the game is the fact that depending on the order you take out bosses the game changes, meaning that every time you play you can have different experiences and endings, though in the end the campaign was fun and well worth what I spent on it-	Costumes – There are a fair amount of unique skins available in this game that aren’t in any other Arkham game, like Beware The Batman, Year Zero and more, some of these are unlocked with a WB login while others are earned by collecting costume pieces across the large map, and each of these skins also have unique benefits when equipped that can really help you out when needed-	Map – This is a very interesting feature that’ll appear on cons as well, but the positive is, is that the map is very large with many secrets paths and more, the map has 3 different wings in BlackGate Prison, each wing is controlled by a different mob boss Joker, Penguin, or Black Mask, and it has another part of the map the Lighthouse-	Collectables – This game has a numerous amount of collectables 1 series for each mob boss and a few other collectables that give gadgets, costumes, and buffs to your character, all of these collectables are interesting some are needed to get farther in the game while most others are only for completionists-	Combat – Like the other Arkham games the combat in the is basically the exact same thing just in a 2D format, it transfers pretty well and is kinda fun though you don’t get to do combat as much as I’d prefer-	New Villain & Set’s Up New Story – This game introduces a new villain into the Arkham franchise Bronze Tiger and man do I really want to see more of him, now the other gem of this game is that it picks up after Arkham Origin and sets up the Suicide Squad, meaning a entire new story for a Suicide Squad game or another Arkham Origins game and I’m excited to see where they take this-	Cutscenes & Voice Acting – The cutscenes in this game are pretty cool in a unique art form that makes the game look cool and different from everything else, voice acting is on point like the other games no surprise there-	No Glitches – Through my experience I had a few hard crashes but other than that it wasn’t to badCons-	PSVITA Port – This game mainly suffers from the fact that it’s a port from the PSVITA , the main reason its on steam is because of the fact that it didn’t sell enough on PSVITA so it was ported and everything in the game just feels ported so depending how you look it, it’s a pro or a con-	Map – While its big, its pretty f*cking confusing, the map is shown in a 3 dimensonal form which looks strange and confuses you even more, navigation around the map is tiring and annoying especially going long distances, half of the time your lost or trying to find out how to get to the next objective, and like most Arkham games there are some places you can’t go until you get the gadget which makes it harder to go easier paths as you can’t yet, even after I completed the game I have almost no motivation to finish as I’m lost trying to find the rest of the collectables-	Investigations – This was a good idea that just ended up being so stupid you’ll almost never finish one, the idea is that in the map if you activate your detective vision you can find clues that lead to a investigation where you get like a prize or something for completing, you pretty much never figure one out since its not marked on the map and since half of the time your lost theres almost no way to find one for a specific area-	Predator – While combat seamlessly transferred over predator wasn’t so lucky, while its not as hard most of the time at some points it feels impossible like the boss fight for Penguin its waves of Predator and it got to a point where I had to memorize the patterns and took me about 30 attempts to finish it-	Need Controller – This could be a positive or negative depending on who you are while I have a controller and was just fine if you don’t then either get a controller or don’t buy this game, keyboard controls are to confusing and weird to use it’s just waaaay easier when using a controller-	Boring/Depressing Atmosphere – Most Arkham games have this but it’s worse in this one, after or even during the campaign it just feels boring a lot of the time and depressing, if you make far enough to beat the campaign and you’re a competionist you probably won’t even be able to get all as it’s atmosphere feels negative, boring, and depressing making you want to play a different game-	Navigation – This is going to be about navigating the map, which is annoying, and hard to explain but if you play the game you’ll understand getting movements strange due to the 3D aspect Final VerdictWhile the campaign is interesting, massively expands the Origins story, and at times very fun, but controls, maps, and other things effect the game at a pretty big level, the Final Verdict for this game is a 6/10, if you’re a fan of the series it’s a must buy to extend the story, I’d go ahead and give it a shot for a unique gameplay experience that may never happen again, if your new to the Arkham series then this is a very easy pass, if the games on sale for $5 which is what I got it at make sure to get it as it’s well worth $5, I hope this review helped anyone make a decision and if it did make sure to leave a comment down below and any other games you want me to review, as always Thank you and Enjoy!!!

												Don't expect a game like the previous Batmans. This one is very different. It's a 2.5D platformer game and a port of the PS Vita version. So it's a big change. But it's a very interesting and original version. New look, same gameplay though. Graphics still beautiful (for a platformer!) Fights are easy, there's no real challenge in it. The story is amazing, the map is kinda pretty, kinematics look like a comic book. At this price, it's worth playing as long as you consider it as a little Batman game that will help you to wait for the next AAA Batman ^^ Fans wouldn't be able to resist! :P7/10.			"

												If you are reading this, it may not be too late for you. I am begging you, do not buy this game. It's closer to a foreign knock-off of an actual Arkham game. There are elements, sure, like Detective Vision, but the game becomes a clunky sidescroller, and I do mean clunky. I played for ten horrible minutes, and I truly believe that I would have felt more in control if the game was entirely controlled by button prompts, like DDR. Maybe you're an Arkham fan, and like me, you see this game on sale for $5. Maybe you ignore the negative reviews and decide to buy it, like me. Save your money, PLEASE. If this game is on sale, odds are other games are too, and here on Steam, $5 can go a long way. I would never recommend this to anybody.			"

												Pros:- Story is actually pretty good... not as good as previous arkham games, but good enough for a PSvita port.- Comic style narration and ilustration.- The concept art is awesome.- Voice acting.- It's Batman.Cons:- The map.- The controls.- Everything about combat. Trust me, you'll hate it.- Fighting the bosses (except Grundy).- Interaction with environment. - Since the map sucks, finding all collectibles is a big no no. C'mon, even The Riddler gave us a map at some point before!- Detective Cases are lame.- You actually have to complete the game three times in order to unlock some skins and the achievement for getting them all. Thanks, but no, thanks.I do recommend the game, but only if it's on sale... at least 75% (as I got it). 05/10			"

												For those people who left comments complaining about this game being a 2.5D game rather than a 3D game I just have this to say; this game was created for the Playstation Vita and Nintendo 3DS. It was never intended to play like the rest of the Arkham games. It is a port from a handheld game. Arkham Origins and Blackgate weren't even developed by Rocksteady. It's a spinoff game featuring different voice overs than the main stream Arkham games. If you can get over that this game wasn't developed by Rocksteady, or that it wasn't developed for console of PC gaming, then I say get it. If you can't, then stay away.			"

												So at first, I didn't know what Arkham Origins - Blackgate was. I looked at some reviews and there a mix of good and bad. Alot of people said that the combat was bad, detective mode and visuals were horrible. As an arkham fan, playing arkham asylym first and enjoying it very so, I decided to give blackgate a chance and see for myself how it was after beating arkham origins.So the game takes place three monthes after Batman Arkham Origins.The basic story is you got a blackgate prison out break, and Batman is trying to stop this outbreak by gaining control of the 3 blocks the prison is divided in by bringing back power to each block. Each block is controlled by a villian. Arkham Wing - Penguin, Administration Building - The Joker, and Industrial Building - Black Mask. Note there is also Soloman Grundy, Deadshot and Catwoman in the game, and you interact with them along the way. The game offers a bit of a choice as you can kind of go after The Joker, Penguin or Black Mask in any order.This does give a new way an arkham game could work, as in all the other arkham games the order in which you chase your villians changes as the story goes on. (Side quests don't count.) There are side quests you can do in this game, but it feels a big task in doing them, and not very fun like in the other arkham games.So let me tell you some things about the combat. Me personally, I didn't find the combat bad, at times I did like it. However, it could use quite a bit of work. First of all, it is a 2.5D game, as in its a 2D Sidescroller game where you can only move left and right, but you're moving around in a 3D World. This already gives you a sense of why people are not liking the combat. The combat in the other arkham games were more free flow and fast paced, where as in arkham blackgate, its restricting, annoying and slow. By restricting I mean you can only fight enemies who are close to you, and fighting off other enemies requires you to jump over the one closest to you, and make your way more up with enemies farther. The controls aren't good as they're are unresponsive and kind of dumb. Prefferably its better to play with a control for this game as the controls are better. It almost pains me to play the game as it more feels like a task. The map itself is very annoying as you can get lost so many times and you're basically spending hours just trying to get to your main point. The map you get to navigate your way around blackgate is confusing as it tries to put a 3D like map in flat like form. On top of that, you need to find upgrades in this map which can also be a pain, as in if you don't the boss battles can be unbeatable. So far for the boss battles, Penguin being the hardest as in one of his guards spot you, they litterly shoot you to death which takes about 2 seconds resulting in you dieing in the process. Not only is that hard, but its even harder as you're in a small area, and to get the guards away from penguin you have to give distractions, and they see you constantly. On top of that, there are drones that scout out the area and shoot on sight which results in a automatic death.The Catwoman boss battle was a bit challenging as you have to time your countering and attacks 100% accuatley and perfectly. Gettingn hit twice results in a automatic death, and there isn't a checkpoint or anything in the battle as its constant dodging every second for like two minutes. It may not seem that hard, but once you get there I wouldn't be surpirsed if you saw some people did it on youtube. Now keep in my mind, this game was originally designed to be on a 3DS/PS Vita. Armature Studies gave a port to give the arkham fans an original feel as all arkham games are for the console (originally made by rocksteady). However, if a game is deisgned for the 3DS/PS Vita, that same game shouldn't have the same design on console/pc versions. if you do, you get all of what I said before, annoying combat, bad maps, annoying controls, it works but is almost unenjoyable, and it's task to play.I don't want to reccomend or not reccomend the game. As an arkham fan the story was decent. Nothing special. Explains a little of what happened between Batman Origins and arkham asylum. So, I will say this. Get this game when its on sale, as its worth the price of 5 bucks. The game itself isn't worth the 20, and I thought this as soon as I actually got into the game.What I suggest Rocksteady to do is make a game that is actually, a sequel to Arkham Origins after they conclude the arkham series with Arkham knight. This game was supposed to be designed to be like that, hence, why it has the name ""origins"" in the title. However, i think its honnestly a bad idea to do this and design the game itself to be on hand-held consoles, and then to be later ported on to regualr consoles. In my opnion, its a bad idea.Lets hope rocksteady can correct this mistake and give us a real arkham game like blackgate, but redesigned for consoles. Overall, the game deserves a7/10			"

												A poorly executed addition to the Arkham series.Pros:- Story is relatively interesting.- Voice acting is as good as in the main games.- Hacking minigame isn't bad.Cons:- Ridiculously clunky controls, freeflow combat does not work at all well and Batman is extremely unresponsive.- The bossfights are rather annoying and can get extremely repetitive when you repeatedly die due to some tiny error on your part. Normally you respawn before a cinematic plays too (thankfully they are skippable).- The map is extremely difficult to read and I got stuck in the wrong place or at a dead end several times.- The game just isn't very helpful in telling you what to do, I had to look up walkthroughs several times just to realise I was missing something extremely simple.- Detective mode is there but very limited, plus the addition of having to hold the Alt key down in order to see key objects which you have to 'analyse' (hold your mouse over them for a few seconds) just got annoying.- Technically, the game is very limited, the graphics are a lot worse than the main games and the map is clearly split into a lot of different sections, normally split by doors which the player 'walks' through after pressing the Spacebar. These are to be expected however due to the limited specs of the platforms the game was originally made for.- The whole unique selling point of it being a 2.5D game just doesn't work well. Arkham Asylum may have seemed linear at times but at least there was some open space to move, this game is all in enclosed corridors and isn't even interesting to look at.Overall, I can only recommend this if you are a huge fan of the series, and at a deep discount. It's not the worst game in ever but it's certainly not one I can see myself replaying any time soon.			"

												I finished up Arkham Origins and lucked into a really cheap copy of AO: Blackgate at roughly the same time. Blackgate is a 2.5D side-scrolling beat-'em-up with a few puzzles thrown in. The story is told through motion-comic-style cutscenes with full voice-acting and it revolves around riots that take place at Blackgate sometime apparently not long after the events of Origins. Black Mask, Penguin, and Joker have all taken control of a section of the prison and Batman has to go in and rescue hostages and take down the bad guys in his inimitable Batman way.Sadly, the gameplay itself is sorely lacking. Armature Studios made an effort to translate the Arkham series' signature free-flow combat to a 2.5D game but it doesn't quite work. As you see from the image below, the game is fond of tossing upwards of 5-8 opponents at Batman simultaneously; this level of opposition is non-problematic in the regular Arkham games because Batman is free to move around at will and target any of his opponents at any time. Here, the Darkknight Detective's movements are restricted to left and right and the game determines his target based on which enemy happens to be closest and in the direction he's currently facing. This makes tactically targeting specific enemies needlessly difficult, especially when facing knife- or stun-baton-wielding foes, which require certain actions to eliminate. In small groups the regular villains aren't too difficult to handle, but when the game presents you with multiple groups of antagonists at once, things can get hairy.However, the boss fights are the epitome of everything that you hate about the concept of ""boss fight"" in a game. Some of them, like Black Mask and Bronze Tiger, are pretty straightforward, but the Penguin, Joker, and Catwoman battles get progressively more irritating as you fight through multiple stages that require very specific attack strategies to defeat. I actually quit the game before finishing the Catwoman fight because for some absurd reason the counters don't work the same way in this conflict as they do in the rest of the game; the second and third stages of this fight require you to counter her attacks before you can go on the offensive, and because the controls for countering appear to be virtually unresponsive in this fight, I gave up after 9-10 attempts. Maybe if you're more dexterous than me, you'll have better luck.The other aspects of the game are merely okay. The game includes a detective mode, like its big brothers, so Batman can scan the environment for ways to get around and collectibles. There are suit pieces that can be collected and different Batsuits can confer bonuses. For example, the ""Beware the Batman"" suit that you get by having an Arkham Origins save on your computer provides a 50% armor bonus against gunfire. A Blackest Night suit (grants invulnerability to most forms of damage) is available by collecting the pieces in-game (you'll have to get about 95% of the way through the game to get all of the pieces so it's not game-breaking) and another (Zero Year) that you get from having a WBID login. You can only collect one of the other suits per playthrough, depending on the order in which you defeat the game's bosses. There are also detective cases to solve, which essentially involves going everywhere it's possible to go and scanning all areas with your Detective Vision until you find all of the clues associated with a specific case (these just basically provide a minimal amount of additional insight into the villains' activities just before or during the events of the game). You'll spend a lot of time doing Armature's version of the crypto-sequencer, which means matching a sequence of three numbers until you get the correct combination to unlock a door or device.You won't be able to get every collectible in each area the first time you go through it because, as in the other Arkham games, some require you to have access to gadgets that you have to acquire as you progress through the story. That's not so unusual, but navigating through the different areas of the prison using the in-game map is quite a chore because it often appears that you can head in a particular direction, only to come across a dead end or switchback and the maps are really just cleverly-constructed labyrinths. At least a few hours of my playtime I can probably chalk up to wandering around the cell blocks and industrial areas, trying to reach an exit or some other specific landmark that was gratuitously problematic to locate.Everything looks good here and the voice-acting is first-rate, so there are no issues on the presentation side, but in the final analysis, this game is remarkably inferior to its full-fledged, 3D brethren. The action is mediocre, the puzzles aren't really puzzles at all, the boss fights are infuriating, and the story is really the only interesting thing about it. I spent about 19 hours playing but if you're the kind of OCD person who needs to get every achievement, you'll have to play three times so you could easily get the same amount of mileage out of this as you did from Arkham Origins. By then you'll probably wish you'd never heard of Batman, let alone this particular game. "

												While a Batman metroidvania sounds really, really good in principle, this game is probably the worst implementation of it I could imagine? The 2.5D nature makes it really hard to tell what you can and can't interact with, given that you'll be going in and out of the background in various rooms, and the combat system being a stripped down, less-controllable version of the Arkham games' fighting means that enemy encounters are a slog rather than an easily skipped or shot target when traversing older rooms. The enemies can be in three dimensions, but you cannot move in them, so if someone is not quite in the melee yet, or is pushed aside somehow, well, enjoy dropping combos as you want to hit them. (Similarly, it makes targeting whoever has the assault rifle a real bear, because guess what the lock-on doesn't prioritize in this game like the others?)Another thing that should be mentioned is that while they try really, really hard to make sure the controls keep continuity with the other games, this is adapted from a 3DS/Vita game, which means that some very, very strange controls are in place, and let's not even get into how Detective Mode is basically just ""see vision cones because where enemies are looking is not always clear"". To actually look at things, you need to turn on DM, then hold the button down to bring up a magnifying-glass reticle, then shift it with one stick while hoping anything at all on your screen is something Batman will interact with. These objects are, by and large, not highlighted (or sometimes even hinted at in any fashion), so just pull out the ol' magnifier whenever you hit a dead end and hope that's the right response, not ""oops I needed to look at a grate two rooms back so I could open it"".Let me be fair to the game and give it some honest praise: it seems to be somewhat non-linear. There are three seperate wings of the prison you need to get into, and each is its own distinct area with a gadget that'll help you progress/an upgrade to pass more security clearance, which will also open up new secrets in the others, so that's cool. It's just that the actual traversal and exploration is a massive pain due to the environments being unclear in what's set dressing and what's interactable, and the combat being a large slog for back-and-forth travel. (It doesn't even give you XP or anything like in the other Arkham titles, so it is seriously just time-wasting filler. Your health regenerates slowly out of combat.)I seriously can't recommend this game to anyone unless you really, really want to see Batman do the Samus thing, or finally want an Arkham game that lets you play dress-up without needing to NG+ it. It's not particularly fun and so, so many games on Steam scratch the gameplay itch for this genre better.			"

												TLDR = I love the Arkham series. This game sucks.I went into this with very low expectations, and I'm still disappointed.Gameplay: Honestly, you have to scan EVERYTHING, or else you'll miss something. Every few feet you run, you have to hold LB, move the circle around the screen, just to make sure there isn't simple tiny 5 pixel big thing that you're supposed to scan. Every now and then you run into a few guys to fight. You then run back and forth throughout the whole complex, trying to find that ONE little spot where you're supposed to do something. Some people are calling this Metroidish, in that you need to backtrack... No... Metroid backtracking made sense, and was fun. This is just randomly wandering the same halls over and over again, with very little idea of what to do, scanning everything you can find. It's all one giant monotonously boring grind. Incredibly not fun. It's a chore to play this game.Stealth: Very little stealth in the game, and it's extremely simplistic, and even boring. Later in the game there's some difficult stealth fights, but it's not difficult in a fun way, it's difficult in a ""COME ON I'm pushing the button to go up there so DO IT!"" kind of way. You just really don't feel like you are the Batman. You feel like you have to find the EXACT right moment to push a certain button. Really lame.Fighting: Not very many fights at all to be honest. For example, the biggest fight in the whole game is about seven thugs... no joke... two are armored, the rest are just regular thugs, one might have a knife. Super simple. The fighting is FAR more simplistic; no specials, don't really use gadgets, just boring. Also, the timing of the counters and hits feels waaaay off. I'm quite good at the Arkham games (100% all of them, two of them twice), and I just can't get the hang of the combat, because it just doesn't feel like they put the time into it, to make it smooth and reliable. Stun a guy and expect to then beat him down? Nope. Game will make you punch the guy next to him. Jump over a stun stick guy and think you'll hit him? Nope. Game makes you hit someone else. Just really bad programming.Story: The story is boring and predictible, and gave me no motivation at all to play. Minor spoilers: It's basically a jailbreak, and you have to fight all the criminals all over again, but there's a plotline where someone higher up has allowed this to happen for reasons (just to have that expected twist, lol).Overall: The game is monotonous. It feels like a constant boring brind. I will beat it, merely because of my love for Batman. I knew going into it that it was a money grab, and I'm still very disappointed.EDIT: It gets worse... There are missable achievements, and they're so missable that you have to completely restart your entire game... The game is also built in a way that you have to play through the whole terrible game three times in order to get 100%. Good games I don't mind doing this for, but badly made game with little to offer? Wow, just so annoyed right now.			"

												Right lets start by saying that allthough this game is set in the same storyline as the ""ARKHAM"" games it doesnt really play out in the same way that the other games actually do (even though it still carries the ""ARKHAM"" tag).Heres the trailer for BATMANS adventures in BLACKGATE!!!


YouTube™ Video: Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate Trailer 

			Views: 208,279		

			Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate trailer. Coming to PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS. Developed by Armature Studio, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate brings the core Arkham pillars to a handheld...		

Ok lets just say that having said that,that the actual fight mechanics,gadgets and all around atmosphere feels like it does in most ""ARKHAM"" games but thats where the similarities end,to be honest the way you play the actual game feels more like an oldschool ""METROID"" or ""CASTLEVANIA"" game and it plays out from that viewpoint.Now this is no major problem as this only spoils your enjoyment of this well made game if you sit and think about it to much ""HEY THIS DOESNT PLAY LIKE THE OTHER ARKHAM GAMES,ME UPSET AND WANT MY MONEY BACK"",and to be honest once you get used to it the 2.5d way the game is put forward actually feels fresh and new (well as new and fresh as it can feel anyway).Lets get onto the fundamentals of the game,the graphics really do their job and do it well of putting over the whole atmosphere of playing in a ""BATMAN"" game and the cutscenes look like they have been stolen straight out of a graphic novel.The cutscenes really do look like they have been ripped straight out of a graphic novel!!

The sound in game is top notch from music and sound effects to spoken dialogue,everything sounds just as it should and puts forward that vibe that you need to convice you that you are in fact playing a ""BATMAN"" game.Mention must go to the voice actors and in particular 3 people Troy Baker who plays the JOKER and does (in my humble opinion) a fantastic job as the clown prince of crime (must say though that i do like and miss Mark Hamil,but well everything changes-not allways for the best though),Roger Craig Smith who does an excellent job of capturing that sound and dark forboding feel of THE DARK KNIGHT and Grey DeLisle who does a great job as the sultry and allways intriguing CATWOMAN (heres a trivia fact for everyone Grey DeLisle had been playing a certain Daphne Blake since 2001).Ok on to the story,well actually no as to tell even any details would spoil both your enjoyment and the sheer buzz you will get out of playing it lets just say that i can mention a few certain villians that appear in the game 1-JOKER,2-PENGUIN,3-CATWOMAN and 4-BLACKMASK,there are other villians in the game and they are there for you to discover for yourself as if i say anymore it would spoil the whole story!! (but dont do like a lot of people do and rage quit as all the enemies in game are beatable.....................i am looking at you MR COBBLEPOT!!!!!!)Finally defeated you PENGUIN!! (this is the fight that most people loose patience with and rage quit!!!!..............well dont as its doable and you just need to learn the pattern of the goons and then its easy!!!!)


Now you are going down you stinky,fish eating BIRD

I will say this though that the game and story take place in BLACKGATE and that the whole thing takes part in 4 distinct areas the Cell Block, the Industrial Area, and the Administration Offices (with each playing out slightly different from the others,with each needing certain upgrades in your epuipment to beat and master),and each area has its own BOSS and at the end its own BOSS battle (some are easy,some hard and a few border on SATANICALLY DIFFICULT-you know which fight i mean you game you)Will you enjoy taking another journey into the DARK KNIGHTS world,well yes if you love BATMAN and have any interest in playing a well made and put together peice of entertainment then why are you still reading this review go and buy the game and if not ""HOLY HECK BATMAN,WHY NOT THIS GAME IS STUPENDOUS"" says ROBIN and how can you disagree with a man brave enough to wear tights and go out in public (well at least he was like that in the 1960s American live action television series,GOD it would take some nerve to do that today)(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			"

												Is it horrible? No. But it’s incredibly boring.Story:A bunch of villains have taken over blackgate. Take it back. They imply some deeper connection with some sinister organization but that whole thing ends in a cutscene and a sequel that isn’t going to be made so this is a waste.Nothing against the voice actors who do a great job at their characters but the story around them is uninspiring.Gameplay:It’s a metroidvania where you go to different parts of your map, unlock more of the map via upgrades and collectibles, and fight things. The exploration aspect of it just boring as none of the levels are that interactive or are fun to explore. The combat on the other hand, is ♥♥♥♥ing awful. It takes 4 hits to kill most enemies, there was never a challenge, and the timing of the counters has been changed from the rest of the Arkham games so you end up getting hit. It’s boring and when they make you use the god awful map to backtrack for a padded section at the end, it just takes away all of the positives it had going for it.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)It looks bad. To be fair, it’s a remaster of a handheld game but it looks super terrible. At Least the frame rate and soundtrack are decent.Final Thoughts:When I get to the “Can I stop playing this now” point of a game, it has failed me and this game failed me.			"

												The only thing I hate about this game is the maps which are like a freakin' maze. Its pretty big and especially Industrial Map is annoying. 2.5D / 2D Batman Game. Really fun and interesting. Need atleast 25-30 of gameplay to get all the achievements but that can be done. I loved all the different endings. Not a must buy but if youre a Batman freak then go for it. 6/10			"

												As a huge fan of the batman arkham series, I have to say wow this was a really huge disappointment.Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure this game would be fantastic on the original PS vita version. But this port was just plain boring, had no moments it just has a story to listen to. Now the graphics are fantastic for a port but honestly the lack of gameplay is really boring.Honestly I was so bored playing with my mouse I had to remap my buttons to the keyboard just to even make it ""remotely fun""**CONTROLS**You're seriously hitting either space or 'F' about 80% of the time, the other 20% would be combat. The combat is very inadequate. It isn't as responsive as any of the arkham games. I would hit one guy and then the avoid icon would appear and if I tried to avoid his attack to attack him back it'd glitch out and then miss.**GRAPHICS** Just a little heads up on this *I was very disappointed* with the fact that there's no graphics option. Only 2 options + change resolution.The game was promising, but failed to deliver. I honestly would not recommend this even to a die hard batman fan (I'd only recommend getting the PS Vita version) if you want a good experience.Score : 6/10			"

												Positives: The voice acting though not up to the standards of Asylum and City.  The costumes, Catwoman.Start of the game. Blackgate itself with the option to choose which  villains you want to take down first.Negative: Fighting Mechanics are god awful, Controls suck. No mouth movement with the characters when speaking.Overall it's a 6/10 game for me.			"

												atman arkham origins blackgate is a different style of batman but not necessarly in a bad way. The new anime style cutsceens are very well done by the artists. The fighting style is different and at a slower pace but that combo meter fills and fills. the non cutscene animation is fantastic with great attention to detail. The map however is not great, it takes time to understand where one is actually going in relation to the map.Overall batman arkham origins is a great game with the only major letdown being the map. I give it  a 7/10			"

												I can't even....I am a HUGE Batman fan. In fact, I love everything Batman (even the 1960's TV show)!But after playing 3.8 hours of this game, I can't bear to play it anymore. The in-game map is confusing as hell (and as far as I'm concerned completely useless) and the combat is extremely clunky. This game attempts to mimic the freeflow combat seen in the other Arkham games but it does a rather poor job of doing so thus making the combat not fun whatsoever! When playing this, it got to the point where everything felt like a chore, and when you start feeling that way about a game that's when you know it sucks.Also, you can tell that the developers didn't put a lot of logical thought into this. For example, Batman arrives at Blackgate prison with JUST batarangs. WHY THE HELL WOULD HE NOT ARRIVE WITH ALL OF HIS GADGETS?! And to get the rest of the gadgets, you have to find them in various places in the prison. How does that make any sense story-wise? How did his gadgets get stolen and hidden in the prison? The game never explains this. So yeah, this game sucks, and it sucks big time. Not even worth playing for hardcore Batman fans, imo. Remember the Batman Forever game for the SNES and Sega Genesis? This game is just as frustrating and lame as that one.I bought this on sale for like $3 and I still feel ripped off. For God's sake, do not waste your money on this even if it's on sale. I'm warning you!			"

												I liked it - the story isnt that interesting, but I did like the metroidvania-lite atmosphere.  Its hard to reccomend, I am a Batman nut so if it's a solid game I'll thumbs up anything.  To a casual you probably wont find much to light - its on the light side, the puzzles and metroidvania elements are pretty basic and the combat can get very frustrating sometimes especially when you got 2-3 specials on the screen that need specific tactics to deal with.  In traditional Batman Arkham games this wouldnt be an issue as its 3D - however being this is 2/2.5D it becomes a huge clutter at times trying to deal with multiple enemy types.  A personal nitpick is that I was able to unlock a new suit before the end of the game, whcih also goes into New-Game+, that makes you invincible...kind of a game breaker.More on the story - it's pretty bare bone.  You are sent to Blackgate to rescue hostages, but there is no dialogue, no interaction with anyone really aside from the brief boss fights or conversation with Catwoman.  To spoil a little even the motivations you find are pretty irrelevant, at the end you dont even know why the villian was doing what they were doing - if anything other than a paycheck.  The three hub villians are really in it for screen time and to cause chaos.  Its just an excuse to throw Batman into 3 hubworlds against typical thugs.  I semi compared it to Indiana Jones' contribution to Raiders of the Lost Ark, courtesy of the Big Bang Theory.  I left the game feeling the story did nothing to me, unaccomplished and quite possibly if I, or Batman, were not apart of it, the same result would have occured or nothing at all.If I had to rate the game it would be a 3/5 - its above average, 20 dollars might be a little steep for what you're getting in the end especially with the actual content the game provides though.  Bought it on sale for 5 dollars, 1 playthrough got me 8.5 hours.  21/30 achievements.  I personally dont have an interest to revist the game again - at least not for awhile.  It does quite literally nothing to advance the plot of Arkham Origins, or anything specific to Batman.  There is an interesting ultra sidestory of Amanda Waller and the Suicide Squad that anyone who watches Batman or DC Comics can call the second its on camera.			"

												There are many things subpar with this game, and it is surely vastly inferior to every other ""Batman: Arkham"" game, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""bad"". It's a weak game, but it's still enjoyable, for the right price (read: discounted).This could, however, have easily been an expansion for Arkham Origins, and it would have been much better off that way.

But hey, once you get the driver issues resolved (rollback to Nvidia 358.50 if you want to get past the first cutscene) you too can wonder why Batman refuses to turn around even when you are ""in control"".

Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate			* 4/10Arkham Origins Blackgate is a conversion from PSP of a platform game that takes place right after Arkham Origins (but still before Arkham Asylum). Batman goes to the blackgate prison where Joker, black Mask and the Penguin have taken control of hte 3 wings of the prison. The idea might be fun, but the game has some serious problems of design and gameplay.first of all this game is a maze. And the developers know it, as a matter of fact they implemented a map to help the player move... Too bad it's really hard to read, with its isometric perspective and multilevel structures badly linked and represented. And in this maze the mission asks you to go from an end to another and there's no fast travel option, requiring you to follow all the forced (and most of time long) paths until the ""hub"" to switch from a prison wing to another.The other problem is in gameplay. Batman is extremely slow. Not during run or others, but during fights, he is extremely slow while avoiding attacks making him very vulnerable during fights with high numbers of enemies. Not to mention the worst coded final battle ever. to parry an attack you can hold the button but here you must quickly press the moment you're being attacked, then you can parry normally... But the game never tells you that difference. You are being cheated by the game itself that changes the fight system just to simulate a battle you cannot win unless you know this bull$h17. Nope, definitely nope.+++PROs+++*coff-coff...*---CONs--- BORING MAZE. This game was the most annoying game in the Arkham Series. So annoying that I refuse to consider it part of the Franchise. A boring long maze that forces you to go back and forth by uselessly long paths with the unhelpful and consued map. FIGHT SYSTEM. Batman is too slow at avoiding attacks and the defense system changes in the final fight without reason or any advice. I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

Anyone seen my Keys to the Batwing?Sidescroller meets Batman! but how well did the mix go?...This is the 2nd Game in the Arkham Series storyline. It is noticeably different in terms of gameplay and the players perspective when playing. This biggest difference to other games that this has, is definetely the Side-Scrolling Style. It is a 2.5 Dimensional Experience (Wrap your head around that!) -Basically mortal kombat 9..The main reasons for the change are:-Armature Studios (Known for Metroid) created the bulk of content here.-WB Games wanted to include Ps Vita Users and even 3DS users in the Arkham series, since Batman was growing in popularity! (Everybody loves Batman right?) So this style was more handheld friendly.-An experient really, to see how well it would work in that sort of environment.Now Because it is so apart from the other game, it recieved bad reviews for PC. As a PS Vita game it is immpressive, but as a PC Game...


My Fight, not yours!

Because of the style that the Arkham games have used so well(Open world, free-flow combat, third person, etc.), this game obviousy had to bring lots to the table to make up for the lacking features of the regulars. But does it deliver? thats the Big question, lets see if i can give it justice where its needed. Here is the Pros and Cons:PROS:+Interesting side scrolling variant! the introduction of new environments and camera angles that the average third person view wont cut. There are parts where it definetely shows its potential.+The Progression (Suit armour, Waynetech Upgrades and Combat Unlockables) is done carefully like the other games, but it seems more noticeable than the other games. The Natural Progression that youl find is the best kind there is.+The Detective mode is very unique and definetely reminds everyone that this was designed for a handheld gaming device.(Swipe finger to use and all that.), but it does shine a new light on detective skills and finding well hidden clues.+Because it is 2.5D, the Combat is simplified quite a bit, hihgh combos will be much easier to achieve. This is one of the many parts that gets Simplified. (Other examples include: Stealth sequences, hiding areas, Gadget use and the Detective scanner.) -However, Many people who liked the origal combat system will dislike this.+The Plot is good and the map is heavily influenced by the ongoing story. There are 3 main sections to play in. (These include The Cells blocks, Administration and Industrial.)The best part about these seperate locations is that each one has been captured by 3 of Batman's Biggest villains...Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. This works very well with the story and the feeling of liberating each one is great! Although it isn't as large and ""free"" as the other games.+First Appearance of Catwoman in the Arkham Storyline. Amd many new characters are introduced +The Cutscene illustration is amazing! Its like watching a cartoon or a slideshow in the Batman universe. Its very unique when compared to the other games and its Art-style is a welcome addition to the series. They do seem a bit lazy in parts and switch pictures rather than a fluid scene. This wasnt a big issue for me however.+The Boss battles are mostly great and provide a respectful difficulty spike in various environements. Guards everywhere with flamethrowers equip Vs gargoyle-hopping stealth sections are a great mix!+Many Unlockable suits and upgrades provided some reasons for replayability, you wont get everything all your first playthrough either. Lots of cool suits however so i felt that it was worth it at least.+The Length of 6-8 hours seems normal and proportional for a title of its style and content.+Serves as an expansion into the world of the Arkham Games, not much else. But it is very interesting because it does take place in Blackgate Penitentiary  (The Main Prison before Arkham Asylum.) which is an entirely new location. So at least there is competely new areas to explore.


You want some too?

CONS:-Recylces lots of content from previous games-Story is interesting at many parts, but the execution of the concepts appear Too Linear and Dull far more than enough. The Cutscenes do a good job with introductions to characters, important fight scenes and Montages...but thats about it! No long term events, no cliff hangers, hardly anything to lead into the future. The Major build ups to Boss battles or other important sections feel too slow and often include LOTS of backtracking, Especially at the start and even middle of the game. Backtracking is ok, but generally its better if the reason is very justified and well explained. Why get something on the other side of the map, when you can call the Batwing?-Stealth is suuuper limited for this kind of game, which is a big shame. Because Batman is meant to be an All-Rounder Hero with many different approaches to dangerous situations!-Because this game was intended for the PS Vita, it has various technical features that are either dumbed down or removed entirely to make it ""fit"" properly.-Something minor really but, Collectible placement is the dumbest thing ever! Why is there Waynetech Crates with Armour upgrades within the cells of Blackgate? Is Bruce trying to recover them all from the Incredibly sly criminals who took them? I'll never know...-So many Boring environments that feel dull and repeated. At least each of the 3 locations has something new to show. Otherwise they wouldnt have a very effective name at all.-Controls are clunky at the best of times and due to the changing camera angles (When you turn corners, or falll down a hole.) you have to expect quick movement control swaps or little things like that.-Graphics are the worst of the series, but this just relates back to the fact that it wasnt intended for PC or console.-Voice Acting is Mainly Sub-Standard, but some characters are done well because they have amazing Voice Actors! (Penguin, Joker and Catwoman sound the best.) This is important for the plot, but doesnt make a huuuge difference. Except when an important Person is talking and you need to work with them/save them! (Giving these kinds of NPC's a few lines for a big chunk of gameplay is strange!)


Batman is just a Footnote... -_-

Final Thoughts:Well, its no masterpiece, far from it in fact. But people should definetely view this game for the way it was intended and presented. Not a solid Block of story to continue on from Origins. Instead I like to see it as a ""test"" for the PS Vita to see if The Arkham Series can be introduced to it. And my answer to that ""Test"" is a big YES! Although the PC Port is another story!Brief:If you like Side scrollers and Action Games, this is for you.If you have been playing much of the arkham series casually and are unsure to get this one, you can take a miss for sure.If you like Batman and want to see the unique art-style that this game has to offer, this is definetely for you.If you are tired of reading this review, dont worry its almost the endOverall I rate this game an Average score of 6.5/10Not the best adaptation for Batman, and definetely not one that he needed either. But it exists and it has many good points in the story. Not sure about the continuation though.Leave a comment below with anything i missed, or any questions. Now if you'll excuse me, im going to play the game all over again to get the other 2 endings...Like that'll ever happen >;)-Kyle "

												I don't need to finish this game to know what to say about it. This is a useless spin-off. It would have been much more interesting as a DLC for Arkham Origins.The gameplay is mediocre and the combat is ho-hum. The graphics are okay (for a vita port) and the voice acting is nice.While I'm playing this game, I can't help but wonder WHY they didn't just make it a downloadable story for AO. Even if it is a Vita port, the controls are awful. The 2.5D gameplay just barely works. The Vita is more than capable of handling a linear, 3D arkham game. This 2.5D gimmick makes the level design feel clumsy and umcomfortablePROS:- mildly interesting story so far- Catwoman is still a bombshell- BATMAN- It definitely FEELS like an Arkham game- Came with my copy of Arkham Knight (along with Asylum GOTY and City GOTY. I already owned AO, so I'm not sure if it came with that as well).- Cutscenes are cool motion comicsCONS:- Bad gameplay- Mediocre graphics- level design isn't great- It's a god damn vita port instead of an addition to Arkham OriginsThe only reason I'm playing it now is because it came with my copy of Arkham Knight. Even then, I'm only playing this while Arkham Knight downloads. That's all this game is good for, to kill time while Arkham Knight downloads. I'm never playing this again once the credits roll. Hell, if Arkham Knight finishes before I finish, I won't even finish Blackgate. I'll just look up the cutscenes on youtube or something.4/10			"

												Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate is an interesting Batman game. It does things a bit different than the newer Batman games. If I had to make a comparison Arkham Asylum would be closest as far as the gameplay is concerned, because this one also plays like a Metroidvania game, except that you play it on a 2.5D pane this time. So the camera will shift to other angles depending on your location. And because of this the controls aren't as tight as they could be. Remember the older Resident Evil games with their stiff movements ? Sometimes you have to move a certain way but have no clue how to move your analog stick; the game doesn't recognize the obvious, natural move you'd normally make and therefore you unintentionally go back and forth sometimes. Infuriating and frustrating. Another thing that also bothered me, in this day and age, was the lack of lip syncing. I can't think of many other games that don't have this feature nowadays. I know it's supposed to be some sort of budget Batman game, but come on, they could've easily used the models from the other games and downgraded them. Sloppy.The game itself is, praise the Lord, pretty good. It works like any other Metroidvania game. I've told you a dozen times about what a Metroidvania game is all about so I hope you remembered it or else look it up somewhere. The 'detective mode' is a feature that was pretty cool, because you have to scan the environments for clues. Find enough of these clues and you'll solve the case. These clues aren't shown on your map so you have to basically scan everything you see. It would've been nice if you could scan on the move instead of having to stand still but that's just me nitpicking I guess.The boss fights are also nice; some of them are easy, other ones are a bit more difficult.Because the game uses several maps instead of one big map like many other Metroidvania games navigation is sometimes hard. Near the end of the game you have to move between all 4 maps regularly and one mission in particular makes you backtrack through several of these environments. The downside is that you can't easily teleport. It wouldn't fit the game, I agree, but surely they could've come up with something. You can only leave a map at the beginning and at the end, and there's no way in between. The map is hard to read so you'll probably get lost every now and then. The fact that you can move into several directions doesn't help either. Unnecessary if you ask me.The game is lengthy, and will take you about 7-12 hours, depending on what you what to collect. That's just right for a game like this. The graphics haven't been upgraded because the characters still have blurry textures. But it still looks nice in motion. Just don't expect the graphics from the previous Batman games.Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate is a fun game, but unfortunately not without its flaws. And despite these flaws it definitely deserves a chance.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												3-10 3d world with 2d controlsi beat AA, AC, and AO before this and though it has the same feel removing 1 dimension broke the controls. this is very evident during fights. where the other games will free flow into move after move from enemy to enemy with little effort here batman has trouble jumping left to right (and vice versa) or who he hits if there is a clusters of a few guys to attack also trying to counter more than 4 enemies is impossable at times. another issue is since the world looks 3d yet played like a side scroller so its not allways clear where you go or what to do. maybe if you didn't play the other games the controls would still feel off but if you played any of the 3d batman games they will feel outright broken or like your missing a few. they also only give you 4 gadgets and now detective mode stops gameplay. you'ed think this would play like the 2d parts from the other games and it kind of does but they removed the up and down inputs yet enemies will still get into odd placements.overall the game looks good but the controls are definitely something you'll need to get past to complete the game and will be a constant issue to work around. personaly i'ed just watch a youtube video if i wanted to know the story and just pass on this bad tablet port.

Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate Pros & Cons ReviewPros1: Blackgate continues the adventure from Origins; the story taking place mostly in Blackgate Prison as opposed to a large section of Gotham City.2: Comicbook-esque cinematics and 2.5D Metroidvania style gameplay offering an entirely different way to play as the Caped Crusader.3: Collectable Batsuits offers fans a reason to push their skills further and replay the game on harder difficulties to collect them all.Cons1: Combat and Stealth borderlines on overly frustrating; precision moves are next to impossible at times due to the nature of the gameplay.2: Fixed Camera while good for Metroidvania style games doesn’t translate well to Batman’s stealth gameplay; the inability to look around in vents compounds this fact.3: Boss fights are made frustrating by the clunky controls, leading to many retries and in general it can make navigation difficult. Overall: 7/10My thoughts on Batman Arkham Origins - Blackgate,I’ve never been one for platformer style games but I did enjoy this tile; I’m a sucker for collecting things in games and oh boy does this have a bunch of collectables. Among those collectables are cool new Batsuits but unlike others in the Arkham series where it’s just for show some of these suits actually give you a boost to help you out during the course of the campaign. I recommend hunting down “The Darkest Knight” suit as it basically gives you invulnerability. I also loved the comicbook-esque cinematics… It might not be for everyone but for me it reminded me of watching the original animated series way back in the day.Unfortunately, as much as I enjoyed playing the game and taking in it’s cool narrative from a unique perspective it was annoyingly frustrating at times due to its finicky controls. Example, when fighting one or more enemies close together and you use cap stun it won’t affect both as in previous titles. Instead you have a 50/50, or even lower chance with more than two, of stunning the intended enemies; which is very problematic when fighting armored knife wielders. Speaking of armaments, the gadgets aren’t exactly all that interesting or innovative… unless you count the slight improvement to the Explosive Gel which can now actually be shot over short distances. The gadgets are not the only thing on the boring side but the level design is also nothing to write home about. They are repetitive and downright boring.Ultimately, Batman: Arkham Origins – Blackgate is a fun game to play through once or twice but I’d only recommend it for the hardcore fans or those who absolutely love platformers. At the very least I would suggest only picking this title up during one of the many Steam sales for $5.00 because it’s just not worth $19.99, especially when you can grab one of the core Arkham titles for that price instead.-SPARTAN 117 B01			"

												This game is terrible, but that's not very surprising considering it's a cash grab complementing another cash grab. Originally a handheld title for the 3DS and Vita, the game was later ported to home consoles and the PC probably because they realized nobody cared about this game. I don't really think this move changed that fact, but let's move on.The plot is pretty inconsequential just like Arkham Origins. It's not like there can be any tension to the story as you know what's going to happen because of earlier games. The inmates managed to take over Blackgate prison and some hostages to turn the place into a madhouse. Three factions divided the area, that's Joker, Penguin and Black Mask and even though they're supposedly rival gangs you won't see them interact at all. Unfortunately for Batman you need something from each part of the prison to get those hostages to safety. You also might encounter other random B-list villains who are there for their boss fight and nothing else. The plot gives the no reason to be there. Oh sure it makes for criminals to be at a prison but random gigantic zombies with no build-up is where I draw the line. Then there's also Catwoman who Batman caught two weeks before the incident and now mysteriously helps you with no ulterior motive at all. Oh and finally there's some hinting at a Suicide Squad thing just like in Origins, but as of this review it's now the year 2016 and we have no word on anything about that.This game is tedious as all hell. It's structured like a Metroidvania, but it's done so poorly you start wondering if any of the staff even played Super Metroid or Symphone of the Night. Traversing through this horribly-designed areas makes me long for death. What's wrong with it? Let's start with Detective mode. It works like the other games, you activate it with a single button button push, but this time you have to manually scan certain objects with your mouse to check whether you can interact with it or not. You can know the game inside and out, but you will always need to scan it before you can do something that allows you to progress, but this seems to happen selectively depending on the object. This basically means you'll stop dead in your tracks everytime to scan that darn wall just one more time to make sure you can't blow it up. I hope you don't mind this, because you probably will have to leave an area and going to a part you haven't explored yet, because you'll find you don't have the item you need. To be fair, the game most of the time tells you where to go and just not how to get there unless it glitches out and it doesn't appear on the map which has actually happened to me. It's still frustrating to have your progress come to a complete halt, because you don't have a certain utility weapon or missed scanning something. This brings us to exploring. You're always stuck on a 2D plane, however you'll find you can go to different directions with vents or using your grappling hook to get to the background or suddenly the room decides there will be a sharp turn you can take. This doesn't sound too bad, but it makes the map look like an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. You'll check it every five seconds to make sure you're not heading the wrong way, but it won't help you get into certain rooms, because of some doors are unmarked and rooms with multiple floors are confusing as hell. God forbid you backtrack and forgot how to progress in the room, because of the lack of visual indicators or a helpful map. It doesn't help that the game's levels have no real visual identity and that Batman walks very slowly. To top it all off, there are so many times when a room just locks you out. What I mean by this is that sometimes the game will arbitrarily decide to not let you backtrack the way you came. For example if you use your grappling hook to reach a certain ledge, there's a chance the game won't let you go back by gliding. This means taking a huge detour everytime to go back where you started. Hope you didn't miss anything.Let's talk about the controls. This game feels horrible. Combat just feels sluggish.. I refuse to believe you can pull off crazy combos like in the other Arkham games. Batmans range for punches and kicks isn't consistent, sometimes hits won't connect and counters flat-out don't work half the time. Not that the game is impossibly hard or anything, because the game is very generous with health and doesn't throw tons of enemies at you all at once. Stealth isn't much better. There are usually only three for each section and your options are severely limited. It works, but it's watered down. Bosses are the worst aspect of the game. They're deceptively simple, but have little indicators to teach you how they're supposed to work. Penguin is the worst example as he summons goons that can only be taken out in a specific way. If you don't know to beat them, they're practically invincible and will kill you very quickly.Besides that there really isn't that much to talk about. The music is generic and I don't want to say anything about the graphics because it's a port of a handheld game anyway. Mooks look less like zombies in this version at least, but I still don't get the cutscenes. Why does nobody look like their in-game model? WHO DREW THESE?So in conclusion this game is bad. Don't waste your money. You're better off with Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Heck even Arkham Knight and Origins are options.			"

												This game is an insult to Arkham games. It's terrible in almost every way. Combat is weird, map is WAY TOO ♥♥♥♥ING confusing, puzzles are terrible, and NG+ is a joke. You'll get to keep your collectibles in NG+ but not your upgrades. I mean, what's the point of NG+ then? Story is good, I liked it. Same can be said for artwork and voice acting but they can't save this game. Another thing I hated in this game that you have to analyze weak walls and some other stuff every time. That's making this game even slower than the usual. I can recommend this to those who has played previous games just for playing once. Don't go for the achievements like I did because 3 of them requiring to finish the game at least 3 times and that feels like a torture.			"

												Ever wanted to play one of the Batman Arkham (City, Asylum or Origins) games but really wished it was more like a side scrolling platformer? Well Arkham Origins Blackgate is the game for you.It takes the EXACT same gameplay from the first three Batman Arkham games and changes the perspective, so it kinda, but not really, seems like a different game, yet is eerily similar to the others.I mean, it's not as good as the original games, but it is an interesting spin on them, and most importantly, the game is a lot of fun to play. There are a couple of annoyances here and there (how to proceed in boss battles are not well explained - plus when you fight, occasionally you end up facing the wrong way and punching into air, and the backtracking.... oh good lord the constant backtracking!) but overall, it's a good way for any Bat-Fan to spend 10 hours.

												This game might have worked well on iOS, however there is no reason why this game exists on gaming platforms. Instead of taking the gameplay staples of the Arkham and adapt it to the 2.5D, it tries to completely reinstate the exact gameplay from the main games without changing where necessary. The result is you have a game which feels very awkward to play in 2.5D and creates all kinds of issues. For example the chase sequences and world readability is very poor, causing a lot of frustration. The new perspective could have been put to a great use if the gameplay and controls were designed around it, however, that is not the case here. "

												I really don't understand all the hate for this game. It's not without its flaws, but this feels and plays very much like any of the Arkham games if you were to remove the open world aspect. Even the controls are the same as its AAA brothers. It's not going to win any awards for its graphics and the map is severly lacking. Those two issues aside, I find Blackgate to be a lot of fun.			"

Well I couldnt resist! Waiting on the new Batman title i needed a new fix and this game looked the part to quell my hunger, decently priced and ITS BATMAN! The game itself isnt as great as the regular titles Asylum/City/Origins but thats to be expected from a different type of Batman game, the story is good and entertaining, the graphics do look good but up close there are some bad textures on the characters, you rarely see these though and it doesnt take away from the game. Voice acting like all the games is wonderful. The only drawback to this game is the combat, it doesnt feel as strong as the 'father' games of the series, a bit clunky and unresponsive to commands, i mentioned it in the above video this being the only weak point of my first 20 minutes and it did continue on sadly. The combat doesnt feel as fluid in general it does lose some points here but the game experience is still great overall, if you can overlook slightly weaker combat compared to the parent titles then this is the game for you, the story alone is worth the small price.

												I was gifted a copy of this game by Warner Brothers following the technical issues that plagued Arkham Knight's release.  I probably wouldn't have played it otherwise despite loving the Arkham series and even being a fan of the often maligned Arkham Origins.  This game was originally designed for handheld consoles like the 3DS and Vita and it shows - what works on those consoles doesn't necessarily work on the PC, where the combat (a mainstay of the series) feels shallow and lacks impact and the graphics - while nice - don't live up to prior games in the series.The story is reasonable but sadly it lacks in the most important department - the thug banter.  The personality and charm that this gave to other games in the series is completely lacking here, thugs barely talk and when they do they don't have much to say.  To make matters worse, there is no postgame content - if you don't complete everything before the final Boss you have to start all over again.  To make matters even worser, the game cuts off access to particular rewards.  This means you need at least a total of three complete playthroughs if you're a completionist, and the game honestly isn't good enough to warrant another go around.It's not bad, but it's got nothing really going for it beyond the license and the goodwill of the other games in the series.  It was fine enough to play, but not anything I'd recommend going out of your way to get to.  You'll probably end up more frustrated than anything else, thinking about what could have been.			"

												Comic book style animation/cut scenes, The story played out like a comic, It has its flaws but overall was a solid game. It doesn't live up to the Arkham name, but for true fans its a solid entry and a look into. Sadly you have to complete it three times to get the final 4 achievements, But the story doesn't take as long as the collectibles did. With that being said the collectibles were tedious and you have to use your analyzer/detective vision every square inch so you don't miss a hint. Also you have to analyze most areas that are destructible to use the proper gadget on in order to move on. You can't just use it right of the bat, which was a little aggravating. 7/10.			"

												Ok, this game has it's origins in handheld gaming (the underrated PS VIta), but it still has it's own charm.The developer has updated the visuals to match PC specs and resolutions, and the overall result is quite all right, in my opinion.It has decent storyline that ties with Arkham Origins, and the action is okay.The maps can be quite confusing and you don't really get much help as you play the game (I found myself going through walkthroughs online to get ahead on occasion).Even though it may not be the best platformer out there, this is probably the only Batman platformer you'll find in a long time.While I wouldn't advice anyone to pay full price for this, if you do get it as part of bundle, then have a go at it.

												After reading a lot of the negative reviews on here, I will just say that I'm glad I decided to buy this game anyway. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. I think a lot of the negative views of this game center around a couple things:1. This is not a platformer nor a brawler. If you go into this game thinking it will be like its fully 3D Arkham bretheren, you will be greatly disappointed. However, if you go into this game knowing and expecting it to be more like a classic Metroid game, then you will be okay. Blackgate was clearly meant to be more about Batman as a detective and a puzzle solver than about Batman the asskicker.2. The controls could be better. But again, I think this is more about expectations. If you think it's going to be a precise brawler like its bigger brothers, you'll hate it. It's meant to be a slower-paced, puzzle-solving and exploration game truly in the same vein as something like Metroid (minus the shooting). I was put off at first, but once I got used to the pacing I started to enjoy the game a lot (Metroid/Zelda-style games are my personal favorite).There are other minor quibbles, such as it having a confusing map, and less-than-stellar combat, but overall it is a good game. If you like Batman and/or Metroid, you'll likely enjoy this game. Don't buy it if you want a platformer or brawler.			"

												God, what an infuriating game. The in-game map is a terrible thing, the combat is a rather insipid imitation of the 3D Batman games, and the boss fights are incredibly frustrating. That said, the map itself is quite a thing (although the violations of the 180-degree rule are annoying). Would have been made *much* more tolerable by an ""extract me back to the area selection screen"" button; walking all the way back to an area exit is super-dull. Just about recommended, I suppose.

												A mostly good game with some serious issues.For the most part, this is a fun take on the Arkham games. You feel like Batman, and the combat has a similar free-flowing mechanic from the ""big"" games (although it IS different). The gadgets also all work as they should.However, this game suffers from not knowing if it wants to be 2D, or 3D. Let me explain. The game is a 2D sidescroller: you move on a certain path, and always go left to right. But here they got creative, and added multiple routes that can make you change direction, for example by entering a vent. And this leads to very confused navigation.The in-game map is nearly useless. Because Batman changes direction automatically while moving, you need to constantly check on the map where you are now headed, and since it is drawn on an angle to begin with, with overlapping segments, you WILL get lost.I also got stuck multiple times. There are moments where the plot forces you go go to a certain area which ends in a blocked door, because you do not have the proper gadget yet, and it expects you to find the one spot in several screens that can be bombed to create an opening.Remember how in e.g. Zelda any wall that can be bombed is marked with cracks? Not in this game. You must enter inspection mode, and literally sweep the entire screen of multiple rooms in the hope of finding the one spot which is ""structurally weak"", so you can progress.The story is weak. You have three opponents, one opponent-slash-ally, and then they suddenly throw in Solomon Grundy... for a single fight, with no build-up whatsoever. The only reason Grundy seems to be thrown in is to emulate the Killer Croc fight from the first Arkham game.I like the graphics, at their best they look very much like the big games. But the cutscenes are done in a highly distorted comic style, which really don't fit the look of the rest of the game. They would have been a lot better if they had been done in-engine, there are a number of ""cinematic"" scenes that are done this way and those look pretty amazing.And while the voice acting is top notch, there is no lip sync whatsover: characters either ""talk"" in the cutscenes, which are little more than moving comic panels, or in-game, where their mouths never move.Pick this up if you like Arkham Origins and want more, but skip it if you're not a huge fan of the game series. If this were a numeric review, I'd give it a 6//10.			"

I read about the bad controls, the clunky camera. How slow this game is and feels.But I had fallen in love with the Arkham series. And I heard it was Canon so when one day it was on sale for a few bucks I thought ""♥♥♥♥ it"". I like the series so much I wanted to expeirence everything.What a Mistake I made. he Story told here is not worth♥♥♥♥♥♥ And while it may still be canon it is just so ♥♥♥♥ing non-saying and insignificant.I could repeat all the gameplay and control issues that many others have pointed out once again. But I really don't see the point.And to convince you a little more. I am not a picky player by any means. I can pull myself through alot for the sake of a game or a story. I can overlook many flaws.And it happened during this game too. At the start I immediatly noticed what everyone meant here by the game's issues and it really did feel bad. But I pulled myself through and got used to it. And while it was never really fun. It was playable in the middle.But then the endgame oh the ♥♥♥♥ing end game. Especially the Penguin Boss fight and if he is the last you defeat that's what coming after it. Frustrating, unecessary and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I can just repeat what many others said before me.Even if on Sale, heck even if free.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!

												Overall it is a good game. There are nice comic book style cut scenes, mostly decent boss battles and some replayability. They tried to incorporate the Arkham freeflow combat system which, given the 2.5D perspective, works well for the most part. That said, it is vastly inferior to that of the Arkham games. Since the game does have a lot of backtracking, the biggest source of frustration is the map. Navigating around the areas is the most challenging part of the game. The game is still quite enjoyable though and so I would recommend it.			"

I found myself wandering around too often with no clue how to get out of the current area. The map is a joke to comprehend even with it's over the top legend.Bottom line:  If you really, really and I mean really like Batman, give it a shot otherwise you may want to skip it.BTW, I'm still playing this game but very frustrated at the moment since I can't seem to find my way out of the current area.

												First off let me say that this game is not what I thought it would be. Which shame on me for not paying more attention to the detials before I purchased the game. I was expecting the open world Batman game type of gameplay and this one gave me a side scrolling Batman adventure. Which by all means is still great. It gave me the nostalgia of an old school batman game I used to play way back when on the SNES. I didn't play to far into the game at the point of writing this review but I will already say that im not disapointed with my purchase other than the fact that it was not what I thought I would be getting. The controls are just like the batman games on console and I can see where the game can be enjoyable. All in all I would pick this game up again on sale but probably not for the full retail price.

												This is a Batman metroidvania, and if you like both of those, it can be an enjoyable game.If you only like Batman, you're probably checking this game out as a fan of the Arkham series. Just know that this game is Arkham in name only. Blackgate is a 2.5D exploration platformer, not a 3D third person game like the rest of the series. If you aren't a fan of metroidvanias, this game is definately not going to win you over. The story is very dull, and overly simplistic. Basically there is an explosion at Blackgate and now the criminals are running the place. That's pretty much it as far as the story goes, sadly. As metroidvanias go, the game mechanics are very weak, due to linear level design, and uninspired combat. If you aren't a Batman fan, you'll probably get bored quickly with the repetitive levels and linear flow. I really can't recommend this game on it's mechanics alone.If you happen to like Batman, and you like metroidvanias, Blackgate just might have enough to merit a purchase. The entire game environment is rendered in 3D, despite movement being locked to 2.5D. It's doesn't look as good as the main Arkham games, but it doesn't look like a Vita port either, probably somewhere in between. The environments are actually rendered with a very high attention to detail, especially for a 2.5D game. Some people have had issues with the controls. I played through using a gamepad and had zero issues. Probably the best thing about this game is the animatics created by Calum Alexander Watt and Armature Studio.  You can see several examples here[conceptartworld.com]. As I said before, the mechanics aren't the greatest, but if you like metroidvanias, there might be enough nooks and cranies to explore, collectibles, and upgrades to unlock, to keep you going between animatics.Marking this as ""recommened"" for the niche audience that the game was made for. Everyone else should look elsewhere.Don't pay more than: $10			"

												It took a while to get used to but it was an okay game. The map system is confusing. The combat can be frustrating at times because it just feels so much more natural in the previous games. There is a LOT of backtracking. Actually, I found 50% or more of the time spent playing to be looking for what I needed to go further in the game itself and running around. I didnt expect a masterpiece when I started playing. I definitely didnt get a masterpiece either. The 2.5D gameplay would be more suited for a game relying less on combat. Key point here: Just remember that this was originally a portable console game and don't expect it to be on par with the previous, full 3D action Arkham games.			"

												It's a good Batman game with many flaws.The 2.5D is nice, sometimes even too marked and confusing, as you could feel like you are playing a 3D Batman and get stuck.The architecture is very intricated, and even with the map (drawn by Escher) you'll easily lost yourself.The combat system is quite laggy and stiff, and sometimes you can't understand if you can hit the enemies or not.The bosses are hard in a stupid way, since the combats brake the game's mechanics. The last boss is very annoying, because you need to have a 0,1 reaction time.			"

												I was a little cautious going into this after reading some of the negative comments surrounding this game over the internet, but I ended up loving Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate. The games weakest aspect is the combat, although this sounds huge thankfully the game isn't very combat heavy. Disappearing bodies and low quality textures while up close where a couple other negatives. I could look past all those faults because the game does Metroidvania really well, exploring Blackgate prison was a blast. I was engaged the whole time while playing and I never got bored. 4 out 5.

												As a Batman fan I have to say that I really enjoyed this game! :)Yes, it's a handheld port and all, but even then it's a pretty decent game.I read mixed reviews which said that the game sucks because of poor graphics and bad gameplay. I wont comment on graphics, because I don't play games for graphics, and nobody should. About gameplay, well here were a bit of problems with controls and there were some stupid game mechanics that became very annoying after a while! About the controlls first:The controlls are  pretty responsive, but there were some times when you had to do/press a button multiple times for it to work, which can get very annoying after a time, especially if you have to hury because a timer.For example: When you do the bomb hunting/hostage rescuing at the end of the game and you have to enter a went by holding the A button on a 360 pad, and it wont register after a few times, not until you go away from the went hole and go back for it to show the (Hold A to Enter). This is very annoying!Other problems I didn't encounter with the controlls, other than this, the controlls are great and very easy to learn.Mechanics:The only annoying mechanics in the game for me was the Scanner!In the beginning I thought of it as a  neat feature, but after a while it got so annoying that you had to do it almost every time for you to go on ahead! Even for things that were staright forward and didn't need any further explanation!Other than this little annoying thing, haven't really got any more issues with the game.The game itself is on the shorter side because you can beat it in 3 or 4 hours most IF you don't do any side content and exploring! Your very first playthrough may be a bit longer if you like to stop from the main story and do a bit of exploring.Keep in mind that by exploring I don't mean to explore the entire map or anything like in the past games, because this isn't a full 3D game, it's just a 2.5D platformer, but believe me that you can get lost very easily.I myself, when I did my first playthrough of this, it took me roughly 15hours, because I did collect everything and did all the side content, but my other playthrougs were only about 3 or 4 hours as I said earlier because I just rushed from start to finish to get all the endings.And yes, it's true that you'll have to do a bit of backtracking when you hunt for the collectibles, but it's not that bad!From my experience and for being a huge Batman fan, with all the little flaws that this game has, I'll give it a 7.5/10.It's not a great game, but it's not bad either! If you like the Batman series or Batman in general, I think that you'll love this too!			"

												If you loved the regular Batman Arkham games...that will have little to do with whether you love this game. They are quite different. Blackgate is more about running around in a maze-like platformer, acquiring gadgets to pass obsticles, collecting collectables, and doing it all again over and over until you have completely exhausted the game. Doesn't sound like the game for you? Stay away. Still interested, and read on...Blackgate is definitely a game with a lot of problems, but if you can get past them, you'll still enjoy the game:*Incredibly easy to get lost and the map is of very little help until you have played through enough to just about have the area memorized anyway. Prepare to spend vast swaths of time trying to figure out how to get back into ""that one place you feel like you just came from.""*Really annoying method of discovering secrets, by stopping, and physically scanning every nook and cranny of the room. Really breaks up the pacing of the game, and you don't feel like you were outsmarted when you miss a secret. You just feel like you were too impatient to spend the extra time scanning that remote area.*Voice acting is pretty sub-par. The same voice actors are back (except Black Mask for some reason) from Arkham Origins, but it's clear that something was different about the directing in this one. It just doesn't sound real. Everything is forced.*High Definition ""Delux Edition"" makes it obvious that most character mouths and faces aren't actually animated.*Story is not all that interesting, and only the final cutscenes of the game really add anything of value to the Arkhamverse.*Combat feels less refined than the regular Arkham games. Very easy to miss an attack that past experience tells you ought to hit.Pros:*The animated cutscenes are kind of cool, even if they couldn't afford to do a full-on cartoon animation.*Collecting Batsuits is fun. Who doesn't like to play dress-up?*Picking up a new gadget is extra-rewarding because it means you're able to get into new areas.*Achievements incentivise repeat playthroughs.*Graphically it's not that bad considering it was originally a handheld game.*It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman.

												Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate is a lot like playing a 2D Metroid game, but with Batman, which is awesome. It makes sense that it should have a bit of a Metroid flavor since many of the people who worked on this game also worked on the Metroid Prime games. You explore Blackgate Prison trying to take down Penguin, Black Mask, and The Joker while collecting gadgets, armor upgrades, and much more. The combat is a simplified version of the system from the other Arkham games. In this game you just punch,counter, and do takedowns and it feels surprisingly good. The combination of good combat, great exploration, and excellent setting have made for a fantastic game which I've had trouble putting down. The bottom-line is if you like Batman, Metroid, or both then buy it.			"

												So, this game is definitely different than the other Arkham games. That is in part due to it originally being a handheld game. Since the game is in 2.5D, you basically move from left to right across most screens, and fight in that method. This... causes issues if you are trying to replicate how you fought in the main Arkham games. Still, after you get used to it, it can be fun.The plot is decent enough. Not up to the standards of the prior Arkham games, but it is hard to replicate that success constantly. Anyway, for a change of pace, it is not that bad.			"

												The story in a nutshell: there was an explosion at the Blackgate prison, the prisoners rebelled and there are hostages. The prison is divided into three territories controlled by three bosses: Joker, Penguin and Black Mask. Batman arrives to restore order.ProsThe story is quite interesting, pursuing the story of Batman Arkham: OriginsBossesSome gameplay elements of Arkham games: Detective mode, main gadgets, silent takedowns...ConsFights are boring: poor IA, collisions, and poor controls - especially the counters, which are undoubtedly the main element in the Arkham games fights, making the final boss fight a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>Detective mode is very limited: we must scan manually the area with the Alt key and the mouse to detect any objects we can interact with. In other words we have to stop every 2 meters to scan the screen in order to go further in the area or solve the side quests. We spend our time doing backtracking: we start a first zone, arrived in the middle of the zone we need a gadget that is in the second zone, but arrived in this second zone we require an access code that we can get only in the third zone, then back to the second zone retrieve the necessary gadget to pass the first one and get the gadget needed in the third zone to retrieve the access code for the second one... The whole game is like this: backtracking everytime, for everything.The map is extremely complicated to understand, very confused - which makes backtracking even more annoying2.5D. We can only move left or right, so entering a room or a vent pipe located on the back wall is sometimes very complicated. Similarly, we will discover some hidden pipes or doors just stepping back from time to time because the camera does not show us everything at once. "

												Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is a good extension of the Arkham franchise to handhelds, but it lacks the specialness or inspiration that would make it stand out as a great Metroidvania-style game - or a great Batman game, for that matter. Without any real surprises, engaging settings, or interesting story, Blackgate feels more like a retread of bullet points than the handheld Batman we truly deserve.			"

												I have to say, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is pretty sweet. Not as much story as I'd like, but it feels very much like the old style of videogames... you're given the tools to overcome obstacles, then you have to figure out how to use them. Now that I've beat it, I don't think I'm going to go back and try for 100% completion... moving from place to place, unfortunately, feels tedious in this game. But the boss fights were really well thought-out and challenging; I had to really try over and over to figure out what I needed to do and/or practice a particular movement enough to execute it at the right time. Like I said, just like older games. Very satisfied; well worth the $8.			"

												Okay, this is coming from someone who absolutly loves the Arkham games and has never played Castlvanya or Metroid. So keep that in mind. First: The port is not that great. You can only change AA whether it's or not and depth of field. That's it. However it runs pretty okay, especially on my piece of junk laptop thats 6 years old, with only minor slow down here and there. Second: This is a 2.5D game, you will always be running left and right with some spots to either grapple into the background or forground. But it's still 2D. Is this bad? No. Is this complicated? I got lost walking once in my small home town, I'm bad when it comes to maps and I haven't got lost once in this game yet and I have no issues with it. So no, it's not hard. Combat: Combat is mostly the same as the main series games, it's just limited to left and right, instead of full 3D. Is this bad? No, it looks weird at first but it's still fine and still feels good to pound the badguys. You can't do all the fancy stuff of the main series but it's still fun.The voice acting is pretty decent as is the story. As many reviews have pointed out, the cutscenes are comic book style and that's pretty awesome! It looks good to like it was actually from a comic book.TL;DR: The port is bad, get over it. It's all 2D so you only have to worry about left and right, the map is not that complicated and it's still fun. Why are people complaining? Because it's different than the main series of games, yes, get over it. It's a lot of fun.			"

I'm a guy that needs a comfortable control scheme, and the vita dosen't really open itself up to that very well for 3rd party games. However I liked the story and the concept of the game. The metroidvania style puzzle platformer, but with Batman.

												Gameplay: ok. Most of it is good, but the problem is that you don't do the takedowns (when on yellow during combat, the B+Y, or square + triangle takedown; it depends on what controller or keyboard you use, but I usually play this game with an Xbox 360 controller; and the ground takedown; RT+Y for Xbox controllers and R2+ triangle for PlayStation controllers; i.e., PS2, PS3 and PS4) that were a good part of the Arkham Series. Such a shame that for this game, the combat had to be ruined. :( Other than that, the gamplay is fine.Story: Great! Liked how the cutscenes were comic styled a little. I got to admit, but usually, for an Arkham game, there are side missions. For this game, there are no side missions, just like Arkham Aslylum (except that Arkham Asylum had only one side mission: collecting Riddler Trophies, solving riddles, analyzing the stories Quincy Sharp left behind for Batman, and alltogether, defeating the Riddler).New Game + : Sort of annoying when you repeat the game over and over again through New Game +. It just never quits!Altogether, this game is recommended unless if you REALLY like the combat and side missions from the other Arkham games.			"

												Awesome. As great as the recent Batman games have been this edition is just done perfectly for a 2.5D action platformer. And for those thinking that they already have the other Arkham games and they dont want a repeat...well, the only thing this has in common is the name. Thats it. Its always nice to see a platformer done correctly. Recently there have been a few. Mark of the Ninja is one and this is another.I picked this up for $5 and that was a steal. I wouldve been happy had I paid $20. The controls are nice, smooth, and simple. This allows you to focus on combat, story line, and the beautiful atmosphere.The only real downside is there seem to be a few unnecessary cutscenes along the way. I hope this isnt consistent throughout because that will become old pretty quick. But thats really the only downside. Everything else is positive.As a platformer with a truly wonderful (and interactive) 2.5D world I would have to give this a solid 10/10. It can be played by all skill levels of gamers and even if youre not good at this type of game you will pick it up fast.			"

												This game had probably the worst boss battle that I have ever had to play.  Probably the only reason I even beat this game was pure luck; that's because, I believe the battle was an absolute guessing game that required no skill or method to even figure it out.  I even timed things, read how other people tried to beat it (all who shared my frustration), but nothing worked, but luck.  On a lighter side, I did overall enjoy the game, the mild story, and light puzzles.  I wasn’t expecting this game to be 2.5D, but it didn’t take away from the game at all.  And it was satisfying to play for a long while, until you get to that certain point of the game.  The only reason I am recommending this game is, because there was more good experiences with this game rather than bad, even though the bad is pretty big.			"

												The game tries to stay true to its roots. This can be good for fans. Or bad in terms of game mechanics.Side scrolling platform need a simple game mechanic. This game tries to implement all feature from Batman Arkham series (the gadgets) resulting a more complicated side scrolling mechanics. It's not hard, just take a little time getting used to.And when you do, this game shines! It truly is... Stories and characters you've familiar with, sweet graphics, and great combat animations. The effort you put in learning the mechanics paid of.Recommended for any player whether fans of Batman Arkham series or not.			"

												Considering the technical limitations 1) must be mostly 2D interactions, but not always 2) must have been able to run on a handheld and relatively easily upgraded to beefier platforms .... I have been extremely impressed in my first few hours with the game.It's not as good as the other games (of course), but that's impossible with these limitations. However, the combat is fun if somewhat limited, there's lots of batclawing, exploding, detective moding, exploring and whatnot. There's not the open-world flying, but Arkham Asylum didn't really have that either.  The odd thing is that this one has more of an explorative... mazelike... dungeon feel to it, which I thought was pretty cool/fun.  It is closer to Arkham Asylum than the other, open-world game.  Which I don't think is necessarily bad, just different.I do see why people would not recommend it, since the other games are all better (because they didn't have to run on a handheld). However, if you've already played all the other ones (Asylum, City, and Origins), then this one should be next on your list to play IMO because it really is a good game. It's definitely a batman game :)SIDE NOTE JUST IN CASE A DEV READS THIS: The main two things that would need changing (which I think would still let it run on a handheld) would be (A) fully rotatable map on all axis, and (B) minor tweaks to detective scan mode, (C) quicker restarts for boss fights.(A) The map is set currently in an isometric locked view, which has limitations when showing the map from the perspective of the user, height of objects, and depth in complex situations (like a large sprawling map). I really like that the maps are huge and complex, and I don't really have that big of a problem reading the map (but probably because I use Computer Aided Drafting a lot), but I can see it being very difficult for many people to use.(B) Currently, the detective mode only highlights main, mostly obvious items in the environment (switches, thugs, keypads, doors, stuff like that). To find explodables, blood, or some collectables, you have to hold down the detective button and it scans in a circle. There needs to be an upgrade somewhere in the game (and maybe there is) that enlargens the circle and speeds up the scanning speed by at least 2 times the speed. These are really my only two complaints about the game that would be fixable within the technical limitations. I think that's pretty good considering it ran on a handheld.  Don't get me wrong, I do not want you to just change it to how the other games have it.  I actually do not like having to be in detective mode so much, so that's why I like the scanning function, but it needs to be faster and more responsive is all (even if it's 33% into the game).(C) For boss fights, when you have to try them multiple times, you are forced to not only skip the boss intro cinematic, but also watch the first part of the boss intro that is unskippable (which is not long).  On normal fights with previously seen and predictable components, this is fine.  However, all of the boss fights have a ""figure it out"" part to them (which I don't mind), but having to repeat much of the fight which I have already seen/dealt with does get frustrating since each of the bossfights have a ""OH that's what I should do..."" moment.  At that point, the player just wants to dive back in quickly and try it again.I'm only mentioning these things though, because I'm hopeful that there will be a sequel that incorporates these elements, because I would totally buy it for PC :)   I was reluctant because of the bad PC reviews, but I was very glad I didn't skip this one.Also I saw some videos of the handheld version, and you guys did a great job upgrading it to be closer to a PC gamer fidelity.  I know some people complained about the graphics, but I thought they were fine for what you were working with (and I know they are just longing for the other Batman game's graphics).			"

												tl:dr DON'T BUY THIS PILE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ waste your money on good games.I got this game as a losers price after the horrific realease of Batman arkham knight (pc). I have therefore not wasted a single buck on this pile of trash. The fighting system:Oh god where do I start, the boss battles are dull but they do work and the rest of the fighting is not really anything to be expected. The Batman arkham games are so well known for it's great fighting system however this is really not the case here, when theres a few enemies you can live with it being terrible but however when the tazers show up in the picture it just feels like pure luck once you make it. Overhaul: You get to choose which to attack first within the prison of Blackgate: Joker, Penguin or Black mask however this whole choosing system is flawed as ♥♥♥♥ you can't complete it fully unless you go through other parts of the prison first. what the actual ♥♥♥♥? why is there even a choosing system then if it's completly ♥♥♥♥ing useless, that's like playing the walking dead and none of your choices matter, none. I could have just watched the TV series then ffs. The whole 2d thingy could have been cool if they wouldn't have ♥♥♥♥ed it up so badly. I rarely write reviews before I've completed the game but I'm so genuinely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥throughout the whole game that I feelt the need to type my frustrations down. Also the fact that you often have to analyze before you can interact with the enviroment is going to test your patience because it takes like three freaking seconds to analyze, so put yourself in someone who plays this game and you know where to go but everytime you get somewhere you need to stop and wait three seconds like every 30 seconds, who designed this crap?Oh yeah the game was released april the first what a ♥♥♥♥ing genious joke that is, because this whole game is an direct insult to the whole arkham series!

												If you're a fan of the other Arkham games, give this one a pass. The controls are poor, the combat is substandard for the series, and the boss fights are both unsatisfying and suffer from poor checkpointing (if you die fighting the penguine, you have to go through the cut scene again, skipable. If you die fighting Black Mast, you start in the room before the fight, have to jump over a pit and then get into the fight room). The story is shallow and the graphics poor (yes, I know this is a port). If you were hoping for a hold over until the next Rocksteady Game, this isn't it.			"

COME 1 COME ALLI am a lover of the batman series, although I haven't yet perfected a game, I have completed (with this one), now 3 in the Arkham series. -Arkham Origins *-Arkham Asylum **-Arkham Origins Blackgate ***Enjoying what there is in the market Deadpool, Amazing Spiderman 1+2, Injustice, & now with us Arkham Knight,note there is a difference between DC & Marvel Universe, this line has been crossed over in many comics before. Though they are inherently separate.In my review for Injustice, I submitted a plea to dev's to give us a full game of say Hawkgirl or even Aquaman, I am echoing that plea now. When this game was released I was excited to see it available. I am satisfied to welcome more from Gotham. I say that because this game originated from PSVITA, and brought to us.It is a 2.5 dimension game, so other than a few options Batman's path is set in very strict linear routes. Don't forget to use your detective vision :-) OFTEN.The story is canon and where the playable DLC of Arkham Origins, Cold, cold heart ends, this game continues on as a sequel to that.Are the graphics good or what? They are grainy. Not unclear.Yes, if you're wanting more batman, it should suffice.The Steam version of this game is Deluxe, including various batman suits with different gasp!working abilities connected to each one, THOUGH THEY MUST BE UNLOCKED.I recommend,Game On..

												I actually considered giving this game a positive review before the second to last part of the final Catwoman fight. I see her goggles and hear the sound, go IMMEDIATELY for the counter and Batman does NOTHING. Apparently you need to counter at the exact moment the sound bite starts or else it just won't work. Also, analyzing objects and walls requires you to stop and scan the screen from top to bottom. The map is really confusing and the guides can only provide you with a minimal help thanks to this fact.			"

												If you're a Batman fan who doesn't mind clunky controls/spending tens of minutes figuring out where to go next, then look no further!No, honestly I think Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a pretty fun game. It can be a little frustrating at times. But the overall experience is satisfying.Pros:- Fun addition to the other Arkham games. (It's different, but with similar gameplay aspects.)- Comic-like cutscenes.- Puzzle elements. (Sometimes you have to think for a moment.)Cons:- Clunky controls.- Falling off platforms due to clunky controls.- Losing battles due to clunky controls.- Moving around awkwardly due to clunky controls.- Getting lost.That being said, I do recommend this game. Just don't pay full price for it. Get it while it's on sale or something.			"

So it doen't matter which way they're looking or their ""spotlight beam"" is pointing. And on top of that its 2.5D which means movment paths is severly limited.

												This must be the worst Batman game to this date (except maybe Arkham Knight).Bad/not responsive controls.Boring leveldesign (has to be the worst map layout in history).Combat system pretty bad (lackluster bossfights).Collectibles.Just good that I got this game for free. On the other hand, it would be better if I didnt got this game at all. What a waste of time.			"

												I would have preferred a working version of Arkham Knight instead of this ""compensation"". It's better than nothing but still quit after the first level due to the awkward camera and controls, poor combat compared to the other games and to be honest I've never been into these sorts of games. Cannot recommend.			"

												The series did not translate well into 2.5D. Unfortunately, whatever value can be found in this game is greatly overshadowed by everything wrong with it. The story inherently requires backtracking and repetition, which is especially problematic because the combat has been reduced to button-mashing and the locked camera and poorly-layered maps make navigating the labyrinthian levels impossible. The game's biggest shortcomings, however, are the boss fights, which are exceedingly frustrating and simply not fun.			"

While they have their faults, I've enjoyed playing them all immensely and think they are a fantastic series of games.This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played for 5 minutes and refuse to play any more as it sullys the series. Don't think it's fair to judge a game after just 5 minutes of play? You're wrong. You can. If you want to play a game that's a cheap copy of a cheap game on a handheld console....then you're mad, but this is your game. Though why you wouldn't buy a console and play it there, I have no idea....If you've played any other batman game, playing this will leave you feeling robbed and belittled.			"

It's remeniscant of Deus Ex 4 The Fall, with it's dreadful animation style, blurred and 'rubbery' graphics, unbindable controls, poor response time and forced acting. Cut scenes are laughable and everything feels so jarred. There isn't any smoothness to it and it feels like you're clunking around in a poorly made robot, unable to control it. The options are little to none and dialogue has gaps in that make it sound like a child put the scrift together in Audacity. I'm all for the other Batman games. I love them to bits (my hours show that) but this, I knew it wasn't at all fun to play just from the getgo. Sorry guys, this feels like a money spinner you pulled out of a bin. Would not recommend.

												For a franchise that took Batman to the next level, Warner Bros decided, ""you know what a fully three dimensional game needs, 2D! Oh and lets make it have fixed cameras and no way to deviate from the set path we have designed. Yeah, that's what gamers want!""This game uses all the models from the Rocksteady Arkham series, but removes anything fun that series offered. Also its controls are terrible, taking away the smooth combat found in Rocksteady's games. Add to that the fact that Warner Brothers stopped fixing the bugs in their Arkham Origin game to focus on the development of this crap, and you have a recipe for♥♥♥♥♥♥poor game management.Long story short, this should have been free with Arkham Origin as an apology for that game. It most certainly isn't worth money. Don't buy it.			"

												It's like they took every single feature of Arkgam Origins (already the weakest game of the series) and made it even worse.This game is a very clear demonstation of why Batman: Arkham series won't work in 2D. First of all, the combat is very similar to the one in 3D Arkham games. But since it's in 2D, you never know what guy Batman will hit. And, of course, he always hits the one with the shoker stick or the one who can block. This makes fighting the generic enemies really frustrating.In contrast, the bosses are too easy. I've defeated Solomon Grundy on the first try in less than a minute.Secondly, looking for secrets and navigating levels in general is boring. Many people find the map in the game confusing, but it was pretty easy to understand for me. The real problem is the level design itself. The levels are too small. and it's like the same rooms/ventilation shafts/tunnels all over again.Thirdly, the story is really lacking and even the Joker feels boring and dumb.Finally, my gamepad (360 controller for windows) is switching off every 20-30 seconds when playing this game for no reason. Since it works fine in other games, I believe this has something to do with the way the game itself. And to make things even worse, the default keys when playing on mouse/keyboard are not remappable. For instance, I cannot bind ""crouch"" to C because the key is bound to something else.I really tried to love this game, but the problems with the controls were the final thing I'm giving up on this.

You meet up with Catwoman for the first time and seems like there's a riot over at Blackgate. It's all great until the gameplay starts. This is a 2.5 metroidvania type of game which has a LOT of backtracking. 3/4 of the entire game is just running around trying to figure out where you're supposed to go due to a really bad map and questionable design choices. The combat has been really wattered down compared to Origins. It's not even close to Asylum. You cannot parry 2 or more foes at the same time, takedowns have been removed during fist fights (except for the crowch one), most stealth takedowns are gone, a lot fewer gadgets and the list goes on. Some of the puzzles were ok and I liked how evidence and various costumes were scattered around the place.Graphics look muddy. Quite a few bugs here and there. The comic-y presentation of the story is nice but there are a lot of stiff animations and bad textures all over the place.Sound quality is serviceable. Voice acting is hit and miss however the overall soundtrack does the job.I did not enjoy my time with this game and honestly I would not recommend it to fans of Batman or the Arkham series.			"

												Extremely janky combat controls. Currently in a fight with electrified floors, hold down nothing but right and dodge, and he will randomly stop moving or only dodge left right into harms way. Don't come into this game expecting the smooth combat of the main games. The map is extremely complicated, I genuinely have no idea where I am, just following the linear map and  hoping for the best. General navigation is extremely disorienting too since it is 2D but also awkwardly 3DThe game begins with a very long chase sequence that I doubt anyone likes either. I am still in the first area(of 3), but yet to have much enjoyment from it. The first boss I fought was average, quite tricky to play with the whole 2D3D camera flipping everywhere. The delay in your actions can make crucial timing feel very awkward. I quite like the take on hacking, but the mobile-port look(of the entire game) makes it a bit hard on the eye. I quite like the way scanning is controlled rather than the 'take a picture' style of the other games, but it feels quite awkward. It's also very easy to forget, well it doesn't really tell you either IIRC, that in detective mode it displays things you have scanned but not things you haven't scanned, so you still need to open the scanner in detective mode which feels a bit odd.In my opinion this should have either been either 2D or 3D and either would have worked fine, but the Resident Evil style camera angles jumping all over the place is really awkward. It also missing the atmosphere of the main games which is a pretty big part of it.Not recommended unless you actually cared about the story in Origins, and want very little extra, or if you feel compelled to beat all of the game like I am. Fairly easy game though if you like achievements but you need to be patient, lots of pointless vents.			"

Voice acting is hit and miss however the overall soundtrack does the job.I did not enjoy my time with this game and honestly I would not recommend it to fans of Batman or the Arkham series.			"

												It's just...not very fun to play. It's a scan-a-thon to get anything done, a slog to get through and heaven forbid you get shot at. Escape is practically impossible compared to the proper Arkham Trilogy.As an idea, this game is a good one. But the execution is poor. There are more things wrong with it than right and I regret my -albeit discounted- purchase.			"

												Extremely janky combat controls. Currently in a fight with electrified floors, hold down nothing but right and dodge, and he will randomly stop moving or only dodge left right into harms way. Don't come into this game expecting the smooth combat of the main games. The map is extremely complicated, I genuinely have no idea where I am, just following the linear map and  hoping for the best. General navigation is extremely disorienting too since it is 2D but also awkwardly 3DThe game begins with a very long chase sequence that I doubt anyone likes either. I am still in the first area(of 3), but yet to have much enjoyment from it. The first boss I fought was average, quite tricky to play with the whole 2D3D camera flipping everywhere. The delay in your actions can make crucial timing feel very awkward. I quite like the take on hacking, but the mobile-port look(of the entire game) makes it a bit hard on the eye. I quite like the way scanning is controlled rather than the 'take a picture' style of the other games, but it feels quite awkward. It's also very easy to forget, well it doesn't really tell you either IIRC, that in detective mode it displays things you have scanned but not things you haven't scanned, so you still need to open the scanner in detective mode which feels a bit odd.In my opinion this should have either been either 2D or 3D and either would have worked fine, but the Resident Evil style camera angles jumping all over the place is really awkward. It also missing the atmosphere of the main games which is a pretty big part of it.Not recommended unless you actually cared about the story in Origins, and want very little extra, or if you feel compelled to beat all of the game like I am. Fairly easy game though if you like achievements but you need to be patient, lots of pointless vents.			"

												Do you like backtracking? Do you like 2D gameplay in an 3D environment that often feels like an unnecessary complication to make the gameplay more complicated (and blocking many ways back so you have to run around instead of just turning around)?Do you like the Arkham Story line so much that you want to know what happend after arkham origins in blackgate?If you answer all those three questions with YES, I can recommend it to you!If not... well, skip it!The game has all the fun parts that arkham asylum had... in theory. Sadly those are barricaded behind unnecessary walls created by the 2D gameplay that really adds nothing to it and shows that it was created for mobile in the first place.Backtracking itself wouldn't be so bad especially as this game concentrates on you finding new gadgets to open up more paths but since it's an mobil game the graphics are not impressive and you'll find yourself often in places that are similiar looking and thanks to 2D you'll have a hard time navigating through the map (oh I hate the industrial sector).How is the fighting though? Arkham Asylum style, but less ""deep"" and that game was already the weakest of the series.Story? more of the same I guess.Honestly, if you don't already have, play arkham asylum! It's in many ways similar but overall a much better experience!			"

												What starts out as a decent Metroidvania in a 2.5D environment manages to squander all of its goodwill about 2/3 of the way through.  Trivial stupidities (Batman can't jump? Mapping multiple controls to the same button so you end up doing the wrong thing in many situations, bonus 'clues' that have no indication unless you stumble on them in the detective mode, random first person view used when you are in some airvents) are compounded by one of the worst boss 'fights' in a game (Penguin's), and a map that is more confusing than useful, and enemies that can only be defeated by one idiotic method, and fighting controls that don't translate to 2D cleanly.  There are so many missteps that the last two hours of play I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself through.  And I deleted it as soon as I finished - I don't care about the detective cases I didn't finish, or the videos I didn't unlock (I'm guessing because only one of each version can be unlocked per playthrough).  I was more than done, and I'm hoping others will learn from my experience and avoid this frustrating game. "

												Horrible little game, and this is speaking as someone who spent only 5 bucks on it, 5 bucks that I could have spent getting diarrhea from the dollar menu at Taco Bell.  Tons of backtracking, then you finally beat the three bosses only to find out that there are 5 objectives hidden somewhere on the entire map, therefore you must once again backtrack all over the place to find them and their locations are based off of which boss you beat last.  If that isn't enough, one of the variations requires you to find 3 junction boxes for each objective within a time limit, so guess what?  More backtracking and seeing portions of the map you have seen many times before!!!  As an extra bonus, sometimes the junction boxes may not register as being blown up with the explosive gel, so it may take two or more attempts for the game to realize that you have indeed blown them all up.I swear, this game has more padding than a flat-chested girl's bra on prom night.  Off to YouTube to see how it ends and ties into everything.  Oh, and a pro-tip for Bats:  Next time you plan on going into a maximum security prison that holds all of your major foes..... GRAB EVERY SINGLE ITEM IN YOUR ARSENAL BEFORE GOING IN!  Don't go in half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Posted: July 8, 2014
												    Let me get straight down to it: this game sucks. It is a waste of time, money, effort, and constantly frustrates you if you're an Arkham fan.    For some reason, they decided to make it so you control Batman FROM THE SIDE like some kind of Mario side-scroller game, making it IMPOSSIBLE to be stealthy as well as hiding enemies from your line of sight while you're traveling so that they can jump you.    Not only that, but the ""cutscenes"" are just lame little comic book pictures with a moving hand here or a cigarette with smoke that moves there. It makes you feel completely disconnected from the story as every other moment is interrupted by one of these so-called ""cutscenes."" As if not feeling like Batman could be in danger wasn't already disconnected!    One of my biggest beefs was the first boss fight. It threw you in there with a comic book cutscene, then said, ""Have at it!"" without giving you ANY advice whatsoever, expecting you to KNOW how to beat him - with your 5 basic moves... It took me a few tries on NORMAL to figure out what to do, each time having to wait 10 seconds to skip the annoying cutscene.     Another beef I have is that the game STARTS with a cutscene - so you KNOW it's probably going to be a bad game. After the intro cutscene, you jump right in to a fight with some security guards as Catwoman escapes from her most recent burglary.     Then, you have to follow her around - which is quite difficult given the 2D atmosphere yet making you make choices as if it were 3D (grappling onto something in the background, for instance). You finally capture her and send her to Blackgate, which then gets taken over by the Joker, Black Mask, and Penguin. So you go there and work out a deal to team up with her (though you never play as her or see her except in the comic cutscenes), and start beating stuff up.    In fact, that's all this game is. You follow the yellow-brick road since you're practically NAILED to it - no free movement whatsoever - and beat up stuff along the way in a weird attempt at the Super Mario Bros. meets Prison Break.    Now, I know I sound really harsh, but trust me - I'm practically UNDER-exaggerating the crud this game hands to you. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt - I truly hoped it would get better - and gave it about an hour's try. Now I wish I had that hour back, along with my $20 and 2 GB of Hard Drive Disc space. Yeah, it's only 2 GB (other Arkham games range in the late 20's). That can give you an idea about how much - or should I say, how little - the content is in this game.RATING: 1 star (out of 10)			"

												I am a huge fan of Rocksteady's 'Batman: Arkham' games, but I don't have the urge to play 'Batman: Arkham Origins' at the time of this review as I feel that I don't really need to play a prequel to fully appreciate what Rocksteady has created so far. Plus honestly, I am not ready to spend more than 40 hours playing a reportedly mediocre open-world third-person action game when I already have a backlog of games to get through.However, I decided to give 'Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate' (AOB) a try as it looked like an accessible Batman game that I could play intermittently until the release of 'Batman: Arkham Knight'. (The low price point was appealing, too.) Sad to say, I found myself feeling underwhelmed with what I played. The pairing of anime-style cutscenes and 2.5D in-game graphics, while looking fantastic in the trailer, proved to be a mismatch. The 'Metroid'-like side-scrolling gameplay also failed to create an immersive environment and somehow made me feel lost most of the time.The 2.5D graphics looked dated despite some remastering for this PC port, and they proved to be the game's undoing as well. I was never quite sure where I could use my grapple gun, drop down a ledge and throw my Batarang without the help of on-screen notifications. Because of that, what could have been great puzzles to solve ended up being hand holding the player through a series of now mundale challenges and quick time events. Plus, needing to use Detective Vision to identify hotspots prior to using some of my gadgets interrupted the flow of the game.I wanted to finish 'AOB' to see the entire story through, but then I realized the story was pretty much the one from 'Arkham Asylum', but done poorly. I saw no signs of story or character development six hours into the game. 'AOB' was unnecessary in the 'Arkham' mythos that Rocksteady had created. After I decided to suffer through the remainder of the game, it crashed and I lost my save file. (Yes, the game failed to save my game properly as well.) I took that as a sign to not waste my time with 'AOB' and to wait patiently for 'Arkham Knight' instead.			"

												Kek, would explain a lot of steam usersalso very in tact with the batverse.Borderline personality disorder (BPD) (called emotionally unstable personality disorder, emotional intensity disorder, or borderline type in the ICD-10) is a cluster-B personality disorder, the essential feature of which is a pattern of marked impulsivity and instability of affects, interpersonal relationships and self image. The pattern is present by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations and contexts.Other symptoms usually include intense fears of abandonment and intense anger and irritability, the reason for which others have difficulty understanding.People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard and great disappointment. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are common.The disorder is recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Because a personality disorder is a pervasive, enduring, and inflexible pattern of maladaptive inner experiences and pathological behavior, there is a general reluctance to diagnose personality disorders before adolescence or early adulthood. However, some emphasize that without early treatment symptoms may worsen.There is an ongoing debate about the terminology of this disorder, especially the suitability of the word ""borderline"".The ICD-10 manual refers to the disorder as Emotionally unstable personality disorder and has similar diagnostic criteria. In the DSM-5 the name of the disorder remains the same as in previous editions.			"

It was stupid to make an Arkham Game like this, though the idea was somewhat interesting as they brought in one or two extra charactes, however to turn a sandbox into a side-scrolling 2.5D game is crap and it seems Assassin's Creed is doing the same, sadly.It doesn't work too well with the scanner, forcing you to scan everything and then all of a sudden, I was stuck in a locked room where there was a pile of crap that was meant to hide an entrance yet there was nothing to do, no prompting of buttons and leading to a deadend.

												Ok this is a mediocre 2.5D Batman game. It is very simple: the game is just not good enough. You can notice it was made for mobile (handheld) gaming.

The story is not really as deep as the other chapters. Level design is ok, a bit weird to navigate through the maps but can be dealt with. I did not finish the game, it simply didn't interest me enough. If you have a PS vita, buy this on vita, it would make a good airplane trip game (because anyway PS vita doesn't really have many good games). On PC you can dedicate your time to better titles. I recommend this on PS vita given the lack of valid games on it, and given that the game is not really BAD in all its aspects. It makes sense on PS vita but not on PC.

												I think this game is only meant for portable game consoles, such as 3DS. It was originally for 3DS and then decided to have a PC version of it. I didn't like this game. Simply because it takes away the great mechanics the previous games they we've enjoyed so much, being stealthy is so, so difficult. If Batman was playing this game he would get frustrated. Story line was decent enough to like. I'm a gamer for a great story line. But with all games game play comes first and sadly I'm not willing to play through a bad game play to know more of the story. Thank gosh I got this game really cheap. $4.99 in the summer sale. It wasn't my cup of tea, but honestly if you want to try out this game buy this game really cheap like I do just in case you're not satisfied with this game.			"

												This game feels like something that was made by a group of people from whom only one had seen Batman Arkham Asylum being played by his grandmother back in 2009 for five minutes.  Then this person described what he had seen to the rest of the team by only using body language. They worked on it for about a week or so when suddenly, two days before release the mane dude decided that it has to be 2.5D. So after googling the term '2.5D' for a day the team gave up and Stanley was left alone to finish the game. And now you can buy it!			"

												This game starts off as a decent Metroidvania. The 2.5D graphics and gameplay actually work pretty well though not as good as the main Arkham titles. The fighting is also well done though simpler. The problem with the game is the boss battles that introduce new, one-time elements required to complete them. They are so confusing that the last 3 battles I was required to go online to a strategy guide to figure out what the heck I needed to do. Worth a purchase if under $5 though I see few people wanting to finish it completely.			"

If it had more time put into making it and wasn't a 2D sidescroller, and was made like the other Arkham games, than this would've been a lot better. It has bland combat, laughable stealth sections, and the requirenment to scan everything to move on. Stick with the other Batman games, they are much better than this game.			"

												As a huge Batman Arkham fan, I thought $5 for a little mobile game seemed like a great price. I was wrong. The story was decent enough and a good epilogue to Arkham Origins, but sadly everything else is lacking.The main problem is the combat. The game is just not fun to play. The Free Flow which works so well in the main series games is back, except in 2D it barely functions at all. Without freedom of movement, the combat is boring and badly executed. Also, the game's stealth mechanics are laughable--one wrong move and instant fail.My main gripe with the game is the horrible, horrible mechanics. For instance, there is a hacking minigame which is decent enough until you get to the end of the game. Then, they make you backtrack around the entire facility using their terrible in-game map, tacking a totally unnecessary hour onto the game's length. And guess what happens if you fail this hacking minigame? You get sent back several minutes and have to do it all over again.That's another problem I had with the game. All the boss fights are one-wrong-move-instant-fails with no mid-fight checkpoints and you have to listen to the terrible intro every single time for no reason. Most of the bosses are extremely repetitive and boring, as well.Overall, even if you're a big Batman Arkham fan, this game just isn't worth the frustration. What could have been a unique, satisfying Metroidvania-style experience is ruined by bad controls, gameplay and combat. Even for a dollar, it just isn't worth playing.			"

												Only for batman fans or else you gonna hate it. Fighting is very stiff and doesn't responds very good (especially the counters)... Boss fights are the WORST (to easy if you now how to do them, repeditive, lame fights, quick time events). Gameplay is pretty fun. Minor things are that you have to scan things before you can interact with it...Too much level replay (like metroid). The upgrades (HP, DMG, items and suits) make it more fun to play.The best parts are the comic cutscenes!Not a bad game but not a very good one two........6/10 rating.			"

												As someone who has enjoyed the Arkham series to date, I found this game to be really kind of frustrating.  In presentation it's really just a much more scripted version of the Arkham series with comic-based cutscenes.  That's not a bad thing, of course, but it feels a little odd to have all of your grapple points set for you after the free roaming of earlier games.   The thing that bothers me the most, though, is that absolutely none of the combat timing seems to carry over to this game from previous games in the series.  There's a small but very significant delay between button press and action that make countering a surprisingly irritating trial.  I'm used to countering just before the blow lands, whereas here you've got to hit counter literally the instant the blue lines show up to have any hope at all of actually performing the action in time.  Perhaps I'll come back to it later, but for now I'm too frustrated with this to find any real fun in it.			"

												I finished up Origins and picked this up for $5 just to keep the ball rolling. Honestly, I can say I shouldn't have bothered. I don't know what it was like before the ""deluxe"" upgrade, but this version certainly doesn't help much either. Perhaps if this had been the original game that started it all (then jumped to 3D with Asylum) a lot of the game's problems wouldn't be seen as such and it could've been a overwhelming good time. As it is now, the game is basically a regressed version of the series, plagued with too many fun sucking aspects, ranging from plain annoyances to full on boneheaded (spike strips).Story:+Comic cutscenes are nice-Story itself wasn't anything specialCombat:-All that you may be familiar with has been stripped away: speed, precision, quickfire gadgets, even the freaking slide tackle is gone! Throughout the whole game I would still instinctively try to pull these things off during combat to no avail because the actions are so ingrained in me.-Enemies freely move in and out of your plane, causing you to miss sometimes. Other times, Batman doesn't focus on the right target, which at worst case scenario leads to you hurting yourself by attacking a stun baton wielding enemy head on.-Boss fights, while unique, don't offer much to delight in as they are simple and quickly over. Platforming/Exploration:+The only change to the formula I did like was the new cryptographic hacking. Instead of twiddling the sticks to form words in the other games, here you have a grid of numbers that you move a box over to match up a 3 digit sequence.+Lots of areas to cover-Lack of quick exit/travel to the 3 main branches of the prison. Later on there are a couple of shortcuts that will take you from one to another but they aren't labeled on the map in any noticeable way so you'll probably have a difficult time remember them.-Map can be confusing at times since it isn't rotatable and multiple pathways will overlap each other-Spike strips on the floor. Really, who in their right mind came up with this genius obstacle? Sorry, player, we're going to make it travel even more of a chore by having you need to keep your eyes out for these instead of being able to tune out while you only want to get from one end of the room to the other. And naturally since Batman is just starting out and hasn't yet trained a day in his life, he can't merely hop over these tiny hindrances. Instead you have to double tap the button to roll over and avoid damage. If this causes you to exit and delete the game in the first 15 minutes, I completely understand (I'm dead serious, these things are pure garbage.) If you're really dying for more Batman after the main games (and at this time before Arkham Knight's release) then you could go for this at a budget price. I did though and throughout I didn't feel it was worth the time.			"

												If your a huge fan of Batman, pick this one up on sale. If you like the Arkham games and aren't particularly a Batman fan than I say avoid this one at all costs. This is definitely a game made for when you have down times while commuting to school/work or just simply when you can't reach your PC/Console.Pros- Good voice acting, decent story, metroidvania style. New game plus. SUITSCons- Awful combat, butchered stealth mechanics, and a horrible map.The stealth in this game is pretty much non existant and I am glad that there were only a few sections (All of which I was never able to properly sneak through because of the poorly implemented gameplay mechanics)The combat is very sloppy as well and waters down the free-flow combat until it is nothing but generic.I wish the developers had stuck to their guns and created a fresh experiance because they absolutely failed when it came to borrowing Rocksteady's core gameplay mechanics. However I did think that their own innovations were very clever and spot on for a Batman game. (Gel Launcher is such a cool gadget and should be included in the next Arkham game.) I also enjoyed the puzzles and exploring the map but the in-game map that they gave us was very confusing because of the 2.5D view they gave us. (Example) When you enter a vent from the right you could be facing left when you exit the vent. This certainly caused alot of problems during my playthrough of the game and I have seen this issue brought up many times during LPs of the game on Youtube.I enjoyed this game but I can't recommend this one in good conscience because Batman is my 2nd favorite Superhero. Although I am a bit bias allow me to take off my rose colored glasses and give this game a proper score:6/10			"

												Wow, what a mess of a game. I love the arkham games. I love Batman. I love metroidvania games. But this was just absolutely awful. The graphics look like something from a PS2. The gameplay is stiff and difficult to figure out. The mechanics are unreliable. The combat is broken. Everything about this game was terrible. Here, let me be helpful. I'm in the second stealth room of the game. THere are no gargoyles and 4 men in a 2D hallway. I'm up on a ledge and i see one guy turn around. I take him out and move forward waiting for the next guy to turn around so I can make my move, instead he just sits there. I try to approach him and trigger a response, but instead he just shoots me as he just barely comes into view. I try again and notice that i can use detective vision. I tag a floor grate THAT WAS PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE and figure thats what im supposed to use. No big deal, just getting used to how the game is played. I take out the first guy again, move towards the grate, go in, start moving forward, and he sees me. WHILE IM IN THE GRATE!!!!! Thats like, all the enemies using xray googles in a steath game. Whats the point of hiding if it doesn't work? The combat is broken too. I start the game on hard, i figure since I'm really good at the 3D batman games this one should be easy peasy right? Well i guess the developers thought it was too easy because the counter mechanic doesn't work consistently at all. I fight my first wave of enemies and even though im pressing the counter button when they attack it's not working at all. I do defeat them, but anticipating the pain that the game is going to give me i switch to normal mode. Even with the counter icons i can't do it. I press the counter button when my spidersense tingles, but i don't counter. The same thing happens when i battle catwoman for the first time. Not only was she one giant QTE, but it took forever just because the mechanic doesn't work. When you play an Arkham game you expect things to have a rhythm and flow during combat. everything was cut short, choppy, stiff, or inconsistent. It was painful to play. I didn't think A:Origins held up to the standards of the series, but at least it was decent. This was just an awful painful mess.  I may not have gotten very far, but i had more than enough. I didn't have high expectations going in, but now my expectations are even lower. If i ever get through my backlog (Ha, that was funny) i might might might pick it back up. But for now the pain is just to real. Save yourself. Stay away from this pain. Oh and those cutscenes everyone raves about? don't believe them. They look muddy and gross. I like my drawings to have a pop at the edges, not this mushy garbage. Maybe it looks better on a smaller screen (cough cough, cashin on a portable game, cough cough).			"

I'll give it another shot but my pet peeve is games with terrible controls. This is something I admire in games that do it right (Tomb Raider and of course all the Bat games) and HATE games that mess it up (since even basic playtesting with gamers will reveal this weakness). This game had BAD controls. The camera is bad too. You often dont know which way to go since you're restricted to 2D planes and you'll frequently pick the wrong direction because the camera often places you at an angles where you cant cleary tell the intended path.

												The worst Arkham game by far.  While the platforming and movement aren't too annoying, the combat is god awful.  The  3D combat system of the larger Arkham games simply does not scale into 2D.  When facing more than four enemies, it quickly becomes difficult to target specific enemies, and becomes even more annoying when enemies must be taken down in specific sequences (such as the knife, armored, or stun baton thugs).  The camera does not help, and it becomes difficult to tell who is ""first in the queue"" in an offscreen fight.  There are better Metroidvania games, and certainly better Batman games.  I picked it up for $2.50, and think that was too much.			"

Arkham Origins Blackgate has a completely flawed combat system, very silly save points for areas that will undoubtedly have to be played again,  a frustratingly complex and hard to understand map, but most of all and the game just feels disappointingly unpolished and buggy. It truly is a sad thing because having a Shadow complex style game based on Batman is a fantastic idea. This one however is sadly not something I would reccomend.			"

												I am a big comic/batman/arkham fan, and I hate his game.-There is more running around and searching for things than fighting.-Platforming sucks.-Bosses are boring and easy-Confusing level design-Stealth sections are awful-You need to scan everything you want to interact with (e.g. explode a wall with gel, throw batrang and something, ect.)-Different costumes are upgrade (I played with a wierd costume because it minimizes the bullet damage)+Batman, and the many other DC carachters			"

												I won't lie, this is one of the worst Arkham games available, but that doesn't mean it's bad! The other Arkham games were incredible, and I would label this title as ""Really Good"". It's still quite enjoyable, though due to it's 2.5D style of gameplay some Arkham fans maybe put off.It's has everything the other Arkham games had: A plethora of baddies, upgradable equipment, cutscenes(Though the cutscenes are done in the style of motion comics), vent crawling, stealth gameplay, investigation clues and even detective mode. The only difference is that it's 2.5D! In all honesty though, for a 2.5D game? You have a lot of freedom to explore Blackgate prison, and can even get lost.I will say this though, the guy they have doing the Mark Hamil/Joker impression kinda stinks! The actor doing the batman voice can pass, but he's just not as good as Kevin Conroy! Overall, it's not perfect, and isn't as good as other games! However I would still rate this a solid 6/10 (Better than average)			"

Unfortunately you can't interact with them until you scan them. Which is tedious. In fact that is all this game is, extra steps to pad the length of it.

												If Steam had a ""alright"" rating then I would apply this to this game instantly. If you're expecting a 2d version of the Arkham games by Rocksteady or WB Montreal, you're going to be disappointed. The combat has been limited to punching, stunning, and evading. No takedowns or insane combo's here, the fighting is anemic compared to the other Arkham titles and isn't the core of the game. This is a major plus due to the fact that this game is a Metroidvania type of game with the cape crusader. The graphics are better than the previous portable literation but that is not saying much, some textures are muddy, or stretched out and this is especially true during fights when you see prison inmates look like they have melted Crayola marks as tattoos on their arm when the camera zooms in. Batman looks great though. Furthermore the map used to find clues is horrendous, it makes finding certain items at times hair pulling or impossible until you look online to see where it is ( EX: Crowbar that is needed for a case). On the positive the game is enjoyable if you like going around the environment collecting things , finding upgrades , Batman suits (Zombie Suit is worth the hunt!), and so forth. You can tackle the 3 main areas anyway you please which is nice, as each different play through rewards you different Batman suits . Aside from the exploration, I found the story enjoyable, it’s there but it doesn't affect the gameplay too much. If you are on the fence on this one wait for a sale, I got this for $5 and I think that is probably the fairest price one should pay for this if they want to try it out. If you have any question you are free to message me and ask me anything.			"

												I got this after seeing all of the Batman stuff was on sale.  I've been wanting to play Origins for a while and was expecting something closer to Deus Ex HR where the DLC was an extra side mission.  There were PLENTY of things that happened in origins that could have been followed up on, or they just could have recycled Catwoman from City and used that for some CW missions.Anyway, instead we got the Arkham series forced into a 2D platformer.  It tries to mesh the games with free flow combat, gadgets, etc, into 2D and it ends up failing.  I don't know who played in alpha or beta and thought ""Yeah, this is going to be a hit!""  Honestly, it feels more like a money grab than anything.Go have fun with Origins, avoid this.  I played 30 minutes or so before deciding this wasn't for me.			"

												Pros: Eh...not much here, really. * The graphics are pretty decent and combat system is still the same controls.* Story is pretty cool with Catwoman involved. Cons: * Very boring - the 2.5D aspect is tedious. Too bad they didn't make this a full 3D game like Origins.* The maps were difficult to navigate as well as tedious as you constantly had to backtrack throughout the game trying to find stuff and forgot how you got there last time. Not much fun.* Most boss fights were terrible as they didn't explain anything to you. You would have to constantly die in order to figure out what the developers wanted you to do. Overall if you're a bigtime Batman fan and love the Batman games that are out now this is a good pickup so you can make sure you have the full storyline and collection, but I'd definitely recommend only buying this on a Steam sale for about $5. It's not worth more than that.			"

												If this were JUST ""Baby's First Arkham"" game it wouldn't be as bad. But on top of this game being essentially a drastically dumbed-down Arkham Origins, it's technically flawed in nearly every respect. The controls are sluggish when they even work, there's barely any key customisation, combat is a complete joke, the graphics look about six years old and terrain naviagion is a pain at the best of times. But that's a luxury compared to the boss fights. Blackgate pretends like it has any, but they're just thinly-veiled QTE sequences, with the final one being the most egregious of them all. Almost zero tolerance for timing and the same grating voice-over again and again.""Are you even trying? I think I'm winning. Are you even trying? I think I'm winning. Are you even trying?

												A spin-off of Batman: Arkham Origins, this is a 2.5D action platformer set in the same world as the other Arkham games. While the level design is fairly well done and the game does a good job of providing Metroidvania-esque exploration, it fails in almost every other way. First off, while the level design is good, the navigation is a pain. The ""world"" is split into three maps, which you have to enter/exit from the front door/back door, which are not easily accessible from most of the map, causing a large portion of backtracking to be for the sole purpose of leaving your current area. To complicate things further, the map is very poorly displayed, particularly in regards to areas with multiple height levels, which can make finding your way around extremely obnoxious.The freeflow combat from the previous games is forced into the 2D perspective, which makes targeting enemies impossible, (you can only attack people directly in front or behind you) and often times they will strafe into the foreground or background which makes it difficult, sometimes literally impossible, to hit them. The predator aspect has almost been entirely removed for this game, and when it does show up, performs terribly, as without the three dimensional movement, there is no way to hide or sneak about other than running away.In addition, blocks/counters don't seem to register half the time and there are no rebindable controls, with the default controls being incredibly odd, making controlling an issue on top of the gameplay issues. In regards to plot, it is extremely simple and is told in such a simple way that you'll get the same level of investment in the game from reading a paragraph long summary of the plot on Wikipedia. In short, I highly recommend that even avid Batman fans avoid this game, as you'll only be disappointed at best, absolutely infuriated at worst.			"

												This had a lot of potential. Batman in a true 2/2.5D metroidvania game? Sounds awesome.Sadly, the execution is severly lacking. The controls are controller snappingly frustrating and unresponsive even at best. There is no jump button, for example, yet there are things for you to jump over, namely, spike strips on the floor. You CAN double tap the action button and roll, and sometimes that will get you over the spikes, but this only works about 25% of the time.The combat against regular enemies is just button mashing, much like the other Arkham games. Only here, you don't even choose which targets to attack, you just spam melee and occasionally stun or jump over someone.The bosses are horrid, and the main reason why I can't recommend this game. They are super scripted, multi phase fights with no check points. The problem comes from the controls being what they are, which makes what would be decent fights into brutally difficult excercises in frustration.The map is a piece of crap. It's fixed angle, but room layouts are completely arbitrary and don't follow the map in logical ways.The rest is kind of meh. Decent music. Graphics aren't bad considering they came from a portable. Voice acting is...passable. And the collecting is alright, from what I got into. I quit when I got to the penguin because he's impossibly hard for no good reason.Why can we not have good metroidvania games made these days? It can't be THAT hard.If you pay more than 2 bucks, you got ripped off.			"

												Got this game for free as apology from WB for screw ups of Arkham Knight, but now i want apology for this apology! They should give people free season pass for BAK, instead of this crappy game and other batman games that everyone already own and for which nobody recieved a gift copy. After playing this a little i feel like i dont even need this game for free!Blackgate is good illustration of retardation of mobile gaming nowadays. Platformer without jump button - what a joke! All you do in this game - kick asses of several enemies for about 1 minute, then walk left or right like 2 minutes, and press RB to hook up to only possible place, then this repeats. Sometime game allows you to imitate some mechanics of Arkham like stealthing, or detective mode investigation, but yet again everything is done with one one button - you just move stick until you see some object, or your just move from one fixed point to another with RB and autoglide on guards.Saddest thing about this game - it actually had potential that developers wasted by designing it for ""one touch"" experience, i think instead of making port as is for PC they should have improved gameplay, give people more of free control over actions of batman, allow to jump, allow to fall, allow to aim for the point of hooking, make battles more challenging and advanced, by unlocking ability to move up and down on ground - and that would be good game, like prince of persia meets double dragon. However they gave no crack and released this iPhonish abomination as is, and it just terrible.Batman games on NES still much better than this, even with worse graphics.Phones need to get back dpad and at least 4 face buttons and 2-4 shift buttons, because touch screens totally ruined mobile gaming, games on siemens and nokia symbian smartphones (like n-gage) was way more advanced than crap like this (that imitates games with one click context actions, but not really offer true gaming expirience) we have now. And devs who ports games like this from phones really should go extra mile and expand\redesign gameplay and controls for PC. Its unacceptable to have gameplay that bad and re-tarded on PC!			"

												I do recommend this game, but my ""yes"" comes with several caveats.First and foremost this is a 2.5D metroidvania (read, NOT the same gameplay experience as the other Arkham games).  It has the feel and look of the arkham games, and while the combat is similarl its much more restrictive and unimportant (fights are few and far between and not terribly challenging, even the bosses can be easily downed by learning their pattern).  You'll spend most of your time exploring 2.5D environments hunting for upgrades and collectibles and exploring the large environment.  There are 3 major areas each with a boss at the end, and the game can play out very different depending on the order you choose.  The game isn't particularly long so its recommended (and necessary for all achievements) to play through the game 3 times to get all the endings and unlockables.Most of the problems with this game come from its 3DS/Vita origins.  The graphics are extremely and noticeably subpar, with most of the graffity on the prison walls extremely blurry, and batman himself looking decidedly low res.  Additionally, the controls are a bit dodgy.  I got through the entirety of the game using the keyboard and mouse without much trouble, though sometimes counters didn't register.  On the final boss I was stuck for ages because my counters weren't registering in time, until I finally tried using the keyboard to counter instead of the mouse, upon doing this I cleared the fight no problem.  Lastly, the game is short.  My first playthrough clocked in at near 11 hours, then my subsequent 2 to get all the achievements took about 5 a piece.  That being said, the game didn't overstay its welcome and anything more might have felt like padding.I enjoyed this game, as a fan of Arkham and Metroid there was a lot to be had here, and I hope they improve upon this idea for future endeavors.  That being said, I got the game very cheap during the Steam summer sale, and suggest you do the same as at present the full price of the game just isn't quite worth it.			"

												Pretty good!The good:- Solid sound and voice work makes it feel like an Arkham game.- Graphics are light compared to Arkham Origins but are plenty good enough in motion.- Joker's boss fight. Solidly paced and you have multiple options based on what gadgets you have at the time.- By extension, the game is kinda a Metroidvania but you can tackle the three sections of the game (and their bosses) in whatever order you choose. This makes less sense story-wise but is nice from a gameplay standpoint.- The hacking minigame is better than any of the ones from Arkham Asylum, City, or Origins. It actually makes you do something instead of just holding two buttons/rotating sticks. - Any goon with a gun is dangerous (Unless you're wearing the unlockable Darkest Knight Batsuit).The not so good and bad:- Detective case clues are just a few pixels large when playing at 1080p and are not highlighted or shown on the map until you manually scan them. This makes completing the finding all the clues tedious and frustrating. Don't feel bad about using a guide here.- Combat is ok unless there's a knife goon or stun-stick goon as you can't seem to counter-dodge their attacks unless you're facing them. Countering regular attacks sometimes misses or acts strange.- Penguin boss fight. Just... confusing the first time through and annoying later times.- Mouse control feels off. I recommend playing with a gamepad or just the keyboard controls. So as long as you don't go into this expecting a mainline Arkham game, there's fun to be had in here.			"

Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate DE: 6,5/10 - BUYER BEWARE! Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate DE ImpressionsThs is not a bad game... while remembering that this is a mobile ported side scroller with sporadical visual 3D elements...a game-genre that has not really thrived since the days of PS1 or the SNES. So if you do not like games like those from the 90'ies, do NOT TOUCH IT.But if you found it somewhere on sale, like for 4 to 5 EUR, when you don't mind the game for what it is, it actually is fun.The major downsides are... the inhuman amounts of backtracking based on a VERY LOUSY and CONFUSING map, the controls are not always very responive, some of the puzzles in combination with the confusing map, are not really hard, but unproffesionally complicated...If you like sidescrollers, go get it... ...but get it CHEAP!PS: The story is mostly forgetable for the games duration, but the outro seems, as if it would lead directly into the ASSAULT ON ARKHAM movie released on BluRay right about now...

												I don't highly recommend this game unless it's on sale and you are a Batman fan. Unfroutanately, the way the levels are designed aren't the best and the map is shoddy at best. The combat is a barely working half the time version of the combat we know from the main-line arkham games. The story and writing are probably the weakest of the entire series. Many times I felt like I was watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon. The boss fights are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. The game is ok, but barely servicble as a legitimate followup to Arkham Origins. Below Average 4/10. Not terrible, but not good either and definetly not a great follow up.			"

												I own this title on two platforms; the original 3DS and PC.For those of you wondering if this is just another game in the now legendary Arkham series I must tell you that it is not. There are certain elements of the gameplay that are similar, but as it was developed for the 3DS, it does not play like the other games in the series. Batman; Arkham Origins Blackgate (BAOB) is quite unique both in the artwork used for the cutscenes and in the battle and weapons interfaces. The cutscenes are done in a cell-shading style seemingly used to create more of a comic book effect. I don't mean to say anything disparaging about the the artist, but I am not a fan. I do appreciate the talent and effort required to produce such work, but it's just not my cup of tea.The gameplay is fair. It's hard to judge based on a familiarity with the other games in the series. The processing power of a 3DS obviously could not handle a game like the others in the series. The developers created a sort of hybrid interface, which at times works very well, and some of the battles are quite enjoyable. The problems, in my opinion, are not based so much in the combat as in the interaction with the evironment, which comprises most of the gameplay. As Batman explores Blackgate prison he typically moves from side to side as in a classic side-scroller like Super Mario Brothers, only path will often have several layers, requiring button prompts to appear on the screen to allow the player to move Batman from one layer, or path if you will, to another. This can often become very tedious and sometimes clunky. The various overlapping paths can also render the map, which can be accessed in a sub-menu, virtually useless. It can be very easy to get lost as you crawl through various vents, turn corners, and drop from the ceiling into rooms. The story told by the forementioned cutscenes is engaging as Batman encounters Catwoman, presumably for the first time, and is pulled into a mystery that seems to take place sometime between Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. A few of  Batman's well-known adversaries must be defeated as Batman tries to regain control of the prison. It is a good game, but not a great game. Certainly a must-have for a real Batman fan, but probably not recommended for the average gamer.7/10			"

												Probably the most underappreciated Arkham game of them all, if underappreciated is a word to use. It's a very good game for a 2.5D Arkham spinoff. I have not encountered glitches, and in order to get all the Batsuits, you gotta beat the game 3 times in a particular order of boss fights each. Honestly, I'm alright with this, as the game has as much replay value to me as the other Arkham games. I recommend this.			"

												This is a really fun game, but make sure you don't go into it expecting it to be something it's not.  This game originally released on the 3DS and Vita.  It's NOT like the other Arkham games, it's a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game.  If you have problems navigating a 3D environment on a 2D plane without getting lost, this may not be the game for you.  That said, for what it is, I still had a lot of fun with it.  If I had to compare it to something, I'd compare it to say, Ori and the Blind Forest, or Guacamelee, rather than the other Batman games.  Storyline-wise it takes place about 3 months after Arkham Origins.  The events of the game don't really tie into the plot of the other Arkham games, but it does show the beginnings of the Suicide Squad.			"

												Well, I was all excited to play another good batman game, unfortunately I overlooked that this one is 2.5D; games that don’t let me control the camera have always annoyed me, as have games that force me to look at things too much, breaks the immersion for me. Needless to say I played the game for less than 10 minutes before I turned it back off. Oh, there was one thing that bothered me more than the 2.5D even though it’s a byproduct of it. When you are fighting enemies they often stand in groups, problem is you’re stuck on a rail, can’t move up and down, which makes it difficult to tell when batman’s stun attack is in range or not, very irritating.

Don't feel bad about using a guide here.- Combat is ok unless there's a knife goon or stun-stick goon as you can't seem to counter-dodge their attacks unless you're facing them. Countering regular attacks sometimes misses or acts strange.- Penguin boss fight. Just... confusing the first time through and annoying later times.- Mouse control feels off. I recommend playing with a gamepad or just the keyboard controls. So as long as you don't go into this expecting a mainline Arkham game, there's fun to be had in here.			"

TL;DRSave your money and don't get this game, it's broken. Shoddy port shouldn't be made at all!The game has a promising start and once you get the hang of it, you have some good fun.That is... until you get stucked in gamebreaking bugs.Past the intro and once you reach BlackGate prison, you have three selectable paths to choose from. Joker, Black Mask and Penguin.I had chosen Penguin path (Cell Blocks)... and once you go around, do your sh!t here and there, you get to have some ""battle to the death"" with a convict, Bronze Tiger. Afterwards, Penguin flees and escape somewhere behind a huge inaccessible door.You are told to head to the Lighthouse... and voilà... stuck there! I cannot advance further since I'm stuck in the area where you do find the electrified caged arena that you have fought Bronze Tiger earlier. Right there, you just cannot go anywhere...Unless you are willing to delete your saved game and restart?♥♥♥♥ NO! STAY AWAY FROM THIS POS!RATING:2 / 10 (was promising until you meet the nastiest villain of all, Mr. GameBreaking Bug!) "

												Forget the fact that Blackgate is way inferior to any of its predecessors (It was build to be, since it is a PS Vita/ Xbox Live Arcade port), the game offers tons of fun, nice puzzles and an acceptable gameplay. I liked the old school cartoonish cutscenes and also, the plot adds a bit more to the prequel since it's set three months after the events of Arkham Origins.If you've never played any of the previous games don't expect this to be the game to finally hook you. But, if you've been enjoying the series so far, you should give it a try.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is a cool game but has some flaws. Unfortunatly you will get lost alot if you don't take a good look at the map because this game is a freaking maze and the map isn't that well ordered. And you have to backtrack a lot. The story is cool but the graphics outdated. Oh and just a warning this is nothing like the other Arkham games this is the adventure genre.			"

												If you're a fan of Metroidvania games and the Batman Arkham franchise then this is an excellent game for you.  You have a fairly big, complex, and non-linear map to explore.  There are plenty of unlockables to discover including access codes for new areas, upgrades for gadgets, and character skins.  There are also many hidden collectables for rewards too.The combat is pretty good but, as this is a port from the Nintendo DS, it is not a deep as the other Arkham games.  However, enemy encounters are varied as you are put in different situations and can use the environment to your advantage such pulling away weak supports with your batclaw or cutting down hanging lights with your batarang.  You can still sneak around and perform a variety takedowns or swoop from above.  Boss fights are entertaining and varied but there are not that many as there is only one per main area.  The puzzles are good and pretty challenging as you would expect from a game originally designed for NDS gameplay.  The only real down side to this game is that scanning the environments can be tedious at times as you will need to unlock new paths and find hidden items.  Even though there is some form of fast travel for previously explore areas with unlocked elevator, you will need to backtrack quite a bit.  This is not always a bad thing as you can unlock new items you've missed and get surprised with new enemies.  Also, there are a few frustrating moments which only occur when you don't know how to solve a puzzle, approach a difficult boss, or disarm some bombs later on in the game.The graphics have been upgraded for this version but there's still room for improvement with the textures when seen upclose which is normally when the game zooms in as Batman takes down his last foe in slow motion.  The sound, music, and voice acting is top notch as aways with this franchise.  The cutscenes are in a stylish motion comic form which I assume is feature derived from being a NDS port but they are still good quality and entertaining.The story itself is very good and serves as a good side-story / follow-up to Arkham Origins.  Some new characters are introduced but are not seen as often as you would like.  Surprisingly, the ending will leave you wanting more as some mysteries are left to be unravelled for another time.This is a very good game overall.  It only received hate for being a 2.5D game but if that doesn't bother you then don't miss out on a good story and great action.  Depending on the type of player you are the game can take 6-10 hours to beat on a regular play through, and 15-20 hours if you are trying to 100% the entire game.  My playthrough was inbetween as it took me 14.5 hours.  I tried to be quick but I did get distracted by searching for some unlockables.This game is a must have for fans of the Batman Arkham franchise as well as 2.5D Metroidvania lovers.  If this game is on sale you can't go wrong.			"

												This game is so repetitive, it's actally unreal. The whole story is riddled with mind-numbing tasks in order to make the game drag out that little bit longer. The game was originally a release for the Nitendo 3DS & Playstation Vita, and should of stayed there, in my opion. Don't get me wrong, I was given this game for free due to the 'Arkham Knight: Watergate Scandle' and I'm grateful in that sense, but as a gamer I have to be honest about it and advise others not to waste their time on this.

While it lacks the open world gameplay of Origins, City, and Knight, it still includes the stealth and exploration that the series is famous for.The appeal is more for poeple who like 2D metroidvania games rather than people who enjoyed the the other Arkham games. If you like both, you'll probably like this game.			"

												I recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of Batman Arham Universe and wants to complement his experience after playing Arkham Origins. The first hour into the game was the most difficult for me, because I'm not used to this 2.5 D environments. The controls were intuitive and easy for me. The graphics looks great compared to PS Vita, but they are out of the league of the other Arkham games. It's worth the time and the money, considering that is a companion game. The game is sure full of content, with some side missions desguised as Detective cases. The game is item based, meaning that you don't earn experience for what you do, but you rather collect items scathered around the map to get upgrades and more batsuits. Ezio is again impersonating Batman, and the Joker, Pinguin and Black Mask returns as villains. This is the first time that Ezio faces Catwoman as a villain. Her boss figth is short and sweet. Other boss figths count on you having perfect timing and lateral thinking. They take just one to five minutes to complete. This game again replicates the sins of his predecessors. Backtracking. You run, and run and run  from room to room to collect items that are necessary to your quest. Fights are scarce, and the predator sections of the game fails miserably to entertain. I just wanted to get over with those parts and continuining my violent tour in Blackgate, that is remiscient to the first time I toured Arkham Asylum. A lot of walking. Exploring is supossed to be rewarding, but the 2.5 D environment makes the experience less inmersive, and is not very enjoyable. I got used to the map and that made my life a lot easier. This a flawed yet entertaining game, that complements the Arham experience. Is worth the full price compared to DLCs or other titles in line with the same price point, and if you are Batman fan. There was certainly a lot of heart and effort in this title to make it a complete experience, that can stand on his own. It takes five to ten hours to complete the first run, and another five to ten to get all collectables and finish the Plus mode. "

What went rightImproved backtracking -There are multiple ways of exiting each zone and it's relatively quick to do so. I understand this wasn't present in the original mobile version.Distinct Batsuits - It isn't a case of Arkham Origins itself, with its Batman in a different costume which can look out of place and at-odds with Arkham City's Batsuits having unique heads/bodies. Although some appear to be straight ports with detail removed, such as AO's and Red Son's suits, the others in AO Blackgate are built just for this and usually offer some gameplay benefit. The pseudo-motion comics work well, though the in-game cutscenes are unskippable.Detective mode is sort-of improved. I like the circle allowing focus on specific areas, I don't like the repeated ""analyzing"" animation for things such as exploding walls, Batman should know immediately after scanning the first one to know what he's looking at.What went wrongPretty much everything else...Boss fights can have good ideas, but are poorly executed overall. If this wasn't a 2.5D platformer, and was Arkham City instead, the boss fights would be over in one fell swoop. I also found only the boss fight with The Penguin to auto-save your progress, so as to retry with The Penguin at his reduced health and in the final stage of the fight. The rest seemingly don't have that luxury, forcing you to go over the same stages again. The final boss fight itself has a novel twist let down by......The Infamous Clunky Controls - This is not a smooth experience. Arkham Origins' movement and combat itself was, dare I say it, a hit and miss affair and not even as smooth as the original Arkham Asylum. Here? It's even worse.  Countering using the mouse often doesn't register, which is not so bad when fighting mooks but the final boss fight with Catwoman makes the game an exercise in frustration and rage (making that novel twist all for naught).  The keyboard works better, but unless you have a mechanical keyboard such as I do, it'd be cheaper (!) and possibly better to use a gamepad (and, of course, not everyone has a gamepad attached to the PC!).The boss dialogue is repeitive at best. The Penguin will repeatedly announce ""you hit like a ponce!"" when Batman is standing still (or otherwise not fighting), and other such lines from a very limited pool of material every few seconds. I get the impression that the dialogue was designed for specific gameplay events (e.g. perhaps Batman not getting a high freeflow count), rather than the dialogue being rattled off ad nauseum.The 2.5D platforming self-sabotages from the get-go. Situations with mooks could be sorted out in moments within Arkham City, but here? You may end up unable to grapple from vantage point to vantage point for seemingly no reason, or have to move the mouse cursor over the grapple point in case of standing in an area with two or more possibilities. Worse when you have to be in a particular spot.  Sometimes running (pressing space) can mean Batman interacting with the environment when you don't want him to. Other times, he just doesn't register counter button presses to literally save himself.Other than that, stealth moves can be finnicky - such as performing a floor grate takedown, where you have to be facing the right direction and be exactly under the grate behind the mook. Guns are almost instant kills and Batman still hasn't sorted out his rebreather (used in a cutscene) to filter out such gas. So it ends up being the old chestnut of a meter that quickly fills up and dissipates if you get out of the gas infested area in time.The story is adequate but not enough to divert from the bad points. To be honest, this could have been RIddler's chance to shine as the main villain, but the villains chosen make more sense for marketing purposes than gameplay purposes. The Joker is the only one with a boss fight that entirely feeds off his character, with the last boss fight only partially using unique character traits (the other parts of that boss fight being repeats of what had gone before). The other main and secondary bosses are either retreads or generic waves of henchmen and drop down on the boss (think Catwoman vs Two-Face at the end of Arkham City).The A.I. knows where you are, and will cheat - if you're spotted in a boss fight, the henchmen know precisely where you are, even when you've moved to the opposite side of the screen and avoided any further detection. Batman usually moves so slowly, that they can catch up with him relatively easily.In closing...The map can be confusing, the graphics are recycled (including animations) but with less shaders and reduced resolution for the textures (given the mobile devices the game was originally intended for) and this let's the game down when played on the PC. But it's the die-hard Arkham fan that I recommend this for, but do wait for a sale (I bought my copy from the Humble Store on sale) and you should get 7-10 hours of determined enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, get a gamepad and buy the Lego Batman games/replay the Rocksteady-made Arkham games/replay Arkham Origins/wait for Arkham Knight. "

												I do recommend this game, but my ""yes"" comes with several caveats.First and foremost this is a 2.5D metroidvania (read, NOT the same gameplay experience as the other Arkham games).  It has the feel and look of the arkham games, and while the combat is similarl its much more restrictive and unimportant (fights are few and far between and not terribly challenging, even the bosses can be easily downed by learning their pattern).  You'll spend most of your time exploring 2.5D environments hunting for upgrades and collectibles and exploring the large environment.  There are 3 major areas each with a boss at the end, and the game can play out very different depending on the order you choose.  The game isn't particularly long so its recommended (and necessary for all achievements) to play through the game 3 times to get all the endings and unlockables.Most of the problems with this game come from its 3DS/Vita origins.  The graphics are extremely and noticeably subpar, with most of the graffity on the prison walls extremely blurry, and batman himself looking decidedly low res.  Additionally, the controls are a bit dodgy.  I got through the entirety of the game using the keyboard and mouse without much trouble, though sometimes counters didn't register.  On the final boss I was stuck for ages because my counters weren't registering in time, until I finally tried using the keyboard to counter instead of the mouse, upon doing this I cleared the fight no problem.  Lastly, the game is short.  My first playthrough clocked in at near 11 hours, then my subsequent 2 to get all the achievements took about 5 a piece.  That being said, the game didn't overstay its welcome and anything more might have felt like padding.I enjoyed this game, as a fan of Arkham and Metroid there was a lot to be had here, and I hope they improve upon this idea for future endeavors.  That being said, I got the game very cheap during the Steam summer sale, and suggest you do the same as at present the full price of the game just isn't quite worth it.			"

												I own this title on two platforms; the original 3DS and PC.For those of you wondering if this is just another game in the now legendary Arkham series I must tell you that it is not. There are certain elements of the gameplay that are similar, but as it was developed for the 3DS, it does not play like the other games in the series. Batman; Arkham Origins Blackgate (BAOB) is quite unique both in the artwork used for the cutscenes and in the battle and weapons interfaces. The cutscenes are done in a cell-shading style seemingly used to create more of a comic book effect. I don't mean to say anything disparaging about the the artist, but I am not a fan. I do appreciate the talent and effort required to produce such work, but it's just not my cup of tea.The gameplay is fair. It's hard to judge based on a familiarity with the other games in the series. The processing power of a 3DS obviously could not handle a game like the others in the series. The developers created a sort of hybrid interface, which at times works very well, and some of the battles are quite enjoyable. The problems, in my opinion, are not based so much in the combat as in the interaction with the evironment, which comprises most of the gameplay. As Batman explores Blackgate prison he typically moves from side to side as in a classic side-scroller like Super Mario Brothers, only path will often have several layers, requiring button prompts to appear on the screen to allow the player to move Batman from one layer, or path if you will, to another. This can often become very tedious and sometimes clunky. The various overlapping paths can also render the map, which can be accessed in a sub-menu, virtually useless. It can be very easy to get lost as you crawl through various vents, turn corners, and drop from the ceiling into rooms. The story told by the forementioned cutscenes is engaging as Batman encounters Catwoman, presumably for the first time, and is pulled into a mystery that seems to take place sometime between Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. A few of  Batman's well-known adversaries must be defeated as Batman tries to regain control of the prison. It is a good game, but not a great game. Certainly a must-have for a real Batman fan, but probably not recommended for the average gamer.7/10			"

												Got his game as a freebie because of the Batman Arkham Knight game being broken (pre-order) and running badly. Well this game is even worse, it doesn't run at all for me, just locks up as the game begins after the intro. I know I should be grateful as it was free but this is simply wasting my time.			"

												Loading it in for the first time its clear that this is a batman name drop turd polish.No options to speak of, what little there are have to be controlled by the up,down,left,right keys with enter and escape rather than what we as pc users are more used to in menus you know using this unique thing called a mouse in conjunction with keyboard.So after dragging my way through the options and having to set up my resolution and so on I ventured into the game. What? A 2.5d side scrolling game? Seriously?After the two epic games that were Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, this turd comes along and pretends to be a batman game in the same mould as the others. Yuck.Awful clunky controls, low texture resolutions, no lip movements on the main characters... and I'm not even out of the tutorial mission. Which by the way assumes you are an idiot and have never even seen a controller/pc keyboard and handholds you in the worst way through a sloppily written intro with crappy dialogue between the  main characters.Just avoid. I'm just glad this pos came as part of a deal with the rest of the Batman games as a bundle and I paid like 99p for it, in which case that's about the right price for it.			"

												I got this free because I purchased Arkham Knight before it was patched, this review is in that consideration.This game is as expected a watered down product of the Arkham series, limited controls and the majority of the game is just finding your ways around the map and using the gadgets you collect along the way. Some of the boss fights can prove difficult until you learn the tricks of what you are menat to do, but out side of these fights you are left beating on thugs that just prove to slow you down slightly.There is a lot of going back and forth to the same spots as you collect more gadgets that allow you to go a little further into the different map levels. That is probably what most of the game time will be.The story they plastered onto the game is interesting enough, the voice acting is good and if you are a completionist, you'll have a lot of secrets to track down.Pros; -Cheap or free         - Nice graphic art for cutscenes         - Interesting boss fightsCons; - Way too much running back and forth           - Variation of enemies is small           - Maps can be somewhat maze like			"

												I'll make this short: If you like platformers, then this is for you. Except that something like this belongs on a mobile store.It is inferior to every Arkham game on PC and lacks in combat; as in that Batman can no longer counter two or three enemies at a time and that the game itself feels so... clunky. I mean, it is clunkier than a GDI Juggernaut being attacked from all directions.And don't even get me started on the graphics. It looks like something out of a game made in 2008. Now now, I know graphics is not everything, but this is something I cannot overlook if the game bears a title such as this.I'll admit, I'm being biased because I'm used to the controls and combat mechanics of other Arkham games; but I just simply cannot recommend this game unless it is on sale or, hell, even free (lel I got it free).But, I personally feel that it really isn't worth it for the title. It doesn't even remotely feel like an Arkham game. "

												I was given this as an apology for being an early purchaser of Arkham Knight. I... am glad this is the one game in the series I hadn't paid money for, because I would've wanted an apology for this. It's not the worst Metroidvania game ever, but it feels more like one of those clunky cash-ins on the Gamecube that the Arkham series finally broke the cycle of. It's vaguely Arkham-inspired, with the name slapped on for money's sake. Poor writing, poor boss design, and sloppy re-use of assets from Origins make what would otherwise be a firmly mediocre game more actively disappointing. Trying to navigate a 2.5D area with an overhead map is completely baffling, combat is a hollow, poorly animated mockery of the main games, and the stealth sections are so badly structured that enemies occasionally spawn directly facing you at the checkpoint. It's a neat adventure-gamey experience to just walk the empty halls every now and then, finding stuff, but any time actual gameplay gets involved, it's a convoluted, badly made mess. Save your money and don't waste your time.			"

												I honestly think this is a great game and a brilliant spin-off to the Batman: Arkham Origins game. Sure it probably fares better as a PS Vita game and there's no denying how convenient it is to have it available on PC for those who don't own, can't afford or even see the value in buying a PS Vita. Any Arkham series devotee already has this in their library and some, like myself, enjoy it for its refreshing 2.5D platformer style. It's one fault (IMO) is the slightly sluggish freeflow combat.

												It's a very fresh take on a Batman game, especially since it has a platform arcade kind of gameplay. + great graphics+ use gadgets to move around+ figure out how to get past obstacles+ a lot of content and locations+ different suits to find+ Catwoman+ a lot of boss fights- traveling between locations is tedious and long and often requires you to go back and find a gadget in another part of prison and come back to the location you were stuck at- to complete all achievements there is a necessity to play through this game 3 or 4 times with different boss order.

												Honestly, this game is really frustrating to play. The controls are largely unresponsive (I use a Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Pad) and so you can be pressing the counter button with it not doing anything, and the mechanics of the game are very frustrating at times. The Map is a 3D mess that is over-complicated for the game. There are times when you literally have no idea where you are or how you got there. The Boss fights are either ridiculously easy or overly hard and the fact that the game ues check points is very frustrating on the bosses. You can beat the same bosses first couple of phases over and over again, but if you die then you have to redo the entire fight from the start (including any cut scenes) which just gets overly frustrating (particularly on the Penguin boss fight because his gaurds can seem to see you even when they have their back to you). The controls are a mess too, and so sometimes you need to hold ""A"" to enter a vent, sometimes its Down + ""A"", sometimes the Right Trigger button or sometimes its Down + Right Trigger. When you are trying to escape an enemy with a gun, you can be pressing the buttons you usually press to get away, but this particular room might have a completely differnt set of buttons. It really is just a mess. The combat is repetitive and boring too. You can start a combo on an enemy and rather than seeing different attacks, Batman just throws the same punch over and over again until the final blow (which does differ). It just feels really lacking compared the real Arkham Games. Another thing which is overdone and frustrating is the constant back tracking. You need to enter each wing to get a piece of Bat-Tech for the next wings Puzzle, but then have to re-enter them to get the access codes and then re-enter each one again to fight the bosses. Finally you have to re-enter them yet again because you have to disarm some Bombs which have been placed right in the dead centre of each zone. In all honesty, this game would probably last an hour if you didn't have to back track so much. It's pretty clear to me that they have just added the back-tracking in to ensure the game has a longer play time, but for me it wasn't fun, it was very boring and very frustrating getting lost constantly. I have loved all of the Arkham games and DLC and even though this was a side scroller beat em up, I wanted to love it too but I just can't. I honestly have more fun playing an old 80's side scroller like Streets of Rage or Final Fight than I had during the several hours this took to complete. I feel bad leaving this review if I am honest, but I just can't say anything nice about this game. Even the story itself is pretty bland and doesn't make much sense. I wanted to play it because I had heard it bridged the gap between Arkham origins and Arkham Asylum, but to be truthful I could have easily never played this and still felt like the games bridged by themselves. The story just doesn't link the games for me, and it made the overall frustration factor even worse because I might as well have not wasted my time. I honestly wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you get it free from a Bundle of the other Arkham games, then sure give it a play. But honestly, I regret buying this game.			"

Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate DE: 6,5/10 - BUYER BEWARE! Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate DE ImpressionsThs is not a bad game... while remembering that this is a mobile ported side scroller with sporadical visual 3D elements...a game-genre that has not really thrived since the days of PS1 or the SNES. So if you do not like games like those from the 90'ies, do NOT TOUCH IT.But if you found it somewhere on sale, like for 4 to 5 EUR, when you don't mind the game for what it is, it actually is fun.The major downsides are... the inhuman amounts of backtracking based on a VERY LOUSY and CONFUSING map, the controls are not always very responive, some of the puzzles in combination with the confusing map, are not really hard, but unproffesionally complicated...If you like sidescrollers, go get it... ...but get it CHEAP!PS: The story is mostly forgetable for the games duration, but the outro seems, as if it would lead directly into the ASSAULT ON ARKHAM movie released on BluRay right about now...

												The game suffers from terrible controls, which really sucks when you consider the main titles of the Arkham series. For example, countering requires the counter button to be pressed repeatedly in order for the game to detect the button press. Batman also seems to have terrible range with his aerial evade and cape stun attacks. Additionally, sometimes Batman fails to exit his evade animations in time to counter an enemy attack, and he attacks in the direction he was last facing without regard to your movement input, so you have to spend the extra second to turn him around. There's also the terrible choice of including stun baton enemies in the game despite Batman's terrible mobility.Lastly, there's the issue of the game being 2.5D instead of strictly 2D. The little extra bit of dimension is problem since there's no target prioritization in the game; Batman can end a beatdown prematurely just because another enemy happens to be closer to Batman on the in-out axis.    This game is best for people who like to ""fight"" the games they play since this game is more annoying than fun.			"

												I've played a bit, and really, while by no means is this anything like a full Arkham installment (I saw plenty of reviewers expecting it to be, not realizing it is a PORTABLE adaptation), it manages to be a fun little game! The mechanics are, for the most part, well translated into a 2D plane, and the exploration is quite similar. The combat IS a little stilted and not quite fluid as in its big brothers, but it definitely works and is fun (Though sliding is rather missed for some quick knockdowns). The only cons are the little ""animated"" snippets...and lots..LOTS of bactracking, but the story seems cool (Nice to see the beginnings of Bats' and Catwoman's relationship) and the Arkham essence is all very much there! I don't know if i'd buy this full price, but i got it on sale, and it was WELL worth the 5 bucks! A nice weekend hobby and a cool way to keep experiencing the Arkham world (Now that i've finshed all 4 main games). BE THE (slightly smaller) BATMAN!			"

												This game is so repetitive, it's actally unreal. The whole story is riddled with mind-numbing tasks in order to make the game drag out that little bit longer. The game was originally a release for the Nitendo 3DS & Playstation Vita, and should of stayed there, in my opion. Don't get me wrong, I was given this game for free due to the 'Arkham Knight: Watergate Scandle' and I'm grateful in that sense, but as a gamer I have to be honest about it and advise others not to waste their time on this. Avoid. Boring, free or not.My rating: 4/10			"

												It's just... I can't. I can't reccomend this game. And I want to. The visuals (being the hand drawn cutscences are great. The voice acting phenomenal though, it being a side game doesn't have near the amount as the main games. I can't get over how terrible the controls are. That's primarily it. I can see past the in game visuals. I have played worse looking games and loved them still. It's just the fact that it's so hard to play. If you REALLY want to experience this game find some lets play of it where they can speed you through the story and let it shine that way.			"

												What happened to this game?  Movement control, on my PC is limited to straight ahead, no camera rotation to look around, poor response to the limited controls...   Strangely enough the 'original' Arkham Origins game permits normal movement and is very responsive!Avoid this game, even though it is a 'Freebie' it still isn't worth the hard drive space.			"

												Meh... this is the kind of game that you can tell from the first 5 minutes whether you'll like it or not. It is a game for PS Vita I think, which got ported over to PC for some odd reason. First of all, it is a sidescroller. Meaning most of the game you'll spend holding either A or D keys and occasionally hitting F to grapple. When you finally get into combat situations, this is where the game truly feels awful. It is so bad, so not fluid and almost impossible to see who's about to hit you. It's like sandbags punching each other... everything you learned in Arkham games you can freely forget.I won't even mention graphics because they are dissapointing. The textures are straight from PS Vita, meaning they're blurry as hell and models are awful. Seriously, these kind of games should be forbidden. Either step it up and remaster the game for the platform or simply don't port it at all.The only impressive aspect of this game are the cutscenes... I find them very amusing and they're greatly done, but that's about it. Once the cutscenes are done, you are thrown back into very boring gameplay sequences. Hold D, hit grapple, punch thugs, repeat. I can't recommend anyone buying this, especially for the price tag. For 20€ you can get other much better games. For 5€ which is a discounted version, you can buy Tomb Raider GOTY or any other Arkham GOTY game and much more better games than this.			"

												Only for the truest batman fans.  Certain aspects are pretty fun, there's a couple good puzzels scattered throughout the game, but a lot of backtracking, poor fight mechanics, and bad guys that go straight thru the floor it's ultimately an average to bleow average game.  There are better metroidvania titles out there, this one doesn't live up to the license.			"

It's an on-rail 2.5D sidescroller with a crappy combat system, that doesn't seem to wanna do what you're trying to.I'm glad I didn't waste money on this, as I got it for free since I bought Arkham Knight at release. For those who might be interested in buying this, feel free to try it out, but do remember Steam's refund policies, I believe most of you will take advantage of that option.			"

No Wonder They Moved Out Of BlackgateIf Steam had the opportunity to give out 'Average' or 'Meh' ratings, I'd give it to this game. Whenever this game gets something right, it gets something else wrong. Good, simple controls get muddled by bad enemy selection and counter response time. Boss fights with iconic characters are almost always turned into annoying battles in which you die in stupid ways because the game fails to telegraph where the boss can actually see you. However the game does have some merits, so by all means read on!GameplayBlackgate is unlike the other Batman: Arkham series. It's a 2.5D side-scrolling adventure with platforming puzzles and occasional beat-em-ups. It's been proven in one of Arkham City's DLCs that sidescrolling Arkham combat works. Sadly I had terrible problems with the way that Batman selects who he's fighting. His cape stun, which normally should 'follow' enemies, simply extends to a small range just in front of Batman. When I ask Batman to counter, there is a terrible delay of roughly a second, which generally translates to Batman getting slogged in the back of the head.There are puzzles to solve with your gadgets, which are generally simple and relatively easy to solve. However it's a welcome change from Blackgate's clumsy combat system. There are lots of platforming opportunities which are good and generally easily accessible, except for one particularly frustrating jump toward the end of the game in the Arkham Wing. All in all I enjoyed the traversing and movement systems. There are only two bosses that I enjoyed (The Joker and Solomon Grundy). Other than that, the other bosses were either infuriating/annoying or poorly made (Black Mask, Penguin, Catwoman) or they were pathetically easy (Bronze Tiger, Deadshot). StoryBatman captures Catwoman and chucks her into Blackgate. A couple of weeks later, there's a big old riot down at Blackgate. Batman must swoop in and recapture the three big crime bosses. Familiar? It does have some good moments. The big draw of the story is to see the first encounter between Batman and Catwoman, and if you're a fan of Catwoman you'll like this story. An enjoyable, if somewhat predictable, story. Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundHonestly, no wonder everyone ditched Blackgate! The only really well done thing in terms of graphics are the character models for main characters, the cutscenes and some details in the environment. My main gripe is that essentially everything is brown and grey. The colour palette is incredibly sparse. No wonder the prisoners revolted; the place is outright depressing. The cutscenes are of a comic-book style which I really enjoyed watching as the story unfolded. Thug character models are pretty much all identical in terms of their archetype. Yes, I understand that it was a PS Vita game. But it was. Surely they could've done something more to make it better looking for the PC players!I guess they nailed the atmosphere of a prison. I almost wished that they'd spiced up the look of it in some places, but if you're looking for a dirty prison vibe this game really nails it. In terms of sound, the game does it well. With good background music (that I think's been taken from Arkham Origins) and good voice acting all around, as well as the thumping of fists onto faces, they've done that really well. ConclusionBlackgate is about 50/50. The graphics aren't really up to standard in my opinion and the map... it's quite possibly the most annoying looking map I've ever come across through gaming. It's a 3D map filled with passages, pathways and dotted lines and it's hard to make heads or tails of it. But Blackgate has a good story, some good platforming and puzzles and sound design. It's a game that I most certainly wouldn't recommend to everyone, and it's obviously a divisive game. But if you're a Batman fan and you're willing to uncover a new story in another broken down prison, this game should suffice to distract you for about seven to eight hours. jmcone's Final Rating- Purchase on Sale "

												I honestly think this is a great game and a brilliant spin-off to the Batman: Arkham Origins game. Sure it probably fares better as a PS Vita game and there's no denying how convenient it is to have it available on PC for those who don't own, can't afford or even see the value in buying a PS Vita. Any Arkham series devotee already has this in their library and some, like myself, enjoy it for its refreshing 2.5D platformer style. It's one fault (IMO) is the slightly sluggish freeflow combat.

												I like to call this game ""Batman: Arkham Backtracking"" because backtracking is all you are ever going to do in this game. The combat, though 2d, is basically Arkham's staple combat, but it is few and far between. You will quickly find yourself running around empty hallways back and forth and back and forth looking for random objects and gadgets.If you're lucky you'll get a boss fight that ranges between ridiculously easy and ridicuusly hard. Either you can beat it in 3 easy puzzle based moves, or they introduce brand new enemies with a brand new set of rules that haven't been explained, talked, about, or warned forcing you to look up an online walkthrough to even have a clue what to do.This is NOT Arkham, this is a cash grab, stay away.

												Sooo... Let's start with this: I wanted to like this game. I really did. I like the other Batman games, I played through Asylum and City multiple times before Games for Windows Live closed AND after that, on Steam, I liked the less-than-favorite Origins, and I'm one of the lucky few, who could play with Knight without serious problems and yes, I loved it. If it wouldn't be enough, I love Metroidvania games. Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Ori and the Blind Forest, and the list goes on... So yes, I wanted this game to be good.Sadly, it's not. The battle is bad - it's basically the same than the one in the other Batman games, except here isn't nearly as fluid and responsive, the map is a mess, but it doesnt matter, because you don't have to think too much, you can't get lost, you just need to go forward, which is disappointig after all those games I mentioned. And I don't know whose idea was that you have to scan everything but please, someone kick him for me, please... you can't aim with your gadgets, you can't jus blow that annoying wall away, you have to scan that freaking wall, and THEN use your explosive gel... yeah, that's reeeally exciting, isn't it?...I'm glad, that I did not pay for this game. I've got it because of the Arkham Knight fiasco, so it would be a horrible compensation for the bad experience with that game, IF I had any. Lucky me, I guess. But if you are like me, and you like the Batman games or the Metroidvania games, and you looking for something you didn't played yet AND you don't have this game... well, search for an another one. This one isn't worth your money, nor your time._____________________________________________PS.: Oh, and if you see any mistake... please, do be a grammar nazi, english isn't my first language, and I want to learn from my mistakes :D Thanks!

												Loading it in for the first time its clear that this is a batman name drop turd polish.No options to speak of, what little there are have to be controlled by the up,down,left,right keys with enter and escape rather than what we as pc users are more used to in menus you know using this unique thing called a mouse in conjunction with keyboard.So after dragging my way through the options and having to set up my resolution and so on I ventured into the game. What? A 2.5d side scrolling game? Seriously?After the two epic games that were Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, this turd comes along and pretends to be a batman game in the same mould as the others. Yuck.Awful clunky controls, low texture resolutions, no lip movements on the main characters... and I'm not even out of the tutorial mission. Which by the way assumes you are an idiot and have never even seen a controller/pc keyboard and handholds you in the worst way through a sloppily written intro with crappy dialogue between the  main characters.Just avoid. I'm just glad this pos came as part of a deal with the rest of the Batman games as a bundle and I paid like 99p for it, in which case that's about the right price for it.			"

Everything about an Arkham game is so stripped down to the bone that it feels more like a third party cheap knock-off than an actual game in the franchise.Every aspect of the game, from the combat to the upgrades to the story to the Secrets feels like a step down from even Arkham Origins.In the end, don't waste money on this, and if you get it for free, be really curious as to WHY.

												Good game overall. The idea is good, but still has some basic flaws.Combat and movement are a little dummy, even if it's a 2.5D game there are some stuff that shouldn't happen on these days.Story is great, all the detective side is a cool thing.Basically: Fun game, not fantastic, but enjoyable.Would recommend.

												A surprisingly enjoyable metroidvania game.Don't come into it expecting anything like the Arkham games, this 2.5d platformer only has rudimentary fighting and stealth sections but there's a  whole lot of climbing, swinging and backtracking.It's not without flaws, the voice acting is flat, the story forgetable and the Vita-port graphics are good but not amazing however it engaged me enough to make me finish the story and restart new game plus			"

												highly recommended , lots of fun, sometimes confusing but nevertheless still enjoyable . Getting this game for 19.99 is a big no no , for the same price you could get a better title. I got it for 7 bucks on rebate. Happy Gaming !!			"

												Like many reviwes here have already set this game or better said mobile game tries to emulate the full gameplay of the arkham series games and only getting them half right at best. the combat is some what similar to the arkaham games but the boss fights are just incoherent and a mess. i would pass on this game if ur thinking of buying but if u got it for free then try it out and see if u like it but i wouldnt buy it.

												Full Disclaimer - I did not buy this game.This game is a massive pet peeve to me.  No shortcuts for completed areas, not so much as a closed fist on Batmans hand.  Climb a ladder? Nope, batclaw that ledge with a usable ladder. Replay is slightly more than nothing, play it 3 more times to get some batsuits that don't really matter.   Once was enough to waste your life on.    Do dont play this, save your time and money on something better.			"

												Final boss fight stage 2 ruins the entire experience.  One of the worst millisecond (you have .000001 to react) piles I've ever seen.  Basically, 99% is an alright romp, but the last 1% fist this harder than an up and comer.			"

												I don't regret getting this, but I can't rightly recommend it to anyone. It's basically the same formula as Arkham Asylum/City/Origins, but stuffed in a 2.5D game. Where Origins was still good fun even though it felt a bit like the B team had a go at making a Batman game, this game felt like it had the C team work on it.The combat is unsatisfying due to the difficulty in targeting a specific enemy when 3 are lined up along the same height on the screen, which is especially annoying for enemies you need to stun or vault over. It's also hard to keep combos going, since the limited sight range might have you guessing if an offscreen enemy is up yet to recieve a beatdown, or you'll just whiff in place.The map is the most confusing mess I've seen for a game map yet; it's an angled top-down view which is blown up in places and connected with dotted lines. Sometimes areas overlap by being above or behind each other, and it's really not clear what's going on on the map.Detective vision has had a downgrade, and now requires dragging a large cursor over the screen to find interesting things, and then waiting for them to scan. Batman can't move while this goes on. It gets very boring after a few screens.There's an explosive gel launcher, which is a better version of the explosive gel spray. In everything else, it's an extremely stripped down version of any of the Arkham games. The story isn't interesting, the cutscenes are (almost) motionless drawings, and the graphics are worse than Arkham Asylum. Visually recognizable pieces of the world that need a specific gadget to interact with need to be scanned first, no matter how many times you've opened/wrecked exactly the same thing. Bosses frequently introduce new game mechanics that aren't explained. The 2.5D movement makes the whole game feel very constrained, and especially the stealth gameplay suffers for it.On the plus side, it can occasionally look nice, art-direction wise, and there's plenty to explore.

												Static camera angles make moving around difficult. Combat is not smooth like the other Batman games where it gets confused as to which target to attack, and if it should block. And on that combat, I've realized it is 2D, so it auto targets the wrong person constantly.			"
