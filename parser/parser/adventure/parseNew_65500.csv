												It's hard not to compare this to entries in the Myst series, specifically Myst III: Exile and Myst IV: Revelation. This is mostly due to the fact that numerous elements were borrowed from each of those games and made just different enough not to seem as though Streko Graphics had done little more than create a Myst clone.While this is a perfectly serviceable adventure game, it's not without flaws (some major, some minor depending on how particular the player is).(A technical aside - some bugs do exist within the game and may likely go unpatched given the age of the title, including a crash to desktop when attempting to delete a save through the in-game menu)The age of the title means that it hasn't held up well over the years, so all the modern visual comforts and relevant settings that accompany them are absent. No true widescreen support and no option to run windowed being two prime examples. The extent of the video settings go as far as color depth options and a few standard definition resolution choices.Going hand in hand with that, most of the 3D modeling in the game is standard fare for the time this title was originally released. Some of the characters look absolutely ridiculous at times and move in a rather wooden manner. Something that certainly allows one to appreciate the advances in that technology at present.As to the plot, what's there is a fraction of a whole. This isn't made clear here on the store page but this is the first part of a series which means the story ends on something of a cliffhanger.What story that is present isn't all that compelling and lacks depth, especially when it comes to the characters it introduces. Unfortunately most of the voice acting in the game is substandard, delivered in monotone with no real inflection toward emotion (perhaps best exemplified by the blacksmith character who does nothing but shout in his brief interaction sequence yet still manages not to sound angry while doing it).Gameplay is typical of the adventure game type - click to navigate a pre-rendered landscape and interact with points of interest. A majority of the puzzles are simple and can be solved without use of a hint system or walkthrough. Only one puzzle in the entire game is randomized, frustratingly to the point where it becomes less a traditional puzzle and more a mini-game of chance as to how many tries it takes before the correct sequence is found.Don't be fooled entirely by the simplicity though as there are a small number of puzzles that present a challenge in how they can be solved.The music and sound design are a mixed blessing somewhat. Most of the game's soundtrack consists of pieces of music that have utterly random ambient noises and sound effects dropped within the middle of their loops. This leads to awkward moments at certain points in the game where something like a door knock can be misinterpreted as a cue that a door nearby needs opened.Likewise there are questionable moments of music used that betray the atmosphere of the game at certain times. Several dramatic stings are completely out of place in the likes of a small mirrored chamber or a well lit, spacious room.The pre-rendered environments in the game are quite possibly the best done aspect of it. Seeing flecked paint on aging wood or an expanse of snow covered land watched over by a cadre of planets is nothing short of wonderful.Taking Aura: Fate of the Ages for what it is, would I recommend it? In general, no. While it is not entirely horrible, there are better examples of the adventure game to play (be it Myst or otherwise) that accomplish exactly what this game does (if not more).However, if you've exhausted the number of adventure games (scarce as they come these days) available to play then Aura: Fate of the Ages is (possibly) worth a few hours of your time. It likely won't climb to the top of your ""best of"" list but it's definitely not a total failure of the genre either.			"

												First off, don't expect Myst quality.  This is a very ambitious adventure game that feels like it had some budget/team/time issues near the end of production.  Very good first 2 thirds of the game, with a very bad last 3rd and an ending that while concluding things leaves a lot unexplained to make room for a non-existant (?) sequel.The first two ""ages"", or level areas, are actually quite good in the puzzle design.  Clues are often just enough for you to piece it together yourself without taking away your own need to poke/click everything and observe.  Many require ""jumping to conclusions"" a tiny bit, just enough where you are not spoon fed the solution, but not to the point of being impossible without a guide.  I loved the first 2/3rds of the game, and it's those first two thirds that earn my recommended upvote.Where it really falls apart is the magic area, the third and final section of the game.  What this area does is very ambitious, but it's clear the design team was not able to put enough videos/clues in place to really make these puzzles work right.  Often in the magic area I had to solve a puzzle by trial and error or by clicking randomly through every scene with no idea what I was doing.  There were also several times in this area that the game just expected me to ""move on"" after a cutscene that I felt didn't even conclude the current ""puzzle"".  A big design flaw with this final area is that unlike the other two thirds of the game, in this part of it you do not have a way of seeing ""the end puzzle"", but are just expected to collect pieces (inventory items) used for it along the way.  And these ""pieces"" are quite random objects that make no sense unless you actually get them all and see what they are used for.  Basically, there is suddenly no story reason for doing anything in the third area, and what little story there is doesn't have enough cutscenes to explain itself.One particularly nasty part of ""clearly cut content"" is that an NPC in this final area has a deep connection to the main character supposedly, but the only dialog you ever have with them is for puzzle solving purposes.  I get the feeling this person was supposed to be a ""hint guide"" of sorts, which would have made the whole age much better to play, but it was too expensive/time consuming to give them more animated clips of dialog.The ending also feels really rushed, I strongly suspect a big final puzzle was cut on the last area, as it is instead replaced with a ""push button and win"" type of ending.Even with all that negativity, I do still recommend it.  If you are ok with playing ""part 1"" of an apparently never continued story, Aura has enough of a ""world"" to get lost in for a few days, and the first 2/3rds of the game are solid old school Myst like puzzles.  Get it on a sale, if it interests you.  I wouldn't pay full price for Aura.  But I still had fun playing it and loved exploring the world, and I feel that I did get my money's worth of entertainment, even if the final age had some pretty badly designed inventory/pixel hunting puzzles.The world itself is actually quite beautiful, even if it is a bit outdated and populated with some of the worst animated CGI ""people"" I have seen in a game.  It still managed to be ""enough"" for me to get ""lost"" in for a few days of play, and I enjoyed all the visuals.  The soundscapes are sometimes a bit questionable, but none of the puzzles make the sounds used to flavor the background music, and nothing felt too out of place to me.Just on the edge of Recommended from me.  You'll get some fun for your money with this one, but don't expect anything that will blow you away, and keep the Universal Hint System on hand for the last age due to a lack of clues.  It's a good ""B"" rating Myst adventure, nothing super special, but nothing you would regret playing through either.			"

												A thoroughly enjoyable first-person adventure. The puzzles are well-designed and ramp nicely in difficulty. Despite what some people say, all the puzzles are logical and are rather well-clued, assuming you look for the clues. I have yet to encounter one where I didn't understand exactly how it worked by the time I solved it. No walkthrough either. I suppose if you miss a clue, you could get confused. But even when I was stumped, a little walking around and thinking got me back on track. I would notice something I didn't before, a pattern I hadn't considered, a reaction I had taken for granted. There is no moon logic here. Just clues you do not yet understand. If you know what I mean.Story? Meh.I encourage those of you who left negative reviews to take another look; these are some very fine puzzles, they just take some effort to solve.			"

												First off, let me point out that this is a game of older date. It shows. The graphics and cutscenes are pretty but not 2016 pretty so if this is off-putting to you, this is not a game for you. Secondly, the voice acting is terrible, nothing less. But since there is very little of it (this is a 'solve puzzles, talk less' sort of game), it isn't that much of a bother.I loved this game, it was a delight to play. Tons of puzzles ranging from obvious over complex and thought-provoking to mindbogglingly unintuitive. This is not a game you will browse through, you will have to be careful and take in all the details. It's a nice, lengthy game and if you do what I do and only get clues online when you're REALLY stuck, it'll be a greatly rewarding experience. I had a pretty good sense of accomplishment after some of the more puzzling.. er, puzzles.Spoiler! :) Remember, like real life, objects can be used several times for different things.  "

												Aura is a first-person point & click puzzle/adventure game, similar to the Myst series.  Differences are a 360 degree camera and an inventory where you can pick up and hold items to later be used in puzzles.  Some of the puzzles are quite difficult, either because you're on the lookout for small details which are easy to miss, or they genuinely require some brains to piece together.  Sketches are scribbled in your journal to give you some not-too-obvious hints if you get stumped. The music, atmosphere and voice acting aren't comparable, but if you enjoyed Myst or Riven there's a decent chance you'll enjoy this game.  I'd say it's a bit easier overall since, unlike either of those games, every single thing you can interact with is key to progressing in one way or another.			"

												First off:  MAJOR plot spoilers but no puzzle solutions.  That said, unless you subscribe to this specific theory, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of weight or emotional depth, at least from where I'm viewing it.  It's a silly game and that's absolutely fine.  I bought it because I wanted six or seven hours of mashing every single object I picked up into every single interactable location I came across, and it did indeed give me that, plus some rather ingenious brainteasers (triangle/circle lock puzzle, I'm looking at you).But.  Um.  So.  There's a weird thing about this.  I played this with a group of people, and we all found it rather silly, and some of the Moon Logic Puzzles are frustrating, but we cheated, because the point was to have fun, and we got about halfway through (I just finished it on my own).And.... about at the point where we discovered the main character's name was Umang and he looked like a white guy with a vacant stare, and that the ""Sacred Rings"" looked exactly like a gyroscopic physics toy, we collectively decided to stop taking the game seriously, and we made it our headcanon that he was, in fact, a patient at a mental hosptial, and the other characters were the doctors trying to help him, or other patients, and all these puzzles were little tasks they'd given him to help him reconnect with the physical world and keep him occupied, so he wouldn't hurt himself or others.  It kept the occasional non-intuituve answer from seeming pointless, and as time went by it got more and more fun to point out, you know, ""More evidence for the asylum theory!""They left off on the world of Knockoff Skyrim in the Clouds, and I kept going.  And I kept finding more and more places where the asylum theory fit.  The children left alone after their mother died.  The nonsensical way the puzzles and worlds are connected.  The way the Grain of Life connects to the Stardust.  The fact that everyone who helps you can only help to a certain extent, even though they are supposedly the masters of their realm - one even says, ""The rest you will need to do on your own.""  The way Umang is pushed over and over and over to journey to these lands, and the way he is eventually pushed to, quite literally, travel to an alternate reality.  And it makes his reaction to that all the more poignant.(The only wrench in this plan is the Generic Evil Guy (TM) who gloats over his sequel hook/plot device, but I'm ignoring that because it's literally the only thing that stops this interpretation from flying like a paper airplane straight into the back of the teacher's head.  And I haven't played the second one, or the third one if that exists yet, so I dunno, maybe I can make something up.)Let me put it this way.  On its own, this is a more or less stupid game with a hysterically funny plotline at best and a clunky, boring one at worst.  Whoever came up with the proper nouns in this game should be forced to redraw all the characters as though they actually come from the cultures in which their names originate - for instance, I don't know that many blond white guys from India, and yet Google tells me that is where the name Umang originates.  The graphics are as advertised: from 2007.  The music is on a loop that's not long enough, and the audio transitions and voice acting are about as smooth and skillfully executed as me getting up before noon on a Saturday.  At one point, if you fail to do several things in the correct order, you are treated to a blacksmith wearing some kind of flexible metal (?) staring at you/Umang with what appears to be unrepentant (though restrained) lust (??), and you are allowed to repeat this five-second cutscene as often as you like (???).  I turned all the sound off partway through and substituted in the Pacific Rim soundtrack, which by total chance played ""Mako"" at exactly the right moment to give the ending cutscene a beautiful, ethereal, almost transcendent feel.On the other hand. I love what I was able to make of this game.  I love that I can share it with everyone else, and that the narrative was free enough that this is a viable interpretation.  I love the puzzle solving and the fact that for the most part, there was a great balance between the amount of effort I exerted to solve the puzzles (at least, the ones I didn't peek on) and the cutscene, item, new area or plot detail I was rewarded with (this is definitely a game for people who like shiny things).Overall - if you'd like the game to carry itself and take itself seriously, don't play this, because it's not what you're looking for.  If you'd like to solve some puzzles and maybe laugh a little at the absurdity of what's going on, at least at face value, and then find meaning in your own interpretations - then this is perfect.  I wish you good night, good luck, and a good imagination.As for the accusations of this being a Myst knockoff... I've never played it, but thanks for the game recc!			"

												Not recommended. A poor adventure game in almost every way.Given the game's age, it looks decent but that's about it.I'll group the problems I had into three sections:#1 Story and LoreTo be short, there isn't any. Just the intro cutscene. There isn't nearly enough exposition, spoken or implied, to spur you to action, give any sense of urgency, or explain who's doing what and why.#2 WorldThe world(s) try to be all mystical and magical for the sake of being so and it doesn't really work. There are reasonable ideas for words but bits and pieces of plants or machinery are just scattered for visual clutter. The sounds effects/ ambiance work fine for each area but the music never seems to quite fit and, in some cases, completely undermines the tone of the area. The music during traveling cutscenes is particularly egregious.#3 Puzzles and GameplayJust bad. The game is trying to be a 360 view adventure game (Like Myst 3 or 4) but with an inventory. Which means that you have to item hunt in bubbles where you can only see an eighth of your current node. Madness!Node placement is strange and infuriating. To move towards a door, for example, you will have to back up and to the side first, even when there's nothing blocking your path. It doesn't help that the clickable area for a number of doors and doorways are offset or strangely small.The cursor helpfully lights up to let you know when you can click on something but this quickly shows that most nodes are empty.When the cursor does light up on something, there's a fifty/fifty chance that clicking will do anything. Interactions are annoyingly specific, with absolutely NO indication that you clicked ""wrong"". Sometimes you have to go do something else first. Clickable areas are sometimes practically hidden, either in a specific node or so close to similar areas that you can't tell one from another.The game's ambiance is too overbearing and routinely makes you think you triggered something in a puzzle when, wait no, nothing happened.The puzzles themselves are either manipulation puzzles (fine), ""fiddle with it and it works now"" puzzles (?), or use-a-clue puzzles. The last type are the most infuriating, both because of the issues outlined above and also many will completely lock you out of even manipulating the puzzle until you walk back and  ask a character for help. Uhg. One tool of a wizard even helps you with one puzzle, only to say, ""You must figure out the next part by yourself"". The puzzle is in his own house! To reiterate, avoid this poor excuse of an adventure game.			"

												This is a very good Myst clone combining sci-fi & fantasy environments.

												Aura: The Fate of Ages is a puzzle adventure in a 3D environment. Basically, you jump from one room to another finding clues or items to complete puzzles of different challenge with the rooms being pre-rendered, quite beautiful backgrounds to your current point of view which you can turn 360 degrees sideways and almost as much up and down.It took me some time to get into the mindset for the puzzles herein but once you found that the main obstacle is the own failure to find interactive pieces/ways in the rooms currently available.One such piece was an admittedly quite big leaf that I had to collect from a forest ground and couldn't for more than an hour. Another was a lever basically standing vertically with the player's point of view almost directly above it.Still the game is fun. I like that puzzles tended to discourage brute-forcing (with often more than a thousand combinations possible) and that, with the exception of two of them, I could think them through before solving them.Even though the graphics seem a bit dated I recommend the game for providing a few hours of challenging puzzles.

												I got the game because the screenshots reminded me of Myst 3 & 4 and I was hoping it was similar. It doesn't bother me that they cloned Myst's visual asthetic. They seem to have put a decent amount of effort into that. What bothers me is that that's ALL they seem to have put effort into. the NPC's speech has at best forced emotions and awkward dialogue, the plot is a forgetable mess, nobody has facial expressions, and more than a few of the puzzles are counter intuitive 'guide dang it' moments, (case in point; in the second area, you have to backtrack and ask an npc what the solution to a puzzle is, which you wouldn't think to do, cause you JUST spoke to him and there's no logical reason for him to have not already told you if he knew.)

												The best way I can describe this game is it seems to have been designed and written by someone who saw some screenshots of Myst, and then had someone give them a rough description of it and Adventure games in general. The puzzles are simplistic and don't seem to relate to the story progression, which is rudamentary, at best. While the Myst series has extensive backstory that's hinted at and expanded on throughout which gives you the sense that you're only seeing a brief snippet of a larger history (and the end of it, at that). Conversely this game briefly mentions a backstory and then doesn't expand on any of it. The voice acting is pretty terrible and NPC interaction felt very mechanical. Myst had the right idea in keeping NPC interactions to a bare minimum, the technology simply wasn't there to be able to do anything with it, but this game was released ELEVEN years after and, while Myst felt like it was a decade ahead of its time, Aura feels like it was released a decade too late.I was only able to get through to just past the statue scene seen in the sample screenshots above before I got bored. So perhaps it gets better after that, but I doubt it. There is a sequel, and even a third one on its way, so clearly some people like it.			"

												Although I did enjoy replaying this game, it was mostly due to nostagia. Yet, 2004 was not so far back in the days to accommodate this fellow adequately.  What I mean is that Aura is a cool game, but nothing more: it's slow, with illogical puzzles and unsatisfactory results.Another thing I find rather awkward is the fact that you get to see millions of things tht can help you solve an issue, but no... you need to use that specific piece of oddly coloured pixel from that other place far away from your current position. Otherwise, the game suffers from the common-maker syndrome: the way the makers think is too common. You get easy puzzles and illogically hard ones, because they couldn't think of a logically hard puzzles to insert, so they ""crafted"" odd ones.Dialogues are also unhepful, could be forsaken altogether.

The music is insipid and repetitive (the sound design on this was as a whole amateurish). The voice-acting is bad to the point of near-hilarity.

												I'll start by saying the Myst series is one of my favorites of all time. However, while this game more or less ganked stuff right out of the series, this did very little to reel me in. I got Riven vibes up the wazoo from the very first part of the game, right down to the soundtrack. There's really something just so beautifully nostalgic about that gonging bell sound. So I was optimistic going in and I honestly really enjoyed the first batch of puzzles a lot, even though I was immediately put off by the inclusion of 3D modeled people/NPCs. Liiiittle bit too uncanny valley. But then things kind of slid downhill for me from there, and rather than relishing the Myst series similarities, I started resenting them for not living up to the standard. It felt like Riven, Exile, and End of Ages were all mashed hopelessly together and created a little bit of an inconsistent mess. And the mysterious atmosphere was totally lost to the addition of a visible player character and relatively populated areas. I feel it would have benefited more by sticking to deserted locations with minor outside interaction, but that could just be a preference.Pros: -Nostalgic vibes-Nice soundtrack (one track in the beginning sounds straight out of an 80s fantasy movie and I LOVE it)-Good puzzles-Beautiful environmentsCons:-Unclear and contrived story. What lore we're given is rushed and unimportant, giving us nothing to use when we need to discern our next step.-Horrifying character models that really just don't hold up.-TERRIBLE voice acting. Like, truly just awful. -Certain things are complicated needlessly. You finally shake an item free of where it's lodged then are forced to find it where it fell on the floor, and it was absolutely hidden from you on purpose. Why. -Certain necessary items you need to pick up and use are not super visible or apparent so you can easily get stuck, which forces you to literally scour every inch of ground you've already walked just in case you missed something.-It is rarely made clear what you're supposed to do next after completing one line of puzzles since you're able to draw nothing from context. It gets particularly annoying in the Na-Tiexu section where the little orphan children are. At no point are you given instruction of any kind other than ""make the bird sing"" for which you are given no indication that you've done this successfully. -Super abrupt ending with elements that are confusing and make no sense, but that ties more in with Con #1The Rivenesque feel to things did count for a lot with me, Riven being my top favorite in the Myst series, but overall it wasn't enough to compensate for the negative points. At $4.99 you're certainly not breaking the bank buying this game, but even so, I'd still recommend you buy on sale if you buy at all.			"

At $4.99 you're certainly not breaking the bank buying this game, but even so, I'd still recommend you buy on sale if you buy at all.			"

												Ok, so, it's a Myst-ish game, a puzzle/escape/explore game where you navigate through a sequence of pre-rendered vistas (many of which you can pan around to give a semblance of 3d location). The characters are early 3d, the player character resembling an early attempt to 3d-ify the Avatar from the Ultima series.97% of the game involves looking at static objects and environment, though, which are mostly pretty.The puzzles are passable, and I manged to make it through much of the game without help. I did get stuck for a rather long time near the beginning because I missed the left-most view of the tables full of stuff in the house near the beginning.There is one puzzle in the third act that really made me mad, though. At one point where the path is blocked, on turning back you will see an item. It is the item you need, and is not held down by anything, but you can't pick this one up. You need to find or have already stumbled upon a different copy of the item in a different area. That copy of the item can only be found by turning to the side and looking down with no prompt to do so to find it in an area that you should have been able to see it from other locations in, but cannot.The plot is largely forgettable -- get all the pieces of the magic whatsit before the bad guy can -- and backed up by mediocre voice acting and characters with strange names I can't remember a few hours after playing. This is passable, if you're playing for the puzzles, except for the ending. I won't spoil it just in case someone cares, but I'll say that I actually expected a final area to play after the last cutscene and was kind of shocked when the credits rolled. Yeah, I can't really recommend this to anyone but the most masochistic puzzle-hound who's played every other game in the genre already.Oh, and you can't play it in anything but fullscreen of 800x600/1024x768, which makes multiple monitor people like me sad.

												The first two chapters and half of the third are 9/10. Interesting puzzles, beautiful graphic and good music. But the second part of the third chapter is ... I don't know how to name it - 0/10. No clues where to go and what to find. There is one item needed to complete the game, but it's absolutely impossible to find it, if you missed it before. And the planet puzzle isn't as good as others. It's a little incomprehensible even with the clues. I recommend this game, but make sure that you look at every corner on every screen in the third chapter.			"

												I bought this because it was dirt cheap and while Adventure Company games usually aren't amazing, they're pretty entertaining. I like the puzzle based games, but they're always better when there is at least a decent story line. The story in this is very weak and like other reviews I read, it's very much a Myst ripoff. There are NPCs in the game who give you hints, but they tell you a clue for how to complete a task and then sit dumbly by while you go to do something in an overly complicated manner (like two-part puzzle to open a door). After a number of hours, I wasn't sure what the goal of the game was anymore. When the game finally crashed after I solved something, I was done.			"

												""Typical"" puzzle adventure game where the puzzles are usually either easy to figure out or impossibly difficult because you did not spot a tiny item or hint in another place. Everything is done with mouse by clicking ""hotspots"", either the cursor goes bright telling there is something to interact or use an item at, or turns into arrow to allow moving to that direction. Some places and puzzles require moving around a lot and it becomes very tedious because the movement hotspot areas are at times quite small, so you need to face exactly to right direction, looking too much left, right, up, or down, and the click is in vain. The game took several hours to complete, mostly because of the slow animations that you need to wait and watch as the game won't allow any interaction during them, or because you get stuck with puzzles or the clunky movement.That's quite much negative things to say, but the game is all about the puzzles, with some story behind. If you like these kind of puzzling adventure games, you could try this game. Otherwise... maybe better not.			"

tl;drFantastic-devices in a fantastic-world.  4/10Ps & Cs+ Some clever puzzles- Devices and location trying so hard to be ""fantasy"" as to be indecipherableNitty GrittyI've heard lots of good things about this game as being a great Myst-like, so I was excited to jump in.  However, instead of a fully realized world full of mystery, you're treated to a ton of fantastical items that make no sense at all.  ""Oh, a ball on the ground.  Wait, that's not a ball, it's a triquantium discontimulator, obviously good for...something.""  Everywhere you walk, there's some strange Lovecraftian device looming over you.  ""Enter 11 gems, and align the planets to...lower the bridge.""  You couldn't look at anything any have the slightest clue as to what the device might be useful for.  At one point, I solved this huge machine puzzle to be granted access to a small piece of metal that does something to some other huge machine puzzle.

The aesthetic is bizzare and incoherant. The voice acting is dreadful. The worst part is the game's ""puzzles"". They mostly involve a very loose connection between colors and shapes and usually involve pixel hunting for the one little thing you need to combine in your inventory to make a magical whatsamawhozits to solve the puzzle. You literally cannot figure out some puzzles because they make no sense. No useful hints in game, just a lot of frustration. 0/10 Do not pay money for this.			"

												If you like awesome puzzles like those seen in Myst this game is for you. However it is lacking in any character development or the like but that is not what the game is about. It's about the challenge of solving puzzles that are solvable and this has plenty of those. My advice is to pay attention in the first world and after that you get the flavour for the puzzles as some of them are quite trying. I am currently in the second world and have been enyoying the puzzles immensely, however I am stuck on a doozy at the moment! I think I may even have to look up the solution as there are so many variables going on. It really is a pen to paper kind of game. Which I love playing! I hope there is a renaissance of this kind of game. The graphics are dated etc but still acceptable but at 5 bucks you will definitely get your money's worth if you like problem solving games.			"

Reminds me of those games in the old days on 320x240 (with interlacing?).Point and click are not really my thing, but it's really hard to navigate around because the exit points are sometimes in inlogical places.The voices of the characters sound to be recorded by a cheap microphone (with some cracking noises).The game crashes when you click multiple times too fast or plug in your headphones.The game has no autosave, so be sure to save after solving every puzzle.In the beginning puzzles didn't make any sense so I had to cheat to find the solution. There are some great puzzles in the game, but I could not solve some on my own.Graphics: Very badMusic: badPuzzles: Some good onesFor the average gamer I do not recommend this game. Unless you are very patient, a good puzzle solver or really looking into the story of this game you might want to check it out (I'm only interested in the good puzzles and storyline).			"

												From the fact that the movement is slow and choppy and the whole limited movement in the first place to the whole not even being able to have an inspect option on the numerous uninteractable important looking things and the poorly placed interaction points (the middle of a set of scales rather than the weight part? Seriously?) This game is a letdown in every aspect.I'm sure some will try arguing ""hey this game is ten plus years old"" Guess what so are fable and postal 2, Planescape: Torment is even older and all thos games have much more complex interaction systems and more stuff actually using memory so arguing the age of the game is pointless since it could have been done much better even then.I would argue it would have come across a lot better being made more in the style of monkey island 1 which was a lot smoother a lot older and a hell of a lot more fun to play, Crash Time II is more worthy of time and money and you've seen what people have said about it (actually the failiures of that game are actually funny and the gameplay is fun to screw around with for long enough to justify buying it).If you're after good point and click adventure games on steam check out the catalog of games Daedalic Entertainment have, literally ever one of them is entertaining and worth putting the money towards if you can afford to.

												+ The game looks great with nice models and graphic from videos etc, but that's it.- The game does not support 1920x1080 resolution or wide screen ratio and no windowed mode is available so it is stretched.- As the picture is stretched the control is much harder (With deformed perspective puzzle with forks is just impossible).- The controls do suck a big time. Depite the game looks 3D there are rather small clickable areas where you can move to next point without any transition animation (There is one but that one has nauseating way of movement). Imagine google photo sphere where you can move to other spheres by clicking in some places.- Active areas are small and there is no hint how to find them and the work only from specific points despite being in reach.- Most of the time you are lost what to do, puzzles often do not make any sense.- NPCs does not react to you at all when not in proper part of the quest.- NPCs might stop interaction in the middle of the quest without any hint if you did not do things in the order that developers intended.- No feedback / dialog with NPCs when quest is done.- Look from farther distance shows puzzle in different state than it is from close.- The location and use of frickin' leaf. - The faces are ugly.Would NOT recommend if you do not like playing step-by-step using walkthrough.What should have been done differently to make the game not suck so hard:- More journal records with current goals described.- Arrows/markers on the screen showing transition areas.- Animated transition between screens.- Hint key that will highlight active items/areas on the screen.- Better (idle / quest end) dialogues with NPCs.- Windowed mode.If you want great old adventure, try Atlantis instead.

												This  review is still early impressions. If I ever get the nerve to finish this then I will edit it with end game impressions.At first glance this is a Myst clone. No doubt about that.  But the differance between Aura and a good adventure game like Myst is that there is immersion and substance to what you're doing and why.  Aura gives you a brief introduction then plops you into its world with no idea what you're supposed to do.  It's another 360 degree panoramic adventure game like Myst III and IV and there's nothing wrong with that.  Where Aura gets it wrong is that there is no logic to some of the puzzles. They're just there for the sake of a puzzle to impede your progress.  There is no dialogue besides the introduction. No lore explaining anything besides the introduction.  You have a desire to get the rings of destiny or some such but while in the game you really don't know why you're doing certain things becasue nothing is explained.  The game does give you hints in the form of a journal which gives you a very 'basic' understanding of how to proceed.  The immersion factor is Aura's biggest weakness.  The background music is just awful. It's a mixture of metal and synthesizers.  For a fantasy adventure game it doesn't fit AT ALL.  For 5 bucks I guess this is worth a buy...only if you're  fan of Myst.  But good luck trying to get immersed in Aura's world.  I didn't enjoy it at all.			"

A big hint to save you hours of searching- pick up the leaf in the world with the spirits. There's a lot of backtracking, which I dislike and the acting is god awful but if you can grab it on sale or part of a bundle (which I did) then it's worth the 8 or so hours to beat. It does leave on a cliff hanger and the sequel currently is not on steam so that's kind of a bummer.			"
