												Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster with some great puzzle-platforming.The game manages to deliver so much emotion even though the characters speak a completely made up language akin to The Sims.Clocking in at about 3 hours it is indeed short but you will not feel cheated as the game packs a lasting impact that few story driven experiences manages to pull off.Pure genious story telling.

												People that have played Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons usually fall into two groups. The first group of people looked at the glowing reviews that this game received, tried it, then found it stupendously overhyped and underwhelming. Then, there’s the other group, who found the game to be perfect. I am glad to say that I belong to the latter party.The late great film critic Roger Ebert once said that videogames can never be art, a controversial statement at best and blatantly offensive and wrong at worst. With that said, we’re going to have to forgive Mr. Ebert, because a)He was great at what he did, and b) He never got the chance to experience Brothers: A Tale of two Sons.Story:You play as two brothers who are sent off on a journey to find a cure for their father’s ailment. You, as the player, are tasked to guide the two brothers through multiple trials and tribulations throughout a variety of beautiful and mystifying locations. Along the way, you will encounter numerous characters, many of which are heavily inspired from classic fairytales and fantasy mythology. There is so much more to talk about here, but once again, this is something you really need to experience yourself. You really will get more out of this game if you go in mostly blind.It’s worth noting that the game is completely dialogue-free. No, I don’t mean that the game merely lacks voice acting. I mean that there is essentially no actual dialogue – voice or text, in the game at all. Sort of. The characters technically do talk, but in a fantasy language without translation. Instead, the story and interactions are told through beautifully-animated gestures and changes in tone and inflections. Despite this, there is never any ambiguity about what’s happening on-screen, and somehow, the game manages to weave a heartfelt story that, at times, can truly invoke a heavy feeling in the chest. Gameplay:Brothers is a story-driven adventure/puzzle game with a novel control scheme. Each brother is mapped to a single stick on the controller. The left and right stick/shoulder buttons control the older and younger brother, respectively. It’s a unique control scheme for sure, in the sense that this game looks like a co-op game for two players, but is actually a single player game, intended to be played on the same controller. The challenge in the game is largely dependent on the player’s ability to co-ordinate both characters at once. The ambidextrous be warned – this game will probably offer you very little challenge.It’s worth pointing out at this point that contrary to what the text in the orange box says on the store page on Steam, a controller is not required to play the game. The game will work fine using a keyboard, and you’ll be more than able to progress to the end of the game without a controller. With that said, a controller is strongly recommended for this game.For the combat-oriented players – sorry, but this game is completely combat-free. Instead, the game largely involves puzzles comprised of environmental interactions and exploration. Each brother has their own perks. The older, taller and stronger brother is able to reach heights, boost the younger brother, push levers and swim, whilst the younger brother can fit into smaller spaces. Unfortunately, delving into more of the interactions between the two brothers would spoil the game for you.The game is never overly challenging or frustrating. OOT Water Temple this is not. Puzzles are, for the most part, fairly straightforward, but are often challenging enough to invoke a sense of satisfaction when you do overcome them.  Death can and likely will occur, but checkpoints are frequent, sparing you from repeating the same segments repeatedly. One of my only gripes, gameplay-wise, was the repetition of some of the puzzles. Using the big brother to boost the little brother up to a ledge got very old very quickly. With that said, even the puzzles that are solved the same way are often presented in a different setting, with a different outcome, which helps to keep them fresh.My only other ""criticism"" is that this game is short and lacks any compelling reason to go back to it after you’re finished. This is, unfortunately, a consequence of any game that is primarily narrative-driven.  The game does support achievements, but these involve optional, easily-missed activities in the game, and are neither challenging or particularly satisfying to obtain. Presentation:This game is beautiful. Not the realistic kind of beautiful that we’d expect from AAA games such as … The Watch Dogs E3 trailer, but appropriately beautiful. You would not want to play this game and have it look like anything other than what it looks like. The world that Brothers takes place in is strikingly magnificent. The town you begin your journey in is vibrant and colourful, whilst later settings are often appropriately darker and harsher. The shadowing and lighting in this game also look tremendous. The most impressive aspect of the graphics however, is the incredible work that was done to illustrate the enormous scale of the game. No matter where you are, there is always a lot going on in the background, making you feel incredibly small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things – something that will be very familiar to those that have played the God of War series, or the critically acclaimed Shadow of the Colossus. Moving to new locations was often breathtaking, although each individual is area is so gorgeous on its own that it's hard to move on.This, of course, was no accident. The game was clearly deliberately designed to immerse you in the environment, and allows you to interact with almost everything, despite the fact that this is completely optional and you are not awarded with anything other than the short animation that accompanies your action. In other words, the game doesn’t force you, or even encourage you (from a gameplay perspective) to sit on a bench in town and really take in the gorgeous scenery, but you, the player, will want to anyway. The music and sounds also complement the game perfectly, and contribute immensely to the emotional impact of the game. I’ve honestly listened to the music numerous times since finishing the game, and all the emotions I experienced from the game just come rushing back. I honestly can’t fault a single thing about the audio in this game, as I feel that it perfectly complements both the emotions and the atmosphere that are conveyed. Overall thoughts:In case it wasn’t obvious, I loved Brothers. There is very little about the game that I can fault. With that said, I’ll admit it’s not for everybody. The game is very narrative-driven and requires a heavy emotional investment – something that not every gamer is prepared to, capable, or willing to do. It’s worth noting that this game could very well have been another To The Moon, or Gone Home – games which I personally loved, and are very story/emotionally-driven, but lack any real gameplay, closely flirting with the definition of what a “Game” truly is. No one played either of those two games and said “Wow, that was fun”, because plain and simple, the gameplay in those two games are complete garbage. Brothers, however, manages to capture the same kind of narrative and emotion (and arguably exceeds them both) without compromising on the gameplay. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that this is, in fact, a game. That is the true magic of Brothers.			"

												It's been a while since I played a game that's this lovingly crafted and that felt like it came from such a strong emotional space that exudes throughout the entire journey. Brothers is a game that deals with many different themes, some fantastical in nature, and tackles them head on and with a touch of nuance. It's also a very charming game that overcomes any technical limitation through great art direction.Its basic concept of controlling the older brother on the left analog stick and the younger brother on the right is one that may turn off some at first but truly comes into its own as the game progresses with a thematic payoff unlike anything I've ever seen in a game before. Brothers also has excellent pacing that carries over into its puzzles. They are simple yet I never felt like they were braindead easy. They're always fresh in some way and play off of mechanics I learned before without ever showing a tutorial on screen outside of the beginning chapter.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was an excellently developed puzzle platformer that wasn't afraid to go to some dark places but also knew when to highlight a truly joyous moment. And this was all through gameplay. These special moments or sections were rarely shown through cutscenes only. It wants you to experience these parts through gameplay as much as possible, and it very much succeeds at that. But it's a climactic moment near the end that truly brings that idea home. A moment so brilliant and emotionally resonant to me that it'd be a shame if people missed out on this because we're on the cusp of a new console generation transition. Don't pass this game up. It begs to be played.			"

												Wonderful game! The story is really deep and fascinating! It's a sweet tale about two brothers who must make a long journey in a fantastic strange world in order to find a magical medicine to heal their father.As a tale, you'll meet all kind of wonderful creatues, some will help you, some will try to stop you. The gameplay is very original too. You'll control two characters at the same time : right joystick for the young brother, left joystick for the big one (using a controller). It works with keyboard/mouse as well. Achievements are easy to get as long as you're curious enough to explore and make everything ;-)Brothers are obviously allied with one another and you'll share their story with passion for sure :) Sweetness,deep feelings,great adventure,amazing characters,beautiful world to explore : it's a sweet tale you'll have to enjoy!10/10			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Atmospheric; Innovative; Adventure; Avant-Garde; Casual My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-5 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Novelty seekers; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Avant-garde enthusiasts; Casual gamersREVIEWBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a splendidly innovative, little game with pleasing aesthetics and a touching narrative that is sure to amuse nearly any gamer.  This game is a quintessential example of the avant-garde in gaming.  Perfectly crafted single-player co-op is now a reality as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons will have you controlling two characters simultaneously (by using the dual joysticks of modern controllers) as you embark on a short, but heartfelt, adventure.The game plays as an adventure-puzzler game.  You will have to control both of your characters simultaneously and use their different strengths and abilities in tandem to solve the various puzzles you encounter on your adventure.  It really is quite an experience and there were several times where I could actually feel my brain get crossed-up as I tried to control both characters at once.  This is definitely the kind of game that exercises your brain.  I would say this mechanic alone would make the game worth playing, even if the other aspects were poor.  Fortunately, pretty much all the other aspects of the game are first-rate as well. Supplementing the innovative mechanics at the core of the game are the elegant graphics, pleasing soundscape, and overall charming atmosphere.  There are some really varied and well-crafted areas to traverse as you play through the story.  More than just looking different, the various areas of the game feel different—  and each add their own twist to the gameplay.The game is ultimately a story-driven experience.  That story is simple, but told well— evoking empathy.  The levels, while gorgeous, are quite linear; and the puzzles, while innovative, are quite simple.  And those factors only serve to contribute to the brevity of the game.  Most people should be able to complete the game in 3 to 4 hours; it is the kind of thing that can (and probably should) be done in one immersive sitting.  It is the definition of “short-and-sweet.”Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one of those games I would say basically everyone will enjoy. Even if you don’t really play games that much, or are someone who only plays a specific genre very different from this, I still must implore you to play this game.  It is very well-crafted, delightfully innovative, and short enough that it is worth anyone’s time to experience.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												This game ... ohh man this game.I can not say too much about this title because this is a game that just must be experienced. It is a short title (I clocked in at about 3 hours when I finished it and I was pacing myself) but is it ever worth the pricetag. Beautiful visuals and story told without any real dialogue hits you hard. It is undoubtedly a must buy in my book, but keep in mind you will need something like a 360 game pad or eqivalent to play this game properly.			"

												This game shows, says, and impacts you more in its 3 hour duration than nearly any other game can do in 100 or more.Video game story-telling reaches its pinacle in this game. The gameplay, pacing, enviornment, and gibberish-spewing characters all coalesse into a game that makes you feel happiness, frivolity, intensity, melancholly, dismay, suspense, terror, and most overbearingly, that motley mix of pride and deep sadness at the game's end.Beautiful visuals: artistic and technical.

												“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is an indie puzzle storytelling game done right. It showed us, that how immensely powerful a video game can be, when its game-play and story complements each other so perfectly.The world is detailed, charming and vibrant, and despite its story being only 3-4 hours long, it takes you through a multitude of environments, every chapter feels fresh, compelling and interesting, and filled with mini side-quests that reward you with achievements and extra contents.The controls for “Brothers” is pretty unique, you simultaneously control two individual characters to solve interesting, varied puzzles in order to progress through the level, on a quest to search for the water of life to save their father. The puzzles themselves are well thought out and doesn’t outstay its welcome, and despite having strange control scheme, I can safely say it works extremely well a Controller and I personally had no problems with it whatsoever.The story is what makes Brothers so brilliant, it immerses you into the world almost immediately, during my short but wonderful play-though I've experienced happiness, fear, wanderlust, compassion and profound sadness. I really think that no other means of media can really replicate such a mesmerising experience, it successfully told me a coherent, fulfilling and mature story without the characters saying single word, but solely relies on pure interactive game-play.“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is incredible, and a game that you don’t want to miss, I had a truly unforgettable experience and I think you will too. Don’t watch a game-play video on the internet, but experience this little gem yourself, you will not regret it.			"

												This game is really good.The controls - while it can be difficult to get used to, after a while it just starts to feel like second nature.  Each thumbstick (left and right) on the controller controls one of the two brothers, and each matching trigger is that brother's ""action"" button.   While this game would be incredibly easy if it were played with two people (each with one controller), it becomes an interesting and rewarding mental exercise trying to control both characters yourself.The story - also very good.  The characters don't speak (really) but talk in a kind of ""Sim-ish"" language.  The developers put a lot of effort into portraying the characters through their body language and tone rather than speech directly.  The game takes place in a world that could best be described as a ""grimm-style"" fairy tale.Difficulty - although you can die, the game is super generous with it's checkpoints, so it would be difficult to get frustrated with the game.  The main focus here is on solving puzzles and some light platforming.Achievements - another interesting idea well executed here.  None of the game's 12 achievements will be unlocked during normal game play.  Every single one of them is optional, and rewards the player for ""going off the beaten path"" and/or doing something interesting in the game.  For best results, don't play through with a cheat guide.  These are best discovered on your own.Length - I played for a little over an hour and got to the third section of the game, which I believe is almost half way maybe?  HowLongToBeat says the game should take between 3-4 hours to complete.Bottom line - buy this game.			"

												Brothers is an adventure game where you play as two Brothers on the search for a remedy for their ailing father. Brothers was recommended highly to me by colleagues, and I went into it with a fresh mind, knowing nothing about it. While the game is great on many levels (which I'll come to), I feel that the renound it has is purely based on the gimmicky control system. This isn't me being negative or insulting, it's just fact, the controls of the Brothers is pure gimmick. But, it works quite well! (<exclamation point, doesn't show on Steam reviews :|)Other than the controls, I didn't really feel the game set itself out as as much of a stupendous game as I'd been led to believe; certainly not Game of the Year, which I heard some had elected it to be.I fully completed the game within 5 hours and did indeed enjoy the story. The graphics, at times, were mindblowing, and are definitely this title's strongest point. It's weakest feature, however, I feel, is the lack of language from the characters. There's a certain charm listening to the almost Simlish talk from the characters, but ultimately it dissociates you from the characters, being unable to fully understand them, and unable to fully connect with them.When you do connect, it's on a base level of emotion, and has almost no base in logic or drive, just raw emotion. Which, at times is more than enough to push the game forward, but at others leave you with a feeling of pointless energy, ""I guess we just go forward then?"" for no real reason.The game is really fun and definitely something everyone should experience, but it is by no means one of the greatest games I've played. I had a super time with it, and found it very cost-worthy at it's price, and would recommend it to all.Nilesy			"

Not only does this game run way better on my Personal Computer, but it works like a charm with smoother edges and sharper textures, giving this piece of art even more pushing power with stunning visuals and exemplary mechanical decisions.Note: You DO NOT need a controller for this game, but it is recommended, as it states on the Store-page.

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Brothers A Tale of Two Sons 

			Views: 2,161		

			Trent explains why, despite it's idiotic title, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons was one of our top 10 games of 2013. Written and edited by Trent Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay,...		

	While Starbreeze has enjoyed acclaim from it's previous releases, the studio hasn't exactly built it's reputation on creating whimsical worlds with moving narratives. Both Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness gave their players dark and gritty worlds to explore and some unique gameplay twists to hook players. With such a pedigree Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons stands out as being wholly against type. It's the video game equivalent of Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, stepping away from subject matter reserved for mature audiences to deliver a memorable experience that can be enjoyed by audiences both young and old. While seemingly stepping out of the comfort zone established by their track record, Brothers stands out as one of 2013's best, and most surprising, releases.  While the setting and tone of Brothers is a departure from Starbreeze's previous titles, they have maintained their fine tradition of offering refreshing gameplay mechanics. Each brother's ability to move is mapped to a joystick and each trigger acts as an interaction button for the corresponding brother. While some games have you changing between multiple characters to solve puzzles, Brothers allows you to control both characters simultaneously reducing the tedium of having to switch between characters or deliver commands to AI companions. Initially, this control setup may seem a bit clumsy but after taking a few moments to acclimate yourself to the setup it becomes natural. The brothers will face numerous challenges and all of them can be overcome with a bit of teamwork. Having the older, stronger brother boost his young sibling up to high ledges so that he can drop a rope is a small example in a long list of ways in which the boys can join forces to overcome the obstacles in their way. Starbreeze deserves high praise for finding so many unique ways to test players and make the most of the brother's teamwork. This is a major reason that A Tale of Two Sons succeeds. Throughout the three hour game, players will shift the brother's weight to steer a glider, use a rope that tethers the boys together to swing to far away ledges, distract a pesky dog with one brother so that the other brother can pass through an area safely and so on. In spite of how many different challenges players will face, it's not difficult to figure out what to do next. Unfortunately, this reprieve from frustration is complicated by a nasty side effect: Brothers is way too easy. Most players will feel completely untested by the puzzles and proceed almost entirely unopposed. While it's ease means most players may not recall any of the specific challenges that make up Brother's campaign after completing it, they will almost undoubtedly remember the game's tone and narrative. The plot is simple, the boy's father falls ill and after taking him to the town doctor they are told to go in search of a cure. This is a terrible blow to the brothers since they have already lost their mother after she drowned; the younger brother in particular is scarred by her loss as he witnessed her struggle before she succumbed to the depths. Their willingness to undertake such a perilous journey is indicative how important it is to them not to loose anyone else with grief and loss becoming a central theme. While the plot is simple, it benefits from the fact that it's telling forgoes the use of dialogue. The characters speak in a made up unsubtitled language allowing players to hone in on the their inflections and gestures. This emphasis on feeling rather than exposition allows the events to soak in without being burdened by anything superfluous or disruptive to the experience. Further enriching the experience is the fact that dozens of objects and people can be interacted with that are wholly non-essential to progressing in the game and each brother interacts with these people or objects differently. The younger brother comes off as quite ornery and mischievous while his big brother is a well behaved and serious. Discovering these traits instead of having them force fed to players is far more rewarding.  Rounding out Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons as more of an experience than simply a game is it's stunning art direction and score. The fantasy world in A Tale of Two Sons is rendered in bright colors and it's texture work has an almost hand-painted quality. The home of the title characters is on the coast, near a sleepy village. This humble setting gradually gives way to more wondrous settings with picturesque mountain ranges, crystal clear bodies of water and vertigo inducing cliff sides. The studio relishes the game's aesthetics by placing benches around the world that the boys can sit on, allowing the camera to zoom in and create a post card worthy view of the game world. The colorful Disney-esque landscapes do eventually give way to some areas that have darker motifs adding a bit of gravity to the boys' trek as well as giving the world a story of it's own. While the environments are fantastic but the boys can appear a bit bland with their cartoon character skin textures and average NPC villager outerwear.  The soundtrack is haunting and nuanced, giving the proceedings a bit of dramatic flair without being too intrusive or overbearing. The somber flutes, strings and chanting that make up the bulk of what tickles player's ear drums has a unique sonic signature that adds a layer of personality to a game that, due to it's fantasy setting, has some derivative subject matter.  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons may very well be this generation's Ico. It's seems that the Playstation 2's companion based cult classic was an inspiration for Starbreeze's game. Emphasizing emotion over raw exposition and dialogue, A Tale of Two Sons carves a space in players memories to reside long term. The plethora of puzzles prevents players from feeling burdened by tedious and stale routines and some darker moments later in the game remind players of the seriousness of their quest lest they get lost in the game's stunning, fantasy world. Were it more challenging, Brothers could have provided an almost flawless experience. While the gameplay may not give you a sense of accomplishment, the narrative payoff is significant enough to make A Tale of Two Sons a mandatory buy for any serious gamer.			"

												I don't know what should I tell about this game that wasn't already told.You control the two brothers with a controller's two bumpers, or with wasd + arrows. Despite the game states that it requires a controller to play, it actually works fine with keyboard.The game is just wonderful, and keeps you at the edge of the seat - there's only a few sections where timing counts, most of the time you can keep your own pace, but as you'll pass hills, caverns, mountains there's always something to concentrate on. Most of the time it's the brand new ideas the game presents - the store's screenshots are from the game's first  (maybe) 2 chapters, most of the game's content is pretty different and presents you with new experiences. You always have to pay attention to the movement if you're playing alone, but it's not overbearing, and it doesn't require pinpoint accuracy. The biggest challenge of the game is to not to mix up your two hands and which one controls witch brother :)  While all you have is direction keys and an action button, this game is nowhere near an average walking simulator. The landscape goes though incredible changes as you progress, and you have various means of transportation that are both unique and makes excellent use of the game's control scheme.This game is a beautiful, albeit short journey which in turn has absolutely minimal downtime. It's a great purchase or it makes an excellent gift for anyone who's willing to try out the game's controls and loves traditional tales, as the game takes place in a similar world.  The game contains darker tones, it's not really a kid-friendly game - the Teen rating is fitting in my opinion.			"

												I heard a lot of good things about Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and I'm so happy that is all true.The story, at least in the beginning, don't seems nothing spectacular but the journey is beautiful and brilliant. Everyone in the game speaks some weird language, but as you get to know both of the brothers you will have a great time playing and interacting with everything and everyone in your way.The gameplay is very different of any other game, but is pretty nice once you get used to it. The control itself is pretty simple, one button to do any action that is needed, but happily there is a lot of situations to explore this system and all of them is brilliant. You control both of the brothers at the same time and in some parts you will face challenges to do two different things using both of them to progress in the story.The visual and the art direction is awesome beautiful. I can't describe how mesmerising is to see (and play) many parts of the game. The music is also incredible, it brings you into the heart of the game. Sometimes you will feel like the brothers are feeling, sometimes it will push you up like if you were invincible. It will bring joy making you smile, but it will also brings you down. It connects you in the universe in a very strong way.Unfortunately there is some negative points: the story is pretty short, about 3 hours of gameplay and that's it. Even the achievements are pretty easy to get after you complete the game and won't make you play more. The game does support keyboard (using the arrows, W,A,S,D, right control and spacebar), although I imagine the experience will not be that nice because the controls are unusual. I didn't test play using the keyboard, but that must be the reason Steam has an alert that says it requires a controller to play.After all that, I'm glad to say that Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a very unique game and will give you an awesome experience. You must play it, or better yet, you must experience it. Now.[Update on 07/01/2014] - Thanks to DrSpoonbender for commenting and let me know about the keyboard support :)			"

Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure game where you must travel around to find help for your sick father.  You and your brother have to find a way to save him before it is too late.  As you travel, you have small puzzles you must solve, and you will use your controller to move both of the brothers more or less at the same time.  Each can be moved, and each has an action button.  Figuring out when to do what is the key to progressing as you enter various situations.I got a little bit confused from time to time on directions or which brother needed to interact and when, but it's not anything that will cause much problem.  I like the relaxing overall feeling of the game, and the emotional quality of the story was really great to experience.  It is simple, but has a lot of depth in how it delivers all of that simplicity it features.ProsThe graphics in this game are really nice.  I like the style and I also like the various environments you enter as you move from place to place.  Everything is quite immersive and has a great overall feeling attached to it.  There are also benches you can sit at, and take a view of the surrounding environment in, if you so choose.  The simplicity of having movement and a single action for each character is also refreshing.  This is not a usual thing for me, that I can recall, while playing games like this.  I was not really sure what to expect starting out, but it really works out great, and the design of the game around this is also done very well to complement this idea.The music and sounds are light.  They are not offensive or overly annoying, which I find can happen with some games if they are overdone, or too strongly done.  On default settings, they fit well, and I like the tracks and the lightness of the feeling they portray while I play the game.The action/interact buttons are fun to use, and in some situations you can mess with various things in your environment.  The boys will occasionally get into mischief in town, for instance.  There are some nice little combinations of things you can do to create funny scenes as they cause trouble for people around them, or just randomly interact with the environment.  There are a lot of different interactions used as you move from place to place, and it keeps things interesting.Characters and creatures you meet along the way are a real plus, and I found this enjoyable.  There is no true language, as far as I can tell, so you have to pay attention to gestures, or use your own interpretation of what they mean.  Sometimes one brother will point to areas of interest, and it's pretty straightforward for the most part on what is going on.  I like it, and I think it adds to the overall feeling and style of the game.The story, and the progression as you move from area to area is done well.  I especially like the emotional quality that comes forth once you reach a certain point.On the one hand I really like this, and I definitely favor it in comparison to what I dislike about it, since it is smoothly done as you transition, but I would have liked a tiny bit of backstory to understand why everything is happening as it is happening.  I think this would be hard to do with the style without something before the prologue, since one must interpret everything going on, rather than read text, or listen to spoken language.ConsShort, and I would have liked to enjoy a little bit more.  I also tend to play longer games in general, so it's not a bad thing being short.  If a game is well done throughout, then the length does not matter.  Some may prefer a shorter experience if they want to get through a game in a reasonable amount of time, instead of it taking tens or hundreds of hours to complete all a game has to offer.Very linear as a result of being short, but at the same time the story is still very engaging, and may be preferable to some people.  I like a little more going on overall with extras, but the simplicity is a strong point as well with this game.  I would have liked to have a little more little bonus interactions along the way, or just a few more general side things.The story at first left me slightly unsure exactly what was going on, though you can tell to a certain extent.  I would have liked to have a bit more clarity on the opening bits, but in general this wasn't too much of a gripe.  ConclusionThis is a real gem that I think almost anyone would really enjoy playing, especially if you like more indie adventure style games, or want to play a solid game that does not take too long overall to finish.  There is something to say about the simplicity which makes the game very endearing, in my opinion.  Many times less is in fact more, and this game definitely brings that point home.  Everything in the game is done with care, and the entire creative work is really impressive.  It's not the best this or the best that, but what it does do, it does extremely well.The story, and your quest along the way to complete it, is a powerful force in this game.  I would highly recommend this to anybody that likes something story-driven, while being not too complex, and hammering home everything it does do quite well.  It is hard to argue with the many many positive reviews this game has received.  After playing through, I can emphatically understand why.			"

												Brilliant game!The gameplay feels great, it is emotional, touching and looks and sounds pretty nice. A small but beautiful fairy tale.You'll play as two brothers, an older and a younger one, on their quest for a cure to their sick father.Both are controlled via the analog-sticks on the controller. You can control them separately and move them around independently, which is also needed for a lot of the puzzles throughout the game, but it is not as hard as it might sound (imho).You will encounter some obstacles on your journey which you need to overcome, e.g. you are tied together with a rope and you need to climb a tower. While one brother hangs on a ledge, the other one swings to another ledge, now hanging there to let the other brother swing to the platform you need to climb.Both have also different ""abilitys"": The older brother is capable of lifting the younger one onto higher platforms, he wouldn't be able to climb otherwise, while the younger one can slip through small passages.The artstyle and visuals are very beautiful and the sound adds a lot of emotion to it.Highly recommended!

												I got Brothers after it was highly recommended by many friends of mine who had previously played it. This meant I went into the game with high expectations.After around 15-20 minutes in the game, I was getting bored and considering giving up on the game. I found the little brother to be quite annoying and the story had not hooked me. The one thing that I did like, was the beautiful artwork. A few minutes later any feelings of boredom had vanished, I was getting pulled into the story and started to enjoy the brothers' adventure. I still found the younger brothers childishness to be slightly irritating, and would not have said no if I could give him a clip 'round the earhole from the big brother (and really, more games should allow light abuse of siblings).After it's slow start, the story had captivated me completely and I played through until the end. I relished in the brothers' achievements and took great pride with every person they assisted. The artwork is rather grand, and there is pretty scenes to be seen across the game.Overall the game lived up to the hype, and it was a truly pleasurable experience. I look forward to another game set in this world, as playing Brothers has left me wanting to know more about the world.			"

												Beautiful, touching, magical and moving.This is an adventure game like no other. You control two brother at same time which is way interesting then your regular game that you only control one character. There are so many things u can do to work together and solve every situation that's thrown at you. You fly with a glider, ride a boat, mount a bird, and slide on a tree.You defeat ogre, invisible frost giant, wolves and other dangerous enemy.You travel though a battle field of giant, huge ruined castle, graveyard at night, magical tree of life, and snow covered icebergs.You meet friends and foe, experience love and betrayal, teamwork and conflict, happiness and sadness. Life goes on…Graphics, Music, plots, puzzle are all very well done. Achievements are fun to get and not that hard to do.I will deduct 1 point for the tears it gave me and this game ends with a solid 9/10. Everyone that read this and never played this game is missing a lot. Install, play and experience this short 2 hours adventure game. PS: on my store page it said this game require a controler to play. But you can play it with keyboard just fine.			"

Brothers is a deceptively simple puzzle platformer that has quite a bit going on under the covers. Its story is told almost entirely wordlessly, with a lot of little side excursions that paint a world of fairytales that is actually quite dark. Don't let the bright graphics and cartoony characters fool you -- while there are some funny and uplifting moments, this is not a feel good game. It's not deliberately out to depress you either, but it's more brothers Grimm than brothers Warner. I'm not saying you shouldn't let your kids play it, but I am saying you may want to look over their shoulder if they do.Believe it or not, this is the game I bought a controller for. I borrowed one to see if the game was any good (it was) and then I completed it after buying one for myself. It's not easy to convince a hardcore mouse and keyboard guy to twiddle the sticks, so it deserves credit at least for that. It deserves some more credit for possibly being the very first game to use its control scheme to evoke an emotional response. I can't get into details (spoilers!) but you'll know it when you get there. It's beautifully done, and you'd need to have a heart of stone not to be at least a little bit affected. If you remember ""press F to pay respects"", this is pretty much the exact opposite of that.The gameplay is just about right. It's not very challenging, but it's not a cakewalk between cutscenes either. The game does make the most of its controls, and coordinating two characters requires your full attention. Liberal use of checkpoints means you're not likely to get frustrated from having to replay bits, though. If the game was much longer the mechanics might wear thin, but its length works to its advantage here. My only gripe, if I can have one, is that one or two achievements are almost impossible to obtain without a guide, not because they require skill but because they require some very unintuitive actions. Still, this in no way detracts from the experience on your first playthrough, and the game allows you to replay chapters at will, so those who want the achievements can get them easily enough.Whether you want to pay the full $15 for 4-5 hours of game is up to you, but even if you want to wait for a sale (or another bundle), this deserves to be in your library at some point or another. Two thumbs up, one big and one little.			"

An exquisite journey from start to finish.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure game about two brothers that try to aid their dying father.  With their father's demise on the horizon they set out on a quest to find the ""water of life"", a mysterious liquid with healing qualities.  With no choices left they embark on a journey they won't soon forget.GameplayBrothers is an adventure game with some modest puzzle solving.  The puzzles are fairly simplistic in nature so adventuring is the primary focus.  You will, of course, need teamwork by using the two brothers in tandem and sometimes apart.  The environment is often times treacherous and will require using both brothers in various ways to progress.GraphicsThe graphics in Brothers are absolutely gorgeous.  They are colorful, vibrant, and imaginative and they bring the fairy tale scenery to realization.  You will ascent rolling hilltops and mountains and explore the depths of dank caves.  You will explore a creepy, sinister forest that will lead into a calm, tranquil valley; there is good variety and contrast in all of the distinct areas.Controls (a controller is recommended for this game)In Brothers you control two characters simultaneously.  At first I was distressed at the thought but the game quickly put my thoughts at ease.  Each brother is easy to control and I never had any issues whatsoever.  Controlling the two brothers at the same time was effortless; it was easy to manage them and make them do precisely what I wanted.SoundThe music in Brothers is clever and accents the scene.  In dire situations where dangers are about the music is quite moody.  When it's more slow-paced the music is serene.  The sound effects are well done and help pull you into the wonderful atmosphere.OverallBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a must play for any gamer with a controller.  It's is a very short game but also a very memorable one; the game is a great price for it's length.  Do not hesitiate to buy this near perfect game.Score1 = Hated it2 = Disliked it3 = Liked it4 = Really liked it(5 = Loved it)If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Orginal Curators Group "

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons tells the story of two boys who have already struggled with the loss of their mother, and are now faced with the reality of a sick and dying father. The village doctor expresses to them that they must travel to a special tree where they can retrieve what is needed to cure him. The journey takes the brothers through bright, beautiful landscapes meeting both friend and foe along the way.Any words spoken in this title are not words at all. It’s gibberish not unlike what you would hear from The Sims, though decidedly less silly. It threw me at first, even prompting me to stop and ensure that I had the correct language chosen in the settings – only to find that there was no language setting at all. Still, you are never left wondering what a character intended to say. Through actions and situations, the message is always clear. It’s as if the developer dispensed with dialogue in much the same way a child removes training wheels from his bicycle.The true genius of this game is in the way that it uses game mechanics to connect the two brothers to each other, and the player to them. Both brothers are controlled simultaneously, one with the left stick and left trigger, the other with the right stick and right trigger – as the player, you are the common link. It feels a bit clumsy and takes some getting used to, and though it becomes easier with time, I never quite felt like I ever got the hang of it even as the game concluded. Fortunately, nothing about this title is particularly demanding from a platforming perspective.Brothers feels exactly like the type of game you’d make if you paid attention to how mechanics feed into narrative, and grew up surrounded by Swedish folk lore and the writings of Astrid Lindgren – author of books like Pippi Longstocking and Emil of Lönneberga, and the more pertinent to this game; The Brothers Lionhart and Ronia The Robber’s Daughter. That’s not to say that Brothers feels derivative – far from it. It’s just evocative of those things, which actually makes it stand out, more than anything. Have it all be coordinated by the steady storytelling hand of Josef Fares, and it’s no mystery why this tale of two sons actually turned out pretty fantastic.Since you always have two characters on the screen at once, it’s basically a one player co-op game – and though that may initially seem like a point of critique, it almost immediately becomes apparent that it’s pretty much the entire point of the game. As you become more and more comfortable with the controls, you eventually get a feel for how these characters are in sync – a true sense of relation that isn’t just fed to you through a cutscene. In fact, the way the game conveys how these brothers help each other out is one of the simplest yet most powerful things I’ve seen someone do with the medium.The bulk of the game feels a little bit like ICO. You do some platforming, some puzzling, some light navigating through perilous situations. It’s never difficult, and certainly not mechanically stressful – but the crux isn’t so much in nail biting challenge, but rather in the interplay between the two characters. The element of doing things in tandem keeps you involved and engaged in a way that doesn’t require the obstacles themselves to be overly convoluted. You’ll guide one character to turn a wheel, while guiding the other to ride an elevator. You’ll move a vine sideways while the other character is climbing up and down to avoid danger. You’ll control the paddles in a boat separately, or operate a see-saw to cut a tree down. There are more elaborate examples, but that would be telling!Adding to the impact of Brothers is the way it marries its visual and audio presentation to its story. The storybook landscapes and pastel quality to the textures evoke the game’s Nordic heritage, and Gustaf Grefberg’s score effortlessly underpins the emotional beats of the story without overpowering it. Caught somewhere between ThatGameCompany’s gameplay-light, aesthetically led works, and some of the more gameplay focused indie titles of recent years, such as Braid or Bastion. Brothers falters slightly by trying to please both masters. However it also manages to step out of the shadows of its influences by utilising its unique control scheme to enhance its story. It’s a wonderful example of tying mechanics to theme and its easy to imagine elements of what Brothers does being copied and iterated on in the future.It feels like another example of smaller games stepping out into unique and interesting directions and telling smaller, more personal stories in ways only possible through the medium. It’s easy to overlook a lot of what makes Brothers unique from first glance, its unassuming style belies a title with a lot more on its mind. But stick with it and you’ll be rewarded with something really quite special.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is not about challenging platforming or confounding puzzles. It’s not about replay value or flashy visuals. This game’s brilliance is in how its moving story is told: all because of how you move your fingers – which buttons you’re pressing, and which ones you’re not. This is a breakthrough in what interactivity can accomplish with little aid from more traditional storytelling mechanics – its resulting importance to this medium is no exaggeration.			"

												Good game with unique gameplay mechanics, beautiful graphics and deep story. Highly recommended for everyone who likes storyrich, movie-like adventure games.You play as two brothers who are on a journey to find a special ""magic water"" to cure their father from a deadly disease. And I mean you play/control both brothers at the same time, the older brother with WASD+Space(interact) and the little brother with the arrow keys+rightCTRL(interact). In the beginning this coordination seems to be a huge challenge but you get used to it quite soon and once you can handle this special controls its really fun.Every brother has his own strenghts and weaknesses (and personality which you notice when you let the brothers interact with certain persons or things) so they have to help each other = you have to coordinate both brothers in their own way to beat the challenges along your way (these ""puzzles"" are simple to be honest but in my opinion that doesnt matter since the focus in this game is definately on the story and they are still fun to solve).This kind of mechanics offer a unique and very special gameplay experience.The graphics are beautiful, especially the water and light effects. Youll fnd a lot of benches along the way, use these opportunities to sit down for a moment and enjoy the view!Unfortunately the game is relatively short - you need 3-4 hours from start to finish, but nevertheless the story is deep and the characters (the two brothers, there arent any more important characters) are complex, for me personally it felt much longer than the three hours it took me to play it through for the first time.I encountered one single bug: I got stuck once between a ledge and the hand of a troll but since theres a checkpoint every few minutes that wasnt a serious problem and like I said it happened only once.Other things to mention: You cant save your game, but there are enough checkpoints. There arent any video or audio settings to configurate except gamma correction and music/effect volume and you cant change the controls - but none of this is necessary or would be useful for the game. The language in the whole game is a fictional language but due to the brothers body language (and the given context in general) you can always understand what they mean.That was it... nice game. 7/10.EDIT: Oh I forgot... You wont get a single achievement just during the usual game, for doing what you have to do to get ahead. For the achievements you have to take the bypaths and have to look out for the little things (:			"

												I have to confess that I bought this game by mistake in the last summer sale. I thought I did a stupid purchase. (Back then i said: OMG im an idiot, why did you pay for this trashy game?....)It's really great when you discover something good in your stupidity.Brothers a Tale of Two Sons is a really good game, simple, short and emotional.Its really easy but besides of that, the game is fantastic.I strongly recommend you to buy this game on sale or perhaps in a bundle.

												Great and short game, but very sad and heartbreaking. It says it requires a controller to play, but you can perfectly play it with the keyboard (although it can be stressful sometimes). That notice should say it's recommended, not required.			"

												Well, that came out of nowhere.I spent a mere 1.5€ on this... and by the time I finished Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, it proved itself to be one of the most powerful, confident and, yes, one of the best video games I've ever played.I strongly recommend you go into this game blind, so I'm going to be as vague as I can in this review.The premise is fairly simple: two boys head out on an adventure to save their dying father. Make no mistake though; this is a mature, sometimes surprisingly dark story that tackles heavy themes.There's not a single line of proper dialogue: the characters in the game use body language and talk gibberish (imagine The Sims, something like that) to convey emotion and/or move the story forward. The storytelling relies heavily on visuals, and does an immensely good job at transporting you to a fantasy world brimming with personality.The gameplay consists of controlling the two brothers via the controller's two analog sticks (though you can use a keyboard, I'd say definitely go for the gamepad). These two must overcome obstacles and solve mild puzzles (which, in all fairness, require no thinking whatsoever, but are still fun nonetheless) throughout their journey.It's funny how a 4 hour game effortlessly packs more creativity, emotion and memorable set pieces than most contemporary AAA titles struggle to achieve in the span of twice (or even thrice) as many hours. Brothers never feels stale or boring, thanks to its constantly throwing new ideas at you (both in terms of gameplay and visuals), toying with each one just enough before moving on to the next.Brothers is also a strong reminder that art direction, when done right, can outweigh technical brilliance. Sure, some textures are bland and low-res, and you'll never come across any spectacular models or visual effects. But the attention to detail here is so staggering, and the world building so impeccable, it will leave you wondering why you care so much about the technicalities in the first place.All this is elevated by the soundtrack, which is simply phenomenal; sometimes overwhelmingly so. There were moments where the visuals blended so perfectly with the soundtrack, it gave me genuine chills.Really, the only criticism I may have is the somewhat clunky controls. It takes some time to get used to them (if you get used to them at all), as they are not exactly intuitive; there were times when I confused the two brothers and their actions. But that's a very, very small price to pay for such an exquisite and memorable journey.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is as close to perfect as it gets.			"

												In Brothers – A Tale of two sons you need to work together so you can help your ill father. Making a game that push the emotional side may not be an easy task since everyone have their own personality, so while many can relate and feel empathy, to others the theme may just not click with them, at all. However, it’s best to play this game with an open mind, let yourself immerse in this small Story and see how important it is to work together for a good cause. While no game should ever be judged by its length, Brothers will not take you more than 3 to 5 hours to complete, yet, this is just the right amount of time to experience the adventure, to discover the world and to struggle in a place full of dangers -during day or night-, for a good cause, your father. The way you control both brothers is not something many are used to and to some it was either annoying or hard to get around to some but I think it was a very creative idea. You see, a family is a very strong bond and should be something that you should cherish. It’s common to have a little fight with your little/older brother or sister in real life and that does not mean you don’t love him/her, it just mean that sometimes you need to adapt to a different way of thinking, a different taste in something, etc. The very same happens with the control scheme in this game, you need to train your brain to master both characters with each analog stick from your controller. It may not be easy at first but once you get used to, it gets a lot easier. And while you’re still adapting to this and you end up getting each brother to a different direction, well, that may also happen in real life. Just remember to cherish the moments with him because you never know what may happen.  There are some puzzles in the game but neither proved to be a hard challenge. The game focus more on storytelling than gameplay mechanics and while you adventure further and further, take a moment to sit down, stop for a bit and just enjoy the scenery, which by the way, is breathtaking; just don’t take too long, someone is waiting for you at home! Having an emotional focused game is always a risk but I believe Brothers managed to do it quite well in this short adventure with a strong ending and perhaps one or two surprises, just pay attention from the very start to make sure you don’t miss any interesting bits from the story right from the start.

												There really isn't a way for me to recommend this game enough. I played it when it came out on the 360 and had to buy it again on Steam.The first thing to know about this game is that it's ideally suited to a gampad with two analog sticks. It's possible to play with a mouse and keyboard, but it was specifically designed with a dual analog stick controller in mind. The gameplay mechanics can take a little getting used to, but after a short time, they feel very fluid and natural. You control one brother with the left stick and left trigger and the other brother with the right stick and right trigger. Those are the only buttons you use. Sounds simple and it is, but it's so unique. I've never played a game like this as far as controlling characters and it's truly a joy to play. The puzzles are fairly simple, but satisfying. The music is absolutely beautiful. The graphics aren't going to push your graphics card, but they are definitely appealing. The story is at times funny, hopeful, touching, and incredibly sad. There is no spoken language in the game, but it does an amazing job conveying emotions via the characters gestures and vocalizations. This is definitely one the most interesting games I've played in a very long time and I highly recommend that you give it a try.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a puzzle adventure game that has you control 2 brothers at the same time to navigate the game and solve puzzles along the way. You will come across many puzzles throughout the game each with interesting mechanics to solve, almost all of these puzzles will require you to use both of your characters at the same time to solve them.Brothers is quite short coming in at 3 hours but I personally don't think this holds the game back at all, it was better for them to create 3 hours of interesting and engaging storyline than 10 hours of boring ""When will this end"" gameplay. I certainly recommend this game if you are looking for an interesting story to complete in one afternoon.Pros+ Emotional storyline+ polished gameplay+ Interesting control systemVerdict 9.5/10			"

												This game delivers an excellent experience. You control both brothers at once, which isn't only a unique game mechanic, but a great way of enhancing the way you experience the story and the emotional bond between the two brothers. It's a very short game, but you feel deeply connected with the characters, and that without the use of words in this game - the game is set in a fantasy world, with its own language, which is utter gibberish. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons ranks at the top of metacritic, and that's definitely justified.			"

												You control two brothers simultaneously, both with the thumbsticks of a gamepad. It can also be played with a keyboard, but for full and creators intended experience this game REQUIRES a controller! Quote from the creative director ""You can play with a keyboard but that would destroy everything with the game. It's really extremely important that you use a controller."" The controls are actually part of the storytelling. Keyboard controls were only added because keyboard support was needed for PC release. You are sent on an adventure to get medicine for your father, on your journey you meet people, animals and even trolls! You solve light puzzles by using both of the characters. The game has no real dialogue, only nonsensical mumbling. Though even without real words  the game delivers real emotions. The visual art and music are beautiful. I just wish the game would had been maybe few hours longer. Short but sweet game.[Score: 87]			"

												As the tale begins .. ""A man, clinging to life. His two sons, desperate to cure their ailing father, are left with but one option..."" .. that's right, to go on an epic bro-tastic quest to save him!Starbreeze studios have created a fantasy world in Brothers that oozes with vibrance, life & atmosphere that really makes the world come alive. This is complemented by excellently detailed character animations & enviromental/weather effects that give additional impact to every scene (and they look really good!). Camera selection/direction is fluid & enhances each specific scene, drawing attention to a beautiful vista or the next path to take. There are also park benches throughout the game, where the bros can sit to view the gorgeous panoramic scenery. This was a really nice touch! Each controller stick & trigger controls each brother independantly (Left for big bro, Right for lil bro). Dubbed as 'Single player Co-op', this mode of play makes for some interesting gameplay mechanics & puzzle solving challenges (not to mention the challenge of actually coordinating your brain to control two players at once!). Its not that easy trust me lol! The rest of the game in general is very forgiving & overall isn't too puzzling &/or difficult to complete.Exploring, you can find some fun Easter Eggs, some relating to achievements, but others that are just there to make you smile and have a fun moment :)For me, the real stand out feature in Brothers was the story, which is a bit strange to say really, as there is actually no understandable dialog in the entire game! Everyone speaks a gibberish language you cannot understand. This actually works in the game's favor due to the quality animation & scene direction; you just understand what is going on naturally & the details of it all become irrelevant. Interestingly, the emotions become more relevant as you watch the brother's story unfold. It's impressive storytelling, exploring (among other things) family, sacrifice & loss, helping others & overcoming fears, along with some heartwarming & heartbreaking moments too. All moving you forward to the unforgettable conclusion (which might just stick with you for a while). Overall, Brothers has smooth & relaxing gameplay, devoid of any of those frustrating gamer moments. Impressive graphics, quality sound effects & a musical score that drives the emotional impact throughout extremely well. It's a short, but memorable 4-5 hour experience with immersive storytelling & plenty of adventurous 'Indiana Jones & Tomb Raider-esque' action sequences to enjoy.Great bro-tastic experience! Great adventure game!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is nothing short of fantastic. The player controls both characters, where the player goes on an epic journey across all kinds different landscapes just to find a certain important object, which can save a certain someone. I don't want to give too much away b/c this game is absolutely epic, personal, and moving. Brothers: ATOTS is basically a cross b/t a platformer, puzzle-game, and adventure game (like say a very-linear Tomb Raider game made before TR 2013) - but, there is absolutely no combat here what-so-ever. Brothers feels like it is something straight out of a classic fairy-tale or fable, drenched with tons of personality in its art direction & art design. It's nothing short of wonderful, with its excellent story-book look and feel. This couldn't have been done any better.Most things here are not said to the player via dialogue or any sort of narration, they are shown to the player. There is no English dialogue - everything here is spoken in a language that sounds like its right out of The Sims' own Sim-language of gibberish. You come to conclusions, based on what you see on screen and how things are laid out and presented to you. Everything is meticulously placed, from the environments to characters - and a lot can be inferred given just how an area is laid out, how a character is placed, and whatnot. This kind of subtlety does remind me of how sometimes Dark Souls tells stories for namely those who are really playing attention, without even cracking one word of dialogue at times - except, this game never cracks one word of dialogue. When played with a X360 controller (which is how I played this game), the player controls one brother w/ the left stick + interact w/ object w/ one of the left triggers, while the other brothers is controlled w/ the right stick + one of the right triggers. Nothing else I can think of feels like this, gameplay-wise. This feels extremely unique, in which you are basically playing a Co-Op style game...basically all by your lonesome self. It's genius and absolutely brilliant. You will need to control each brother at the right time sometimes; simultaneously sometimes (which can be confusing at first, and then joyous and awesome once you get the feel down correctly and execute a set-piece correctly); or do things in a certain manner to advance further in the game and story. All of the set pieces here are fantastic and extremely well put together. From every story set-piece to every gameplay set-piece, everything is put together in such a manner in which it's integrated extremely well with each other. Each brother has their own advantages and disadvantages - one brother is much taller + stronger, while the other brother is smaller + skinnier. This can help lead players on how to figure out what to do in certain situations + encounters. Maybe the big brother needs to give the little brother a boost, so they can reach a ledge. Maybe the younger brother can squeeze through bars that his bigger brother can't get between. Thankfully, the puzzles aren't hard, obscure, or ridiculous - but the player likely will have a bunch of ""Aha!"" moments, once the players realize how to make the brothers work together in the correct context and manner. Everything (difficulty-wise) is, as Goldilocks would say, ""just right.""While it likely won't take players likely very long to finish, Brothers is an absolutely unforgettable journey that must be experienced. Players will be moved by this fantastic experience, once it reaches its jaw-dropping conclusion. Taking my time, it took me somewhere around 4-5 hours to finish. It is a delightful experience, every single solitary step of the way. This game should be experienced by every gamer and should not be missed. This story-book, fairytale-like, and fable-like experience here is brought to life absolutely beautifully.Grade: A.			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is the first game to successfully tell a story within the video game genre. It is more an experience rather than a game. It is the most emotionally charged game to an extent where it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Brothers operates with a beautifully spare efficiency in every aspect of its narrative and design, propelling you through a striking storybook landscape in which gameplay mechanics and thematic storytelling thread together more tightly than most games can manage. The resulting journey is so singularly devoted to creating a specific tone and atmosphere that you won't likely be able to stop thinking about it until long after you've seen it through to the end. And it surprisingly excels at this without saying a single word and without forcing anything upon you. It is really understandable that it would be the Game of the Year and is already a personal choice of famous youtubers. It is clearly my Game of the Year. Dont't watch it, play it. This game will impact you in a way that no other game ever did. Lock your door, plug in your controller and start Brothers. Play it in one sitting, it is a 2 and half to 3 hour journey. I could go on and on about this game but I cannot put it all in words. It is an unforgettable experience. I definitely reccommend it. :)			"

												What can i say for this game. In the midle of the game i wanted to write a review about how cool it was to cut giants parts , bath your self into giants blood and do awesome staff.. But now that i ended the emotion that it offered me overflows from my feelings box.. The game is a road full of surprises, goes from sweet feelings , to sad, to sweet, to sad and goes on, but somehow the sadness seems familiar and you can make it part of you.. It is a simple and soon game, it will end soon but the emotions taht it offers are from an other place..  I had long time to play such an excellent game. Ofc some tiems it lucks into some controls or graphice, you cannot make it run 1080p HD but itt looks so pretty and smooth. I got it on sales, so i didn't pay much, which made me enjoy it even more!  I would recommend it to all of you to try it, it is a sweet and nice game			"

												I was blown away by this game:The controls were good ... it's difficult to wire your brain to control both characters at the same time, but this control scheme was simple, elegant and just made sense.Relatively linear and easy, but it just allows more time to enjoy the game. The entire thing is like a gorgeous painting.At core, the puzzles are all simple, but the variety and variations kept things fresh and enjoyable.Scenes and panoramas ... just incredible. My favorite parts was when the camera would show you an area that you had just traipsed through 5-10 minutes before.Level design. Incredible variety. Pastures, mountains, battlefields. The part where the ogre(?) is helping you climb a mountain is very clever. The battlefield ... awesome and a bit twisted. There are zip lines (for lack of a better term), boats, hang-gliding, goat-riding ... I forgot about the goat-riding!Short but sweet. Just a ton of goodness compacted into a game that's decent length. I wouldn't want it shorter, and there's just no need to stretch it out. Well, I wouldn't complain if the developers cut the last level ... some of it was just unnecessary.What I didn't like:I didn't like controlling the boat.I really, really didn't like the last level. I get that the developers want to drive in some emotion, but the stuff they have your character do after collecting the medicine was just effed up.All in all, a great game. Even the stuff I didn't like was very minor in the whole scheme of things and doesn't take away from the sheer amazement you get. Incredible game. I really can't see the developers topping this gem.In some ways, I might even consider this to be the best indie game ever. My current No.1 is Cave Story, which is a completely different game, so maybe we'll just call it a tie.9/10 "

												Brothers left me speechless. Let first say to anyone looking for a short review, ""Buy this game. It is 100% worth any money you will spend on it."" I would also like to take a humble moment to confess that this game made me cry. Yes, I cried. Now that the confession is out of the way, this game is a work of art. The story telling in this game is so fulfilling that the fact that story includes no dialogue only adds to the art form. The player is greeted in the beginning with horrifying story of a boy not able to save his mother from drowning and having to deal with emotional stress as a young child. The story continues by giving the two brothers the task of curing their sick father. The story itself is an adventure in emotion and storytelling. The brothers venture off into an unknown world coming across all sorts of different people and creatures, both needing help and helping the brothers along the way. A wonderful part of the story is the side stories that you stumble upon that have nothing to do with main plot. It’s a rich element of character to an already impressive story. For the second part of this review, let’s talk about the controls. The game is designed to use an Xbox style of controller utilizing the analog sticks to individually control each brother. Interaction with the environment is as simple as pressing the triggers, one for each brother. It is a lesson in coordination that for this guy was occasionally challenging. If the brothers swapped sides on the screen from the layout of the control sticks, it confused my thumbs. But I would not give up the uniqueness of these controls.This may have been a short game (approx. 4-5 hours) but the story and cinematography outshined anything. A truly unique game and must play. "

												Singleplayer co-op, designed for only the controller. This co-op mechanic is one of the single most innovative things that I have ever experienced in a video game and it delivers the most emotionally charged story I have ever experienced in games (without saying a single word in English). I have cried from reading books and watching movies, but finally now I genuinely had tears from playing a game (sorry ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Valiant Hearts"") - and it's a great thing to admit. This game will give you a full breath of emotional responses like sadness, happiness, wanderlust, joy, curiosity, disgust, horror and compassion - delivered in a fantastic mature way (and not in a cutscene), that at no point ever felt forced!It's a game about platforming and puzzle solving ... and controlling two characters at once! Solving the puzzles is so satisfying since they make sense and the approach of solving them is so unique and so innovative that I really never experienced anything like that before.

												I have daughters, not sons, but this one still touched me on a personal level. It would be hard for it not to touch anyone because it follows a very human story, a journey of sacrifice and loss. I had some idea what I was getting into when I started it and the finale still got me pretty good, so prepare for a straight shot to the feels when the end comes. You'll need to prepare for a very unique experience anyway when you start wrestling with the controls, but I assure you the sacrifice is well worth it.Unsurprisingly, this game is the tale of two sons, out on a quest to save their deathly ill father. Told entirely without intelligible dialog, the story sends them to the furthest reaches of their rather Scandinavian world to retrieve something that can save his life. Along the way they'll meet all manner of simple folk, some not-so-friendly critters, and some unexpected figures of myth. There's a lot of ground to cover between their craggy home and their mysterious destination and you'll guide them almost the entire way, in a grand journey that feels taken from a proper epic poem.You're guiding both of them, mind you. At the same time. You'll need a modern controller for this one because each brother is controlled by a different analog stick. Each has his own interaction button as well, but that's it for the controls and thank God for that because it's actually MORE disorienting than you're imagining. I got confused enough by tank games that have each stick control a different tread, so having two people to run around at once really screws with my brain. Honestly, over the entire three hours the game takes I never REALLY got used to moving two characters simultaneously.The good news is that you don't REALLY have to get used to it for the game to work. The vast majority of the paths through the game have safe edges and no dangers to worry about. Jumping is automatic, climbing just requires holding interact at the right times, and almost none of the puzzles you'll face require careful timing. Instead, Brothers goes off in a more creative direction to challenge you with puzzles specific to your dual protagonists. There are moments where you'll need them both to navigate something long through narrow passageways, or cooperate to trick a monster into a cage, or get each other across a gaping chasm. In what's easily the game's most clever sequence, the boys are connected by a rope that they can use to swing off of each other to reach new heights.The creative puzzles you'll face are woven carefully into the world to feel natural, never forced. There are definitely shades of ICO here, especially when you reach the windmills or towers. That feel extends to the world as well in how intelligently it is crafted and realized, though there are a lot more people kicking around in this one. Your journey isn't a particularly solitary one (and not just because you've got your bro with you), with plenty of farmers, villagers, and other folks going about their lives. There's more than that, too... the further in you get, the more creatures of myth you'll run into, giving the game a much more epic feel than you might be expecting from the start.What begins as a trek through pastoral fields and scenic trails soon grows foreboding with torch-lit caves and darkened woods, and only becomes more intense from there. I won't spoil anything but there are areas (and events) near the end of the game that were shocking in how dark they were. And then there's the ending, which I do hope you're prepared to face. The whole story from start to finish is expertly told through the efforts and small interactions between the brothers, and by the time it winds to a close you're bound to feel like the unseen third sibling. Drawn in by the gorgeous visuals, excellent soundtrack, and high quality throughout, there's even more to appreciate here than what I've laid out for you. Take a chance and follow these brothers on their journey, and I promise you'll be well-rewarded for your time.			"

												Brothers is an amazing game. I played it a while back and wrote a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥review that didn't really portray how much I enjoyed this game. A few of the generalized points about why I love it:First, the graphics. The use of the Unreal Engine 3 is really taken advantage of, with some incredible lighting and unbelievable physics. It is a very colorful game that is very immersive.Second, the controls. The fact that I prefer a controller helped in appreciating the gameplay a lot more. In this game, one controls both brothers - at the same time. That's right, no switching back-and-forth between them. It is why a controller is required (though I've heard of people using keyboards somehow), because you need the two joysticks. When controlling both brothers at the same time, it is noticable that the older brother has assets while the younger brother is weak.Third, the storyline. There are not many games that are able to choke people up (emotionally). This is one game that was, at the very least, able to choke me up (even if it was just at the end). The story is about a widowed ill father, and about his two sons travelling far and wide to reach a cure. When the characters talk in the game, it is an unknown language. But even when people do not speak the same language, when they feel strongly about something and speak to you anyways, you may just understand what they said.In the end, this is a very nice game. Personally, having a brother that only shares a mother with me, I couldn't understand the full extent of their emotion.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

												Rarely does a game come a long which can take you through emotional highs and lows. Rarer still is a game which blends those emotional experiences so seemlessly with the gameplay mechanics instead of shoving it down your throat in lengthy cutscenes. Brothers is a shining example of a successful blend of story and mechanics. The game's puzzles are well designed and feel satisfying to solve, almost always making use of the 'one player coop' asymmetry between the characters in unique and celver ways to progress through the game. Brother's Environments are extremely varied from grand mountain vistas to muted yet intricate caves. It feels like a world teeming with interesting fables and legend, yet the game insists on leaving lore and backstory to your imagination. This means the pacing feels pretty impecible throughout. Now, the game's characters don't speak a word of any particular language. Pretty much all of the communication between characters is done via body language. This perhaps sounds a little pretentious - but it works SO much better this way. Never did I feel like I didn't understand what a character was trying to communicate. Admittedly it was jarring at first, but after a half hour you'll start to see why this method of communication works in harmony with the game.I won't spoil what makes up this game's 'emotional' qualities. - and I know you want to punch me in the face for saying ""emotional qualities"". Just know that Brothers isn't just a sad game. Quite the opposite, it makes you feel a range of emotions. This game is funny, charming, thoughtful and touching. For me personally it's had a greater emotional impact in its 4 hour length than any film, book or indeed game I've ever played. All that whilst not saying a single word of English. Do yourself a favour, lock yourself away for a few hours, play this game from start to finish and immerse yourself in the story.As a final note - I would recommend playing this game with a gamepad. Wait! Don't through your pitchforks yet! The game still plays on a keyboard - though this game feels like it's built for a controller in mind. I would argue that keyboard control would detract from experience, and I'm pretty damn ardent about mah keyboard n' mouse.			"

												I recently wrapped up a 2 hour playthrough of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. I give the developers full credit for creating some astonishingly beautiful visuals, which truly enable the fairy tale world of the game to come to life. I was swept away by breathtaking vistas of misty valleys and snow-capped mountains, as well as some of the most gorgeous water effects I've ever seen in a video game.That being said, I didn't find any other aspect of this title to be particularly noteworthy or enjoyable. The puzzles are extremely simplistic and I was never, even for a moment, at loss as to how to proceed. This simplicity might lead one to think that this could be a good game for kids, but the grim tone and surprisingly gruesome middle section quickly put that idea to rest.I question the decision to implement a made up ""language"" for the characters to use to express themselves. I think it badly detracts from the seriousness of the story. I would have preferred either no dialog at all (pantomime would probably have been sufficient) or some concise dialog/narration in a real language. Perhaps something written in a fairy tale style would have fit the mood of the game perfectly.Finally, I have to take major issue with the ending. I think the developers were going for grand operatic tragedy, but because of the complete lack of characterization things fall totally flat. The shrill and melodramatic music that underscores ""big"" moments makes the lack of true drama all the more obvious and jarring.I'm sure many people will enjoy Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but based on my own taste in games and art in general I don't find anything to recommend here.

												A clear 2013 Game of the Year candidate, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a third person puzzle game that gets absolutely everything right.  The story is a simple one - your father needs help desperately, and you have to go find it.  Throughout the journey you'll feel many emotions as you quickly grow attached to the brothers.  This attachment is due to the fact that you control both brothers at the same time and you need to have them work together to fight through adversity and move on in your journey.  The lack of lengthy cut-scenes and a made-up language were interesting choices that also worked 100% with this game.  It makes you become even more involved, not just sit back and watch a movie play out in a game.Graphics-wise, it's visually beautiful without the need of heavy tweaking.  The game environment immerses you to its fantasy world instantly.  Houses, farms, towns, cliffs, castles, mines, caves, water... all the environments are well-made and polished.  The way you get to interact with animals in particular was phenomenal in my opinion.  A lot of small interactions with people, items, and animals are not necessary to move on in your journey, but they add fun and depth to the game experience and gets you even more immersed.It's recommended that you play with a controller, and I could see why.  You control one brother with each joystick, and a lot of times you'll need to interact with both at exactly the same time to solve puzzles.  I thought that the teamwork between the brothers was spectacular, and not something you see every day in a single player game.  No gameplay bugs or annoyances to speak of.  You just need to learn to work together with yourself :)  The puzzles themselves are very simple, yet brilliant in how you go about to solving them.All achievements are fun to attain, not a chore.  If you missed an achievement during your first playthrough, you can go back and play each chapter separately.  I finished the game in 4 hours.  Others have finished it between 2 and 6 hours.  The game was so much fun that I purposely had to put it down so that I didn't play through it in one sit-down.  I'm not going to spoil anything whatsoever regarding the story.  All I'll say is that you'll experience many up's and down's throughout the journey.  Which again, it's something that the game got 100% right.  Right now I can't think of a single negative to speak of.  I guess the game length would be the only negative since it's such a great and fun game that you'll wish the journey had lasted longer.TotalBiscuit called Brothers the best game he's ever played, surpassing his previous choice (Deus Ex).  I also happen to think that Deus Ex is one of, if not the best game ever made.  I do understand why he would place Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons so high up the game ladder.  I haven't played The Last of Us yet, but I would strongly make a case for Brothers as a 2013 Game of the Year candidate.  I'm not a recognized game reviewer person or site, so it's just my humble opinion.  But go ahead and buy Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons if you want a great, emotional gaming experience :)			"

												Alright, let's do this.Take a deep breath. Relax. Now breath out.As far as things concerned, games of nowadays are making you either angry (or rather frustrated) because of their challenge, or happy (or rather proud of yourself) when those challenges are through. Other then that it's just a bunch of copy-this-and-paste-that mechanics. One can encounter a rare gem of a very good game with an intersting story and compelling characters. They're not making many of them, but still. Amidst those gems is this game. And when I say ""gem"" about it, I mean ""crown jewel"".It's unique. No matter how hardened you are, the game will find a place in your heart, a door long forgotten, and will kick it open with a bang. It will tour you to some dark places, grim and solemn; and yet it will show you that there's always a hope.It won't give you headache, won't make you feel a real hero and most of all, a winner. But it will give you an experience like no other, the one you will never forget.Emotions. Now I remember them.			"

												I came into this game knowing it was the single player co-op game, many friends had recommended it, and not much else.  That is the way to do it.  It is absolutely worth the 4-6 hours it will take to complete and every new chapter managed to again take my breath away.  It is an incredible story of loss and growth set in an utterly realized yet fantastical world.  Sometimes controlling the brothers at the same time is confusing (it's the video game equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time), but it is not enough to take away from this journey.  Immediately jumps into the top of the ""video games as art"" conversation.  Play it now.			"

												Fantastic little adventure indie gem. Not one word is spoken the entire game (the characters just speak kind of like the sims and they don't say much). Yet it manages to tell a powerful and emotional story through music, character expressions, body language, cutscenes and sound effects in a way that's truly unique. It's short, I finished it in a little over three hours but that didn't detract from enjoying the playthrough. It's definitely worth getting on sale. A 360 gamepad or controller is required so skip it if you don't have one. But I'd say buying a cheap generic controller just to play this game would be well worth it and would open up other titles to play that use a gamepad.			"

												Oh boy, this game..Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an amazing journey about those two kids, searching for a cure for their father, since he got sick.You will totally need a controller for this game, but there is a reason. Let's analyze everything, shall we?The gameplay is pretty innovative yet so easy: left stick + L2 to control a brother, right stick + R2 to move the other one. Each of them will have his own ability, like the big brother will move heavy stuff, and the small one will pass through tiny bars. Might look a little too hard to control at the biginning, but you'll get used to it pretty fast. But you'll probably get stuck sometimes or die like an idiot becouse you can't tell witch kid you're actually moving. Probably it was just me becouse I'm terrible with a controller.Anyway, the story itself is pretty easy, but the small events that you will encounter, most of them well hidden, are really well written. Some scenarios are really, really impressive and I think I never saw something like that, like  the Valley of the  dead giants .There aren't many enemies this this game, but a lot of jumping puzzles and puzzles itself. Not much difficult, but still a lot of  fun to play. There will be also some boss battles, but not much of a challange.The music is really great, I love it and really know where to hit the spot. Really well chosen for certain moments.The only thing that kinda disappoint me are some few bugs that I encounter: for exemple, once I got stuck into a rock, and i couldn't move from that. Had to restart from last checkpoint. Immersion broken.In the end, this game get for me a whole 8/10Is great, go get it now. Maybe better get that on sale, is an awesome game, but 15€ might be a little too much, but that won't be a problem.			"

Brothers is a sublime poignant experience, characterized by its ability to convey affecting emotion without any intelligible dialog. It carries you through a fantastical world never uncertain of what it wants you to see and feel, and does so in such a effective manner that it never needs to say anything to make you connect with your two characters, and leave a lasting impression.Brothers story is not one that can be spelled out on paper, and really does require you to experience it for yourself in order to understand why it is so powerful. The way in which each piece is woven and rewoven together creates a world that feels connected and draw out despite the immense ground covered and the drastic changes undergone by the environment, as well as the short length which leaves little time for exposition. I honestly do not feel capable of doing it any sort of justice with this review, but know that this is the type of narrative journey that comes along rarely for a reason, that being it is very hard to do successfully especially to such a level as is shown here. I once read the way A Tale of Two Sons plays described as ""single player co-op"" which is the perfect definition for it. You control both brothers concurrently with the two analog sticks and triggers. It's a disorienting rewiring of the motions we've become so accustomed to and requires you use both sides of your brain at once, but once you get accustomed it allows for an array of increasingly ingenious occurrences. The ways in which it forces you to work together (with yourself) are brilliant and within the first opening moments completely sold me on the unusual control scheme and only continued to impress me with the cleverness that the developers managed to play with mechanic.As compelling as I found the gameplay, I was simply struck by the unequivocal beauty of the visuals. The texture work and lighting effects bring the prodigious creativity and imagination to life in a vibrant and ever changing display of wondrous locals and characters. The breathtaking and dramatic soundtrack is perfectly timed to every action that occurs, with a dynamic range of sounds that sweeps you through the world as an irreplaceable part of it.There are few games which I feel deserve the title, but the level at which Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons accomplishes everything it attempts and the skill in which it executes the different components, warrants the term masterpiece. It is an impressive achievement in both interactive storytelling and original game design that left me in a state of wonder with each passing moment. Disregard the fact that you can and likely will complete it in one sitting, Brothers is something that needs to be played and a game I will surely be singing the praises of far into the future.			"

												In first hour of gameplay, I've thrown a little girls ball down the well, got my petty revenge on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who made my life difficult, stole not one, but two sheeps and made friends with a benevolent troll. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons combines a brillianty crafted, surprisingly interactive world, with charming, sympathetic characters and emotional storyline. It's short and very linear, but it's also airtight, perfectly paced and not a moment of it feels superfluous. While platforming is easy and puzzle soultions are almost always very obvious, main challenge comes from mastering games unique dual-control gameplay (you control one brother with each analog stick and that's why GAMEPAD IS A MUST). To me it was relatively easy but some less patient players may be discouraged from properly enjoying it. However, that would be to their own detriment, because despite it's shortness (and subsequently relatively high price) it provides a unique experience and narrative (reactions and dialogue are communicated exclusively through mime and vocal inflections) which should be experienced and appreciated by anyone who loves puzzle-adventures or just wants a well-crafted, story driven game.

												I have bought the game maybe two years ago, when I read good reviews about it and when it went on sale on steam. I have just played it on my new lenovo gaming laptop. I am only mentioning this because I thought the visuals were gorgeous, and it deserve to be played on a good PC. (Mine comes with Nvidia 960)I was amazed by the story and emotions involved in the game. It might not be very obvious at the beginning of the game, but trust me it surprisingly gets epic. Although the game has no narrator nor it uses a known language, it communicates the story very fluently through the scenes. I want to say more but I think I might run into spoiling the story for the reader. I highly advise buying and playing this game. I also highly recommend playing it with a joypad. I first played it with a keyboard and I almost gave up on it. It was really confusing to play on a keyboard and I couldn’t control the players properly. The puzzles seem to be more enjoyable when played with a joypad, and it seems that the way the creators intended it to be. If I ever want to criticize anything about the game, it would be that I wanted to have more puzzles and a little more complication to come with them. Final verdict: 9.5   "

												This was probably one of the best games I've ever played in all my years of gaming. Great story, amazing graphics, beautiful music, and very rewarding to play. Although people have found ways to make it work without one, you will definitely need a controller to get the full experience (preferably one with feedback/vibration turned on and also 2 analog sticks, I used an Xbox 360 controller). It's a very short game and probably doesn't have a lot of replay value (though I personally may want to play through it again and again every so often, the way you go back and read a book you really love every few years), but it's an experience that I think will stay with you long after you finish playing.At first, I thought the controls were going to be awkward, but the interface is so simple and the story is so compelling that you really do get lost in the game and the controls feel very natural. The puzzles are intuitive and not too difficult, and unlike a lot of games I never found myself frustrated because something was too hard or I couldn't figure out what the next step was. I also never felt like the puzzles were too repetitive (even though some elements do repeat) because the environment keeps changing enough to keep things interesting. Overall this game was a pleasure to play and very very satisfying. If you're on the fence about buying it, don't hesitate. It's a beautiful gaming experience that shouldn't be missed.			"

												Brothers - a tale of two sons


knock knock 
A Screenshot of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons
By: Sir Strattimus




Who's there? oh well, it's another review of Brothers - a tale of two sons, what else?So, my motivation for playing this game, was basically that I had heard only good things about it. Actually not just ""good"" things, I had heard great things. So I decided that I wanted to try it out, and now I can only take part in the joy, of confirming the awesomeness that is this game.The only thing, that people kept repeating, that's pulling this game a small bit down, is the fact that it only takes about 3-4 hours to beat. I did it in one sitting, and on one hand, it's great to have a short game, with a nice storyline. It always feels good to finish a game, and it's healthy if you tend to have a quickly growing backlog. But on the other hand, it's also nice to have a game, that's abit long, you get to follow the charaters for longer, and get more into the story. Plus, if it's a good game, then there's the obvious advantage of extra gaming content. (When I'm saying a long game, I'm not talking skyrim long, just with a bit more of an ellaborated story). But in the end, I don't think that this game needs to be any longer, in the matter of a fact, I think it has the perfect length, you get a nice insight in the game and the two brothers' adventure to reach their goal.One thing I found really special and unique in this game, is how it manages to create that feeling, of sympathy, and understanding. Even though it's in a completely foreign language. In fact, I pictured myself in their roles so much, that I even started refering to myself in plural. This is definatly one of the most emotional games, I have ever played. At parts, it got me directly sad.Even though this game at the store page, has a note saying ""notice: this game requires a controller"" this is actually not the case. I started this game up, using my gamepad, and given you're playing as two charaters, it takes a second to get used to the double controls. Especially when the brothers switch side of the screen. Anyways, half way into the game, i decided ""hmm, maybe i should try using my keyboard, just for the sake of testing if it works."" And it does, and while many say that the keyboard controls are much more difficult to use, i actually found it completely opposite, and stuck with it for the rest of the game.The graphics in this game is astonishing, and all over fantastic. Brothers is all over a beautiful game

 and not only that, the tremendous amount of stuff you could interact with, simply made the game even funnier, even the two brothes had different ways of ineraction, it was an exploration in itself, just walking around, and watching them react to stuff.You start the game with a cutscene, where you tragically see the mother die at sea. 


oh wow, 1minute in the game and the mother's tragic dead occur,

You're playing as two brothers, who has bring their ill father some healing water from the tree of life (atleast that's what it's called in my head xD). They have to pass and solve countless tests and challenges by the use of teamwork and some nice parkour, you start of in your home town, getting slowed down by a simple town-bully, but are yet to find out there are far worse things to worry about, giant trolls, even bigger spiders, invisble snow creatures and all sorts of monsters awaits the two boys, and before they finally reach the tree, they have to survive all these things. and just when you think all is good, twists are happening all around you (no spoilers, go play for yourself) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233640820http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233641046 While almost everything in this game is perfect, it feels like the devs. has done over one particular bit, abit quickly compared to the rest of the game, I'm talking about the soundtrack, while it too has some cool parts to it, I feel like it lags that one epic track, that makes you wanna play the game, over and over again, just for that track, or simply just makes you hum along to it.All in all, I give this game a 9/10 it's an amazing game, the developers did an incredible job on this game, it has every little aspect needed in my opinion, the only thing keeping it from perfection is the soundtrack.So cheers Starbreeze Studios for this game http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233640379 also, have a few pics :eng: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233897403 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233653659 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233647495 "

												Brothers is a game where you control two brothers on a quest to save their father. The game is optomized with an Xbox 360 controller in mind, no doubt. Or at the very least, a controller. It can definitely be played with a keyboard and mouse, but I wouldn't recommend.Now that I got that out of the way, I'll let you know why(if you didn't already know) this is one of the best games of the year. The way you control both brothers binds with the story so well its absolutely amazing. We all know when it comes to gaming there are two basic factors that make a video game: Mechanics and story. I think a game can have very little of one or the other, and still be a good game. However, it is extremely rare that the mechanics practically make the story. Its absolutely amazing how well it is done. I'm fairly sure its been done in similar ways before, but not in a way like this, in a way that makes the story what it is. The story wouldn't exist without the mechanics, its amazing how they flow.There is no dialouge, yet the story is one of the best I've played. How the hell does that even happen? It completely took me by surprise. I didn't think that was possible until Journey, and now Brothers has done a very similar thing. To be honest, while the mechanics do make the story, they don't come without bugs and issues. There were several times where the controls got in the way of me being able to complete a task. I don't entirely blame the game, I blame my brain for not always being able to keep track of both characters and coorespond that with the correct stick on the controller. Also, I ran into a few different glitches, but nothing broke my game. However I have heard of glitches forcing some people to restart entire chapters, which is not ideal. I'm not going to tell you this is my favorite game of all time, or even my #1 game of the year, but that doesn't mean the game isn't amazing and plenty of fun. I would have been happy paying the full sale price, but at $4.49, its an absolute steal. Brothers gets my full recommendation. Buy it now(at this time it is 4.49) or at 14.99, it makes little difference. The game is absolutely worth every penny. Play Brothers today to experience one of the best blends of story and mechanics I've ever seen. Buy At Full Price  "

												A rare gem of a game based on a modest concept that is executed flawlessly. It doesn't try to appeal to everyone and is better for it. Its main strength is its highly emotional story which is hard to talk about without spoiling anything. I can only say that it managed to surprise me more than once. It's about 3 hours long which might seem short on paper but you won't be bored for a single minute and the impact it makes will stay with you a great deal longer. It's designed to be played as a ""single player co-op game"" but I played it with my younger brother for an extra layer of immersion and we both had a wonderful time throughout. The game doesn't actually ""need"" a controller to work but using a keyboard is a bad idea as it takes away much of the gameplay value. I had to use an emulator to get my old controller to work with the game but it was well worth the trouble. All in all I'd say it's more than worth the price and the 3 hours of your life as it will most likely enchant your whole evening like it did mine.			"

""Dramatically & Fabulous Journey of two Brothers""This game is very beautiful and epic. Tho I don't understand any Finnish they are talking but you can feel what they would mean. Ofc the motion capturing is perfectly implemented. The even better point is that impressive visuals settings and unique graphics and design. Especially the fabulous animals like a flying chimera, trolls, orcas or wolves. Essentially this is an action-adventure with some jump'n'run elements included. And a few little puzzles also. It uses some nice physics mechanics. XBox Controller for rumbling is strongly recommended. The story turnsout very dramatic and in the end even sad. But you will be blessed with a bunch of beauty graphics. Just don't stop screenshoting ...			"

												This game took me completely by surprise.Which is really surprising because, after the first few minutes, it was nearly a disappointment: graphics fine but not sophisticated, a touching story which did not seem very promising and characters too simple. And then I let it drop in a corner of my library and forgot about it until I decided to get back on it more than a year afterwards, mainly because the achievements were easy to get.And finally, this game astonished me and was clearly much better than I expected it to be.I was totally absorbed by the unique atmosphere that characterizes it. I’m not surprised it has the tag ""Atmospheric"". With the atmosphere somewhat childish of the beginning, I was not expecting to discover a universe both gloomy, melancholic and yet very colorful afterwards. This conjunction of the theme of death on a bright picture painted with softened features worthy of a children's story is quite striking and almost unsettling. And let’s not forget about the history of these very young characters which ends up tearing your guts out.

The harmony that unites the two brothers is at the heart of this adventure which has a rather special gameplay where the two characters must be controlled at the same time to progress. I play with the keyboard and it took me some time to get used to it especially as one of the two protagonists requires a qwerty keyboard but I just had to manually switch it to azerty with Shift + Alt, and you get the hang of it really easily.Clearly, I was blown away and I highly recommend this little gem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Si je devais résumer mon sentiment sur ce jeu, je dirais qu’il m’a totalement prise par surprise.Pourtant, après les quelques premières minutes de jeu, j’avais réussi à accrocher tant bien que mal grâce aux graphismes sympathiques mais pas assez aboutis à mes yeux, à une histoire touchante mais qui ne me semblait pas non plus très prometteuse et des personnages que je trouvais plus niais qu’autre chose. Et puis je l’avais laissé choir dans un coin de ma bibliothèque jusqu’à ce que je décide de m’y remettre plus d’un an après principalement pour les succès faciles à obtenir, je l’avoue.Et finalement, contre toute attente, ce jeu a dépassé toutes mes espérances.Je me suis totalement laissée absorbée par l’atmosphère unique qui le caractérise. Pas étonnant d’ailleurs que le tag « Atmosphérique » lui ait été attribué. L’ambiance quelque peu enfantine du début ne laisser en rien présager de l’univers à la fois glauque, mélancolique et pourtant très coloré que l’on découvre par la suite. Cette concomitance du thème de la mort sur un tableau lumineux peint avec des traits adoucis digne d’un conte pour enfant est assez frappant et presque déstabilisant. Et que dire de l’histoire qui finit par vous prendre littéralement aux tripes.

L’harmonie qui unit les deux frères est au cœur même de cette aventure de par un gameplay assez particulier où l’on doit contrôler les deux personnages en même temps pour pouvoir progresser. Personnellement, je joue au clavier. Il m’a fallu un peu de temps pour m’y habituer surtout que l’un des deux protagonistes est programmé à la base pour un clavier qwerty mais il m’a simplement suffi de le passer manuellement en azerty avec les touches Shift+Alt pour régler ce souci, et le coup de main vient finalement assez vite.En clair, je me suis prise une bonne claque comme cela se fait de plus en plus rarement et je recommande vivement d’acquérir cette petite perle au plus vite.

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons opens and closes with death. It’s a game about death. But it isn’t a game about killing. What is between the opening and closing scenes is a dark fairytale world full of mature themes, and the bond of two siblings as they struggle valiantly on a quest to save their withering father. A beautiful and melancholic journey awaits you, and a deep emotional investment will be required. And though brief, this attractive storybook adventure is as dreamlike as it is affecting.Brothers’ appeal lies in what it doesn’t tell you. Cutscenes are used sparingly, with the world itself providing the emotional pull and story. For instance, while I was using the twin-control scheme to explore a town, I was able to steal a ball and throw it down a well, leaving a small girl in tears. The imaginary language used by the characters is universally bolstered by wonderful body language, and the affection and fears that each brother holds for the other. The twin-control scheme is key to the game’s identity. It’s a somewhat clumsy control system, with each brother being assigned to a control stick and a shoulder button. However, Brothers’ generally requires the input of both characters, both to work together and independently, to pass obstacles. It’s a key identifying feature for the game and one that has been cleverly exploited.The obstacles are generally rather easy, and there is only a small amount of room to experiment, with generally one rather obvious solution. The challenge comes in actually performing the actions necessary to pass. As you control both brothers at the same time, and often you need to split them up to do individual tasks, some of which can be timed, it can occasionally feel like trying to pat your head and rub your belly at once. Something that for most of us, we are certainly capable, but it does require a different type of input than we would normally use.And these siblings will certainly have you wringing your hands. Sometimes over the controls, but mostly over their relationship with each other, and in turn, your relationship with them. The epic undertaking they’re on will have them trek over snow-capped mountains, across frozen lakes and an ancient giant’s battlefield – it’s a wonderfully realised world without exposition – it exists and feels real. The settings are as varied as the tasks required of the brothers, and the emotional pull of the game will have you powering on to see what happens next. This is not a game to be played in short stretches, and at just over 3 hours in my playthrough, I completed it in just two sittings.The dark undercurrent of death in this world is never confrontational, it seeps into every pore of the game, and can even be missed. Shortly after leaving a small village, I passed a man attempting to hang himself. Using one brother to prop him up, and another to cut the rope, I left him sitting beneath the tree to sob like a man who had nothing left. Further ahead I found a burnt out homestead, and with the brothers working in tandem, I was able to retrieve a small music-box which seemed to help the man. This sentimental scene is one of many throughout Brothers’ that outright dealt with death in a mature and intelligent fashion, an unusual but fascinating design decision by the developers. I suppose you could say that the true aim of Brothers’ is to make us feel. Of course, there is the adventure, and the smartly designed environmental obstacles, but this is a game where touch isn’t just an afterthought, and death has some permanence, and has some resonance. And while it’s brief, Brothers’ doesn’t outstay it’s welcome, and provides an ambitious, emotionally affecting adventure that while short, is very sweet. Memorable.8.5/10.			"

Nordic heavy fairy-tale with uncommon controls. Main plot is glorious and consists of different little stories you can discover (or miss) on your way. It also has a lot of symbolism which is often a part of gameplay. Some people say that it's too short (around 5 hours), but in my opinion the length of the game is ideal for the story being told. It brings new elements of gameplay in every chapter, so you simply have no time to get bored with them. It keeps the game interesting until the very end even if you don't like the plot (what is unlikely). The game also provides picturesque landscapes like every 5 minutes.Technically it's a platformer with some little puzzles. Unique feature of the game is controlling two characters at the same time. It can seem difficult at first and it definitely needs more coordination, but controls are simple and very well done. In overall the game isn't hard to beat. Game runs well on old systems (see system requirements). Also it's fully compatible and comfortable to play with keyboard.I highly recommend to play and complete this peace of art.			"

												This is a game you should not miss. A great experience to control both brothers together at the same time with both sticks of your gamepad, working the way through a nordic inspired magic world wrapped in mature atmosphere. Sometimes challenging but never unfair. The story is short but touches you at many points of the game. Alltogether the game is quite unique and you should not miss it ... if you have a controller!

												A nice short little adventure with easy achievements. Really enjoyed it, although there are some minor things that bothered me, which makes the universal praise a bit confusing to me.First off the positive aspects though. The mechanic of controlling each brother individually was definitely unique and entertaining. Sometimes I had to figure out who's who, so I always preferred having the older brother on the left and the younger one on the right, so that they align with the analog sticks they're controlled with, but once you get used to the controls it's somewhat fascinating to play two characters at once. It's surreal to look at the screen and see them move so naturally and despite being in control it disconnects you from what's happening. I felt like I'm watching a movie or something. That's not a bad thing, it only underlines how idiosyncratic the feature is.What I didn't like was the gibberish language they were talking. Growing up in a multicultural area, and being a son of migrants myself, most words sounded familiar, but didn't make sense at all. So it really took a lot of immersion away from the game when they just sounded completely ridiculous in, what supposed to be, moving scenes.It also felt a bit incoherent, because this game got really, really ♥♥♥♥ing dark all of a sudden. At first it was a beautiful hike through the woods, but then it was all about death, halucinations and what not. You could argue the sudden change is an artistic tool to add more weight to the events, but it just felt out of place.Still an enjoyable experience and alone the gameplay mechanics make it worth being played.Review taken from my backlog profile.[backlog-deepness.rhcloud.com] "

Explains the plot through gameplay rather than exposition.A lot of classic games either skimped on discussing any plot or simply didn't have the technology to incorporate a complex storyline. By reducing voiced character interaction to a minimum and having them speak in a foreign language, the player is left to interpret the story; a compelling and central aspect to this indie contender. I've been told that this is one of the very finest games ever made and while I understand the appeal and certainly agree its worth your time, I don't think it belongs on the pedastal so many critics have garnished it with. Despite clocking in at three hours, the game felt much shorter as it seemed to just fly by. Every blink I took was accompanied by a huge transition in location. Before I knew it I was adventuring in a completely different place, each one bearing its own set of rules and all goverened by the same overarching objective (venture forth and get your sick dad some medicine). You'll never feel stressed and even dying won't set you back more than a few moments. Progress is blocked by a handful of simple, contextual puzzles. This is the perfect game for relaxing with one day. Perhaps the strongest point and what makes this game so unique is that like Mario and Luigi RPGs you'll be controlling two characters (who can't typically sepraate far from one another). The way they both interact with the expansive world made everything come to life. One brother would kneel down to pet a sheep and the other would pick it up and carry it with him. One would admire the caged bird and the other set him free. This game's been on sale before so try to pick it up on the cheap. I snagged it for about three bucks. You'd have to enjoy a AAA game for sixty dollars proportionately if you wanted that sort of value.			"

												The only word to describe this game is: beautiful. The art direction, soundtrack, color patterns, interaction with the world, controls... everything is beautiful. Especially interactions and the responses of the items or people (wouldn't like to call them NPC's in such a game) depending on the brother you're interacting at that time makes this game astonishingly brilliant. Being directly involved  in some major happenings (like at the giant tree, near the end of the game) makes it more than a simple platformer and enhances the game's influence on your emotions as you are doing those specific actions.  Preference of using the player's involvement rather than showing those kinds of events as cutscenes turns this simple story to a bond between the game and the gamer.Only negative points are: Mostly holding LT and RT buttons might become tiring for fingers after a while. Controller direction settings are set for XBOX gamepads, which are different than most of the gamepads on the market in terms of locations of digital and analog movement buttons, therefore while you're controlling a brother with analog, you'll control the other with digital and this kinda diminishes the revolutionary control system.Game is too short and would love to play more of this.Puzzles could have been harder (?).At the end, it is a great experience to participate in the tale of two brothers.

												Absolutely amazing.Brothers is a short game (3 hours or so, maybe 4-5 if you're going for all the achievements) but the experience is very rich that is packed with detail and incredibly polished. The unique controls (one 'half' of a controller for each brother) make it unlike anything else out there, and the ease of the controls make it very accessible to almost all audiences.A great game if you want to feel something epic and substantial in a short period of time (like a lazy afternoon on a weekend). Whether you think the $15 price tag is worth it for 3 hours of content is up to you, but it's definitely worth picking up on a sale.			"

Controlling the two brothers in the begining might a little bit difficult , but you'll get used to it after a while, don't worry. This game has simple yet enjoyable  puzzles, all the characters speak in a language like the sims, but you understand them from the body language and their facial expressions.

												Man, where to begin with this one...Story: Two brothers, Naiee and Naia, lost their mother to the sea. Now their father is ill, and according to a local doctor the only thing that can cure him is some healing water far away.In short, the story won't woah you at all, but it's simple enough to get you engaged.Dialog: There is none, you'll either dislike that or you won't mind it. Personally I don't see a reason to complain about it, infact it honestly goes well with this game.Graphics: The visuals and artstyle is definitely one of this game's strongest points, every location you go to throughout this adventure is so beautifully crafted and diverse. Gameplay: I like to compare this game with Prince of Persia but without attacking and you control two characters instead of just one.You control the 2 brothers with your analog sticks, one for each brother. Each brother also uses the triggers for actions in the game, again one for each. This might catch you offguard at first, but you'll get use to it with time and it allows for very interesting puzzle solving.Final note: One thing I would like to mention is that this game is quite short, shorter than what I would like. There is so much potential to have this adventure expand even more in between, but at least it never felt repetitive as it is.Anyways, definitely a Must Buy. Beautiful visuals, engaging gameplay and a lasting impact.			"

												Brothers is a story-driven action/3D-platformer adventure. You guide two sons across a dark fairy-tale realm, in search of a magical ingredient that will save their widowed father from an illness.- Gameplay is what makes this game unique: You control both brothers with a single gamepad (highly recommended), using the analogue sticks to move the brothers and one button to interact with the world. That's all! You'll need to synchronize the brothers' actions and use each ones advantages to move across the story. You can also play co-op, e.g. one player on keyboard and the other on gamepad. The puzzles are usually pretty simple to figure out, but some can be a bit hard to pull off. But, don't worry, the game autosaves frequently, so you can die as much you want. Finally, note that there's no text in this game, neither written nor spoken: there's some made-up language heard, but you'll only have visual clues about what to do next. - Story is linear, simple but beautiful. The world-theme might seem like a fairy tale, but be warned that there's a lot of mature content in the game. Tears came to my eyes several times, but there was also a few laughs :) Note that the game is a bit short, i.e. it takes 3-5hrs to complete it. I did a second playthrough to get the achievements, which were usually small branches off the main story, that you might not notice.- Visuals are FANTASTIC; Unreal Engine at its best. Can't really describe this, so you'll just have dive into the story and get blown away! The world is magnificent and varying, in the ~8 chapters of the story. The camera-rotation is smooth but might be annoying to some.- Audio is fine in overall. The music is beautiful, but not omni-present in the game; I think it could do with more music. As I said, there's some made-up language used in the game, which might annoy you at times: The brothers have a tendency to call out to one-another when they're separated!I highly recommend this game to lovers of action-adventures, with a sensitive vein. EDIT -- The controls worked right, with the exception of one (non game-breaking) glitch: Sometimes the big brother would interact with the world (thus re-starting small cut-scenes) when I moved both brothers in tight spaces with the analog sticks. This was most likely due to me using x360ce emulator to make my PS-styled gamepad compatible with the game.			"

												Another, hopefully, short affair, this time filled with FEELS in the vein of the To The Moons and Icos of this world. Excellent graphics courtesy of Unreal Engine, which also means it runs full 60fps at 1080p without hiccups.A pleasant experience indeed, tailored almost exactly for those whose backlog is hopelessly big: it gives you the illusion you can actually go through the backlog!Heavily recommended although the dual control of the bros takes a bit to get used to and by the time you DO get used to it, the whole thing is finished.

												This is a fairy tale of a game. There's nothing terribly complex or unique about it, but at the same time there's something endearing to it. It's a brief experence, to its benefit, and no part of the game overstays its welcome, I feel. Mechanics that utilize the two-character controls are introduced and dropped before they get stale. The general ""plot"" is pretty unremarkable, but like any fairy tale I wasn't really expecting it to be super special. The artstyle is pretty simple but the landscapes do look pretty great. There's little benches strewn about that do nothing but pan over the vistas, but you'll find youself wanting to sit in them for a bit anyways. The music is also pretty good, especially during chapters 3 and 4. but by the end of the game I found myself wishing there was a little more variety to it.Locales are kind of connected together in a way that doesn't seem terribly cohesive, but the variety in types of places that you visit, especially for such a short game, it pretty nice.  I also like that the achievements are just little extra/optional things that you'll find yourself doing in the world naturally without searching around corners and stuff for game-y collectables or something. Not too much of a time investment to experience and no frustration. I suggest everyone willing just gives it a playthrough to wind down after work one day or something.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.  It took me about 2hrs to complete but in that short space of time i felt so engrossed in it.  Never before have i felt what the character in a game would be feeling at that moment, whether that be the the fear of the younger brother entering water or the protectiveness of the older brother ferrying him across or the sheer glee of riding a billy goat across a mountain.  Couple that with a unique and highly enjoyable puzzle platforming experience and you would have to be mad not to buy this game!A controller is needed to play this game but if you have one you have no excuse.

												So sad; this story is just so sad. So good; but so sad. *sigh*+ Beautiful Graphics.+ Excellent soundtrack, really sets the mood of the gameplay.+ Good story. Sad, but good.+ Intuitive controls. I thought it would be weird to control two characters at the same time, but it worked great with my controller.+ Got to ride a mountain sheep/goat, that was fun!+ Story was easy to follow, even without comprehensible dialogues. - Puzzles are too simple.- Short, about 3 - 4 hours long.I cannot believe that I left this game in my backlog for so long. And I am so glad that I decided to play this today. I absolutely loved it. I hated that the game made me dug a grave for my brother and buried him too, because it made me extra sad, but I loved the game in its entirety.Worth buying at full price. A steal, if you can get it in a sale.My Rating: 10/10			"

												Brothers is such a good game I cant recommend enough! With a new style of gameplay which is new and intriguing, A story that will make most people cry or at the very least feel upset/emotional . This is a gem thats worth your money.It's not long and the achievements are fairly easy but for a 4~hour story its worth it. the controll system is confusing at first but it fun to adapt too. The story and sounds are the Highlight of the game for me. The art style is another thing which is  great in its own way.The game does have very minor bugs and animation issues but they are so small its unnoticeable.100/100 Highly Recommend!			"

												Genre - Action Puzzle/Adventure GameShort, sweet and beautiful. The game uses limited interactions but enough to make you feel involved in the story. You follow two brothers as they try to save their Dad.  You need a controller to better control both brothers at once. It took me about 3 hours but there are a few achievments to search for afterwards if you are that way inclined, maybe adding another couple of hours to your gametime. Due to how professionally the game appears to have been made and the unique style it is definately worth an investment and playthrough though.P.S. The morale of the story appeared to be a woman can get you where you need to go but never really trust her...			"

												What does Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons have in common with Unreal Tournament, Killing Floor, America’s Army, and Brothers in Arms :Road to Hill 30? Good question being all of the latter are blood filled death fueled first person shooters. Answer :They all use Epic’s Unreal engine. And this threw me for a loop. Being used to playing violent shooters, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons grasped me like any game in recent memory rarely has and captivated me for all of its four and a half hour story. It was like coming from a crash diet of Bawlz or Mountain Dew Amp, and switching to herbal tea. The game concerns a simple story of two sons attempting to find a magic serum to heal their dying father. They meet with misadventure along the way, but never fail to stay the course. Told entirely through exposition (there is no discernable dialogue in the game whatsover) the player uses a gaming controller to control the actions of the two boys. One stick represents the taller and stronger brother who is able to assist his younger smaller brother into high places, and the other stick represents the smaller brother who is able to squeeze into tighter spaces to press levers, open gates, etc. to allow his older brother entry. A charming little tutorial starts the show and gently eases the player into the game mechanics. Don’t worry, it’s far easier than it sounds. I never had to access a walk through, and I only got stuck one time. I took a breath and reapproached the problem and then it came to me. I did die twenty-two times, but not once did I feel the game cheated. Death was usually a lesson learned. And strangely even though I died several times it was a relatively easy game to get through. The story is definitely the thing. Speaking of story, it unfurled before me and captivated me like watching Labyrinth, or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, or the obscure, The Company of Wolves. These are wonderful fantasy movies I saw in theaters years ago and remember never wanting them to end. This game isn’t a deep game, which isn’t a surprise considering its short playtime. It does, however, exude a wonderful ambience which is augmented by a beautiful soundtrack. If you’re a fan of Stars of the Lid or Sigur Ros you’ll find the soundtrack as splended as I did. At the story’s end I found myself a victim of my own emotions. I find it great that a computer game can make me feel that way. I want to revisit this place especially since it left me painfully pining for more background, lore and history of the wonderful place that could only exist in literature or art. This game is truly a testament to the old maxim, less is more.			"

Posted: December 22, 2015
												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a third-person linear co-op game and inspired by games such as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus due to their similarities in gameplay and aesthetics. The premise of the game is following two brothers, Naie (eldest) and Naiee (youngest), through their journey across different lands searching for a magical tree which has the cure that can save their dying father. Being a very narratively driven game, revealing any details about the story would ruin much of the game’s charm since that is its main driving force.The game plays exactly like a co-op puzzle-platformer where you control the two brothers through their journey. Throughout the game, using a controller is strongly recommended as playing it on keyboard, whilst still doable, can result in some awkward coordination between the two controllable protagonists when they start bumping into each other or objects like two drunks. The actual gameplay itself is satisfying due to the nice blend of “puzzles” requiring both brothers’ participation throughout most of the game. The difficulty of these “puzzles” may eventually feel disappointing after a while as they do not provide any concrete challenge to the player(s) (hence the inverted commas), although that might have been deliberate for the integrity of the game’s pace. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is, indeed, one of those games where the difficulty requires being at a minimum for the narrative to be at full throttle. Remember, no one wants to get constantly stuck solving complex puzzles in a narratively-driven game as it subsequently ruins the game’s pace.However, where it lacks in challenging puzzles or even perhaps rewarding gameplay, it compensates for its narrative which in actual fact is the heart of this game. The journey, albeit disappointedly short, transports you in a world where you believe you are in a place like Middle-Earth; travelling through various mesmerising landscapes on your quest for the cure while the suiting soundtrack plays in the background. All of its narrative is achieved rather through visuals and gestures as there is not any comprehendible dialogue in the entire game. That in itself is commendable as not many games can pull it off as successfully as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons does. Frankly, each gesture or visual representation is easily and surprisingly understandable. Besides all that, the game also offers in its storytelling a handful of moments of happiness, laughter, seriousness and sadness without feeling schizophrenic with its mood shifts. The game‘s narrative can have some amazing set-pieces, but also a couple of clumsy ones.And that is as much as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons can offer to players. On top of its colourful charm, or even some of its darker undertones, there are two main complains I personally had with this game in my first playthrough which ultimately felt detrimental to an extent towards my overall enjoyment. On a technical level, I encountered three game-breaking bugs which would not allow me to continue to the next area. Whilst two of them were solved by looking up online forums, the latter required restarting two prior chapters since simply restarting the current one was not sufficient to solve the problem. As of now, I still have no idea how those bugs triggered when it seems that the majority of people never even encountered them in the first place. Still, having to restart two complete chapters is bothersome. Then lastly, the ending. I will honestly be one of those in the minority who was not totally satisfied with the story’s conclusion nor did it have an impact on me. Even as I wish to critically evaluate it in this review, I cannot do that without simply spoiling it. But I will say this: I understood what they tried to achieve with the coming of age approach, but reflecting back through the entire journey, the writing at this point was sloppy and felt more of a cop out in the end to me. It also made me realise how Naie was not fleshed out as a character as much as his younger brother, Naiee, making a certain event not as effective as the developers would have hoped for, to me at least. Perhaps that is because the story might have been moving a bit too fast for things to fully develop.   Conclusively, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one those video games where you delve in exclusively for the storytelling experience. Nothing more, nothing less.  Without even sounding remotely pretentious, It is hardly the “masterpiece” everyone clams it to be, although it will definitely, and respectfully, leave a lasting impression for many people regardless, especially for youngsters. But not for everyone. Mechanically, it has a solid co-op experience with extremely easy puzzles to solve and backed up by artistically appealing sceneries, a fitting soundtrack and a simple, yet immersive, narrative despite a few clumsy set-pieces and a somewhat unsatisfying ending. At full price, however, I would definitely not recommend this due to its short length (2-3 hours at most) and limited replayability as there is not much reason to revisit it anytime soon now that you know how the story wraps up. Conversely, considering it always goes as low as £1 during virtually any Steam sales, there is absolutely no excuse not to try this, and that is why I am recommending it in the end. Despite some of its flaws, I truly had fun playing it and thought it managed to do what it was aiming for mostly pretty well, even if I will probably not reflect too much upon it in the near future.

												A simple masterpiece.   Well, this game has been on my radar for quite some time and i decided to purchase it in the summer sale. Job well done , me. x Graphics are stunning.x Story is simple yet elegant.x Voice acting is non-existant which makes this game so different than others and when interacting with other characters in the game and performing a strange task , it makes you think why and you end up with a billion answers.x Controller needed , because you control 1 brother with the left stick and the other with the right stick.x The two sons 's bond is strongly noticed.x Puzzles are easy - tricky - oh that's what i'm supposed to do? - now that's plain awesome - how did they think that? x Devs are praized every 10 minutes.x Just buy it . It's on sale right now !!!      [ DeathEagle Approves ]			"

												A very short & bittersweet game that is full of heart and touching moments despite the fact that the language is intentionally made-up gibberish but the beauty of it all is that you can still understand what's going on without knowing what's being said. It is also one of the saddest games I've ever played.During the 3 or so hours that it will take you to complete the game you'll trek across picturesque landscapes filled with wonder and danger as you solve simple yet clever puzzles by controlling both brothers (use of a gamepad is strongly recommended). You'll also encounter a lonely and sad troll-like being who helps you navigate the environment and whom in turn you help by rescuing his captured mate. At another point you can stop a heartbroken man from commiting suicide and help him to come to terms with the death of his loved ones. It's no wonder that the game won Best Xbox Game at the VGX 2013 awards :)9/10			"

												Finished the game in ~3 Hours. The chapter transitions are nothing but a simple fade to black then back to the game, so it can easily go un-noticed. I completed one of the chapters without even realising it and had to go back at the end for the achievemnts. The achievements are not too difficult and are some of the nicer achievements I've seen in a game.While I wouldn't say the story is unique, it is definitely gripping. You experience a roller coaster of emotions while playing this :) I used a keyboard to play, rather than the recommended controller, and the controls were pretty good. It was a little difficult to get used to controlling two characters at the same time but you get used to it pretty quickly. Overall a great experience, will definitely replay in the future. 8/10			"

												A fantastic novella-length adventure game, in which the clever gameplay is ultimately just a question of unfolding the story rather than an end in itself. I often dislike games of the scripted, on-rails type, but this one is perfectly paced and uniquely immersive. It lacks the courage and follow-through of what I assume must be its inspiration in Lindgren's ""Brothers Lionheart"", and because it is mute it is more abstract and like a fable, but as far as narratives in games go, this is 10/10.

												First of all, if you want to play this I recommend getting an xbox controller. Playing with a keyboard will only be conplicated and you won't get the 'amazing' experience as you will with a controller.Brothers is a rich and amazing story about two brothers going out on an adventure to save their sick father. On their way they make meet many hindrances, big and small, all tiny puzzles for you to figure out. The game is fairly easy, but a few scenes in the game can be quite graphic and brutal for younger players. Getting the hang of controlling the brothers can also be a bit tricky if you're not used to multitasking, as you will have to control two things at once, up to several occations.It is also fairly short, it took me about 3 hours to complete the story and under 1 hour to get all the achievements and ""secrets"" I had missed.All in all it is a game worth playing! For me a real tear jerker that I am happy to say I've completed.If you are a sucker for casual, but story rich games, you should definitely pick it up!			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one of the best examples of a small game with big heart. It looks beautiful and plays surprisingly fun, thanks to the unprecedented control scheme that immerse us to simple yet entertaining platforming and puzzle mechanics, and some engraving sequences along the way.More importantly it is an impressive and unforgettable journey. A journey about being a child, a journey about love and loss, a journey about courage, making sacrifices, saving turtles, loving all animals, a journey about witnessing violence and deception... and in the end it's a journey about growing up.A definite must-play!*Last update is just for Steam Awards.*			"

												A remarkable experience, one that I really thought achieved that much sought-after balance between compelling gameplay and compelling story, and like many great stories it's all about the journey. You control two brothers on a quest to find a cure for their ailing father, each brother controlled simultaneously with the left and right analog sticks on your controller (if ever there was an ad for getting a 360 / PS4 controller for your PC, this is it). It doesn't take long for your brain to adjust to this, although I found I had to keep the brothers on the same side as their analog stick to keep up! This isn't just a gimmick either, it really works, even to the extent of serving the story. There were times that I felt this was the best Tomb Raider game I'd played since the first one, that sense of edging around precarious drops and leaping between hand-holds, and the game exploits the co-op nature of your two characters well. It's also really spectacularly beautiful in places, and I kept wishing my Steam screen save button was working, but alas no. The game clocks in at just over three hours, but it feels right, almost like experiencing a great movie. The less said in any review about the actual story, though, the better. Just play it.			"

												I bought it on sale for $3.39. Definitely worth it. I went through it slowly and I lost a lot of time when I had to restart a chapter due to a glitch. There is probably only really about 4 hours of gameplay. Still, I think I'd have felt satisfied if I had paid full price.The mechanic of playing two characters simultaneously is something new and fun. The puzzles are never too hard and you're not likely to require a walkthrough. It's really pretty. It manages to create a real sense of attachement to the characters as they go through so much to try to save their father.Be warned, however, that it is VERY linear. It is not a wide-open world for you to explore, it is a story for you to play through but there is really one way to play this game. If you can't enjoy that, even with great visuals and storytelling, buy another game.Spoiler Do not read this if you intend to play the game No, really, really don't. It's for people like me, who have finished the game:  When big brother dies and you have to use the controller to controll just little brother for the first time since the beginning of the the game, it's really emotionally affecting. Suddenly playing with just one character now seems as odd as playing with two did at the beginning. That emptiness of somebody who should be there and who isn't is the closest I have ever felt to having a loved one die that didn't actually involve having a loved one die (yes, speaking from experience). Not for everyone, I guess, but a game that does something I've never seen before and made me feel something I didn't think a game could.  "

It was really really wonderful.Thirdly, There is nice story with unusual creatures. I liked the plot twists with giants, cave trolls, invisible yeti, a huge owl, etc.Fourthly, there is awesome music. I have added soundtrack to my usual playlist.Fifthly, The game is short. I have passed this game for 3 hours. I think everybody can find such a small amount of time for this true gem.I recommend this game for everyone!I promise you unforgettable feelings!			"

Worth your time, but don't expect a masterpieceI usually don't write reviews, but as I was playing this game, I felt so conflicted about the experience that I had to share my opinion. Perhaps I didn't enjoy the game as much as I could have, because, looking at the reviews, I expected the game to be outstanding, which I don't think it is.I'll skip the basic explanation of the game and jump straight to an overview of what I liked and disliked about Brothers.The review will be free of any explicit spoilers, but if you have not played the game and want to know as little as possible about its content, I suggest you stop reading right here.Pro Atmosphere - Although it could have been a little more diverse in places, the world designed for Brothers is vivid and feels very much alive. The graphical fidelty is pretty average, but the scenery constructed by the designers is downright beautiful at times. It is often highlighted through the use of specific camera angles (e. g. when sitting on benches). Characters - The characters in this game, especially the brothers, are very expressive, despite being somewhat stereotypical. Their character traits and emotions are well portrait through their animations and manner of speech. Storytelling - Brothers relies mostly on visual storytelling, but it also features good voice acting, which makes use of a fantasy language. This puts emphasise on the emotions of the charaters' rather than the content of their utterances. In the game's last chapter, it manages to cleverly use the control scheme and gameplay as a storytelling device, which is arguably its greatest achievement. Gameplay variations - You'll encounter different modes of travel throughout the game, which shake things up a little. When they actually affect the gameplay in a meaningful way, it creates some great moments (e. g. rowing, rope climbing). Checkpoint system - The game auto-saves at checkpoints which are reasonably placed and thus minimize frustation when you die, which happens rarely. The game also allows you to revist specific chapters, without having to play it all over again, which is good. Achievements - The achievements in this game are all actual rewards for doing optional things in the game world. They  are mostly well designed and encourage exploration. And there aren't too many, which allows you to 100% the game without too much effort. Many games get achievements wrong, Brothers really gets this right.Neutral Music - The music in this game is what you would expect. Sometimes it is a little too cliché, but it fits the scenery and story well. Nothing memorable here. Soundeffects - These fit the scenery just fine, but the sounds uttered by the brothers throughout are too repetitive and annoying, whichs degrades the overall impression of the soundeffect quality.Con Puzzles - Most of the obstacles presented to you in this game are puzzle type challenges. But they offer very limited options and are too simplistic. Not once did I stop to think more than a few seconds to solve any given puzzle. The game also utilizes only a handful of puzzle elements and reuses them a bit too often. I suspect they could have gotten more variety out of the mechanics at hand. Difficulty - The challenges presented to you apart from the puzzles are of a platforming nature, except they lack any challenge, as you aren't even allowed to fail in most instances. Altough it is quite clear, that requesting extreme precision as you are controlling two characters is not a good idea, these parts could also have been a bit more challenging. What is the point of slowly balancing over branches or treading along cliffs, when the user input is of no relevance? At no point does the game request any kind of mastery of its unique control scheme, which is a letdown. Length - As a consequence of my last two points and despite the general consesus, I think this game could have actually been shorter. Most of the time is spent walking or climbing and simply offers too little in terms of actual gameplay. Sure, a lot of it contributes to the exploration of the game's interesting world and is part of the visual storytelling, but if all the game wants to offer is a story, why make me walk through it at all? Movies do just fine at visual storytelling. (Minor) Bugs - Besides a few visual inconsistencies I once caused an object to get stuck, which forced me to restart from the last checkpoint.I'm sure I've overlooked an aspect or two, but this should serve as an overview of the game's strenghts and weaknesses and what to expect from it.I may have focused too much on actual gameplay, but I firmly believe that it should be the first concern when designing a truly interactive experience. The streamlined feel of the game and its low difficulty are probably intended to let the player experience the story unobstructed. I still wish it would have been a bit more challenging at times.Overall, Brothers is a precisely crafted and emotional experience well worth the few hours it takes to complete it. It's gameplay, although well polished, would benefit from some added variety and challenge.It is no masterpiece, but on a binary rating scale, it is definitively a 'thumbs up'.I wouldn't say it quite deserves its MetaScore of 90. I would rate it somewhere around 75/100.Still, it's a recommended buy on a discount for everyone that can appreciate a story-driven game.			"

												I'm not going to surprise anyone, I guess, by saying that I recommend you play this game. No matter who you are and what kinds of games you like, you really should give this one a try. It's a must-play.The game's biggest asset is the story and how the mechanics are interwined with the story. The game never offers too much of a challenge, but its innovative ""each-stick-controls-one-character"" approach is, at times, challenging enough to get used to. Once you get a hold of that, the puzzles are unlikely to stump you. This is a relaxing experience, which is there to be seen and played by yourself, while focusing on what's going on. Watching a playthrough of this short game is doing yourself an unimaginable disservice.Pretty much everything else also works incredibly well in this game. The art direction and design proves to me again that video games do not need anything more than the tried-and-true Unreal Engine 3 - they ""just"" need imagination, and vision. Sure, it's easier to say that we need more detailed graphics and lightning effects to convey emotions and atmosphere, because that doesn't demand any artistic input in the game's style... well, Brothers is proof that this standpoint is plain wrong, and if a game has a boring visual design, not even next-gen graphics are going to make it look better than Brothers does. The game is gorgeous, and each of the different locations you'll visit is uniquely attractive, while conveying the theme in a near perfect way.The soundtrack also helps a lot in building the game's atmosphere. It is one of the best I heard in recent years, and definitely unique in its own way. This is the first time I heard an OST so dipped in northern-european themes. The vocals do most of the heavy lifting to establish this feeling, but not a single track sounds like it doesn't fit into the overarching goal of the music. Not only a spot-on supplement to everything else in this game, it is an achievement on its own. You can buy the OST over at BandCamp and I highly recommend you do that.What more is there to say? This may not be the best game of all time, or even the most moving one, or the most influential one - but that doesn't change the fact that it is a must-have.			"

												A truly unique epic platforming experience. I enjoyed every second of this game, unable to stop playing until I had fully completed every part of it. At first I thought I'd never get used to the control layout but once you start playing, it becomes so fluent. While nothing is in English (or any language known to man for that matter), the emotions and actions of each character conveys what they're saying perfectly, not at any point was I confused as too what was going on. I can't recommend this game enough and while I got it at a bargain during the sale for only £1.09, this game is worth so much more. Starbreeze Studios, you have my blessing to create further masterpieces as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is simply wonderful.			"

												Beautiful game, really enjoyed it overall, it isn't long but I took my sweet time with it. The controls are really fun, though it took me a while to get used to - right analog stick/ trigger for the younger brother, and the left side for the older brother, it really feels like you're completing things and helping each other out.The scenery is really good, but this brings out one of my main gripes with the game, the camera is pretty bad and although I can understand it's hard to have better camera control because you have two characters at once, there certainly could be improvement and the inconsistent camera movement (you can only turn the view right and left, and in many areas you can't even change the view) made me dizzy at times.All in all, a good game that was way worth the 70% I got it at, but I wouldn't say it's a ""must-play"" or anything, just a pretty game with a decent story.

A great little game!   Art style is fantastic and will give you some beautiful backdrops. Game itself isn't that challenging, the puzzles are easy but that isn't that important seeing the emphasis is on the story.  Story is great, played it in one sitting just couldn't put the controller down. Speaking of controllers... It is best you play with one, the controls are awkward in the beginning but you'll get used of it in the first half hour.   Wouldn't mind seeing another game from them. Just hope they don't focus too much on the gimmicky controls but just deliver another great story. Way too little games out there with great stories!   A must play I would say.			"

Those controls are also cleverly used to make you even more immersed in the story. And the feels...			"

												""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" is a journey through fable-like world that focuses on inducing variety of emotions. The environment is very scenic, often having you traveling high up and admiring beautiful landscapes. It's inhabited with trolls, giants, griffins and other mythical creatures. Everywhere you go there's always something nice to look at. The camera's position often emphasizes the best fragments of a scene. It's not photo-real, but definitely eye pleasing and charming. You control both brothers at once - left hand for the older one, right hand for the younger. Many puzzles rely on syncing them well together. For me that was something new. Personally I had to keep them on the left&right sides of the screen in accordance with the control scheme. Whenever they switched positions due to my running around, my brain just went out of whack and chaos followed. I had to slow down and reposition them to be able to continue comfortably.The puzzles themselves are fairly easy. Some variants are recycled throughout the game. There is no greater planning involved and you solve many as you go. There is also no backtracking, so even if you're not sure how to tackle a specific problem, in most cases solution would present itself after simply going a little further. I feel that puzzles are just meant to be a way of reinforcing the bond between brothers and making player more attached through gameplay. Most of them require both protagonists working at the same time or in a longer alternating sequence.The reception of the story differs from person to person. Many people got their hopes up by other reviews/opinions and were disappointed. Others were ecstatic. For me the general experience is above average, that's for sure. Also the ending squeezed a tear out of me or two, so the narration trough gameplay mostly did it's job. But I didn't experience strong emotional response from the beginning to the end like some. Still I find the whole journey enjoyable and well worth my time.The game is pretty linear. No choices to be made, no events that can be prevented or played out differently. Apart from the main task that the boys are focused on, you can interact with many objects or NPCs and observe separate animations for each brother. Those do not affect anything, but make the world feel more alive and characters more fleshed out. All the inhabitants communicate in a made up gibberish sounding language, so the gestures and body language are especially important.The whole world might look like it's fable-like, but in reality it's quite harsh. Brutal and cruel at times even. Good things happen, then bad things happen. You save someone, someone will die as a direct result of helping you (or even a worse scenario). One has the impression that no good deed goes unpunished. Sometimes you won't be able to help - you'll just witness the effects of a tragedy that already took place. You meet both friendly NPCs, and mean or outright ill willed & hostile ones. Although there are very few moments in the whole game that actually pose any danger (story wise, not from manually letting go a ledge or other mechanics associated deaths).Completing the game takes about 3-4 hours, even when interacting with every possible object/person. So it's quite short. There is no need to replay it, other than experiencing the exact same story again if you really were swept away by it. If you have a chance to grab it on a sale - I wouldn't hesitate, fully recommended. At full price, I would say it's not for everyone. Definitely for people that can appreciate the emotional content and enjoy the journey aspect without making fuss about easy difficulty, length or minor issues - basically, recommended for informed customers :)Subjective Assessment - 7.5 (more than nice, not yet great)[utilizing full 1-10 scale, where 5 means average]			"

												Brother - A Tale of Two Sons reminds me of Papo & Yo in that the short story is both moving and powerful. The game showcases a unique 2 character control element that I haven't experienced in a single player game before. It takes a little getting used to, but it ends up working pretty well after a little practice. The visuals and camera work are both pretty amazing with some areas being absolutely breathtaking. The journey of Brothers is quite a remarkable and memorable experience and definitely gets a nod of approval from me.			"

												All I heard abouth Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons were, ""its a great game"", ""good storyline"", ""a must play game"" etc. But what they didn't tell you is that the story will rip your feelings to shreds. It'll bring you to the point of tears more than once with the story. You're happy for a minute then you're absolutely depressed the next.Starbreeze Studios and Josef Fares made a masterpiece of a game here. With excellent graphics, soundtrack, storyline, unique gameplay mechanics and all that it just feels so perfect.The controls for the two brothers is at first a tad confusing (I used PS3 controller) but the gameplay makes you master it with time.There's puzzles, platforming, wonderful/sad story, immersive world, great soundtrack, good game mechanics colorful characters to fall in love with plus you get to ride a Mountain Goat (awesome stuff for real). So be prepared to set some time free to play the game in one sitting to soak in its immersive world.I give this game 9/10 (-1 for bringing a grown♥♥♥♥♥adult on the verge of crying)PS: If Jess Mcdonell says a game is good, then it is good =P And also don't forget to ""color"" the left out bunnie black!

												An enchantingly lovely storyline that draws you into each scene can only be outdone by illustrations like those in this 4-way winner. Graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, and story are intertwined to provide a strong and unforgettable experience for the adult player, Without spoiling any of the scenes, it is emotion-rich in moments... the everyday moments 2 sons experience, which are usually relived year after year in their own memories, and the memories of those who were witnesses (such as Mothers of sons, like me.) This tale has moments that will surprise and delight you, as well as moments that will make you cry. Beyond all that feel-good stuff is the gameplay. Puzzles and platforming will keep you immersed in this other-world/ other time motif of minecarts and stone walkways until you find yourself at the end of the game with only regrets that it's over. This is my 2nd experience with Brothers, as I already complted it on the PS3 COnsole. I had to have it again on STEAM for the art experience. I hope trading cards are in the works. :)			"

												This is without a doubt one of my favorite games, if not the best of them all. To begin with the story is beautiful and really well done. Without the risk of spoiling any of the story I can tell you it's about two sons who lives with their father who gets deadly sick one day and needs the special water from the Tree of Life far far away, that is your quest in this game, and that will lead to a lot of danger and big adventures. When I went out on the adventures as the two sons I first noticed how beautiful the graphic is, it's like running through paintings or fairytales and it reminds me a lot about Trine in that way, though with its on touch of course!  I also realised how big the world really felt like while playing even if it's a quite liniar game. Outside of the liniarity there is a lot you can choose to explore which can give various achievements that won't be achieved by doing the main story. The good thing about this is that it wont interrupt you on your quest. Speaking of the quest you will be doing alot of puzzle and who says no to a little challenge while playing, am I right? I know that people say it's a bad thing for this game being so short, but I must say I didn't really feel that way while playing, actually I got so absorbed in to the game that the time it took to finish it didn't really matter to me. This is what I can tell you, and with this I take my leave and say ""BUY THIS GAME!"". /Sow			"

												Beautiful fairytale wih a very Nordic feel to it. Gorgeous landscapes and scenery, smooth gameplay if you are good with multitasking with a controller, old school and simplistic and yet surprisingly fresh, vibrant and meaningful. The puzzles are incorporated into the enviroment and feels natural and logical, never forced as to just give the gamer more gametime.Reminiscent of classic Grimm stories, there's darkness here amids the beauty, but unlike those stories there's plenty of very moving scenes compared to the somewhat unempathic Grimm-tales of old.Also surprises along the path which deviate from the clichés we've come to expect from almost all things fairytale.A gem.

												I had been meaning to play this game for a while but never got around to it. It wasn't until a friend of mine posted on my Steam profile telling me to give it a go did I seriously download it on my laptop and made a genuine effort to put some time into it. The first thing that you'll notice about this game is that there's no real spoken dialogue. I mean the characters do make sounds and seem to have some verbal exchanges but it's more like Simlish. If The Sims has taught us anything in the last 20ish years though is that you don't need to understand the language to understand a story. This is actually the biggest lesson I'm reminded of as I live somewhere where I don't understand what 90% of the people around me are saying on a daily basis, but I digress. Brothers features a beautiful rustic fantasy atmospheric adventure almost as if it was straight out of a fairy tale. You and your brother go on a journey across the land to find a tree that could save your dying father's life. Despite it being primarily about our two main characters and their journey you get to meet a lot of different inhabitants that help you along the way. Also you see the relationship and personalities between the younger and older brother in how they interact with each other and those they meet. You'll find both have skills that move the game along. As we all know the older brother excels in strength you find out early on that the little brother also has some advantages due to his size and pulls just as much as weight as his counterpart. Somewhere along the way though you'll find out that despite the cheery magical surroundings that the fairy tale aspect might be more ancient fairy tales where things don't always work out the way you expect it would and not the Disney type where people live happily ever after. That however, makes this game all the more compelling as at some point I was playing through tears. This isn't too much a spoiler but I think when a game can elicit emotional responses without saying a word that speaks volumes of the story and characters.I was sad when my adventure finally came to an end but I felt satisfied and a real sense of growth in the characters without any leveling up system or super powers. Overall you have great graphics, a touching story with endearing characters. It was a pleasure to play, even with the sometimes unfamiliar controller mechanics where you're using each side to move both brothers simultaneously. I wholeheartedly recommend this game as one everyone should experience.			"

												If there was ever a game to bring up in the ""games as art"" debate this would be it. Not because of its graphics or story (even tho both are great) but because of the way it uses interactivity to tell its story in a way that no other medium could have done.At its core Brothers is a puzzle game with a unique control scheme. You play as two brothers on a quest to find a cure for their sick dad and each brother is controlled using one of your analog sticks. This takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it you get to experience some really cool puzzles that are all based on the fact that you're controlling two characters at the same time.I can't write a review that comes even close to doing it justice so I'll just say that Brothers is one of my favorite games ever made. It's a complete masterpiece and a couple of moments in the game gave me shivers and almost brought me to tears. On the other hand I've seen playthroughs on youtube where the player doesn't have nearly the same reactions as I had to certain key points in the game, but yet they've all agreed that the game is amazing.Just go play the game for yourself. Worst case scenario you won't regret it and at its best it'll make you re-evaluate what can be done with videogames.			"

												Words cannot describe this game, but I can try to offer some words which can be a bit too shallow for this experience.The game is playable with Keyboard, but using a Controller is best; you should also look into rebinding the keys for a more comfortable layout. The mouse is not needed.Now, the game is pretty solid, it's about 3 hours and 25 minutes long with a few deaths, and the price point of 14 euros can make it an odd choice for some. Not to fret, the game brings beautiful environments, intriguing places, and smart puzzles which aren't extremely hard to solve after you get used on how the two brothers work. (Now that the game has a bit of age behind it, you can find it heavily discounted in sales!)And the story, I can't say anything without spoiling it, and honestly, it's best to go with an empty mind. The story will hit you like a bag of bricks, and when you think it stopped, it will whack you again over the head just to be sure it hit you enough.Play it, I doubt people will feel any regrets after playing this.

												This was an epic journey of two brothers that set out to find the water of health for there ailing father .Many trials and puzzles as they journey far beyound there village.The game calls for a controller but can be played with a keyboard.I used 2 keyboards  using the w-s-a-d keys and space bar and my wife co-oping with me using the arrow keys and right control as the younger brother.Can be done with one keybpard trust me.A very dearing tale that has somewhat of a sad ending .I would recommend this game for its story and visual fantasy.Since it is a short story I would not buy unless it was on sale.I purchased it for $4.49 during the Steam Christmas holiday sale.

												I cannot believe how much this game touchs you and pulls at your heartstrings. I have never in all my life played a game that made me openly weep for about 30 minutes. The game is just such an emotional and thrilling experience, it is worth every moment you play it. I would suggest if you were to play this game, I would play it in one sitting, because I believe the impact will be far greater than it would if you had a break from the game. I will not say much more, only that people should BUY this game! Everyone owes it to themself to play this game. Wow.... such emotion. Fantastic game.			"

												By finishing this game you will learn a few things:- Love blinds. Love hurts. Love kills.- You will cry. Of sorrow and happiness. You will be literally drowning in tears. You will learn how to survive that. I just finished the game and I'm still crying. Even if you are not as sentimental as me, you will not be able to hold it. Otherwise, you are a horrible monster.- You will also grow up.- As long as your beloved ones are in your memory they are alive.10/10			"

												A quest of the two eponymous characters to find a magical cure for their ill father, where you get to control both of them at the same time in a sort of puzzle-lite third persons' view co-operating-with-yourself adventure game.It's essentially a very visceral, very interactive fairy tale. The control scheme, the environmental puzzles with quite obvious solutions to push the story forward.. It is all about creating practically a physical bond between you and the brothers, via the controller, to feel their struggle quite personally.The tale takes you to strange places along the way. That also includes variety of emotional places, there are times to be happy, and to be sad, and perhaps to be scared, too. And it can get very intense at all of them. Yes, this is definitely about the journey not the destination. Even the achievements accentuate exploration and doing side activities not on the main storyline - this is exactly what you get rewarded for. You get exactly zero achievements for the main ""quest"" (which probably also serves to well, avoid spoilers).All this means you are doing everybody a great disservice if you're just watching some let's play or something. I think any single player game with a story is meant to be a GAME, therefore something for you to experience personally not via watching others do it (unless you've done it already and want to relive via someone elses eyes), but this is especially true in this title.It's best experienced in one go, to keep you in the emotional flow, it's at most 4 hours long if you like to smell flowers along the way (you can even literally do just that at places.. well not YOU-you but you know what I mean, the characters you play as) and you probably wouldn't want to leave a movie in the middle and come back later, would you?Also, it's obviously designed with a twin stick controller in mind, controlling each brother with one of the sticks and triggers. For example things like cranking a winch are just felt more personally if you're actually ""cranking"" your sticks. But - it does have keyboard bindings, WSAD for one brother and arrow keys for the other, so it actually is playable without a controller despite the warning on the Steam page, you're just somewhat missing out and I imagine keyboard control can be rather frustrating, I mean even the twin sticks almost cross that line often but luckily the game isn't hard so that's never an issue.Seriously if you're a PC gamer and do not have a controller yet, then you were asking Santa Klaus or your regional equivalent for wrong things. Because you are missing out in titles that were designed primarily with controllers in mind, and this game is perhaps the best example yet of just how much you're missing (otherwise the design with controller in mind usually just comes from a mild form of consolitis). But mind you, you don't need anything posh and expensive, you're probably somewhat worse by not having things like force feedback but otherwise there are pretty cheap controllers that do the job just as well, you may just need something like x360cemu if it's not an xinput controller.All in all, I highly recommend playing this game. I mean I'm personally not entirely sure why TotalBiscuit hails it as perhaps the best game of all time as far as he is concerned, it must have had much higher impact on him, but nonetheless it is truly a great gem, exemplifying of just how well controls can be integrated into a game, and how a game  can present you various emotional states not just cashing on one.

In short, is the game good?Yes. Very good.Is it worth my time and money?Yes. While the game is relatively short (can be completed in 4 hours during a normal playthru), the game sells a sense of ""woah"" to the player in large doses. Definitely worth the money. Alternatively, buy it when it goes on sale (like I did).Is this game for anyone?Yes, anyone can pick this up and play with ease. While the character controls are quite unique, they're pretty straightforward to learn and use. The puzzles aren't really hard, but because of the way they are executed, they bring a feeling of satisfaction.Linear, open-world or something else?Game's very linear. Not many branching paths, aside from a few puzzle sections involving slight backtracking.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?You use both analog sticks to move both of the brothers at the same time (left one controls one, right one controls the other). Can be confusing at first, especially when they'll be on the opposite screen-space from which side their analog stick is.Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?Very pretty to look at. The world is stylized to look like something between a fairy-tale fantasy land mixed with real medieval times. It all feels very well crafted and each section of the world smoothly transitions to the next.Audio design and soundtrack?Sound effects and ambiency is done well. A small settlement sounds like a small settlement, while a deserted castle sounds like a deserted castle. Music only plays in key points of the game, such as cutscenes, exposition, etc. but also sounds amazingly well done. A definite addition to the game's tone and atmosphere.Plot, story?Pretty basic, clearly inspired by fairy tales but with a few nice, yet predictable twists. Still, very enjoyable story that feels very well set into the created world. How does the game run?I played and completed the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, vNidia GeForce 9600GT 1GB) and it ran at a pretty stable 40-45fps on 1920x1080 resolution with V-Sync turned off. Expect better results if your PC is newer than mine.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes. The flying owl gryphon thing. Anything you didn't like?Yes. Options menu in the launcher is a joke. Definitely needs more graphical settings, especially since this is a Unreal Engine 3 game. Also, game does not support most cheap USB joypads (since the PC version apparently uses XInput signals instead of DirectInput signals). You either use keyboard, a 360 controller or download x360ce (the XBOX360 controller emulator) and configure your joypad through that. Extra hassle that could be easily avoided with a bit more work.Final score?I give Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons a flying owl gryphon thing out of 5.			"

Posted: February 8, 2015
												Let me start off by saying, don't expect much from this game. I feel like it is a game that could be victim to overhype.I went in merely with the intention of clearing some dreaded Steam backlog and hadn't seen anything about the game in over a year, forgetting how nice the screenshots looked.Therefore, going in with no expectations whatsoever, I came away having played one of, if not my favourite, game of all time.This game gets better and better as it goes on, so don't expect to be blown away from the start. It is the grand sense that I really had been on an adventure that was left with me at the end, and being 3-4 hours long it feels like I had taken part in an interactive movie (having played it in one sitting). But it is definitely a game, and the gameplay was just the right amount of fun. A lot of clever design choices means the game continually flows, adding to that sense of adventure. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, but never did I feel like I was having my intelligence insulted either.  There were times when I anticpated having to do something again, or something similar to what I had just done and had a feeling of tedium, only to be pleasantly surprised that the developers recognised that, and changed it up completely.  I wish more developers would recognise that a game doesn't have to be long and filled with fluff to make it good. Three hours of quality is plenty for someone with limited time to play games.The story isn't complex but it will leave an impression on most people. And how they go about conveying that story was also a clever touch. The game has no understandable dialogue, using only an invented language with no subtitles to get it's message across and I'm surprised at how well it does this when, in my opinion, the character models are the worst part of the game. They look out of place against the fantastic backdrops that make you stop and sit on a bench to look at the vistas, even when you were planning on rushing through a game to get it off your checklist. So at first, I wasn't struck. However, despite this, the sense of emotion you get from the characters is really rather deep and by the end you're completely invested. Most of the game is spent in third person and you won't be up close enough to see the poor character details anyway.The other thing most people will comment on are the controls. You control both brothers, from different sides of the keyboard and I can see why a lot of people will mark them down negatively. It is often difficult to get them both running in merely a straight line. I argue though that the controls are perfect for the type of game it is and add a layer of complexity to it that stops the game feeling too easy. Like I said, the puzzles aren't difficult at all, but the controls make you have to think about what you're doing, and I have to say, the times when you simultaneously have both brothers doing something complex, or even just running down a path and crossing over each other and turning at slightly different times, but doing so accurately, feels really good.There are a few negative points to the game, a couple of which rear their head almost straight away. As mentioned, the character details aren't great. Then, you come to the first puzzle.  You have to raise a platform, and it's immensely tedious, especially if you let go, and you have to start again. This platform raising happens once more in the game, and if  anything is even more tedious. Maybe I did it wrong. But it's over in a couple of minutes and overall doesn't affect the game. Lastly, texture glitches. In two cutscenes, some textures didn't load. It was only a rug and a chest of drawers, so not game breaking, but noticable. Also in one part, a shadow didn't load that was part of the mechanics of the situation, and I died. I didn't realise why until I started again and saw the shadow now loaded.Overall, I can't believe I had this game sitting in my library for so long being unappreciated. I also feel bad for spending so little on it. I can't quite remember what I paid, but it probably wasn't enough. Play this game, don't expect much and you're sure to have a good time.			"

												One of the finest examples of video games as art (not to be confused with art as video games). Those who played ICO may find Brothers somewhat familiar: two characters with emotional connection helping each other, solving puzzles together, speaking language the player doesn't understand, travelling through breathtakingly beautiful places. With that said, Brothers is definitely not a clone, with its unique ""single-player co-op"" control scheme, and the story that takes you through the world that is reminiscent of the one from ""The Neverending Story"". Wonderful graphics that pushes Unreal Engine to the max thanks to the fantastic work of designers, beautiful dynamic soundtrack, emotional story, interesting puzzles and unique controls. Don't miss this gem of a game.			"

												This game is more about the story than any other thing. Graphics, music, story are beautifull very explicit and made my son cry.If you search for some diffucult platerformer, this is not for you. The game itself is not really difficult, puzzles goes from easy to medium at most and you can really take your time to do them. And it's a good thing because you control the big bro' with the left side of your controller and lil' one with the right side, witch seems quite odd at the beginning. You can get used to it but not really confortable with it and need to really think sometimes what hand you need to move. Controls are probably the most difficult thing in the game, but this game is not really about difficulty and really about the story and their journey together.I would recommend this game to anyone who like to take their time to discover a beautiful journey.

												An emotionally charged coming of age puzzle adventure.  If it doesn't bring tears of happiness / frustration / sorrow / joy to your eyes, I don't know what will!  It's not particularly challenging but buy it when it's on special for the play style, as a unique ""single player co-op"" (esp. if you have a controller with two sticks), or enjoy it as a simple interactive 2-player story on the same keyboard, as I did with my kids.  Just be aware, it does get quite dark and surreal / scary for kids, with drowning, family member loss and even suicide being very minor themes that might affect people sensitive to that sort of thing.  It is entirely linear, but many incidental obects and people can be interacted with by both brothers in different ways, and there are 12 side achievements you can work towards.  If for no other reason, the visual aesthetics and certain cut scenes are magnificent, making it a most enjoyable 4-6 hour journey.  I thoroughly recommend it!			"

												A couple of times you get to play a game that can make you feel completely worn down, emotionally speaking. This game did that for me. It doesn't happen that often, although there are some great titles out there that are as worth it as this one.Let me start by saying that the puzzles are not that difficult, which could be a turn-off for the hardcore gamers, but the game-play (controlling both brothers at the same time), narritive, surroundings and the story itself make up for it and then some.The way the characters just speak in what seems a 'made-up' or 'children's language', which you can understand instantly, is one of those points I really liked. I think it made the story stronger then with actual words in a spoken language.The story is about two brothers (surprise!) that have to work together to get a potion for their father who is sick and on the brink of death. To get this potion they have to travel through forests, mountains and ice-covered seas to get to the 'Tree of life'. On this journey they get help from surprising figures and have to help each other across rivers, canyons and other obstacles.And if any of the players say they did not tear up or even cried big tears at the end... well, they might have lied. I know I cried. Big time. Not with actual sobbing and runny nose, but still... A story about sacrifice, perseverence, hardship and an ending like that... Yeah, that just hit me hard.Nominated for the ""I'm not crying, there is something in my eye"" award!			"

												O jogo é lindo (enredo, paisagens, personagens, cutscenes, tudo). É um jogo curto e simples. Você controla dois irmãos, ao mesmo tempo. Sugiro que jogue com uma manete, por favor! A movimentação não exige muita complexidade, somente as direções, dois botões para mover a câmera e dois para as ações - um botão para cada irmão -, que variam de acordo com a situação. Depois de um tempo você se acostuma muito bem e não buga mais a sua mente controlando os dois garotos.   Você vai em busca de um objetivo, e para alcançá-lo você passa por diversas aventuras. Você está no mundo de Esopo, das fábulas. Todas as histórias que você já leu ou ouviu quando criança (tá, nem todas) estão colocadas de modo fantasioso no jogo, e que baita País das Maravilhas, com certeza.   Você passa por situações diversas, desafios e lugares diversos; e isso te deixa bastante envolvido no jogo de modo que o faça zerar em poucas horas. É muito interessante o modo com que você pode interagir com os personagens, criaturas, animais e objetos do jogo, cada irmão interage de uma forma.Talvez o final possa ser surpreendente para alguns jogadores, para outros não.

tl;dr version - Go get it! And if you can, play with a controller over a keyboard. (CAN be played with a keyboard despite the way it's been advertised)A beautiful game that's focused mostly on the story and creative ways to play rather than a challenging gameplay. This game can be emotional, funny, mysterious and epic. The whole game can be completed in a single sitting, yes it's short. But that doesn't make the game any less impressive. The story itself revolves around 2 brothers and the way they've implemented the controller to interact with them is simply brilliant. Hence it's highly recommended to be played with a controller over a keyboard. The game has a deep message behind it, about life, morality and overcoming struggles. And the music, I fell in love with it instantly as soon as I heard it. It's absolutely perfect. It knows when it needs to be serious, epic and just downright silly. The art style the devs went for is great as well. Some scenes are completely breathtaking, combined with the beautiful music scores. Not a lot of games could pull off what this game manages to do. Needless to say, this game has become one of my favourite games of all time. When it comes to cons, I don't really have any with this game other than a couple of bug encounters that didn't really pull me out of the game.			"

The Good:+What really stands out for me is the gorgeous graphics,atmoshpere, and beautiful vistas. Its a game where you just want to stop and look at everything. +Varied environments throughout the game make the world feel more real and alive and provide a nice change of scenery +The game feels like a grand adventure in the span of only 3 hours. It does such a good job of the pacing and the puzzles that it feels like you just completed an epic quest. +Controller both brothers at the same time can be frustrating however it adds an extra element to the gameplay, and provides some interesting scenarios and puzzles. +Simple and yet effective story conveyed with no dialogue The Bad-The game is very easy, the puzzles are not to challenging at all. - All achievements are optional and very missable requiring a guide to get them. If you don't care about achievements than this shouldn't be a problem- Although not required, you really need to play this with a controller. ConclusionAn excellent adventure/puzzle game. The game is more about the journey and the adventure rather than the puzzles. Although short it really was a great experience.			"

												HOLY CRAP THIS GAME!!!! I loved the crap out of this game, and while it is short (it took me about 3 hours to beat the game), I think this is one of my favourite games ever. At least in my top four. 9.8/10 (really crazy good for me). The basic plot: two brothers have to go to a far away land to get a cure for a rare illness their father has. The story adds onto this and has several twists and turns but this is the basis of it. Whats interesting about this game is that there is no actual interpretable dialog. what i mean by that is they make sounds, but its gibberish, and you have to look for context clues and hear the emotion in their voices to understand whats going on. This game is basically a puzzle game with two buttons, analog stick for movement and action buttons to act upon the world (im pretty sure you can only play this game with a controller). the controls are smoothe and the difficulty is good, i failed a few times but no part was frusterating. The graphics are amazing  and the art and world they create will stick with me for months (seriously breathtaking).. If you love art, BUY THIS GAME. if you have emotions, BUY THIS GAME!!!!! basically the only reason i wouldn't say to buy this game is if you just are not that sympathetic. because this game relies on the fact that you WANT the dad to be cured and want these kids to succeed, if you dont give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about the dad or the kids you wont be motivated to play the game and probably wont have that much fun.Like i said before, probably one of my favourite games ever, I would recommend this game to basically anyone. It was short but incredibly sweet, I loved the crap out of this game :)			"

												A simple, yet brilliant approach at expressing the bond between two brothers through gameplay mechanics.With a beautifully rendered world and an universal fantasy-appeal, this game will quickly capture the player in its world and soon he will find himself immersed into captivating landscapes. Despite all that beauty, the world of Two Brothers is not easy to traverse and only through teamwork can the brothers succeed. Control the two brothers via a single controller and feel how close these two sons are to each other. Feel their togetherness, wonderfully expressed via gameplay and level design.Highly recommended.I also recommend playing this great, albeit short game in a single session, to really connect to the journey that the two sons, as well as you, have brought behind themselves.

												This is an incredible game! I am happy to see a perfect port from the XBOX 360 version.The style of this game is very unique. Controlling both brothers at the same time might take you some time to get used to, but it is this style of game play that makes you understand how close the brothers are.The story is very heartwarming and presented through a world of fantasy, with breathtaking visuals and an amazing soundtrack. Though the characters in the game speak an unknown language, it is easy to understand what the story is about and what they are communicating with each other about through their physical gestures.The addition of Steam achievements is also a nice bonus.Highly recommended.

Product received for free
Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons Review  Introduction Brothers A Tale of Two Sons is an atmospheric, adventure, platformer indie game with heart, emotional content, and great sound. We set out on a journey towards uncovering a cure for a man who fell ill. Unfortunately, during this time period that the game takes place in, medieval it looks like most, doctors were not present and medicine was meager; the technology advancements we have in present-day was never present. What is his specific indisposition? We are not clued in towards the specific illness; possibly one could assume hay fever since his deportment facsimiles it as such. Two brothers bond to solve puzzles together, move obstacles, objects in securing the long journey that is brought forth ahead through fantastical enemies, real-life ones, and a secular cult ready to kill us.         A rare cabochon in the indie market and scene comes Brothers A Tale of Two sons predominantly marketed toward drama, tear-jerker, and adventure audiences. It takes the core rudiments from excellent drama movies incorporated in the exemplums of today that relate to real-life quagmires. The main plot centers around a castle and a populace that two brothers burgeoned in all speaking one language. We bring the old man to someone who can help him.      However, he assigns us our extended peregrinate towards finding the only cure. The cure is healing water present in an oasis that is supposed to revive any of all afflictions when drunken. That is after the water has been collected from a flask. We must work together, taking turns with our brother as well as working simultaneously. The little brother has an advantage, such as the ability to slide through small spaces, while his brother is good at swimming, pushing obstacles, and hitting switches.  Presentation     The presentation is opaque; no one word nor sentence can describe the immersive landscape. The graphics are beautiful; rivers with waterfalls flowing into them, bridges, ledges, logs; log branches to walk beyond, and a castle. The snowy environment is found later in the game, while in the beginning, it must be summer because the sun is bright, no waterfall nor rain exist. This is part of the reason we are led to gather this healing water from the oasis because, in our town, it looks like there has been a massive water drought. The environment is heavily inspired by adventure based films tied in with drama. These days, I never watch movies. As a result, I cannot compare it to any specific motion picture. Gameplay/ Mechanics     This game requires a controller all the way through because keyboard controls will, simply not be effective. It is a puzzle based adventure game with platform elements. The platforms, later on, borrows characteristics from Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands such as wall running, rock climbing, strafing across ledges, and in scaling walls. All puzzles are easy to figure out, mostly levers, pushing objects, turning objects.  Verdict- 7/10- good  Brothers A Tale of Two Sons is a lighthearted journey through joy and happiness at the start, but it gets very emotional, taking a dark turn later on at the point of the climax. The story is told from the first-person perspective. It is worth the money because it is a beautiful, emotional, turbulent indie game with heavily inspired elements that blend in and fit well. I wish I could have gone into more detail with this game. However, it is too short to accurately talk about it more thoroughly without spoiling the whole game for you. Now, if you like these aspects I have highlighted from my own experience, then try it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed if you have a true heart and love for people. Get the tissues ready because some will find the climax and beyond harder to bear, especially when we get to the final ending of the game as well as the ever-present present event that sets it off.Overall ScoresPresentation - 10/10     Graphics are well done, compared to any adventure, drama movies that have come out within the past half decade. There are two seasons in the game, summer, and winter. The characteristics of this are glaciers, ice peaks, waterfalls, torrential rains, a couple of underground tunnels, and grassland. Subtitles were supposed to be present, at least, to my knowledge. However, I never found an option in the menu to display it which would have been nice to include English subtitles as well as other languages so people can understand the dialogue. I am uncertain of the specific language spoken throughout the whole game. Nonetheless, the non-verbal cues we are given incorporated through the dialogue makes every cutscene and conversation in the game understandable. They focused more on emotion in the non-verbal cues to be understood better than the whole story rather fully told verbatim.Gameplay - 10/10     Gameplay fits well using the fundamentals of the platforming across high ledges but adds one new feature; the ability to control both brothers at the same time, working together while strafing buildings. One example of this is near the end of the game when you use the rope to tie yourself together with your brother which functions as a harness. You have to coordinate your movements together with your brother. When you are rock climbing, jumping upwards, you swing one of the brothers through the rope with the proper layout of controls meant only for a controller in mind. You swing until you hit the next small rock, actually more like a little circle of something similar to a pillar, but too insignificant to be considered one.Game Length/Story - 9/10     It follows the length of a conventional drama, however, extends it by double the time spent in this game rather than watching a movie in the same blend of genres. This is appropriate for an adventure game, the emotions of happiness, joy, sorrow, grief, fear, and dread. The story of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is around three hours through the main story. The story flows in chronological order, including the ability to interact with the dead ( i.e. ghosts of those in the community who have died) while you are sleeping, hearing them call your voice, trying to guide and comfort you within the spiritual realm. It is touching, emotional and a loving repositum to the heart's core. Controls - 7/10     Controls are responsive most times but can become a little awkward in the more difficult sections. Interactions which are sometimes comedic in nature, doing behaviors that are auto scripted, are controlled by the left and right triggers on the controller. In contrast, the movement of both brothers is controlled separately; right movement stick for the young sibling, the left for the older brother.Disclaimer A review copy of Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons was provided by Gamephasis.

												2013 will be remembered as a great year for indie games, and Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons deserves a special spot among ther best games of the year. Graphics are simply awesome, neat and very VERY evocative. Controls are challenging (you will move both characters at the same time using the two gamepad's analog sticks) but once mastered are really fun and rewarding. The puzzles aren't very hard, you'll probably never get stuck for more than a couple of minutes, but the game never gets boring. Story and character design are just wonderful... and considering no one ever speaks (at least not in a real language) I guess we're really really near to perfection in this department. You'll end up caring A LOT about the two brothers and their journey, and if you're a little sensitive you'll probably end up in tears. We need more games likes this.  "

												This is one of the few games that made me tear up at the end and I'm not that kind of person that needs tissues when I watch dramatic movies.  The plot is about two sons who went on a journey to help their dying father by bringing him medicine from this far and beautiful place, but the road leading to it is full of danger and mystery along the way. The characters in this game don't even speak a comprehensible language which I found strange but they make up for it in terms of hand gestures and interactions between each other. The graphics are charming and breath-taking, the game is filled with puzzles that make you feel smart when you solve them and the stroy is amazing. If you see this game on sale, don't even think about it twice. It's a masterpice, buy it.			"

												Rating: 10/10 must buy - worth full price and then some ( WORK OF ART status)Summary: Emotionally charged and beautifully designed adventure puzzle game. Can be played without controller but dont do it, use a 2 stick controller. Hits right in the feelings in the best possible way. No one will be left unmoved by the game.Long review (SPOILER FREE):Game is set in a fantasy world in which you play as two brothers on a epic quest to acquire a certain item. It is a very mature tale about growing up, brotherly bonds, effects of  trauma on a young person, overcoming those traumas and acceptance of death as part of life.  Art direction is really good and make the world seem very alive which in turn makes you get really immersed in the game. Game is not long around 2,5h (4h if you stop to take in scenery) but in that short time it will take you on a emotional roller coaster ranging from heartwarming to heartbreaking. You will not feel like you were cheated by how short it is in the end, it will feel perfectly timed. I can honestly say this is one of the few games that ever induced such deep emotions and cathartic feeling at the end. I am talking about The Walking Dead Clementine affection or MGS Sniper Wolf death scene level of emotions. This game will stick with me for the rest of my life. Please play this game in ONE sitting. Characters in this game speak in a made up language and there are no subtitles yet design is so masterful you will never not understand what is happening or get lost or not understand a puzzle. In fact i was impressed that i developed such strong feelings for the brothers despite it. Puzzles range from easy to medium. Sometimes they are a bit ""hard"" just because you are most likely not used to controlling 2 characters at once using both analog sticks and R2 L2 triggers. Personally i did not find them clunky it worked really well for such a design.Most impressive thing that really hit me in the feels was how the game  managed to incorporate emotions into actuall controls. That blew my mind and if you play until the end you will know what i mean by that.Only criticism i can possibly give would be that you should have a controller. Everything else is perfect at least for me. I will follow future similar releases from this studio. This game is a work of interactive art that can not be done in any other medium except video gaming. GO BUY IT !!! "

												I love absolutely everything about Brothers.1. It's a rejection of every condescending trend in game design from the past 5 years. No hand-holding, no collectables, no constant pats on the back. This is a game that treats its players like adults. Your *special reward* for playing Brothers is the WONDROUS JOY of playing Brothers.2. The developers knew their constraints and made smart decisions with the resources they had. No budget for voice actors? That's fine, the characters will speak their own language. XBLA games have limited graphics? Screw it, we'll pick an art style that looks good at any poly count.3. Did I say ""looks good""? Sorry, I meant GORGEOUS. Brothers is flat out beautiful. You'll find yourself constantly stopping to take in jaw-dropping vistas. The game knows it too. The designers sprinkled benches throughout whose only purpose are to let your characters relax and admire the view.4. No English, no problem. You don't need to understand the characters' words to get what they're saying. Everything you need to know comes across in tone, body language, and action. Brothers is the ultimate rejection of the David Cage school of videogame emotion. You don't need to see the individual atoms of NaCl and H2O in a character's tears to inspire empathy.5. I adored the coming-of-age theme. It's done in a way that's entirely unique to the medium, and yet I've never seen another game pull it off the way Brothers does. The game begins in innocence. You're running across verdant hills and through lush fields, playing pranks on local farmers, dodging mean dogs.But the darkness slowly creeps in. First, it's only in the background, and easily ignored by our storybook children on their magical adventure. Soon, though, you'll be neck-deep in the muck, and the green grass will be nothing but a distant memory.For such a short game (3-4 hours), it's incredible to compare where you begin and where you end up. It's the journey in between, the way that the protagonists react in the face of an increasingly adult world, and how they ultimately  learn to live in it—that's what makes Brothers so special.			"

												It's one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played. The gameplay is definitely the highlight of the game, two hands are like brothers, and this idea is deeply bonded in the story, in the beginning you may think this is interesting, in the end, it's more than just interesting. And the STORY~it's beautiful, sad, dark, and brave. Some stories may be told on purpose, like in this scene we should make it look sad or something, ""Brothers"" is different, it's plain and pure, honest and sincere, also a bit cold, it's just the way it is. The puzzles are also pretty amazing, not too hard and still interesting and enjoyable, the NPCs are doing a great job.The world inside the game is absolutely beautiful ! Nature was being rendered sooooo well, presenting us tons of delicate details, despite the mission, I really enjoyed lingering around in there.But, it's also the shortest game I've ever played. Took me 2.7 hrs to finished the main story , but I really can't ask for more playing hours, cause it feels like it's almost perfect, everything begins and ends at the right time.The achievements are really worth your time though, totally easy to accomplish, and helps you to check out the interesting details you miss.That's it~just play it.

												this is a beautiful short game that's pieced together admirably, and it's one that i've become enamored with ♥it's certain that the story itself is the pillar of this game's foundation while puzzle-solving stands as an inferior element.  i personally didn't find that to be an issue since i'm not opposed to a non-challenging game as long as it still has its merits, which in this case, it does.  although the playthrough (generally between two to six hours) is quite momentary, the wonderful quality makes it worthwhile.  i was pleased by the unique, simple-to-grasp gameplay and non-complex obstacles that merged flawlessly with the story's fluidity.  each transition was a passage full of adventure-- i found delight in being met with lovely little surprises like riding mountain goats and sailing on a sky glider.  i'd also pace my course throughout the scenic journey so i could appreciate the landscape encompassed by an enchanting ambience.  as for the brothers, they were personable characters with a charm suitable for the heartfelt story.  my fondness towards them progressed alongside the heroic tale, and with that, so did my devotion to their valorous pursuit.  inevitably, this endearing story steadily tugged at my heartstrings until i fell in love with the entirety of it.

												9/10 - This is one of the greatest games with genius story telling.It has beautiful design and unique gameplay mechanics - controlling two characters at the same time in order to solve puzzles and progress further. Storyline is just brilliant. Even the game is short, you get to experience so much in this adventure on every step, and it gets more and more emotional toward the end. Not many games in history achieved such level of involvement.The only bad thing is that its gameplay extremely easy to the degree it is often boring or just inexistent. It is ridiculously linear, you have just one narrow route (or a couple parallel ones) and you can't leave it or fall of a cliff, even characters jump over a pit on your way automatically when you approach it. Despite quite innovative control mechanics and occasional interesting puzzles, you still don't get anything challenging to solve with reasonable amount of effort, everything is pretty much obvious right away. All that almost excludes failure state of the game in practice, even my first death was way past the middle of playthrough.To sum it up - it is a great experience you should not miss if you like games like that, or just want to experience what the game offers. Just don't expect much out of an actual gameplay and ignore linearity - you will be able to appreciate the game to the fullest.			"

												Didn't really know what to expect going in and haven't played a game with a controller in many years.While there are some things you have to do that take longer than I think they should it's not a game changer.Also, no subtitles, but I had no problems following the story just by their actions and the cut scenes.The scenery is great and the journey is fantastic. I didn't put it down until it was over (About 3 hours.). That is a rare thing for me.Despite some minor graphical glitches here and there, they're very minor and it didn't hurt the game at all.This is a must play if you have a controller. I saw in the settings that you can use the keyboard, but boy would that be a pain. Left hand using WASD to move older brother and space for actions. Right hand usinf arrow key to move younger brother and right control for action. Not horrible since movement and the one action key is all that's required, but it was far easier with my controller.PLAY THIS GAME!			"

												This is such a wonderful game. Beautiful backdrops, simple, engaging gameplay and a story which manages to make an impact without any speech from the characters, just simple gestures. Starbreeze manage to create a bond between the player and the two brothers, a bond which goes somewhat unnoticed until the final moments of the game and its the final moments which are this games greatest achievement. The emotions this title made me go through is second to none and one of gamings best examples of how it can engage a player far more than a movie is capable of.Well done Starbreeze Studios.			"

												Absolutely breathtaking game, It's an emotional puzzle game where you take controll of 2 brothers going on an adventure in hope of finding a cure for their dieing father.The one of many intresting things about this game is that you actually play through the whole story without useing a singel word of english, as far as i can tell the actuall speech within the game is utter gibberish. At no point does the game translate the words used in the game, and that is probably for the best.What this results in is a phenomenally good told story. The game doesnt need to rely on voiceacting to be understood, you can tell exactly what to do even though you can't understand i singel word, whether it be through gestures or the inviorment.It's Mind blowingly good and you need to pick this game up. The only down side of this game is that you can't play coop or splitscreen with your buddy.This is easily one of my favorite games of all time :)			"

												this is a beautiful short game that's pieced together admirably, and it's one that i've become enamored with ♥it's certain that the story itself is the pillar of this game's foundation while puzzle-solving stands as an inferior element.  i personally didn't find that to be an issue since i'm not opposed to a non-challenging game as long as it still has its merits, which in this case, it does.  although the playthrough (generally between two to six hours) is quite momentary, the wonderful quality makes it worthwhile.  i was pleased by the unique, simple-to-grasp gameplay and non-complex obstacles that merged flawlessly with the story's fluidity.  each transition was a passage full of adventure-- i found delight in being met with lovely little surprises like riding mountain goats and sailing on a sky glider.  i'd also pace my course throughout the scenic journey so i could appreciate the landscape encompassed by an enchanting ambience.  as for the brothers, they were personable characters with a charm suitable for the heartfelt story.  my fondness towards them progressed alongside the heroic tale, and with that, so did my devotion to their valorous pursuit.  inevitably, this endearing story steadily tugged at my heartstrings until i fell in love with the entirety of it.

												This game is good, really good... But people have hyped it way too much. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, the graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing, the controls are kind weird, but after some time it becomes fun to play with both characters at the same time, and even without understanding what the brothers are saying, you can really connect to them.But this is not a GOTY, and in no way this is the best game ever made... It achieved a pretty high position in my ""Games that almost made me cry"" list, but the 1st place still belongs to To The Moon, which is a shame, considering all the things I heard about this game...

												Never has a video game distilled the core elements of the character-player interface in such an emotionally gripping way.The visual elements, the dialogue (or lack thereof) , the elegant sound, and above all, the controls combine so flawlessly to generate emotion for and connection to the characters that it rivals even attempts made by the best movies and books.I defy any critic to play Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons from beginning to end and not call it ""high art."" And the highest at that.			"

												Great game, if you want to relax from hardcore gaming, and go through a good story.It's not hard at all (the only problem might be getting used to controls), so i would recommend it even to new gamers,it's short (3-4 hours) - yes, it's a positive feature here, you don't get a lot of repetetative gameplay, it's more of a story telling,beautiful art, and each level is unique location with it's own nature and inhabitants,has a good story - well it is not something that will surprise fans of good movies, but it's definitely good, video games rarely comes with these, and the story comes natural with gameplay.

												SPOILER ALERT: THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWdon't play this game if you've had any alcohol because the whole thing about it is that you control 2 brothers with the same controller. it actually works great and it's a lot of fun but that's not the best thing about this game. the best thing about this game is definitely the multiple ways in which you can kill each other. for example you can die via wolf, be crushed by a giant, fall into a big hole. really great stuff. im being facetious again but the storytelling is great and i was really immersed and it's around 2 hours worth of gameplay but it's actually amazing. i would buy this game for 5 quid which is 200 dollars i think.

												A charming tale which is told by sight and sound rather than traditional scripting.The two titular sons are brothers who must journey to assist their sick father. A journey that will call upon both of them to work together to overcome the sometimes hostile environment to reach their goal.The mechanics and premise of the game are beautifully simple and excellently excecuted.The left thumbstick of your gamepad controls the movement of the older brother with the left trigger handling any of many interactions with the environment and/or the younger brother. The younger of the two is likewise controlled (you guessed it) by the right thumbstick and trigger.It takes a little bit of getting used to but clicks into place quickly enough and feels really rewarding once you get to grips with it.The puzzles never seem to get too difficult but require enough thought to not seem contrived and they never infuriate.Anyone who has ever played Kuri Kuri mix on the PS2 will enjoy this immediately, as well as feeling right at home. The main difference here being the excellent way the developers have made two main characters that you can instantly empathise with.Ultimately I would recommend this at full price. At the holiday price it is quite simply a steal. Don't miss this one.Additionally I would like to add that I am playing this game using my motherboards onboard graphics. And it runs fine. It should run really well on older systems.			"

												I'll try to not spoil anything, but I apologise if I end up spoiling something for you, you have been warned... Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is not merely a game, it's a masterpiece of modern gaming and storytelling with the use of a made up language. Considering it's a fairly short title (about 3 hours long), which might put some people off it is surprisingly worth it's value. Brothers presents you astonishing visuals along with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game. Brothers doesn't really tell you a story like most games out there, it shows you the story by using a made up language, as I mentioned above, you are not presented with a certain and linear story but the way each brother interacts and uses body language to express himself gives you a good feeling of what's going on. Another thing I love about this game is how the developers decided to show you that these two brothers are inseparable, you control each one with a different stick on the controller but yet each puzzle or obstacle cannot be exceeded by using a single brother, one brother needs the other in order to survive... Besides this, everything else I have to say is abunch of spoilers and things that would ruin the way you would experience this game for the first time. I have nothing else to say other than, please buy the game, if not by paying full price atleast try to get it once it's on sale (like I did), we need more games like this, I need more games like this. Definitely one of my favourite games of all time, taking the top 1 place on best storytelling for me and bringing The Walking Dead to top 2. Be amazed by Brothers!			"

												This game was simply amazing! Although there are still some things that could be better and need work, the things they did right really stand out and exemplify the game in a great way. First lets talk about the bad things.This game has its bugs and glitches that actually break the game. I was unfortunate enough to encounter one of these that would not allow a cutscene to play causing me to be stuck with no way to progress. 505 support gave me a few solutions that did nothing to help until a friend of mine found a video displaying the same problem I had. (http://youtu.be/c-DJGQ3t3YE if u wanna see it) I was unable to play for weeks emailing 505 asking for help. That was the only game breaking bug i encountered, but there were many graphical glitches and frame lag spikes at the most random of places.One thing I truly enjoyed about his game is that it does not hold your hand. New little mechanics are added into the puzzles and will require you to think a little which is refreshing from 99% of games where everything is handed to you instantly. Another they did correctly was the controls. They were extremely innovative and well made, easy to use and although i would get my thumbs tangled, it felt smooth and overall nice. The story is a cliche, but thru the gameplay and interactions, it really was quite good. The game never truly dragged out when compared to most games and the visuals were nice. They could have done much more with the art, but how it is now is still well done. Overall, this is a solid game with great controls, a moving story, fun puzzles and nice visuals. It does have its bugs and glitches but with some research you should be able to find a fix and continue on your journey. Highly recommend to everyone.			"

												I can see why this has been on so many GOTY lists. The journey you take with the brothers is extraordinary. Closest thing I can liken it to is Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls, except if those had been made by Astrid Lindgren.A couple scenes had janky animation, and at one time I felt frustration at not knowing what to do, but those issues don't matter on the whole. The world design and story more than make up for it. Critics like Adam Sessler & TotalBiscuit had hyped up the ending quite a bit, and probably as a result I didn't find it outstanding in any way. It ended like it should, but it wasn't the high point for me. The best scenes in the game were the ones which were completely optional. For example at one point you meet a man who has lost his family in a fire and is about to kill himself. Whether you help him or not is optional, and if you do there's a thing you can do for him which helps him deal with his loss. This entire area is off to the side and can easily be ignored if you choose to. But this, and many other areas like it provided the strongest moments in the game for me.I'm glad I played it. I had seen clips from it and heard the hype from those who played it, but it didn't really prepare me from what the game is like. Don't miss it.			"

												Though i recommend it, i've got a mixed feeling about this game. Let's point out some things first:The music and the graphics are simply amazing, you can't argue about that. The controlling of the two brothers was new to me, so it took time to get used to it, but it's not hard at all. There are no speaking in the game, just gesturing and some mumbling. Because of this, i just simply cannot form a connection with the brothers. Okay, i'm controlling them, but i just couldn't care about them much enough. And it really affects the game, i think. Some SPOILERS INCOMING!I loved the dead giants valley, it was gore, it was epic, and yet still beautiful in some way. I was totally amazed by the map design there.But there's one thing, that almost made me quit immediately, and give this game a negative review:That girl at the end, turning into spider. Was that really necessary? I don't have a problem with spiders, nor do i fear them, but it just wasn't filling in that word, or even in the game. I was shocked, and not in a good way. Can't really express why, but that was a big minus for me.Overall i'd recommend it, but there are things that holds back this game to be a very special one...			"

												Bravo, just bravo. This is the first time I ever write a comment on steam. I just have to say, very well designed game. And to all that´s considering buying it, just do it, it´s a small game with a big impact. And do use a controller to play this game, you can play it with keyboard but it won´t have the same meaning as a controller.  In the beginning, the controling seperately the two brothers with 2 thumbstick on controller was a bit frustrating, but if you have played it, you´d understand what a monumentally impressing design that is for expressing the emotion of the game. Through the whole game, you are telling yourself, left stick is big brother, right stick is little brother, to the point that the controller has intergrated into the storytelling. And in the end when the big brother was incapacitated, you suddenly felt that emptiness on your left hand, and the urge to rush up to the tree and save him. Then you found out he´s already gone, the reassurence of the temporary disabled left hand in your heart became permanent, you geniuenly felt that lost in a way of your own control. However that wasn´t the end of it, the final part when the little brother refuse to step into the water and you can´t seem to find a way to make him do so made me emotionally angry. ""Your brother died for this, you gotta get over yourself little dude"" I was yelling inside. But no, he just refuse to go on into the water. After several minutes of trying, I was confused, angry, then suddenly I touched the left stick, the one representing the passed away big brother, and the little one moved, struggled through the water with his brother´s strength. I was all tearing up, controlling the little brother using the big brother´s power, pulling lever that was impossible for the little one before or climbing up the cliff too high for him before.... This game definitely deserve a medal. "

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was developed by the company Starbreeze Studios, who were responsible for games like The Chronicles of Riddick games, The Darkness and Payday 2 and directed by famous Swedish film director Josef Fares.The two Brothers, Naiee (the younger brother) and Naia (the older brother) become united as one not only by the plot but with the help of the game’s mechanics and narration. Thrust out their village and into a gorgeous and almost realistic storybook, the Brother’s only weapons are their minds and their only resource is each other. The brothers then embark on their epic journey through the beautiful landscape of villages, hills, mountains, caves and even the valley of dead giants and trolls that went to war with each other on a very bloody battlefield. At the same time the Brothers also faced challenges like the local bully, a farmer's aggressive dog, and deadly wolves.  Along with these challenges the Brothers also undertake a journey of self-discovery as they learn to work together to overcome each challenge. They even learn and work out how to help out the various characters they meet during their adventure - like reuniting a friendly pair of trolls, saving a man attempting suicide, aiding an inventor, freeing a badly injured griffin that help them before succumbing to its injures and even a girl from being scarified by a blood cult.The dialogue throughout the game is in an artificial language and there are no signs to really provide any type of information to the player in regards to where you must go. You just follow the path, trusting that the brothers are heading the right way. And this parallels the relationship between the brothers: although you can’t understand what they say to one another, you know they love and look out for one another. The game’s visuals are gorgeous to look at and the game rarely lets a few minutes pass without offering some sort of staggeringly gorgeous landscape to ogle. There are even benches scattered throughout the game for the Brothers to sit on. The player is given permission to stop and enjoy the vistas; which are not only beautiful but ram home how vast a world Naia and Naiee have to traverse and, by extension, how vital their relationship is to their own survival. The game makes it so clear that the characters themselves are impressed by what they see. The soundtrack was equally as gorgeous. The Swedish vocals added that extra charm when it came to cut scenes and often provided the atmosphere and told the player what they should feel at that precise moment.The player controls both brothers simultaneously, each mapped to an analogue stick, as that makes button mashing impossible when it comes to puzzle solving. Every action from ""grab the ledge above"" to ""play the harp"" is performed with the triggers. When I first played this game I did find it quite hard to control both the brothers the same time. Usually one would end up running into a wall. Ultimately the control scheme acts as a defining piece of storytelling. The control scheme is actually very simple, though. You control both brothers independently; the older brother’s actions are enacted with the left analogue stick and the younger brother with the right analogue stick. Each brother also has one interactive button that is context sensitive to the area or person it is being used on. There is a very brief introduction to the controls, which becomes a very strong narrative choice because it allows the player to naturally grow with the brothers on their journey and experiment a little more, revealing layers of their characters. Coming back to the point I mentioned about the Brother’s communication is almost psychic, we eventually learn that due to the control scheme of this game that the brothers are sharing a brain; which is in fact the player’s brain. But a curious thing happens as you help the siblings solve puzzles and work in concert to skirt danger. You learn. You get better at controlling these two disparate entities and, in turn, they appear to work together more seamlessly. (WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT) So after the brothers save the girl from the blood cult’s ritual they decide to ally with her. They reach a point in their journey where the girl urges the Brothers to enter a cave which they presume is the direction that they must head in order to reach the Tree of Life.Before Naia enters the claustrophobic tunnel, Naiee become hesitant, pulling Naia’s hand and tries to convince him that this is not a good idea, foreboding that something bad is about to happen. Naia insists that nothing is going to happen and since Naiee is too weak to go on by himself he follows both Naia and the girl into the tunnel. As the brothers shuffle forward, you start to notice what appear to be victims mummified in web. Something doesn’t seem right.In an instant, the girl exposes her true, evil arachnid form and imprisons the brothers in a web and slowly pulls them upwards to feast on.  As Naiee awakes, the brothers devise a plan to escape. To defeat this she-spider Naiee must ram into her while Naia tears off each of her limbs. The fight is pretty easy and feels quite satisfying. As Naia rips off the last leg he is pierced by the spider’s venomous pincher and loses colour of his skin simultaneously. Now Naiee must carry Naia for the remaining way to the Tree of Life, where Naiee must now collect the Water of Life to save not only their father, but Naia’s life too.As you’re controlling Naiee throughout the Tree of Life using only the right side of your controller, you start to feel alone and awkward. Normally the right analogue stick is used to look around in a game; not to move about. It’s weird, unnatural and disjointed. The control scheme is now missing something and you as the player are not use to using the right side of the controller to move around. What you are feeling is exactly how Naiee is feeling in the story but for different metaphorical reasons. The use of only the right side of the controller is symbolic for the emptiness inside of Naiee. And to top it all off, even after Naiee retrieves the Water of Life you find out it’s too late to save Naia and ends up dying in Naiee arms in the most heart wrecking scene I have ever witness. And it doesn’t end there!The emotional knife digs in as you control Naiee, again only with the right side of your controller, to bury Naia, a character that even you as the player, have become emotional attached to. And despite never understanding the dialogue in this game you cannot help but empathise with Naiee.  And even after that, Naiee rushes home to deliver the Water of Life to his father. However Naiee must cross the shoreline before doing so. He is faced with his greatest fear! The flashback to his mother’s death at the beginning of the game explains this phobia, and without Naia there to carry him across like he has been throughout the entire game. Using the right trigger only makes Naiee steps back from the water. But as you realise that the ghost of Naia is with Naiee you also realise that he is also in your controller; and by pressing the left trigger Naiee gathers the strength and determination to swim across the shore, climb up the mountain, use the machinery to reach his father. Even though Naia was not physically there to help Naiee or for you to control with the left analogue stick, it didn’t matter at all. He was still there to use in the left trigger button; which then become symbolic for the brother’s true strength. As for what happens after Naiee reaches his father, I’m not going to say. All I will say is it’s better to experience the ending on your own.			"

												This is my first proper recommendation of a game on Steam. Because no other game that I have ever played has provoked my emotions in a way Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons has.The story of two brothers against the world, fighting to save their father. A simple story, but the way it is told has to be one of the most breath-taking experiences a video game can muster. I can't say much with regards to the story except that if story-driven games are your thing, you have to play.Every little aspect of this game, from the game controls to the language spoken by the brothers helps you connect with them, their troubles, their fears, their emotions. No game has so far captivated me this quickly and this deeply, although I am probably feeling this way because I just finished it. And that's just fine. This game is a masterpiece that everyone should experience. Some brief review notes: Do not judge the game solely based on the first few minutes of gameplay, as the puzzles and co-operative mechanics develop at an amazing pace. The ideas in the game are innovative, not repetitively used and are a lot of fun to experience.Controls-wise, this game definitely has to be played with a controller with two joysticks to get the most out of the game. The keyboard controls are manageable but a controller is best. However, there are times where you are required to hold down the buttons for minutes on end which is quite stressful on the fingers. The graphics and art are nothing special, although some of the scenes do inspire some awe in you. The game isn't about the art however and the deciding factor in whether you want to play a game should almost never be graphical quality.Brothers makes use of the controller in a way no other game I've played has ever done. That could be my inexperience talking, but the innovative way you control the two brothers using a joystick and shoulder pad each pulls you into the game and doesn't let go. It takes some getting used to of course, but a helpful tip is to try and keep the younger brother on the right as much as possible as it helps coordinate better early on.The speech in the game is no known language. And this is one of the best features of this game. The story does not rely on voice acting or script, but the true weight and emotion of the story itself as well as the body language and gestures of the characters. Very few games have managed to pull this off to the degree that Brothers has and I fear no other would be able to live up to this quality of story for a long time.Puzzle platformer games are nothing new. Many games have a tried and tested formula to them. Brothers on the other hand is a game that no other game would make you go: ""Oh, this is just like that other game."" No. That will never happen. Because the mechanics of the game, they way you solve every problem, the satisfaction of achieving the goal while controlling both brothers at the same time is a unique experience in itself.TL;DR If you love video games for what they truly are, you owe it to yourself to play this game. No game will ever be like this game. Ever. Bros before hoes.Nominated this for an award. Worth it.			"

												While from the perspective of level design and gameplay mechanics this title leaves a bit to be desired (indeed, many of the obstacles are overcome with much the same solution), the stunning beauty and artistry presented more than compensate, rendering this more an interactive story than a game in the normal sense.  There are no side-quests, nor is there any real purpose in honing one's skills, at least not beyond learning how to control the two characters simultaneously.  However, if you enjoy contemplative nature hikes, appreciate minutiae, and are even remotely of an empathic disposition, this one is definitely worth your time.  There are moments that will stay with you well past the meager 3-hour duration.From a technical standpoint, the game ran with barely a hiccup on my 8-year-old laptop, so just about anything with at least an integrated graphics chipset should have no trouble.  While a controller is not strictly necessary, it is important to note that the keyboard configuration cannot be changed (wasd+space and arrow keys+right control); since you will be controlling both characters at once, this requires a keyboard that supports many concurrent key presses.  Though it is playable, the recommendation of having a controller is a good one.			"

												You will be controlling two characters. If you think you can pull that off, you will have a great time. Actually that is the most special thing about this game.The story is great, it will take you to emotional heights.The older brother is stronger, knows how to swim, while the younger can pass through small gaps. The older brings maturity while the younger brings joy. It's fantastic really. The graphics are amazing I find it beautiful. There are some great visuals that will surely amaze. The language is meaningless, like in The Sims. Yet they say enough with body language. It's often funny and entertaining.There are puzzles but they are really easy in my opinion.The playthrough is very short, but i recommend it.			"

												Summary: Brothers is an engaging, fun, frustrating and immersive afternoon's fun - requiring a pad.It's a tough thing to talk much about Brothers - A Tale Of Two Sons. The game is compact; so there's little you can draw reference to without spoiling anything, and to ruin this beautiful little tale would do the reader a great disservice. That in itself should serve as a recommendation, though it comes with several caveats.Firstly, there is only one reason why you would logically ever play Brothers twice, and that's to get achievements. As sad a statement as that is in many games, here it's in the games' favour, as the achievements here take the form of vignettes which occur off Brother's beaten (and entirely linear) path. These brief scenes take a variety of tones and forms, and some are more enjoyable than others (of course). The merit of this approach is that the achievements enhance the game rather than detract from it, and for this Brothers should be applauded. Find all of these asides from the main tale though, and that's it - nothing more to see here.So, the game itself. Brothers is an isometric overhead adventure, in which you guide the titular big and little brothers (who call one another Naia and Naiee in the game world's language, whatever those words may mean) around various obstacles on their journey to find a cure for their ailing father. As we have come to expect, the game and soundtrack are both beautiful, with a visually realised and aurally rounded world waiting to be explored. The manner of exploration is probably the most talked about and easily discussed mechanic of the game, which to summarily recap, involves simultaneous control of both brothers. On a standard gamepad set-up, the left stick controls the big brother, right stick the little brother, with left and right triggers serving as each character's action/interaction button, and left/right bumper rotating the camera. This control scheme may be both the game's key draw and most off-putting mechanic depend on how you personally handle the remapping of ingrained controller use - the operation is fairly fluid and has a gentle enough curve to allow you to get used to it, and I personally found the system engaging and enjoyable, but I can see the same aspects frustrating and annoying many gamers. Nonetheless, overcome the fact that you WILL at times be constantly running one brother into a wall while the other calls out to his counterpart for no reason, simply because the little brother is positioned to the left of the big brother and your mind has once again mapped the left stick to the left character and vice-versa, and you have a wonderful ride ahead of you.And you will need a controller. Yes, the game has keyboard controls. Be aware however that the game itself will warn you that it is designed, specifically, to be controlled with a pad. On a keyboard certain tasks requiring rotation of both thumbsticks simultaneously... do not map well. I can't honestly recommend the game to anyone without a controller.As to the story, events and specifics of the world - they should all be experienced for oneself. So long as you have some sort of empathy within you, this is a great little journey which will draw you in fully for three to four hours. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging at any part, there's no choices or branching story lines - and you won't mind. It's refreshing how streamlined and conservative Brothers is with it's mechanics, puzzles and set-pieces, and it deserves to be played both for and because of these aspects. The tone, whist initially whimsical, darkens considerably, to the point where I'd advise against playing the game with younger children. To give it a cinematic comparison, it starts off in Jim Henson's Labyrinth, moves into The Never-Ending Story, and ends... not joyfully. However; I wouldn't change a thing about it.It is also very worth saying that just because you'll see the entire game in one or two play-throughs, it is still extremely re-playable and enjoyable each time. I fired up the game to check out the keyboard controls while writing this review and I felt an urge to play again immediately, which would make a fourth run at the game.This really is a beautiful, innovative and rollicking yarn which asks for very little from the player and gives a ton back. The only hold-ups are the aforementioned potential control frustrations, and for those to whom it's a factor, the price. Not wishing to seem ♥♥♥♥♥rdly, for your average player, £12 for a three-hour game isn't great. When you take into account what you get for that price of entry, I'd have to say that yes, it is worth it, but I can't say I paid that for it as I picked up a cheap key. At half price this game is an absolute steal and should be purchased without reservation, at full price, give the points raised here a little thought before committing.8.5/10He Ain't Heavy			"

												Wow.. I cannot find the best way to explain my experience from this game, but I have been moved and feel unable to truly express what a gem of a game this has been for me. The steam winter sales of 2013 had Brothers on sale and not having heard of it, I decided to watch the trailor.. Already I felt ""This looks like it'll be good"", and I instantly snagged myself a copy. I installed and played Brothers in one sitting, unable to stop myself from progressing through the game.I felt such intrigue and splendor as I navigated the beautiful levels and explored some of the secrets and easter eggs hidden in each world. The main characters themselves, Nyaa and Naiee are loveable but disticntly different. The older Naiee is mature and respectful whilst the juvenile Naiee is cheeky but adoreably curious all the same. And despite the fact that all the dialogue in the game is in tongue, the body language and emotions portrayed by the characters alone is more than enough to understand.My only qualm with this game is that it felt that it cut short too quickly.. And the hope I had towards the end of the narative didn't come true, yet I can accept it. I just wish I wasn't feeling so.. robbed of my happiness.. Regardless of this though, the loss any player might feel as the tale of two sons concludes, the grief felt is shouldered by the in game characters and it's hard to not feel like you the player aren't there with them mourning.What ever the case, the journey and excitement of Brothers makes it truly a game experience I won't forget, and one I hope everyone can share and be a part of. I've been moved to the point where I already purchased a second copy for a friend's wishlist. Have fun playing ""Brothers""!			"

												This underrated gem should undoubtly be game of the year. Aside from nearly faultless aesthetics like art and audio, almost every puzzle-solving mechanic is refreshing. Instead of being predictably wholesome which the art style seems to imply at first glance, the story reveals dark themes yet maintains innocence and empathy as its main driving force. Clearly a game made with love. :)			"

												You will be controlling two characters. If you think you can pull that off, you will have a great time. Actually that is the most special thing about this game.The story is great, it will take you to emotional heights.The older brother is stronger, knows how to swim, while the younger can pass through small gaps. The older brings maturity while the younger brings joy. It's fantastic really. The graphics are amazing I find it beautiful. There are some great visuals that will surely amaze. The language is meaningless, like in The Sims. Yet they say enough with body language. It's often funny and entertaining.There are puzzles but they are really easy in my opinion.The playthrough is very short, but i recommend it.			"

												First of all, this game is amazing. It's short but it really teaches you to love the two main characters and is very emotionally attaching. Alas, this is also a sad game. Gameplay / player control is easy. Ok it says controller is required and that is true. At first I had mayor difficulties with Steam Controller and it's mouse pad. But finding custom configuration for the controller helped a lot and I actually played the game through without using keyboard's help. What also amazing is VO. Characters speak in emotional language, not real. Still it's very easy to understand what is spoken - great job! And games music just fits in. Again, emotional.So, long story short. I really recommend this game.P.S. I really love that they used Unreal Engine and not something else - hint, hint. The game looks stunning.			"

												9.8/10 - No words are spoken, but a masterful tale is woven!I can't say enough about this game; It's a new experience altogether! The graphics are really amazing and the controls really define this game. You play as Two Brothers who travel to the far corners of the world in search of a cure for their dying father. Each brother is a single side of the controller. It really takes some getting used to, but once you do it's a fantastic journey! Game is only about 4 hours max; but those hours are very high quality.** This is the BEST use of my Steam Controller yet! I recommend loading the best community preset and prepare to be amazed!Worth the full price! On sale for $1.49!! You have to buy this!

												There are people who very heavily complain about stories and games. They say ""if I wanted stories, I'd go watch a movie"". Other people just feel that games without a story are unengaging and arid. To both groups I recommend Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Both will gain a new perspective.Rarely a game manages to deliver such rich, emotional and well-developed storytelling. As a lifelong gamer, voracious reader and a professional that understands the power of drama, I can tell you that this game has it all. Every single element shows the maximum attention to detail, storywise. Careful planning and masterful presentation are noticeable at every single moment. Only a master storyteller, playwright or writer can achieve this. Music, setting, colors, sounds, environment, level design, camera angles, zooming, pacing, ""dialogue"" and a hint of mystery here and there make this game a superb and very enjoyable experience. The world is rich and interesting and the characters are empathic and show more personality in 3 hours' worth of playing than most others from famous lengthy franchises or dull modern novels/movies. In a time and age of predictable endings, cookie-cutter stories, boring conventional scripting, forced and faked emotional stimuli and lame plot twists, Brothers brings a breath of fresh air.Yes, the game is quite short for today's gaming standards. Bear in mind though that the narrative is excellent and the duration is perfect. Think theater or cinema: more than 3 hours would be just too much. This is more akin to that than to Call of Duty, Minecraft or Super Mario.The controls at first are awkward but soon you'll get used to them. A gamepad is strongly recommended, and there's a reason for that.I am quite sure that you've never played a game like this. Bought it on sale; after finishing I would have gladly paid twice the regular price. The developers deserve it. It is that good. Maybe not a game for everyone, but definitely one worth playing.Unconditionally recommended.			"

												The game surprised me multiple times along the way - even last seconds of final cutscene.Right from the beginning it surprises by its visual quality - it is very beautiful, by attention to detail - there are tons of details and tiny cute content you can miss by just running along the path, by its technical quality - very polished and almost flawless.Later it suprises by original and imaginative world and strange big and little details. And as you get closer to the end it gets more and more gruesome and morbid. Although first it seems like a fantasy game for children, especially due to casual gameplay and visual style, I'm not sure I can recommend a child play it.Gameplay-wise it is very casual and will not make you replay long sequences or test your hardcore gamer skills. But it's not mindless either. The balance is very precise to make it a game but not allow gameplay overshadow story or visual/audio beauty and immersiveness.I feel that creators were influenced by many classic games, and weave the influences very organically into the game. There is definitely strong influence from Ico in castle chapters. There is also very deep controller trick reminiscent of Metal Gear's one.Overall, this game seems perfect labor of love with no visible flaws. Except that in my opinion it's a mature game which can be easily mistaken for a child game, so the target audience will most probably not play it.Highly recommended.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is essentially a very story driven experience with some interesting puzzle elements to break up the gameplay. I don't want to say much more than that as the 'game' is very much the experience rather than the gameplay. The use of the dual analog sticks to control both the Sons independently is a nice twist, and something I'd like to see more of (even if at times it was slightly confusing). In fairness it's only one of the bold decisions the developers made with Brothers, and for me most (if not all) of them worked.The use of dual analog sticks; the belief in their storytelling being strong enough to not include subtitles to translate the pseudo-langauge they created within the game; and ultiamtely the story you experience. It's a short review for a short game that lasted just shy of 3 hours in total, and the only thing I can really end this recommendation is:If you enjoy indie games and the 'Art' experience they often deliver this for you. If you prefer deeper gameplay than this might not be what you're looking for, but it's still a worthwhile purchase for the narrative and platform-puzzle elements it provides.  "

												This game features a beautiful fairy tale, which tells a story about two Brothers trying to find a cure for their dying father. Swedish film director J. Fares and Starbreeze studio really managed to make this fantasy world alive, set in varied and beautiful locations. Story is simple, but emotionally strong and creates a bond between two brothers similar to ICO. Gameplay is kind of original and lets you control both brothers at the same time. It works rather well except some awkward controls in a few levels. Sound simply can not be missed. You won't understand what characters say, but animations, gestures tell that with no words. Music is very well done and is a huge part of the atmosphere.And don't forget to collect all achievements, they add even more to the story.At the end, Brothers is truly a work of art and despite a short length it is a journey you will be immersed and won't forget. Yeah, it`s one of the best games in this year.ReDiR's rating: 9.2			"

												I am in the minority who did not enjoy this game. Perhaps it was because of all the hype I had heard about it, but I felt deeply disappointed. I knew it was a short game, but I don't mind that if the story is good enough. That is however where I found the game lacking the most. I found the game extremly predictable. Call me jaded if you like but the ""twists"" were not emotional to me. Perhaps it was because the gameplay did not draw me in, but I suspect it was primarily because the game chose to use a gibberish language and rely only on visual emotional appeal. And that is where it failed me.All in all, the best I would say is pick it up cheap if you really need to see for yourself, but I think my own time might have been better spent watching someone else play it, which is why I personally cannot recommend it.

												Alright, I read some reviews before I bought it, just now finished it. And I pretty much agree with the positive and the negative reviews ;)Very linear, puzzles rather easy, replayability kinda low, sometimes a bit clunky controls. And the camera is at times very annoying.On the other hand, stunning visuals, especially in the latter part, fascinating and gripping, a bit like a movie, well worth the discounted price in the summer sale imho.It is also true that the game has some disturbing parts that are not exactly that well suited for very little children for example.Anyway, I don't regret getting it, any game that makes me go ""woaaah"" while I play is good. I mean, if you just shrug away every visual here, you have to be dead inside. Okay, it also had some parts where I just shook my head, but, eh, if you take it for what it is, more like a moviepuzzle-experience, it's certainly worth getting. If, however, you expect a very engaging puzzle-platformer, this is probably not the game for you. Also the plot might not be to everyones liking. Whether good or bad, you'll probably keep this one somewhere in your memory.Good, albeit short experience and definitely worth getting on sale if you are not sure if you'll enjoy the style or expect more freedom and harder puzzles.

												Breathtaking game. When I first sat down to play this, I was immediately drawn to the characters and the story. The fact that the emotional attatchment to each of these characters grows so quickly and you understand what each brother is going thru is astounding. All without ever speaking an actual language. Story aside the complexity of the puzzles gradually scales as you play the game in a seamless fashion. The mechanics work quite well with the unique control scheme they have going for them. If your not used to controllers it may be a bit troublesome but by the harder puzzles you will feel very comfortable with your dextarity.Graphics wise looks great for what it is the art style fits perfect with the atmosphere of the game.Bought this once on xbox bought it yet again on PC 9.5/10			"

												This is beautiful game, a true definition of Cinematic platformer, for me a great game of this genre is one that can tell a good story without the use of dialogue and almost non on screen information, this game suceed on all of those.Playing as two brothers make you care about each one of them, even if you don´t have much time to share with them, and there´s little to no information about them, that game makes you care by the only way a videogame can tell better, by the way of gameplay. The game put you on situations that make both useful and bonded, this game is not an escort mission where you got to carry a defendless character, each puzzle is desing with both brothers in mind. another big plus and one of the selling points of the game, is how beautiful the art design, this game has the best 3rd person camara I ever seen, this game is a true master peace, worthy of your money and time.ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES OF ALL TIME.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is often named as one of the best example of games that use the tools proper of the video game medium in a way that no other does.The main ""gimmick"" of the game is the fact that you control the titular two brothers at once, using one analog control stick and one ""action"" button for each. This mechanic, alien at first, quickly becomes second nature, letting you fully enjoy your travels through beautiful scenery following the brothers on a quest to find a cure for their dying father.Talking about storytelling, that's another way Brothers sets itself apart from most other games, as the simple, fable-like story is told using gameplay and rare in-engine cutscenes.You find out the personality and quirks of each brother by the way they interact with each other and with the people and creatures they encounter during the journey. You understand the power of their brotherly bond by the way they help each other out solving puzzles or getting out of difficult situations. All of this without ever having to read or hear a single word.I would 100% recommend Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons if it wasn't already clear enough, as the way the game marries its storytelling to its mechanics is truly fascinating and definitely worth the 2 to 4 hours needed to complete it.

												Sometimes you want to play a fairy tale, a simple but beautiful story of basic human values, of self-improvement and of what truly matters to everyone. You want to see some adventures of characters, who you can (or want to) relate to. It's an old formula, take some kids and send them for a quest for the sake of the family, on a road where they will face scary monsters and challenges and overcome their fears.What most prefer to ignore is that fairy tales are pretty gruesome. Someone alwayse dies in those stories, be it an old king or a dragon, and dies in a rather displeasing way. It's not a fairy tale without a pinch of sorrow in it, and not everything is well after the happy end - monsters and kings remain pretty much dead anyways.With this game I managed to look at Starbreeze studios from a very different point of view. It is a beautiful game with a distinct fairytaleish athmosphere and a bit naive, but touching story.			"

												This game made me cry. Twice. Which is a good thing - I like it when fictional stuff elicits tears from my eyes; I call it ‘resonating with art’. (What? It’s better than that ‘ninjas cutting onions’ cliche people always use... right?)On the subject of cliches, this game has many: a convenient sunset, a generic premise to set up a generic conflict, a flashback recalling happier times, and at some point a backstabber.The game is also linear, and short (3 hours). But hey, sometimes it’s fun to play a linear and short game. (People complain about linearity, but if every game had an open world, well, we’d have a dump truck-full of terrible open-world games.)The difference with this game is that its linearity serves a purpose: there’s a constant build-up, and just the faintest sense of a ticking clock, of inevitability.Even the cliches add rather than detract; they make the story seem innocent, the adventure seem mild, the characters seem... invincible. They keep things straight-forward, because straight and forward is precisely where the game wants you to go. Even the controls, which will take time to adjust to, are as basic as they get.But for all its simplicity, Brothers doesn’t let you grow bored. There’s never two of the same puzzle, and the settings change regularly. (I have a short attention span, but this game never once lost its magic.) You might ‘die’ a few times, but you’re never really stuck, and even in the few places where a sense of urgency might be felt, there’s never much tension. It’s the kind of game that you can play at leisure, while also being very fun.The setting, mind you, will at some point take an abrupt turn - in literal terms, you’ll start to go downhill instead of up - and from there the mood will start to shift. Just wait.Everything, from the settings to the cliches, will there reveal itself as a tool, a gameplay feature employed by the developer to serve a purpose - but it’s a purpose I shan’t spoil. Even the controller, which you’d spent a decent time mastering, will turn out to have, all along, been a pawn expertly positioned in storytelling.Towards the end every piece will culminate like a well-choreographed dance, a superbly-structured film. And in many ways this game is a film, but it’s the kind of film that the developer goes to lengths to make sure you’re a part of. Enjoy it.Because you may not want to play this game twice. You’ll certainly want others to play it, to experience it with child-like eyes; but you’ll also wish that you could return to when your own eyes were child-like - when, you might say, times were happier. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is just one of those games that you can never un-play.10/10P.S. I purchased this game on sale (80% off, I think). Whether you think it's worth the full price will depend on if, for the same price, you'd purchase a 3-hour film that you knew would be great to watch.			"

Don't get fooled by the nonsensical dialog though. Every action and emotions plays out perfectly well and drags you deeper into the game. A message to my 3 brothers. I love you guys.

Positive:- Beautiful scenery (seriously, the character models might not be so impressive but the environment is stunning)- Nice music (a great atmosphere is created in conjunction with the scenery)- Fun and non-frustrating puzzles- Interesting controls- OK storyNegative:- Game is relatively short (perhaps 2-4 hours)- Controls can be tricky to get used to (especially if you're playing alone)- Not much of a challenge - Story is not as fantastic as other reviews seem to make it out to beConclusion:While the storyline is nice and tear-jerking, the scenery, music and game-play is what made this game for me. The world created for the Brothers is the major selling point! The story is OK at best, unfortunately. Not the most creative or mind blowing, but not mediocre either. Furthermore, the controls are creative but also confusing at the same time. When playing with a controller, you control each brother separately using the two analogue sticks and trigger buttons. Sounds simple enough, right? Yes, until you mistakenly let go of the wrong trigger button and one brother goes plummeting to his death. No biggie. However, I played this game twice: once alone and once with my girlfriend. When playing with a friend this becomes a much more enjoyable experience. Each player can take control of one brother by sharing a controller: one analogue stick and trigger button each. This basically nullifies control confusion. So grab your significant other and buckle down for a pleasant few hours!If you want to spend a few hours playing a very casual puzzle-platformer with great scenery then this is the game for you! Having said that, I would NOT pay full price for this game. Wait for a sweet deal and grab it then.			"

												This game is pretty great. The developers managed to do better characterization without any real dialogue than most games can manage with hundreds of lines of dialogue. The visuals and music are excellent as well, and they give the game a very distinct atmosphere. My only real complaint is that this is a barebones console port. The beatiful graphics would be well served by options to increase the graphics quality, but unfortunately there are only resolution and v-sync settings. Also, although this game does not actually *require* a controller, you don't want to play this with a mouse and keyboard anyway. In the end this game is absolutely still worth your time.			"

												Quite simple. This is a great game. It's a well-told story that doesn't use and words to tell it. It's got emotional impact and  unique mechanics. It's not a long game, it's not the greatest triple-A graphics, but you owe it to yourself to play it. It can be played in a single session, and you should really do it when you are alone.A simply great game.			"

Definitely worth playing! + Beautiful game+ Unique controls (Each brother controlled with separate analog sticks)+ Ties emotions perfectly to the controls+ Game mechanics are not overused+ Great emotional story with any real dialogue (they speak in a sim-like language)+ Achievements are not rewarded for playing the story but by going off and exploring the world+/- Game is short (2-3 hours) but its the perfect amount for the story being told+/- Puzzles are not overly challenging but the story helps you to forget that- Must be played with a gamepad to get the best experience			"

												Alright, I read some reviews before I bought it, just now finished it. And I pretty much agree with the positive and the negative reviews ;)Very linear, puzzles rather easy, replayability kinda low, sometimes a bit clunky controls. And the camera is at times very annoying.On the other hand, stunning visuals, especially in the latter part, fascinating and gripping, a bit like a movie, well worth the discounted price in the summer sale imho.It is also true that the game has some disturbing parts that are not exactly that well suited for very little children for example.Anyway, I don't regret getting it, any game that makes me go ""woaaah"" while I play is good. I mean, if you just shrug away every visual here, you have to be dead inside. Okay, it also had some parts where I just shook my head, but, eh, if you take it for what it is, more like a moviepuzzle-experience, it's certainly worth getting. If, however, you expect a very engaging puzzle-platformer, this is probably not the game for you. Also the plot might not be to everyones liking. Whether good or bad, you'll probably keep this one somewhere in your memory.Good, albeit short experience and definitely worth getting on sale if you are not sure if you'll enjoy the style or expect more freedom and harder puzzles.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is often named as one of the best example of games that use the tools proper of the video game medium in a way that no other does.The main ""gimmick"" of the game is the fact that you control the titular two brothers at once, using one analog control stick and one ""action"" button for each. This mechanic, alien at first, quickly becomes second nature, letting you fully enjoy your travels through beautiful scenery following the brothers on a quest to find a cure for their dying father.Talking about storytelling, that's another way Brothers sets itself apart from most other games, as the simple, fable-like story is told using gameplay and rare in-engine cutscenes.You find out the personality and quirks of each brother by the way they interact with each other and with the people and creatures they encounter during the journey. You understand the power of their brotherly bond by the way they help each other out solving puzzles or getting out of difficult situations. All of this without ever having to read or hear a single word.I would 100% recommend Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons if it wasn't already clear enough, as the way the game marries its storytelling to its mechanics is truly fascinating and definitely worth the 2 to 4 hours needed to complete it.

IntroBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons. This game really touches your heart in many different ways. Before I dive into the specifics of the game, I'll go over the generalities. I'll have a more in-depth review of the ending for the people that have actually completed the game with analysis, themes, meanings, etc.Story:Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a story based puzzle game. The basic story revolves around two sons and their journey to help their father who has been struck with an illness. The brothers are forced to solve some puzzles guaranteed to make you think and help many different characters along the way. In this short 2-4 hour adventure, the game still managed to make me feel a genuine concern for each and every character introduced along the way. Not many games can really do that. Controls/Gameplay:The controls are challenging, to say the least. Depending on whether you use a controller or the keyboard, the left joystick and left trigger control the older brother while the right stick and right trigger control the younger brother. Likewise, on the keyboard, WASD will control one of the brothers and the arrow keys will control another, the space bar and ctrl button taking place of the triggers. Despite these being the only controls in the game for movement and action, I found myself constantly confusing myself on which of the brothers I was controlling. This wasn't really a frustration, but it did allow for some amusing points in the game where both brothers would be running into a wall. As for the gameplay, the game pits you against puzzles throughout your adventure. The puzzle difficulty increases as the game progresses, but I wouldn't say that there were any puzzles that will keep you stuck in the game for more than 2 minutes. Many puzzles require the two brothers to use teamwork, leading to some rewarding moments upon completing a puzzle.Graphics/PresentationThe graphics fit into the games core design and mood very well. Running on the unreal engine, the game runs very smooth and I encountered no significant FPS drops during the game. From being high up in the mountains to running across glacier ice caps, the game looked beautiful throughout. The game won't blow you away compared to games running on the more powerful engines of Battlefield and Crysis, but Brothers does its job very well. The music in this game is also top notch. The music definitely sets the mood and makes the player feel a certain way. Flawless execution there.Final Thoughts:Even though I find many positives to say for the game, I feel that this kind of game wouldn't be fit for everyone. Although it may seem appealing to many people from reviews and video clips, this game is suited towards a more mature audience. If you are a type of person to play games seeking pure entertainment and wants the game to give you more than you put into it, I recommend you not buy it. I also think that the $15 pricing is a bit too steep. I really wanted to play this game for a while, and I only purchased it after it went on sale for $1.50. If you are willing to pay $15 for a 2-4 hour game, then by all means, do so. I do feel that the developers deserve that much, but the game doesn't give you $15 of content. Instead, it gives you a memorable gaming experience with many things to remember and think back on. This is the type of game that people will complete and spend a lot of time thinking about what just happened. What this game lacks in content it makes up for in memorability.Final Rating: 9/10 (missing 1 point from length of actual game)SPOILERS. THIS PORTION IS ANALYSIS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLETED THE GAMEThere will be many people that complete the game and do not see it as I do. However, the ending is a lot more dense then what you actually play through. If you put yourself in the shoes of the younger brother, the game does feel a lot more harder to bear. Your older brother just died. Throughout the whole game, you and your older brother were inseparable. If you went too far off, you would stop and you would call your older brother over. If your older brother went too far off, he would stop and call you over. If there was something that you couldn't do, you could do it with the help of your older brother. Your flaws in strength and inability to swim are gone with the help of your brother. If you couldn't reach something, your brother was there to boost you up. You became perfect. Unstoppable. With your brother by your side, nothing could go wrong. But now, he's dead.You aren't immortal. Your flaws are back. If something goes wrong, you don't have your older brother to turn to. Not only that, you have to dig a grave for your brother and then bury him with your own hands. If you didn't think about this during your first playthrough, I suggest you replay that portion of the game and think about this. Upon burying your brother, you are taken back to your hometown. But you aren't taken back right away. You fly over the glaciers, through the mountains, past the castle. You are shown all the places that you have been to be able to get the medicine to heal your father. Getting through all these places would not have been possible without your older brother. When you arrive back to your hometown, you come across water. You can't swim, how are you going to get across? Normally, you would press the action button for the younger brother and grab onto the older brother. But this time, you press the action button of the older brother. Your brother's voice echos through your head as you swim for the first time across the lake. You come across a switch that you're too weak to pull. Again, you press the action button for the older brother and manage to pull the switch down. You come across a ledge you can't reach. Once again, you make it up while pressing the action button for the older brother. Using the action button for the older brother makes it seem that you are borrowing the strength of the older brother to do things that you normally couldn't. Keeping his older brother in mind, the younger brother is able to do things he would normally be unable to do in order to complete both of their goals: saving their father. The final cutscene shows the father crying over the older brother's grave, but the younger brother stands in silent mourning. The younger brother knows that even thought his older brother is gone, his voice will be with him and empower him to continue to push himself to do things beyond his own power.Quick Last ThoughtsThroughout the whole game, the younger brother is seen to have a close connection with the mother. The opening cutscene shows him mourning over his mother's death, midway through the game, the younger brother has a dream about his mother, and at the end of the game, he gets a vision of his mother who influences him to swim across the water. The older brother is seen to have a close connection with the father. After the initial opening cutscene, the older brother comes to the younger brother and asks for help to get their father to the doctor. Midway through the game, the older brother has a flashback to him and the father fishing. At then end of the game, those close connections are gone. It can be implied that the older brother-mother and the younger brother-father weren't as close as  younger-mother older-father. At the end of the game, the older brother is with the mother and the father is with the younger brother. With that, both bonds can become stronger.Great game. If did not manage to see these connections on your first play through, I suggest going through the ending once more.			"

												Everyone knows and most have their constantly growing - especially after a big sale - tower of 'games to play in the future' here on Steam. Most of these games will never be played at all, but sometimes there is a little gem, where you ask yourself, why you waited so long to find it.'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons' is one of those gems!After a long time I decided to give this game a try, that promotes itself with a very unique co-op gameplay with one controller. Being not that much of a fan of controller based games I was impressed how very well this game uses this advertised feature. After getting that small barrier (for me) out of the way, a very good story (for a 'puzzle platformer') presented in a graphical wonderful world awaited me.The puzzles and platforming parts aren't hard at all, so it is possible to fluently play through this game without getting stuck. Every chapter holds some little secrets, so it encourages you to explore the small world a bit.So if you are not afraid of multitask two players on one controller by yourself, then grab that game.

Its a short game only about 2-3 hours of playtime but at least it didnt have any useless padding. The story is nice and touching. The puzzle and platforming is casual, a great game to play when your in laid back mood.And the best of all, this is the greatest coop game that I played. My left and right hand didnt argue with each other especially when one hand wanted to explore every space in the game world, the other just tag along merrily.			"

There is nothing not to like about this game beautiful scenery, serene music, fun game play and puzzle solving, I highly recommend it.			"

												*Update 11/2016 - Nominated for Steam Awards; 'I'm not crying, there is something in my eye'* | A wonderful tale with a unique and refreshing gameplay control experience.  The dual character control from one controller is easy to pick up, and the various puzzles and gameplay elements introduced throughout the game keep the control style from getting stale. Many aspects of the journey of the brothers involve helping others, and in return, they help the brothers to advance through the various areas and puzzles, which is delivered wonderfully and seamlessly (no fetch quests).  With a more peaceful overtone to the game, when you do encounter the few “violent” pieces of the game they have that much greater impact and dig a bit deeper into your emotions. The graphics, environment/set design, and audio are all very well done.  On your journey you pass through many beautiful landscapes with perfectly matched gentle music scores and ambience, dark and dreary battlefields with ominous overtones, and magical places with quite a unique and mystical feel.“Brothers” is a wonderful experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to fill 3 hours with a memorable, fun, and sometimes ‘heart-string pulling’, time.

												I have long held the belief that video games can do things that other forms of entertainment cannot, due in part to their interactive nature. I have never seen that belief more actualized than the way it is in Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons. This is the finest example of a video game as art I have ever seen. It's perfectly paced, perfectly challenging, and I have never come closer to crying at a video game in my entire life. And it doesn't overstay its welcome, either; the game only lasts for three hours, tops. Unfortunately, I can’t express exactly what I am talking about without spoiling the game big-time. It is an experience that needs to be played. Buy this game and clear your schedule and just play it in one sitting. It will change the way you feel about what video games are and, more importantly, it will change the way you feel about what video games can do.			"

												Short and sweet, takes about an afternoon to complete.Story and narrative are all but absent. The characters speak but not in any language I know, it may as well have been grunts or whistles. The game is more about the adventure. I found that the premise, a quest to get medicine for your sick and dying Dad, didn't really fit with the tone and pacing of the actual quest. It felt like the game was encouraging me to explore, play and muck around rather than urgently pushing you through the journey to save someone.Aside from this the adventure was pleasant with some elements I wasn't expecting. A word of warning though, despite the screen shots you see on Steam the game is definitely not appropriate for young children, the first half is OK but things start to get very dark, scary and violent after the halfway mark.ControlsI found the controls a little akward. Controlling two charcters on screen at once is very difficult to co-ordinate. I think the game would have lent itself quite well to actual co-op play but sadly there is none to speak of. The game play is fairly simple and there are no areas where you will get stuck trying to figure stuff out which means that you can focus on the story and the beatifully realised game world.Graphics are last gen console quality and it seems as though it was more or les a direct port with no imrpovement on the PC. In saying that though, the graphics are almost flawless and there are some really nice details through out. For example, the shadows in some parts of the game actually enhance the story as the game progresses.Sound and music Fit well with the game and the ambience is nice.All in all a great game especially if you pick it up on special. A good few hours of light entertainment. Aside from the controlls the game is not challenging at all but not in a bad way.			"

												Super intelligent game and an emotional masterclass in story telling. As a game, it is rarely difficult or overly challenging but that 100% doesn't matter as the strength of the game is in its story and the journey of the brothers.  I was hooked and played it from start to finish in a 3 hour session. It might sound a little short but I think the length is absolutely right and you will be amazed at how far you come in that time. It's a really good game and despite knowing the story now I've completed it, I will be playing again. Dual Stick controller recommended to make the most of the innovative control system, though there are keyboard controls. I love the way the game uses camera angles to show you just how far you have travelled or how far lies ahead in the unique and gorgeous fantasy world. I picked it up in the 2013 winter sale, but it is well worth the full asking price. Starbreeze are back on form!			"

												An emotional rollercoaster played in a 3D painting. This is a beauty, a real beauty.A short but oh so sweet story puzzler about hardship, life and death.The not so deep story does leaves an emotional scar for people with empathy.If the kidsplay versus hardship doesn't get you, the music will. If that doesn't work, there is still the cute animals and some gore.The reason this is short is, because the game actually doesn't punish you too severly for making a mistake and everything you have to figure out is pretty much close to realism. If that is possible in a fairytale. The expierience doesn't feel short, you are on an urgent mission, so not interrupting the flow of the game is a plus.And then there is the reason I bought the game. The controlling of two characters at the same time. It really works well and it makes the game an instant classic. I'm begging for more gameplay like this. I like regular gameplay just like the next guy, but anybody who tries something new and pulls it off, always get the cake.Classic			"

Story sucks you in as you go on an adventure and I could not put this game down. Expect puzzles, many feels and a chilling soundtrack. You'll find yourself staring at the rolling credits, trying to process what the ♥♥♥♥ just happened - that's a sign of an awesome game.			"

												Good:Stellar graphicsUnique gameplayBeautiful storySoothing scorePacingBad:Not keyboard-friendlyShortSummary:From the dev team that brought us games like The Darkness, Chronicles of Riddick, and Syndicate, Starbreeze Studios have tried something refreshing and much appreciated. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons keeps the narrative-driven gaming trend going this year with relateable interactions and development in an unforgettable journey.The game starts off showing a flashback of the mother of the two sons' death. Whilst reminiscing on that tragic day, the two brothers' father falls ill. After a trip to the local doctor, the brothers are told about the water from the 'tree of life' which appears to be the only way to save their dad, and so their quest begins.Right off the bat the visuals are phenomenal, making use of the Unreal Engine 3. Vibrant colors shown in various settings such as forests, mountains, dungeons, and small towns, nice cell-shading style, detailed shadows...for an indie-style game, it actually looks on par or even better than some AAA titles. To top it off, the soundtrack sets the tone and brings the world to life, immerseful and always in the back of your mind whilst playing (see video at the top to get an idea).The controls are unlike any I've played before it. You control two characters simultaneously, and whilst there's very few controls to use (movement for either side of analogs, and one button interaction for each brother), how they integrated and executed the controls is brilliant. It takes some getting used to, and you'd tend to forget a finger on a button here or there whilst trying to keep the brothers on track with their mission, but the game isn't punishing. It's simplistic and overall not too difficult to play. The two brothers rely on one another to move forward, both having significant differences to get through various puzzles. However, playing with a keyboard can prove to be frustrating. Definitely recommend a controller (even the Steam page claims it requires a controller to play, although keyboard controls are available).There is never a dull moment in this game. The pacing is perfect. For such simple mechanics with the unique twist of controlling two characters at once, each segment, or well, chapter, is different and utilizes the innovative controls in a variety of ways. And the best part about the pacing is, and this is a debatable point, the simple puzzles keep the game from detouring and ruining its experience.Whilst the gameplay and graphics are integral, very fun parts of the game, what outshines more than anything, what brings all the elements together and shapes it into an extraordinary game, is the growth of the brothers. They have to go through hell and high water in order to save their father, and like any group of siblings stuck together for so long, there's going to be rivalry. Their age and clothing show their typical, rather cliche attitudes well, and we need that to piece their styles together as there's no English in this game. There's voice-acting, but done in a fake language allowing us to detail the characters on our own. The brothers encounter various people and things to interact with, with both reacting their on way to any given situation, further drawing their different personalities to us.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an emotional ride. It doesn't just stop with the engaging, roller coaster of a story, it is a well-rounded game with fun controls and beautiful graphics to follow suit. It shows us very, very strong bonds as children, as siblings, as a family...life lessons secretly hidden in this title. This, along with Gone Home, have really set a new mark in gaming today, pushing forward for the better of the industry. And now...I urge anyone who stuck around reading this to try it. We need more games like Brothers. These titles are taking risks and evolving the gaming industry, or have the possibility to, so long as they get more exposure. And even without talking about it, the experience itself is worth the price of admission. A general $15 full retail price for a 3-4 hour game, but there's constant sales and even if you don't catch it during a sale it's still very much worth it. Couldn't recommend Brothers enough. Thank you for reading.			"

												An emotional rollercoaster played in a 3D painting. This is a beauty, a real beauty.A short but oh so sweet story puzzler about hardship, life and death.The not so deep story does leaves an emotional scar for people with empathy.If the kidsplay versus hardship doesn't get you, the music will. If that doesn't work, there is still the cute animals and some gore.The reason this is short is, because the game actually doesn't punish you too severly for making a mistake and everything you have to figure out is pretty much close to realism. If that is possible in a fairytale. The expierience doesn't feel short, you are on an urgent mission, so not interrupting the flow of the game is a plus.And then there is the reason I bought the game. The controlling of two characters at the same time. It really works well and it makes the game an instant classic. I'm begging for more gameplay like this. I like regular gameplay just like the next guy, but anybody who tries something new and pulls it off, always get the cake.Classic			"

												I'm going to look at 4 aspects of this game. No spoilers.1) Graphics:The visual style of the game is gorgeous: It doesn't aim for realism; it's simplistic yet every scene is like an oil painting. The bright, vivid and sometimes sombre colors and the beautiful lighting are really wonderful to look at. It was a feast to my eyes.2) Sound:The game had beautiful ambient music throughout. It was uplifting at times and heart-wrenching at others. Makes you feel like you are living in fantasy world from an ancient tale. The voices of the characters were kind of annoying to me but it's really not a problem at all. Sound effects added a sense of realism. 3) Gameplay:You play with two analog sticks of one gamepad; left analog controls the older brother, right analog controls the younger one. This was refreshing, nice and challenging at times. At one point I thought: ""Well, this might have been better if it had an option for two players where you play with two gamepads."" but as the story progresses, you understand why the developers didn't go down that road and why it would actually be worse if they did: I think there are certain emotions that the developers wanted to evoke that wouldn't work if the brothers were controlled separetly.4) Story:My goodness, the story... It was so, so heartbreaking. I particulary liked one thing about it: The game has a made-up language so all of the story is conveyed just through visuals and sound and not through dialog. This stylistic choice was really unique to me and it is one of the things that really make this game what it is. You feel a certain connection to the characters but it could have been better with more flashbacks and a much longer story.In conclusion, I think Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons can be described with only one word: ART. (8.5/10)			"

												At the start of the game, I was enthralled with the art style. Through the middle I was continually impressed at the creativity, originality, and storytelling. By the end, I was sure I'd just experienced one of the best games I've ever played. At the risk of getting carried away or sounding too hyperbolic, the question of whether games can be art has been put to rest.It took me about 3 hours to complete. I mention it because, in this case, I consider that the perfect length. It is as long it needed to be; no more, no less. Long enough to be a great experience, with no unnecessary ""filler."" More importantly, it is short enough that you have no excuse to not see it through to completion.Were I doing a more clinical breakdown, I might mention great choices on the part of the developers, like having no HUD to distract or pull the player out of the experience. Or the fantastic art and sound design. Or the fact that they respected players' brains enough to let us infer the finer points of the story through context and body language, rather than beating us over the head with exposition. Or, perhaps most impressively, the way they use the controls themselves to great effect. (On that note, ""Brothers"" really deserves the proper playing environment: preferrably a gamepad with dual analog thumbsticks. If you don't have an Xbox 360 pad for PC, but you do own a modern gaming console, consider purchasing it on your console of choice instead. The controls are that important, in my opinion.)Since this ISN'T a clinical breakdown, however, I'll simply say that ""Brothers"" deserves a few hours of your time.			"

												It's a GREAT concept. I really enjoyed the game, but I think this is more a Coop idea than a Single Player. Yes, the idea of controlling both characters is good but it should definetly have Coop added. I also played it on a Keyboard with my Girlfriend, and we had a really fun time. It is not meant to be played that way, but the hand overlap, and the Control bugs we had by pressing too many keys at the same time were not that bad.For a gamer, the puzzles are too simple. It is a very short game, but it's worth it. It's more of a movie experience than a game one.Definetly not worth $15 USD if you are searching for a gaming experience, but around $3-5 it's ok.I HATED THE ENDING			"

												Everyone knows and most have their constantly growing - especially after a big sale - tower of 'games to play in the future' here on Steam. Most of these games will never be played at all, but sometimes there is a little gem, where you ask yourself, why you waited so long to find it.'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons' is one of those gems!After a long time I decided to give this game a try, that promotes itself with a very unique co-op gameplay with one controller. Being not that much of a fan of controller based games I was impressed how very well this game uses this advertised feature. After getting that small barrier (for me) out of the way, a very good story (for a 'puzzle platformer') presented in a graphical wonderful world awaited me.The puzzles and platforming parts aren't hard at all, so it is possible to fluently play through this game without getting stuck. Every chapter holds some little secrets, so it encourages you to explore the small world a bit.So if you are not afraid of multitask two players on one controller by yourself, then grab that game.

												People looking for an exceedingly long game, or something where they can stray off the path quite often and do what they please..this isn't really for you. There are some times where you can stray and earn achievements, which is always rather satisfying and quite often cute or heartfelt, but other than that you're mainly expected to get things done for the main storyline. You're trying to save your ailing father, after all!  Nevertheless, this game has something that I'll call artistic value, not to mention something to say. It's about growing up and the acceptance of death, and learning that life can be difficult at too young of an age, but finding the strength to go on. The gameplay is fun and a bit out of the ordinary, the scenery is gorgeous and the game has no understandable dialogue but manages still to have one; humans say a lot with body language, after all. All in all it was quite an enjoyable experience, and seeing as I picked it up for under five dollars with a sale and some money in my steam wallet from trading cards, I'd say it was worth much more than I paid, despite its short length.

The puzzle and platforming is casual, a great game to play when your in laid back mood.And the best of all, this is the greatest coop game that I played.

												This game is pretty great. The developers managed to do better characterization without any real dialogue than most games can manage with hundreds of lines of dialogue. The visuals and music are excellent as well, and they give the game a very distinct atmosphere. My only real complaint is that this is a barebones console port. The beatiful graphics would be well served by options to increase the graphics quality, but unfortunately there are only resolution and v-sync settings. Also, although this game does not actually *require* a controller, you don't want to play this with a mouse and keyboard anyway. In the end this game is absolutely still worth your time.			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons likely contains the most human story to be told in a video game for the entire year of 2013. Dialogue is absent from the game entirely; instead, there is a tasteful reliance on visuals and sound to tell the tale, and boy oh boy (no pun intended), is this EVER a tale to be told. The gameplay consists of moving two brothers simultaneously through a vivid fairytale. The player must use both brothers for problem solving, whether it is action-related, puzzle-related, or even a boss fight. There is no attack button, so don’t expect a hack and slash. As far as the story goes, what starts out as a typical fairytale progresses into something darkly heartwarming. There should be a bit of real life in every fairytale and this game nails that idea perfectly.			"

												If you are on this page, it means you are considering this game. My advice? Stop and buy it. Now.There is no reason not to. The gameplay is new and refreshing, the story is well told and very moving, the music is simply beautiful and the art style is simple and elegent. There is nothing bad about Brothers and it is a breath of fresh air considering the types of games being released nowadays. To complete the game and do everything would take little more than five hours. While this might seem short for what it costs, it is worth every bit of it. In fact, if I could I would go back and pay the fifteen dollars again. This is the type of game that should be being made, not Call of Duty 18.It really doesn't matter who you are, you can't help but like this game. As I said at the beginning, if you are on this store page and reading reviews, just go and click the ""Add to Cart"" button (then, if you don't have one, go out and buy an Xbox controller for PC) you won't regret it.

												This was one of the most heartbreaking and most touching and emotional games I've played in 2014.So simple to control, yet so puzzling.You control two brothers on the quest to save their father by using both of the Control Sticks and shoulder triggers at the same time, and the puzzles are all around both brothers doing something, so both can advance further. There is a lot to find and explore (see achievements), and the immense attention to details far away, and nearby. The VA (whatever language it is) and the lack of UI drastically add to the mood of this game.Don't let you scare away of the Xbox controller requirement. I played it with a Wii U Pro controller and it worked just fine.I cried several times during this game. Worth full price.			"

												This game is definetely one of the very best I've ever played in any genre. The scenery is jaw dropping, the musical score is excellent and the story is very compelling, even though not a complete sentence of dialogue occurs anywhere in the game.Although the style of play requires a controller (in the sense of being able to play smoothly; you can also play with the keyboard, but it's kind of tedious), the game at no point feels repetitive. The puzzles are not very hard, but fun and the story will keep you glued to your chair for hours. I don't want to spoil the storyline, but the way emotions are evoked without saying a word is amazing.Buy it, trust me!			"

												I find the control scheme to be very confusing so far, almost to the point of frustrating, but I haven't gotten very far. When the brothers switch places on screen (big is on right, small is on left, controls are static for big on left, small on right) that controlling them becomes a confusing matter and suddenly one dude is going the other direction. You kind of have to stop, have them run to the ""correct"" sides of the screen and then work on a puzzle. Then I'm good and can play it without losing the pacing.Audio is very sublime, graphics are absurdly atmospheric, the whole fantasy is just really fantastic. They don't speak english but it's got a nice sort of ICO feel to it, without the combat.			"

												This game is amazing. The gameplay mechanic of single-player local co-op is unique and fun, even if the game isn't challenging. The visuals are beautiful, and the aesthetic style of the game looks like a painting from a fairy tale book. The game is very charming, with polish in unexpected areas and all kinds of weird little ways to interact with the environment. I found the end of the game very touching, more emotionally touching than any other game I can remember. The music was very good and unique, which added to the whole experience.This is a great artsy little game that is charming and unique. It's very short and sweet. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes videogames.			"

												If you're okay with a game with little replay value, and if you're okay with a game that isn't very long, and you just want a raw story..Then buy this game.It's 4 hours long, but well worth any price.There's not much that could be said about this game without spoiling anything, but basically you use a controller and the left stick is the big brother, and the right stick is the little brother. You use the brothers at the same time to complete context sensitive tasks and puzzles.Again, not going to spoil anything, but there's a huge chunk of symbolism with the way you use your controller towards the end.Oh yeah, you don't NEED a controller, but it makes it a lot easier to play in my opinion, due to the mechanics.

												I could talk about the faults of this game, like broken textures and bugged out scripted events, but i simply wont. Because the story and mechanics of the game overshadowed all of its problems/issues by a longshot. Im probably not the first person to say that the game experience is an engaging emotional rollercoaster. Never have I felt such a deep emotional connection to a game character(s) and felt so involved in a game's story. Im not ashamed to say that I cried my eyes out several times while playing.To fully enjoy the experience it is imperative that you use a controller for this game (I went out and bought an xbox controller just for this reason); it works with keyboard, but it is not the same thing... AT ALL.I want to write more about the game, but I'm just gonna say: Buy it. It is worth its original price (14EUR), its DEFINATELY WORTH 4.19EUR.Do it! Go buy it! I'll shut up now. "

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a very powerful and emotional game, which manages to deliver a beautiful and captivating story without any dialogue or written story-telling. All the story-telling is done by the character's body languages or the game simply showing that something is happening in the area. It has a gorgeous art style and some beautifully designed levels, both visually and how you progress through them. They're very linear though, with only some minor exploration leading to a nice view or something to do for an achievement. Your goal in this game is to find some magical tree and bring back some water of the healing well inside of it, in order to cure your ill father.The gameplay is quite innovative, putting the player in control of both characters at once, using only one controller. The left thumb stick and trigger control one character's movement and actions, and the right stick and trigger are used for the other character. Keyboard support has been added some time ago as well, but I can't vouch for how well that works as I only played it with a controller. It's pretty tricky to get used to at first, and I often had to move one character at a time or pause shortly before releasing a character's action button to make sure I wouldn't accidentally let the other character fall to his death. Most puzzles and obstacles require the brothers to work together and make up for each other's weaknesses. The big brother is the strongest one so he will be pulling heavy switches and carrying things, as well as boosting his little brother to higher platforms. The little brother never learned to swim due to being traumatized by seeing his mother drown in front of his eyes, so he clings onto his bigger brother when they need to swim through a river or pond. But because he is more nimble he manages to get to some places where the big brother can't get to and then helps him get past. A lot of the time you will also need to use both brothers at once to move something heavy or interact with two things that are spread apart at once.The ending is very emotional, but obviously I can't talk about that because it would spoil the entire experience for anyone who hasn't played this yet. And if you haven't, I really recommend you do. It goes really cheap during sales, and it only takes about three hours to complete. Despite being so very short, it still delivers a great experience that's really worth your time, especially if you're open to the more artsy and touching games out there. It would be cool to play this game with someone else online, but then that would also take away the innovative controls which are part of what makes this game such a great experience.			"

The gameplay, the narrative, the atmosphere and scenery all add to the overall experience. Whilst not completely original in idea, it is original in execution.The gameplay done via a controller is nothing short of superb.

This is achieved by the importance of showing the audience rather than telling, so the distinct choice to remove dialogue and ""tell"" the story through visual aids (read body language) and integrated cut-scenes of events is nothing short of brilliant. Each interaction and challenge that the two boys overcome leads to greater involvement in their supportive relationship, and even as just a witness to the relationship the player feels involved as the instrumental force behind their achievements.Other characters within the world offset the two brothers, from incidents of being bullied and bullying themselves to acts of compassion and friendship, each additional interaction adds to and assists our understanding of the two boys. Their development as characters and the imaginative world-building adds up to an immersive experience that is thoroughly enjoyable.The fairytale like world itself is fascinating, whilst we witness stereotypes, there are enough non-cliched characters to offset the tale as a whole, and overall the story of loss and grief gains a veneer of the beauty of life for being presented in this format. The world itself is gorgeously rendered, the style adopts a medium between realism and a more cartoonist-storybook style. While the graphics will date, it has enough artistic leeway in not adopting a purely realistic stance that it will still be pleasant if not beautiful to look at in years to come. The game is unfortunately very short. It runs about twice the duration of a movie, and there is little replayability value, as the narrative is self-contained. The only reason to replay would be similar to the reason why we return to a good book again and again. To experience the message and overall story again because it has become a beloved addition to our personal experience.			"

Plays fine with a keyboard after 10 mins of getting familar to the controls even though the store page warning makes it seems as if the controller is mandatory.ii.) Achievement hunters beware, you have to pay attention to get them pesky ones and there is no backtracking with most points being of no return nature.			"

												It wasn't until the latest Steam Summer Sale that I have heard about this game. I bought it for mere 2 euros then, but after playing the game I can assure you that it is even worth the full price. Throughout my gaming years I have encountered many different games with many different stories, gameplay mechanics, etc. But this game stands out as a unique example of a gaming masterpiece. Why, might you ask yourself?First, the game tells a story that maybe isn't the most original story ever told before, but the way it presents itself is simply amazing. You will almost instantly develop emotional connection with both of the brothers and it will last till the very last moment of the game. I can count with one hand the number of games that had such an emotional impact on me as this game did.Second, the mechanics and gameplay are something I've never seen before. The reason Steam warns you that you need a controller to play is because you control both brothers at the same time. It seems tricky, but in reality is very natural and fluid. You will get a hold of it in minutes. I liked the concept.All things being said, this game is short, but will take you on such emotional rollercoaster in it's 3-4 hours of story that you will never forget. Must play.			"

												Personal Rating: 9/10An emotional adventure not as aesthetically unique as Journey and not as powerful as The Last of Us, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons lies somewhere in between. It is above all a story told with no more than pseudowords and names (I'm thinking it's not really a conlang they speak) and an accurate soundtrack that fits perfectly with each sequence. The plot itself is rather simple. Two brothers must save their father who is terribly ill. For that they have to reach the Tree of Life and harvest the water that springs from its center. A lot happens, and I can just say that the whole journey is unforgettable. The whole artwork and design is at times reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus and ICO, in which the player journeys into and out of the dreamlike “Forbidden Lands”. The very concept of travel, journey and quest is essential to the whole atmosphere of both games, and it works the same way in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. (Also, one can see how the couple's escape in ICO and the wanderer's quest to save his loved one in SotC might have influenced Starbreeze.) As to gameplay, the controls feel very awkward at first, and even by the end of the game I still struggled here and there. But they never get to the point of breaking immersion. On the contrary: for me playing this game feels exactly as it should — you must control both brothers simultaneously rather than alternating between the two as is commonly done. This is especially effective in one particular chapter, in a way which I won’t comment in order to avoid spoilers. I have seen many game reviewers (from ACG to Downward Thrust and Satchbag) discussing the gameplay aspects of adventure games and whether they function more like interactive movies or  proper  games. Indeed this could be argued in cases such as Gone Home or the Telltale games in general. But where these games' mechanics are rather epiphenomenal, the gameplay of Brothers enriches the experience in ways I can hardly explain without spoiling the story.Though the game is short, I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in the  style  of game I vaguely call “an experience”. Indeed, unless you are too impatient with unconventional, inventive controls (in which case you will hate this game), I say this game is definitely worth a try.			"

												Type of Game:Third Person AdventureVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Ico, Lost Vikings, & to a lesser degree UnchartedThe Good:Exploration is very rewarding as the game has beautiful sceneryThe story is gripping and as good as any motion picture out thereThe control scheme (each stick controls each individual brother) really lends itself to the game in an immersive wayWonderful characters that are relatable and expressive (even the supporting cast)Puzzles are fun and not too difficult, but still give you that “AHA!” feelAn emotionally gripping game that really pulls at the heart stringsWonderful soundtrackThe Bad:Requires a controllerOver fairly quickly (2 – 3 hours)Depending on your budget it may be too expensive (personally I got my moneys’ worth hence my price point below)Can you play it while the children are awake?:For the most part, yes.  MILD SPOILERS: A certain portion of the game has some corpses hanging from trees and there is a frightening spider monster that may scare the younger ones.Did I make time to complete it?:I beat it in 3 hours and loved every minute of it.  I consider the purchase the equivalent of a movie ticket, which is almost the same price!Recommended Purchase Price:$14.99GAME REVIEWS @ A GLANCE:www.gamersglance.com "

												Wow, When I got this game I really had no idea what I was in for. It was on a flash sale so I picked it up to add to my collection. The graphics are great, from the enviroment to the characters themselves. The detail and artwork is just amazing. The game is definitley candy for the eye. For a game that uses body language and dialog sounding similar to the Sims games. The story really grabs you. is emotional and is easy to understand. Now the controls are a different story. I left everything at default and tried with the keyboard at first but seeing as you have to control both characters at once. The controller soon fell into my hands. The controller made this game a whole lot easier to play using the joysticks, but it still takes quite a bit of hand eye corrdination to get it down With about 3 - 4 hrs of gameplay total it had me hooked for the entire session. Definitly worth the full price even though I got it on sale. Highly Recommended.			"

												 Two sons must set out on a perilous journey to bring back the Water of Life to their ailing father. I TOTALLY LOVE THIS GAME , THE STORY , WELL I FIND THE STORY VERY WEIRD.... O_O BUT I LOVE THE GAME , I DO ENJOY IT , BUT there's also those parts where i say ""ahh.."" this isn't the type of the game.. i thought it was :D But still a great game , good :D thing for me buying it and i RECOMMEND YOU GUYS! I LOVE THE PART WHERE U HAVE TO SAVE A SUCIDING MAN.... AND YOU JUST GIVE HIM HOPE WOW. I can happily call this game my game of the year. This is mainly down to the games ability to tell a story without using a single word of English. During game play you will feel a whole range of emotions from anger, sadness all the way to happiness and excitement. This game in my eyes is a 10 out of 10 no questions. :D			"

												I'll cut right to the chase on this one - this game is amazing. Seriously, like, really good. But if you're still on the fence, or want more details, read on...You play as two brothers, who you control at the same time using one controller (single player co-op, essentially). The left stick and left trigger button control the older brother's movement and all-purpose ""action"" ability, respectively, and the right stick and trigger similarly handle the younger brother's actions. For the first couple of minutes, controlling both characters simultaneously feels a bit awkward, but it quickly becomes second nature. The game does a nice job of easing you into the controls. Gameplay mainly consists of some basic platforming and solving puzzles using cooperation between the brothers. Brothers is not a challenging game whatsoever, and the path you take from start to finish is pretty much linear. On paper, those two things may seem like negatives. However, in conjunction with the rest of the experience, I felt the mechanics and ease of gameplay worked perfectly. This is not a game one plays for a challenge. It is a journey you take, experiencing the story of these brothers, in their quest to find a cure for their ailing father. This game is all about that journey, and experiencing the amazing sights and sounds of each new area and challenge that the brothers face. To add any significant amount of frustration to that experience would have been a huge disservice to the game. It feels just perfectly balanced exactly as it is. And that is all I am going to say (to get into any more specifics would defeat the purpose of experiencing it for yourself). Brothers can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours. Even though that's not a lot, I felt it was just about right. What you get out of this game is well worth every penny, even with the short length. This is, of course, assuming that you are into these sorts of low key, emotional game experiences. If that's not your cup of tea, you may want to skip it. But for anyone else, if you are at all open to these sorts of games, you absolutely must play this at some point (though I would recommend sooner than later, so as to avoid getting inadvertently spoiled). Technical notes: On the store page for this game, it states that a controller is required. While technically that isn't true (there are settings for keyboard in the launcher options), there IS a reason it says that. I really, really, REALLY do not recommend playing this without a controller. The wired Xbox360 controller works natively with no problem, but I would assume anything with two analog sticks and left/right triggers should be fine. The game was clearly designed around using a controller, and I just don't see how using a keyboard could possibly replicate that ""zen"" experience of becoming one with the controls well enough. But hey... do whatcha gotta do.			"

Disclaimer: I have beat the game and have all of the achievements. This was an enjoyable game. The mechanics were interesting and something I haven't seen before. You control two brothers at the same time. They must work together to progress through the game. There is no English, or any known language for that matter, in this game. Surprisingly, this doesn't keep you from fully grasping the story. The brothers set out on a grand adventure, and you watch them grow emotionally, especially Little Brother. This game will give you the feels. It has a very touching story. Another surprise, the game had some pretty dark spots which I very much appreciated. I would highly suggest adding this to your wishlist and grabbing it on the next sale.			"

												I guess this is ok if you like this kind of game.  Turns out I don't.  Bought it on sale based on John Bain's recommendation.  At some point I guess one gets sucked into the story so much that it really has an affect on you (like reading a good book), but alas, I didn't get there before completely losing interest.  Can't recommend it, but if it's on a really good sale and you know what you're getting into, it's probably an oustanding value.			"

												A very charming game, I highly recommend this one to everybody. It requires a controller to play but that is half the fun. The left side of the controller is for the older brother while the right side is the younger brother. This makes the puzzle solving a bit more interesting in that a few times I found myself mixing up the buttons resulting in one brothers unfortunate death. This game has a lot to offer though even in the limited 3-4 hours it takes to complete the game with all the achievements. The story and characters are extremely likable and recognizable even though the language they use is completely imaginary. The art really got me too, there are these benches you can sit down in to observe the surroundings in a wide view; and I often hesitated to move on in the levels just to spend a few minutes taking in the scenery.People of all ages will enjoy this game, so check it out if you ever get the chance.

The dual character control in one controller takes some getting used to, but is not difficult.  My only complaint is that the puzzles were a little on the simple side.  If you've played Tomb Raider, then you'll breeze through it.  Take your time to enjoy the scenery, though. So much effort was put into making this game, I felt bad I got it on sale. Well worth the asking price.			"

												After all the praise this game has received, my expectations were quite high. However, after playing through, I'm a bit disappointed. The gameplay was repetitive and most of the puzzles were obvious. The story was ok, I guess, but a bit cliched, and it didn't fully succeed in making me care very much about the characters.On the upside: The game is at times very pretty, the scenery varied. Some of the humorous and/or fascinating details scattered throughout the game made me smile. It's also fairly easy, making it a relaxing experience - perfect for Sunday afternoons. And, considering the short length of the game, it never gets outright boring, although it comes close at times.			"

   Overview    Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a simplistic, yet provoking game in which you play as two brothers (simultaneously) on a quest to rescue their father from an unknown ailment. The story, character backgrounds and even your mission are shrouded in an unknown (probably gibberish) language, forcing you to rely on what the character's body language and surroundings are telling you. While it may seem difficult at first, the game does a marvelous job of keeping you on track and never feeling truly lost. It's a delicate balance that the game does quite well. I never felt lost, scrambling for what to do next.Without delving too much into the plot (for fear of giving away any spoilers), the story is straight forward, but very powerful. As the game progressed, I couldn't help but feel connected to the brothers, their family and the cast of characters you meet along the way. Without language, you're not so much being told what is happening, but experiencing it first hand, which was a treat.Visually, the game is filled with eye candy. The environments are beautiful and change drastically as you progress, letting you see a plethora of sights - from charming villages to the aftermath of a war zone. It's as visually appealing as it is thought provoking. Overall, the game is enjoyable, albeit short. If you enjoy puzzle games with some emotional storytelling, I would highly recommend this game to you.   Pros    Storytelling - The game has a unique way of guiding you without giving itself away. It's a refreshing alternative to spoken word. Visuals - The landscape is ever-changing, but always enjoyable. It leaves you with wonder and lets you fill in the gaps with your imagination. Interaction - Whether it be with other characters, animals or the environment itself, the game lets you interact with the world around you to let you understand each brother's personality. Music - Simply put, the music is an auditory joy to listen to.   Cons    Game Length - The game is short. I completed it in roughly 3.5 hours in one sitting. Some might be okay with that, some not so much. I was really hoping for more once I became invested in the characters.Difficulty - I found the game to be rather easy. I expected the puzzles to become progressively more difficult as the game carried on, but found they plateaued rather quickly.Overall, the pros heavily outweigh a few cons in my opinion. This one easily goes into my games recommendation list. It's a pleasure from start to finish, but remember to bring a a few tissues with you just in case.			"

												One of the greatest game experiences I have come across in a long time. The game goes above and beyond what you pay for.Bullet points usually get read over paragraphs:Pros:-Game doesn't hold your hand with how to control characters or how to get through obstacles. Instead excellent design gets will be enough to get you through this game-Simply stunning visuals.-Emotion is carried out extremely well without any dialogue.-Puzzles are very innovative and fun.-Variety of environmental hazards and visuals keep the game fresh.-Zero GUI elements make gives the game a clean and simplistic feelCons:-Puzzles can be a bit too easy. -Game length may be a bit short, however the price you pay for the game reflects thatBottom Line: A must play for any gamer, you'll leave the game with some personal emotional impact. This game does right what a lot of other games do wrong, and that is excellent design to guide the user rather than overbearing on screen instruction. Get this game and give it the attention it deserves, turn off all distractions and play it through to the end.			"

												Nice little gem, Brothers puts you in the shoes of two sons who need to find a special potion for their ill father, and for this they will leave together for a really short adventure (maybe too much short), between fairy locations and great dangers. The game can be described as an adventure platformer, full of environmental puzzles which must be always solved controlling both brothers, like a coop game played alone. Brothers is rather easy, you'll finish the story in about 3 hours, but the developers really nailed every aspect of it thanks to a good level design, nice graphics, very good music and excellent gameplay mechanics...in a certain way it remainded me of a masterpiece like Little Big Adventure from 1994 (20 years old!!!), so if you know or played that game back in the days, you will find a little reminiscence of it here! Good work Starbreeze!			"

The storyline is also very emotional. i recommend this game because you don't see a lot of games like this, and no matter which genres and games you like or dislike, you will love this one.

												Very inventive controls and really great worldbuilding. The environments were all really beautiful and interesting and the way you move through them was surprising throughout. I wasn't as emotionally invested as some people seem to have been, but the story works nonetheless and the controls and environments were enough to leave me with a very positive impression of the game. The game becomes increasingly surreal as you progress through it, and it made the world this takes place in really interesting. I would absolutely love to get more background information about some of the things I saw in the game. The great thing is that the game doesn't tell you anything through text or dialogue. The dialogue that's there is all in a made-up language, and there's nothing to read. Instead, the game SHOWS everything and it does a very good job at that. Everything is clear enough to get from A to B and solve the puzzles without many problems, but vague enough to remain mysterious.The controls are also a pretty good point about the game. A controller is basically a must. Each brother is controlled by one of the analogue sticks, and each has an interact-button. You control both brothers at the same time, and... it just works really well. All the puzzles are easy enough to grasp within a few seconds but still require some finesse to get right. Even so, the game isn't really about the puzzles so much as about the story and the two brothers from the title. The game takes about 3 hours to complete, perhaps a bit longer if you try to get all the achievements, which are basically just tiny extra bits of story that can be really good in their own right. I would definitely recommend this. It's not a game you can sink countless hours in, but it's definitely worth the trouble of picking up and playing through at least once.			"

												I'd recommend playing this game. The soundtracks and the in game sounds are fantastic. The game kind of provides all the things that a fan of Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider (and sometimes even Harry Potter!) wants. The story is a heart touching one, you'll love it. The game is fun played alone too, but if you've got a buddy to play with, then it just feels a whole lot different. I agree that the game is short. In fact, it took only about 3 hours to complete (while enjoying the views every now and then). But then, how much can you expect from a game that's just about 1 GB? That's right. 1 GB. You'd think that the game may be around 3 GB or so by looking at the visuals. Don't be disappointed. There are 12 achievements that you can complete, and for that it will take a lot more than 3 hours. Also, I would find it hard to imagine if you said that you wouldn't play the game again.Bonus:Suppose you are really tired at the end of the day and you just want to relax. TV shows are tiring, FPS is a little too much to handle. You can't even go out because you're lazy AF. What to do then? Play the game! The beautiful visuals, places and atmosphere combined with the background music will help you relax. You could just stand or sit on a bench, and just enjoy the view. You can thank me later. ;)			"

												Brothers is an adventure puzzle game played thru the actions and interactions of two young brothers as they go on a quest to save their ailing father.  A gamepad is a must for this game, each thumb stick controls one of the brothers, while the corresponding trigger causes each brother to take action.  In order to progress thru an environment you will have to traverse and interact with it, using each brother to manipulate different parts of the environment to move on.  The scheme works much better than I thought it would, rarely did controlling each brother at the same time feel cumbersome and after some practice it felt natural.Visually the game is very pretty, you will explore different scenery like mountains and ice, and come face to face with a vast array of NPC’s in the form of animals, giants, ferries and a host of others.  The sound is appropriate to the fantasy setting, the characters speak in a made up language, so most of the story is told thru gestures and the visuals along with the musical score, it all works together to give the gaming world a unique feeling of life.  It’s a short game, clocking in at 4 hours or so, but its just long enough to feel like you went on an adventure without getting repetitive.  Brothers is imaginative, not very violent & will challenge your brain just enough to feel like you accomplished something without frustrating you, very balanced and enjoyable experience.			"

												Play with a dual analog stick controller and prepare to have your mind blown. It's not very long, maybe two hours or so, but it is totally worth it.  Can't say much without giving it away, but it made me feel like no other game has made me feel before. Such a great idea for a game. Simply amazing.			"

												Every once in a while, the boundaries of modern narratives blend, every once in a while, something shatters and innovates tropes, aesthetics and storytelling, gameplay wise, its value lies in the intangible emotional bonds that you as the player tie between the two characters, that in itself is a stroke of genius, and if you add an amazing art direction, level design and AMAZING camera work, the experience becomes twice as powerful!This ""game"" pulls just the right cards at the exact moments, things suddenly fall into place, and the full force of the events just hit you like a ton of bircks, I loved every second of my playthrough, the vsuals are great, the music colors with drama every step of the way, and suddenly the journey becomes more important than the destination, a tearjerker for sure, this is a more mature gem, for those that want something extra, a touch of magic in their entertainment.Sure it is short, and I would have wanted more, but ist it always like that when one gets lost in the experience, and is having so much fun?Highly recomended, not for everyone, cynics and emotionally drained individuals, need not apply...

												Set in a Nordic landscape you will follow two brothers in their journey and struggle to find a cure for their sick father. It's a beautiful game with a gripping story to tell rather than giving you a challange. I would recommend you using a controller/gamepad though because you will need to take controll of both the brothers at once so two yoysticks is appreciated. Pros:+ Beautiful and atmospheric enviroment based on nordic mythology.+ Nice graphic+ Fun and not so hard puzzles.+ Fun to controll two characters at the same time and make them help each others.+ It's a cozy little game you may finnish in one sitting.+ Feels like watching a movie (in a good way)Cons:+ Sometimes the ""voices"" can be kind of disturbing+ A little to shortEven though it's kind of short I still think it's well worth the money I paid. And if your wallet still sadly doesen't agree or you believe around 3-4 hours playtime isn't worth full price be sure to pick it up on a sale later! 8/10			"

												An excellent, if short, game. The game is almost entirely story, and is told without the use of words as two brothers travel through a world helping one another to pass various obstacles. The specatcle is largely the point of the game, and the graphics are suitably awe-inspiring to allow it to work. Controls can be slightly awkward sometimes, as one half of your controller controls each brother individually - there will be times where having them on the wrong side of one another will confuse you for a half second or so - but the entire game plays seamlessly and is a wonderful experience that everyone should enjoy at least once.

I've never enjoyed any single player game as much as I enjoyed this game, it has got everything - emotions, great storyline, smooth controls, and smooth gameplay. The only downside is that it has got a very short story, very short that I completed the game in less than 5 hours.All in all, it was a great game to play and was definitely worth the money.

												One of the greatest game experiences I have come across in a long time. The game goes above and beyond what you pay for.Bullet points usually get read over paragraphs:Pros:-Game doesn't hold your hand with how to control characters or how to get through obstacles. Instead excellent design gets will be enough to get you through this game-Simply stunning visuals.-Emotion is carried out extremely well without any dialogue.-Puzzles are very innovative and fun.-Variety of environmental hazards and visuals keep the game fresh.-Zero GUI elements make gives the game a clean and simplistic feelCons:-Puzzles can be a bit too easy. -Game length may be a bit short, however the price you pay for the game reflects thatBottom Line: A must play for any gamer, you'll leave the game with some personal emotional impact. This game does right what a lot of other games do wrong, and that is excellent design to guide the user rather than overbearing on screen instruction. Get this game and give it the attention it deserves, turn off all distractions and play it through to the end.			"

												This game is easily my game of the year for 2013. What first looked to me like a small-time indie game that probably wasn't worth my time ended up being one of the most phenomenal titles I've ever played.This game tells an engaging story without a single word of spoken English; characters speak complete gibberish yet still convey emotion incredibly. It's only a 2.5-3 hour experience but it doesn't need to be any longer, it's the perfect length to finish in a single sitting and you will never feel that it has outstayed its welcome. The level and puzzle design is perfectly done, you should never need to think overly hard and you should always have a good idea of where you're meant to be going and what you're meant to be doing.Graphically the game really holds its own. I can see this title being one of those timeless games that never quite looks outdated visually; it's bright, colorful and charming. It should also be noted that the control system is unusual but not bad at all, you control each brother with a separate analog stick and bumper and it works perfectly that way. Also, that's me recommending that you play this game with a gamepad, the keyboard controls work but are nowhere near as comfortable.If you have any taste in games at all you should purchase this game, lock yourself away from any distractions, pick up your gamepad and play through this game in a single sitting. You won't regret it.			"

Some landscape are truly beautiful and make the world alive.The game keep suprising you by how diverse it is. Your journey will lead you in the mountains, in the mines, a creepy forest, abandoned city etc.. There is a lot of creativity in each obstable to overcome. You will mostly wont use the same solutions twice to overcome those obstacles.It will keep you engaged throught it simple yet effective plot and it subplots.The chemistry between the characters are great.  A real rollercoaster of emotions. It will make you happy, it will make you sad and it will leave you speechless once over.Overall it a masterpiece that deserve it place among Ico and Journey.			"

												TL;DR: Get this game and play it in one sitting. You will not regret it. This is a work of art. 95/100 does not come easily.Plot: Two brothers set off on a journey to find a magical medicine in order to cure their very ill father. This journey throughout this fantastical world takes them to many places, many scenes and environments, and they meet many people in their attempt to find the magic cure.I purchased this game as an afterthought. I had some extra cash and 2 bucks sale price is good for a game I heard was good. Where I heard that, or when, I have no idea. I started off and was immediately impressed at how fluid the controls were. Very simplistic. One analog stick and trigger for the younger brother, and another set for the older brother. I feel the game is best played with a controller, but I won't stop you from using KB + M.  Controls: 25/25The play itself is quite linear. There is a set path to be taken to the set destination. I'm not going to detract many points for linear play, because they pull it off very well and it fits in with the story. The mechanics are fairly straightforward, one button for ""Interact."" The puzzles were towards the easier side and involved one the brothers doing independent things to advance on their journey. The gameplay was enjoyable and very smooth. Aside from the linearity, there were some 'side quests' that offered no actual benefit, but were fun and felt worth doing regardless.Gameplay: 22/25The graphics and art style are phenomenal. I was blown away by the detail of the enironment and the cutscenes. The plant life, the skies, the clouds, the mountains, the snow. Every bit was very impressive. I don't care if my dude is dangling from a rope several hunred feet in the air, I just really want to look at the mountains. It's not attempting to be hyper-realistic, it's more cartoony, and I feel that it pulls it off extraordinarily.Graphics: 23/25The atmosphere was really engrossing in this title. The music added so much to the tone and the entire soundtrack is amazinga adds so much to the experience. Another part of the atmosphere is the environmental aspects are the fauna and the various background elementS really add to the entire experience. I don't want to name any so as to dampen your experience stumbling upon them, but they are great.Atmosphere: 25/25So in conclusion, I very much enjoyed this game and I think that most everyone will. I strongly recommend that you buy it.			"

												It has been a very long time since a game managed to make me cry... this one had me sobbing. Prepare yourself for this emotional rollercoaster - this game is both as beautiful and atmospheric as it is heartwrenching. Having just lost their mother to drowning at sea, and now on the verge of losing their gravely ill father, the two titular brothers set off on a surreal journey to obtain the one thing able to cure him. The story unfolds without words (at least, not words that are comprehensible), using body language, music and nuance in a manner that is masterfully handled and pulls you straight in.Gameplay, unfortunately, is where Brothers suffers. Firstly, you NEED to use an Xbox 360 controller. Each brother is controlled individually with each control stick, proving to have a steep learning curve. This essentially gives an illusion of co-op, which while visually interesting and making both of their movements feel organic (rather than an NPC programmed to follow you), it proves to be quite frustrating at first as you frequently lose track of which stick controls which brother. Another downside is that it's also quite short and can be finished in only a few hours.Atmosphere, story and visuals are this game's bread and butter. Despite the frustrating gameplay, if you're fond of games strong on story that tug at your heartstrings and leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled, I can't recommend this highly enough.

												“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is an atmospheric adventure indie game done perfectly. The story is rich and includes a few puzzles too. The main idea of the story shortly - two boys who have already struggled with the loss of their mother, and are now faced with the reality of a sick and dying father, must save him by retrieving ""The Water of Life"". And so their journey begins.The story is excellent, it immerses you into the world immediately. I've experienced a lot of different emotions - happiness, fear, wanderlust, compassion and grief. The game successfully tells a consistent, intelligible, fulfilling and mature story without the characters saying single word which you could understand because if I'm not mistaken it's in Finnish (which confused me at the beginning, to be honest), but it entirely relies on pure interactive game-play. That genuinely leaves a deep emotional impression on the player.The world is elaborate, charming and spirited, and despite its story being only ~4 hours long, it takes you through a lot  of various environments, every chapter feels fresh, captivating and interesting. There also can be found some mini side-quests that reward you with achievements and extra contents. It would be a sin if I don't mention the brilliance of the soundtracks -  truly atmospheric and moving.You control two individual characters at the same time (the brothers) to solve interesting, varied puzzles in order to progress through the level. Even if it's told that the game is supposed to be single-player, I think that it can be an amazing local co-op too. Playing by myself was unique expierience I have never had before because simultaneously controlling two characters can be quite challenging sometimes. There's a notice that game requires a controller to play - I played with keyboard (wasd, space bar, ctrl and arrows) and I hadn't any problems with that.“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is truly fascinating game. It had captured my heart. This is one journey you will never forget.To be honest, the ending has broken my heart. But it was worth it and I'll definetly play this game again.""One must be strong where the other is weak, brave where the other is fearful, they must be... Brothers."" "

My friend introduced this game to me and I totally addicted to it.Besides, the keyboard works well with this game but it might be hard to control the two characters at the same time when you first play the gameTry this game even if you are not a puzzle game or an adventure game lover!

												Ingenious.  Brilliant.  Not many games have had me this immersed or never wanting to stop. This game had it all for me.  Puzzles, adventure.. gorgeous graphics, story and atmospheric music.. all well put together.  The two complaints I have read in general + my retorts on them are: 1) ""We are only able to use a gamepad + we have to use it in a non-conventional way, since we have to move both brothers at the same time using each side of the gamepad."" ***** Personally,  I found this innovative and not hard to get used to.  And actually FUN when used to it. 2) ""The characters speak a made-up language - with no subtitles.""  ***** It bothered me in the first 15 mins too, but I understood further on that it was made this way on purpose.  If not, I would had never picked up on the subtle details such as body-language, facial expression, tone of voice, making it an even more personal experience for me! :DEither way, this game has made me smile and get all choked up so often... which is rare and was very unexpected.  I highly recommend it for those of you who like a decent puzzler with a gorgeous immersive story in an equally beautiful setting.  No regrets at all here.  A staple art-piece in game format.  :) Totally underrated. Thank you to my brother for recommending it.			"

												It's not often I care much about the graphics of a game - being a Nintendo gamer and all, gameplay often comes first (as it should). But this game? This game has changed my opinion.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has such a beautiful art style, like Fable: that realistic yet slightly cartoony look. The game is filled with an array of warm colours, gorgeous lighting and an absolutely HUGE sense of scale. Playing as the two brothers in such a lonely yet amazing set of environments, you feel absolutely dwarfed by the sheer scale of it all. This is saying a lot - but I'm going as far as to say this visually looks more impressive than Okami, which if you've played you'll know is one of the best looking games despite its age.Coupled with a superb, chilling soundtrack and a completely unique single-player co-op gameplay style; this is seriously the perfect game. Two hours in and I swear this is game of the year material, if not one of the best games I've ever played if it continues the way it's started.This had better win a multitude of indie game awards. People NEED to play this.			"

												This is the Steins;Gate of video games. It may not be long, or that much fun actually; however the experiences that you will obtain from letting yourself enter this games world is unparallel to that of any game that I have played in a long time. The only time I can recall having a game feel this fresh and new is when I first started playing games back in grade school fifteen years ago. Moments in this game don’t try to “wow” the player, they don’t try to trigger a dopamine rush; they just make the player have emotion. This game bridges the game between story narrative and player driven activity. Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons shows that video games can in fact become art at its truest from, and must be experienced by all.			"

												Brothers A Tale Of Two Sons is a touching experience.Unlike other games (which i still love) such as ""Heavy Rain"" or ""Life Is Strange"", this one is a proper game in the most classic sense of the therm, but it also adds so much to the rather simple gameplay.The player guides two brothers in a quest to find a cure for their illed father; each character is controlled with a half of the controller, so you are often asked to solve short and easy puzzles by moving both characters at the same time with the analog sticks.The thing that makes ""Brothers"" interesting is the experience.The strongest component of the game is the sense of exploration; you wander through a series of magical and very well designed landscapes, which become really breath-taking towards the end.The game istelf doesn't have an actual narrative, but the music, animation, atmosphere and setting help to create a truly dreamy and oniric experience which captivates the gamer's attention and strikes directly to the heart, also because of some emotionally intense moments.Considering the very low price this game can be found at it's a very well deserved purchase, specially if you want to see what the gaming medium is capable of, from time to time.Pros:- Touching- Dreamy- Amazing Level Design- Spectacular Soundtrack- Charming- Intense- Calming- Cool and easy achievementsCons:- Short			"

												     A fun little Indie game that I picked up for 5 bucks during a sale.  A notice on this one as my opinion of this game is based on playing it with an XBox 360 controller.  There are keyboard options but once you see them even the most veteran keyboard-mouse gamer will find the game nearly impossible to play that way.     The game only takes about 3 hours (or less if you don't explore and just tear through it) to complete.  The graphics are very good, and the music was well done, though the wailly singing portions grate after awhile, even though they are used in the right parts of the game.  It is a simple story of go get the medicine for ailing guy.  The fun of the game is the unique gameplay of controlling the brothers at the same time on opposite sides of the controller as you travel across the land to get the healing water.  The puzzles aren't too hard, either, so you will fly through it but if you don't concentrate you will be playing some parts over and over again.  Voice acting?  I still don't know what the hell was said at any point.  And there are some cheesy kidsy moments, but they are minimal.  Overall a good game.			"

												One of those games that, while very short in length, you'll love every minute you spend playing it.It will take you 2-3 hours depending on if you rush through or take your time,  it's not hard and you're unlikely to get stuck at any point, but none of that matters. If you've played Journey on PS3, it evokes a similar state of mind/emotional response to that, even though it's a different game altogether.Every now and then a title comes along that reminds you of why you love playing videogames - this is one of them.

												This must be one of the most visually pleasing and emotionally touching games I have played in recent years. Top that with some very creative controls (though at times confusing) and clever platforming and puzzles and you have the recipe for this game. The only drawback to be found here is the length of the gameplay, which must be considered quite short. But what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up for in quality. It is developed by none other than Starbreeze Studios, the company who brought us games like The Chronicles of Riddick, The Darkness and most recently Payday 2. So it is safe to say that they have had some moderate success already with proven creativity. It is clear to see the Scandinavian influences in this game in the way of backdrop scenery and folklore, and even the folky chants playing in the background.The key feature in the gameplay is controlling the two Brothers at the same time to solve puzzles. Therefore it is highly recommended to use a XBOX controller while playing this. That was also the intention of the developers, seeing it was first released on XBOX Live. I haven't tried playing it on the keyboard, but I feel that would be a bit awkward. Even on the controller it can be awkward at times, especially when the character you control with the left stick is on the right and vice versa. Something just crashes in the brain when that happens.It seems to me that this might be the start of something good. There is a lot of uncovered ground here both in the gameplay idea and in the world it is set in, and hopefully Starbreeze will build on this and release an even bigger title in the future. Short or not, I do not think you can play through this game without being awed in one way or another. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves games in general and love new experiences within their favored media. Starbreeze certainly deserves your money for making an impact on the gaming scene.I rate this game a solid 9/10!Happy gaming			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. One of my Favorite Tales of All Time.Genre: Short Adventure Puzzler. Developed & Published by: Starbreeze Studios AB & 505 GamesPlatform: Windows and Xbox 360. Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay & Story ThoughtsBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure title with a unique control scheme. Two boys set out to find a cure for their ailing father and take an adventure across a sweeping landscape to obtain it. Through villages, over frozen lakes, underneath mountains, saving people and creatures alike, Brothers is a game that achieves a cinematic edge to it while making sure the player is involved as much as possible. It's a small, heartfelt yet epic tale that never oversteps what it sets out to do. The brothers don't speak English (none of the characters do) so the entire story is told through the gameplay and what's happening onscreen. And while English is never spoken, you can understand the events going on well enough through their actions and how they talk.  Originally posted by KingIsaacLinksr's original thoughts on the story.:I thought I was much too cynical to get shook up emotionally by a game ever again with such a ""simple"" story. I was wrong, very very wrong. I smiled, I laughed, I was surprised, I was shocked and I even teared up at one point. I just didn't expect that to ever happen. It's pretty darn rare to get shaken up emotionally and I think the main reason is how connected you are to the characters through the controls. I still stand by what I said. There are only a handful of games that have affected me as Brothers did and I enjoyed it all the more for it.  ControlsThe game has the story and mechanics mix almost perfectly. You control both brothers with the two joysticks on your controller. Which at first wouldn't seem like a big deal, but it forms the basis of the rest of the game and the puzzles. It's a bit janky to control the brothers and can sometimes be a little more difficult than you would imagine. But you eventually get used to it and the game would be worse off without it. Controlling them requires a controller, there isn't any way around that. What surprised me most was that you interact with many of the events in this story that I expect to be thrown into a cutscene. Which makes the emotional impact of some scenes all the harder.  PC Settings & Console NotesSettings are limited due its console roots but overall the game looks rather good, even if it's not going to blow your socks off. There isn't any Steam Cloud (not that it's really necessary) and all the settings are managed in the launcher. All two of them (resolution & v-sync + keybindings). However, the game didn't have any framerate or crashing issues on my end. PCGamingWiki Article[pcgamingwiki.com] Final ThoughtsThis is a game worth the single playthrough you'll get from it. You'll get around 3 hours from the playthrough and it'll leave one hell of an impression. There are few games that leave such a mark in my mind and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one of them. The unique control scheme and the game's insistence that the player be involved as much as possible is well done. I have few complaints with Brothers. This was my GOTY for 2013 and it was earned.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Simply put “WOW”! What a game this is or I should rather say ""Mind Gymnastic"" while being very pleasing for the eyes. :)Let me elaborate on that just a bit...In this simple but beautiful told story, all in a made up language, and please don’t let that discourage you, it actually makes perfect sense. Anyways, you as a player are in control of two Brothers simultaneously, each helping the other in small simple puzzles along their journey, for finding a cure for their ill Father. While solving these simple puzzles, you put both Brothers to good use with each hand, either on a Keyboard or with a Gamepad. This makes the game experience so fresh and original, that this is a must have, especially if you enjoy a good story and some eye candy to go with it. :)Don’t miss out on this, it’s even on sale, so there is really no excuse. ;)My top recommendation - 5/5.

												Brothers is the kind of game I want to tell kids to play instead of shooting dudes in the head in a shooter. The game relies on a single gimmick, controlling two brothers with separate analog sticks. Using this to explore the beautiful land and solve puzzles using the siblings in unique ways, Starbreeze manages to keep the control gimmick fresh with every passing chapter of Brothers. It is short and sweet, with many awesome moments that will make you sit and stare at your screen just soaking it all in. With dialogue limited to simlish, the storytelling is profound and you will fall in love with what Starbreeze has done here.			"

												I can't believe how good this game is.  It's not about two brothers trying to save the world; they're just trying to protect their family.  In such a short period of play, and without a single uttered word of English (or any other discernable language), you experience sadness, joy, mirth, fear, and so many other emotions.***This game has my highest recommendation.  If there is only 1 story-driven game you play, it should be Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.***On top of being an absolutely phenomenal story, the game mechanics are perfectly suited to a dual-analog controller.  Maybe playable without, but excellent with a 360 or other comparable gamepad.  I see no reason NOT to use a gamepad here.  The graphics are beautiful without being over the top (it only uses DX9, iirc) and the scenery is amazing.In my honest opinion, this is one of the best games of all time.  No BS.			"

I loved the style through it all and the changes in scenery were very cool.Following on from that, the controls are a huge part of the game. They take a bit of getting used to in the beginning and I would really suggest that you use a controller, especially near the very end or you don't relly get the full effect of what's happening.So, to wrap up, this is a beautiful and heartbreaking game that had me in tears.

												In this day and age, I find myself increasingly frustrated and fed up with the video game industry. Maybe it's the 'ship it unfinished and patch it later' mentality, anti-consumer drm, emphasis on pre-orders with exclusive bonuses, big publishers inability to push anything that isn't a AAA military shooter, micro-transactions, you name it. I find it hard to excited about upcoming titles, and even developers that I previously thought could do no wrong (Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware, Dice etc) are all dropping the ball in big ways. All of this makes finding a gem like this title all the more appealing. Brothers is an adventure game in which you control two characters at the same time, using both sides of your controller. This immediately makes the game feel fresh - it's almost like playing a coop game with yourself as a partner. It feels weird initially, but it works, and immediately builds a bond with both characters and the player. The controls are tight and movement is fluid and smoothly animated. Graphically, the game is stunning. While not being incredible on a technical level, it combines solid visual quality with a striking, memorable art style that creates a truly immersive and beautiful world. The landscapes are richly detailed and often have a story behind them that you can pick up if you pay attention. The environments are varied and it has an incredible sense of scale that almost reminds me of the God of War games (not that this is a button mashing gore fest, but it has that enormous scope that can make you feel very very insignificant). The characters are memorable, both the brothers and the individuals you meet along the way are loaded with personality, the animation is fluent and they are all wonderfully unique. Interestingly, not a word of English is spoken, but the expressiveness of the voice acting and the animation mean that you understand everything that is happening perfectly. The music is also memorable, the instrumentation is striking and I love the use of space and silence in the score.Initially, the only negative I could think of was the length of the game. I finished it in around 3 hours, and I took my time. I have since changed my mind - I feel that the story being told would have started to drag if it went on significantly over that, and although I wish I could play it more, the amount of gameplay they pack in is fantastic. The areas are varied and interesting, the puzzles and platforming are challenging enough so that you have to pay attention, but never so hard that you get stuck. I was initially going to write about some of the many unique moments that are part of this game, but they are probably best experienced first hand. Definately some suprise moments.Brothers has reminded me of why I love this medium. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Quite an enjoyable game with a very moving story told in a unique way.Firstly, you *need* a twin stick controller to play this - you *might* be able to kludge your way through with the keyboard, but you really don't want to. If you don't have one, go in to the City and buy an XBox 360 controller right now - I'll wait.... OK, you have one? Good.Now, I love a game with a good story, but let's be honest - in most games the story and gameplay are somewhat disconnected from each other and could just as easily be presented as two separate pieces of art. Heck, there are some games that would have done better to throw away one (or two!) of those pieces altogether!This game is different - the story and the gameplay are both perfectly intertwined. Sure, it still has cutscenes, but the story is largely conveyed while you control the brothers throughout their journey. This game has managed to figure out how to use the unique properties of a video game to tell it's story, rather than relying on techniques from movies or novels like every other game.There is also, no speach - well, at least not English. The characters do use body language and speak some kind of made up language to effectively convey emotion and meaning, without distracting from the story or journey at hand. If you have ever played The Sims or The Singles it's similar to the spoken ""language"" in those games.The story is very moving - I don't really want to spoil anything, especially as the game is not all that long and I couldn't do anywhere near as good a job as the game itself does. The basic premise is that the two brothers have to go on a journey far beyond their village, past troll mines and Giant's cities to find a tree that produces a healing exiler to cure their sick father (or so I gather - no English, remember?). I won't say anything more - you need to play it.The gameplay is also pretty unique - at it's heart it's really a puzzle platformer where you have to use the strengths and weaknesses of each brother  to manipulate levers to move obstacles to allow both to progress on your journey. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult, but they are still satisfying and there is enough variety that the gameplay never outstays it's welcome.What makes the gameplay unique is that you control both brothers *simultaneousely* with both of the sticks on the controller. This can lead to a bit of brain♥♥♥♥ at times - often coping with that that was more difficult than the puzzles themselves, but it doesn't take long to get used to and is never a serious problem (so long as you remember which button is which brother when you need to let go of a ledge).You can usually pick this up from Green Man Gaming (unlocks on Steam) with whatever 20-25% coupon they have on offer at the time.

												Brothers really is fantastic and one of the stand out games of 2013. It’s an adventure set in a fairy tale world that flows evocatively between moments of whimsy and tragedy.   It’s a coming of age tale, it’s about bonds and friendship and loss, it is a modern Ico, conceptually simple yet beautifully crafted. You control two brothers simultaneously, each half of the controller moving one of the siblings. Interaction with the world is simple, there’s only one interaction button for each boy and there are no menus or magic or combat. Controlling each individual character is simple, but coordinating their actions in order to transverse their world is somewhat akin to trying to pat your head while rubbing your stomach.That’s not to say the game is difficult. While there are puzzles to solve, there’s little in the way of real challenge. But the game isn’t about that, it’s not about getting a high score or finding collectable items. It’s a story waiting to be told and every interaction tells part of the story. The game is essentially wordless, with a simlish like language used. Instead the story is told through the animation. As the two brothers interact with the same object their personality comes through, the care free nature of the youngest brother and the older one trying to be strong and responsible while still being a teenager. The game is only a couple of hours longs, but it’s very lean and takes you on quite a journey in in that time. It’s also a remarkably pretty game with a lovely soundtrack. There’s plenty more that can be told about Brothers but it’s really a game that deserves to be experienced.  "

												For people who enjoy a great experience and aren't concerned with a playtime:price ratio should certainly check it out.  If you are looking for challenging gameplay or vast amounts of content this might not be for you.As an experience this game is incredible.  It pulls a ""Shadow of the Colossus"" and tells a wonderful story with little to no dialogue.  The art is beautiful, with benches to sit the brothers on, set in front of some truly great vistas.  The world is fantastical, yet grounded.Looking at it as a game, however, leaves some good and bad. The game does contain an interesting control scheme, in which the player uses the left stick and trigger to control one brother and the right stick and trigger to control the other brother.  Clever utilization of this control mechanic is found throughout the game, with a few moments that really stand out.  The puzzle mechanics throughout the game are never truly challenging, often being pretty straight forward.  The game is also pretty short at 4 hours or less.			"

												When I picked this game up it just looked interesting, but I didn't at all expect to play something this great.Overall the gameplay is simple, at it's core its an extremely easy puzzle game. It's pretty clear from beginning to end what the game expects you to do, and it's never especially hard to get it done. But this isn't a game you play for a challenge, this is a game designed foremost as an experience.I've never had a video game tug at my heart the way that Brothers did in the decades I've been gaming, it might not seem that emotional while you're playing but I promise you that the game's ending will make you feel something special.

												The first game that does tragedy so well, incorporating loss and grief in gameplay itself. It can be compared to Ico and Another World, but it's more linear and restricted than they are. Despite that the gameplay is interesting, unique, and never throws at you the same ideas - the journey of the two brothers is a very diverse and emotional experience.			"

												     A fun little Indie game that I picked up for 5 bucks during a sale.  A notice on this one as my opinion of this game is based on playing it with an XBox 360 controller.  There are keyboard options but once you see them even the most veteran keyboard-mouse gamer will find the game nearly impossible to play that way.     The game only takes about 3 hours (or less if you don't explore and just tear through it) to complete.  The graphics are very good, and the music was well done, though the wailly singing portions grate after awhile, even though they are used in the right parts of the game.  It is a simple story of go get the medicine for ailing guy.  The fun of the game is the unique gameplay of controlling the brothers at the same time on opposite sides of the controller as you travel across the land to get the healing water.  The puzzles aren't too hard, either, so you will fly through it but if you don't concentrate you will be playing some parts over and over again.  Voice acting?  I still don't know what the hell was said at any point.  And there are some cheesy kidsy moments, but they are minimal.  Overall a good game.			"

												La version française se trouve ci-aprèsAs most of the reviews here and there have already said, this is one of the most entertaining and beautiful game in its area. It's a tale where you take a part of it. Take the time to stop by at some of the bench you're going to pass through during the game. That will let you admire the very well done scenery.In the same time, let you invite by the poetry of the music, in every matter, the soundtrack is not just a music, but really a full part of the game. And in the same idea, the language used in the game is as poetic as the rest, so it’s mostly your imagination which will make the scripts ;o).Oh, also, take note that even if Steam (and the developer of the game) tell you that this game require a gamepad, it’s playable with a keyboard. You have to practice and from time to time it's not as perfect as it could be with the gamepad's joysticks but that work.Well, it's worth the full price asked (and in my humble opinion is still cheap even if it's not a long game - about 3 hours) and I think it's a nice pause to take.---------------------Comme la plupart des évaluations présentent ici et là l'ont déjà fait remarquer, c'est un des jeux les plus divertissants et beaux dans son type. C’est un conte dans lequel vous êtes entrainé. Prenez le temps de vous arrêter au niveau des bancs que vous allez rencontrer durant le jeu. Cela vous permettra d’admirer les très beaux points de vue, particulièrement bien fait.Dans le même temps, laissez-vous entrainer par la poésie de la musique, car à tout point de vue, ce n’est pas juste de la musique mais réellement une partie intrinsèque du jeu. Et dans la même idée, le langage utilisé dans le jeu est aussi poétique que le reste, c’est donc votre imagination qui fait le script/les dialogues ;o)Oh, et aussi, prenez note que même si Steam (et le développeur du jeu) indique qu’une manette est nécessaire pour jouer, c’est tout à fait jouable au clavier. Alors cela demande de la pratique et de temps en temps ce n’est pas aussi parfait que cela pourrait l’être avec les joysticks d’une manette, mais cela marche.En tout cas, cela vaut le prix demandé (et selon mon humble avis cela ne reste pas cher payé même si ce n’est pas un jeu très long – environ 3 heures) et je pense que c’est une belle pause à prendre.

												After hearing all the great stories about this game I started playing it myself. It's a relatively short game but both the story and how it's told through the characters is incredible. The environments are breathtaking, the game simply looks stunning using the Unreal engine allowing for incredible vistas. Through the way the story is told using flashbacks two brothers are dependent on each other allowing for an emotional bond between the two that you as a player also slowly build up as the game progresses.Seriously recommended, rated 9 out of 10, but only buy the game if you have a controller.

Thumbs Suggested: 2It's not often I've liked a game so much that I've actually been willing to press even more buttons to tell the world how awesome or potentially life-saving something is. Well, I don't know about the latter, but Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons is indeed awesome. Every scene and every image may induce awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping gazes upon its on-lookers thanks to fantastic art direction by Starbreeze Studios. Who'da thunk the makers of The Darkness and The Chronicles of Riddick games could make something so bright and colorful? But then again, maybe we shouldn't assume too much about Starbreeze's new-found love of color just yet. Even in the span of the game's three-hour playtime, there are several instances of “dem feels” to be had.Brothers may also wreak havoc on your thumbs and cranial wiring thanks to its unique control scheme. Each brother is assigned their own analog stick and trigger allowing them to move and carry out context-based actions independently of one another, leading to some pretty hilarious moments. I can't count how many times I've let go of the wrong trigger while one of the brothers dangles precariously from a ledge or chain, only for him to meet an untimely demise. The worst is when you have the brother controlled by the left-side of the controller on the right and vice-verse. It's a bit like trying to do a math problem upside-down. I dunno know, though; I'm pretty bad at math.All these eccentricities of game design culminate into what is one of the best ending sequences in a video game to date. This is one you just have to experience for yourself, so I'll leave it at that. This is the kind of story-telling that the medium has been striving for the past couple of years thanks to a booming indie scene. If Siskel and Ebert were here today, they would have said, “Thanks to a severe case of carpal tunnel, we can't help but give Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons Two Thumbs Up!”			"

I loved the style through it all and the changes in scenery were very cool.Following on from that, the controls are a huge part of the game. They take a bit of getting used to in the beginning and I would really suggest that you use a controller, especially near the very end or you don't relly get the full effect of what's happening.So, to wrap up, this is a beautiful and heartbreaking game that had me in tears.

												In this day and age, I find myself increasingly frustrated and fed up with the video game industry. Maybe it's the 'ship it unfinished and patch it later' mentality, anti-consumer drm, emphasis on pre-orders with exclusive bonuses, big publishers inability to push anything that isn't a AAA military shooter, micro-transactions, you name it. I find it hard to excited about upcoming titles, and even developers that I previously thought could do no wrong (Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware, Dice etc) are all dropping the ball in big ways. All of this makes finding a gem like this title all the more appealing. Brothers is an adventure game in which you control two characters at the same time, using both sides of your controller. This immediately makes the game feel fresh - it's almost like playing a coop game with yourself as a partner. It feels weird initially, but it works, and immediately builds a bond with both characters and the player. The controls are tight and movement is fluid and smoothly animated. Graphically, the game is stunning. While not being incredible on a technical level, it combines solid visual quality with a striking, memorable art style that creates a truly immersive and beautiful world. The landscapes are richly detailed and often have a story behind them that you can pick up if you pay attention. The environments are varied and it has an incredible sense of scale that almost reminds me of the God of War games (not that this is a button mashing gore fest, but it has that enormous scope that can make you feel very very insignificant). The characters are memorable, both the brothers and the individuals you meet along the way are loaded with personality, the animation is fluent and they are all wonderfully unique. Interestingly, not a word of English is spoken, but the expressiveness of the voice acting and the animation mean that you understand everything that is happening perfectly. The music is also memorable, the instrumentation is striking and I love the use of space and silence in the score.Initially, the only negative I could think of was the length of the game. I finished it in around 3 hours, and I took my time. I have since changed my mind - I feel that the story being told would have started to drag if it went on significantly over that, and although I wish I could play it more, the amount of gameplay they pack in is fantastic. The areas are varied and interesting, the puzzles and platforming are challenging enough so that you have to pay attention, but never so hard that you get stuck. I was initially going to write about some of the many unique moments that are part of this game, but they are probably best experienced first hand. Definately some suprise moments.Brothers has reminded me of why I love this medium. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												After hearing TotalBiscuit praise this game and name it ""the best game he has ever played it,"" I was excited to try it out, if only to have another point by which to compare my tastes to TB's, a figure whose opinions I often admire. Now that I've played it, and given a week for my opinions to potentially cool, I can confidently agree with TB in every way. This is the only game that has ever made me cry like a babby, and it is the best game I've ever played. Tthe controller-requirement is one of its best features. While clumsy, controlling each brother with a separate half of the controller makes this game undeniably groundbreaking, as it is the only example of a game making its physical mechanics part of its thematics and emotional weight. The setting is also incredible. Screenshots will only show you picturesque, ye-olde villages and like scenes, but don't let them mislead you. Without spoiling anything (and please, let NOTHING in this game be spoiled, or you will regret it) many on the set-pieces in the latter half of this game are beautiful, startling, and horrifying. At least within my breadth of knowledge, there is no other game that has taken such a surreal and bold approach to fantasy world-making. When I wasn't in awe of the beauty in this game, I had my hand over my mouth, terrified. Obviously, your own experiences with this title could vary. You might find the story not as enticing or convincing. It's entirely possible that it won't grip you like it did me. But if you let this game in, I promise you'll have an experience unlike anything you've had in video games to date.  "

												This is an intense experience, albeit a short one. The journey leads you through a quite surrealistic fantasy world which fluctuates between being joyful and depressing, though it clearly drifts towards the latter over the course of the game. There's not that much of a plot actually and as there is neither any on-screen text, nor any spoken language other than the unintelligible fantasy language the characters are using every now and then, the main focus clearly is the emotional impact rather than the actual plot. This is working great, though.This cannot unconditionally be said about the controls, however. Controlling two characters at once with an actually very basic setup (using one analogue stick and one trigger per character, plus two buttons for camera control) is an interesting concept and nicely supports the narrative in certain ways, but it's really easy to get confused, especially in sections demanding that both brothers are simultaneously moved more or less precisely. You can certainly get used to it, but it might take a while and the game might actually already be over at that point ;) You can easily plow through the game in three hours or probably even less. There's some replay value because of several optional parts - in fact, all of the game's achievements are completely optional. Then again, not each achievement is unlocked by an additional puzzle of some sorts, but sometimes simply by interacting with the right object long enough. The puzzles in general might be a bit too easy and for the most part they rather test your patience than your logical thinking. Pretty much all of them make great sense in the context of the journey, though - there's no tacked-on riddle solving that feels out of place.All in all this game does indeed deserve the praise it's been getting ever since its release, and it is very easy to ignore the lack of challenge and the basic nature of the plot as it still delivers some satisfying gameplay and an emotionally impactful and visually beautiful experience.For comparable titles, see Journey (PS3), Papo y Yo, and maybe Limbo.

												Great game with beautiful landscapes and environment, highly recommend playing it!There's no english dialog so you connect with the characters through their actions rather than words. The mechanic in this game is to control two different characters - the younger and the older brother - at the same time. With this mechanic the two brothers have to work together and in some way complete each other, so you can walk through their journey.At some point you may think that you could play this game with a friend rather than single player mode, however, the end of this beautiful game is the reason why it could never be other way...

												Let me put it this way... no wait, ♥♥♥♥ that, you have to get this. First of all, it's absolutely immersive. The visuals and the soundtrack (and sound effects) are making the game INCREDIBLY immersive. Second of all, the story is beautiful. It could be made a movie. It's an epic fantasy adventure with a few plot twists and surprises, and LOTS of interesting creatures around. Third, the game's puzzles are p e r f e c t. They are neither too hard nor painfully obvious. You just need to look around for a few seconds every once in a while and the gameplay is still fluid af. And I wouldn't call it a puzzle game either, most of the ""puzzles"" only revolve around the game's unique mechanics anyway. The last thing I would like to mention is that you will most definitely feel amazing when you finish the game. Even if up to that point you weren't sure whether you like it or not, I can guarantee you that you will love the final part of the game (which is also visually, again, incredible).In short.Pros:- Amazing visuals, best at the final part of the game- Immersive sound effects - Emotional and quality soundtrack (I can't stress how good it is)- Not a single word you can understand, but a very rich and emotional story (IMPORTANT!)- Reasonable length (4-5 hours of gameplay)- Easy achievements (but best collected AFTER you finish the game so they don't distract you)- Fantasy elements (contains all kinds of creatures)- Unique gameplay mechanics- Very fluid puzzles that are neither too complex nor painfully obvious and are barely noticable.Cons:- Quite expensive (although you can get it for $4 on sales)- Short? (depending on what you want, I like them shorter) (I've said earlier, 4-5 hours)Don't be prejudiced because, trust me, you WILL love it.			"

												Ingenious.  Brilliant.  Not many games have had me this immersed or never wanting to stop. This game had it all for me.  Puzzles, adventure.. gorgeous graphics, story and atmospheric music.. all well put together.  The two complaints I have read in general + my retorts on them are: 1) ""We are only able to use a gamepad + we have to use it in a non-conventional way, since we have to move both brothers at the same time using each side of the gamepad."" ***** Personally,  I found this innovative and not hard to get used to.  And actually FUN when used to it. 2) ""The characters speak a made-up language - with no subtitles.""  ***** It bothered me in the first 15 mins too, but I understood further on that it was made this way on purpose.  If not, I would had never picked up on the subtle details such as body-language, facial expression, tone of voice, making it an even more personal experience for me! :DEither way, this game has made me smile and get all choked up so often... which is rare and was very unexpected.  I highly recommend it for those of you who like a decent puzzler with a gorgeous immersive story in an equally beautiful setting.  No regrets at all here.  A staple art-piece in game format.  :) Totally underrated. Thank you to my brother for recommending it.			"

												This is the Steins;Gate of video games. It may not be long, or that much fun actually; however the experiences that you will obtain from letting yourself enter this games world is unparallel to that of any game that I have played in a long time. The only time I can recall having a game feel this fresh and new is when I first started playing games back in grade school fifteen years ago. Moments in this game don’t try to “wow” the player, they don’t try to trigger a dopamine rush; they just make the player have emotion. This game bridges the game between story narrative and player driven activity. Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons shows that video games can in fact become art at its truest from, and must be experienced by all.			"

												It's not often I care much about the graphics of a game - being a Nintendo gamer and all, gameplay often comes first (as it should). But this game? This game has changed my opinion.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has such a beautiful art style, like Fable: that realistic yet slightly cartoony look. The game is filled with an array of warm colours, gorgeous lighting and an absolutely HUGE sense of scale. Playing as the two brothers in such a lonely yet amazing set of environments, you feel absolutely dwarfed by the sheer scale of it all. This is saying a lot - but I'm going as far as to say this visually looks more impressive than Okami, which if you've played you'll know is one of the best looking games despite its age.Coupled with a superb, chilling soundtrack and a completely unique single-player co-op gameplay style; this is seriously the perfect game. Two hours in and I swear this is game of the year material, if not one of the best games I've ever played if it continues the way it's started.This had better win a multitude of indie game awards. People NEED to play this.			"

												Brothers A Tale Of Two Sons is a touching experience.Unlike other games (which i still love) such as ""Heavy Rain"" or ""Life Is Strange"", this one is a proper game in the most classic sense of the therm, but it also adds so much to the rather simple gameplay.The player guides two brothers in a quest to find a cure for their illed father; each character is controlled with a half of the controller, so you are often asked to solve short and easy puzzles by moving both characters at the same time with the analog sticks.The thing that makes ""Brothers"" interesting is the experience.The strongest component of the game is the sense of exploration; you wander through a series of magical and very well designed landscapes, which become really breath-taking towards the end.The game istelf doesn't have an actual narrative, but the music, animation, atmosphere and setting help to create a truly dreamy and oniric experience which captivates the gamer's attention and strikes directly to the heart, also because of some emotionally intense moments.Considering the very low price this game can be found at it's a very well deserved purchase, specially if you want to see what the gaming medium is capable of, from time to time.Pros:- Touching- Dreamy- Amazing Level Design- Spectacular Soundtrack- Charming- Intense- Calming- Cool and easy achievementsCons:- Short			"

												Wow I didn't expect this game would be so much fun.First time I started the game, I thought this game is broken.Conversation language is strange. It is not English and I don't understand the detail of the story at all.Unable to detect my generic USB controller. I had to play with keyboard.No display setting, it only has gamma setting, and the launcher only has language and keyboard setting.But After I ignored those problems and started to play, I found the game is soooo fun.Controlling 2 different characters with 2 different keys (Big brother with W A S D Space, Little brother with Arrow keys and R-CTRL) is somehow challenging and fun, and all the obstacles are brilliantly made. I think it will be more fun to play it solo rather than co-op with your friend.There are many objects that can be interacted, and the brothers have different response to the objects. It is fun to watch their responses.The world design is reaally great and detailed.Fun achievement. Easy to get but all are missable if you don't try things up. There are helpful guides about this.Short gameplay. I have seen people play it less than 3 hours. I prefer shorter gameplay for non RPG games :)Simple and nice UI. Needs more in-game setting though.The downside :The camera is rotating too much, it is already hard to control movement of both characters, and the camera makes it harder.Note : They say that this game needs controller because some keyboard can't detect multiple keypress at the same time. Google ""keyboard ghosting"" for more information. I don't have this problem so I played it fine with my keyboard.			"

												An above average game.You play as two brothers trying to save their father and control them simultaneously while trying to work your way around the landscape, which invariably leads to puzzle-solving, platforming, and some parkour.I liked how the game took so many twists throughout the story, as it starts off lighthearted but eventually it takes a turn out of nowhere to some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥and gets surprisingly dark, which really helps eliminate the tedium and repetitiveness that these puzzle platforming games are often plagued with.However my two main issues with this game are:One, these brothers are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and when I say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I mean REALLY big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Throughout the entirety of the game they harass villagers, break♥♥♥♥♥♥ steal livestock, steal vehicles, PURPOSELY MURDER creatures, DESECRATE the dead, and BATHE IN BLOOD just so they can save their father; how is ANYONE supposed to end up liking these main characters?Two, I can't see why this game is held by a lot of people to be more artistic than any other regular game out there. Sure the game looks nice, but just because a game looks pretty and plays differently than other games DOESN'T make it any better artistically, and I think the games price (about fifiteen dollars) is a tad steep for the game you get. And honestly, the game's premise is very generic. The story is basically ""father falls ill, sons go on a quest to find medicine to cure it"" and that formula goes pretty much how you would expect it to. Even though the game does take a lot of twists and turns, the ending ends up being very predictable, and the game fails to try and make you care for the brothers other than with its cheap gimmick of controlling both brothers at once.Overall I'd recommend buying this game if you like platformers or like these sort of ""fancy"" storytelling games, no offense towards those types of games and the people who like them (I am one of them), but acknowledge them for what they are and don't think just because these games have a different style than most other games they're somehow ""great art"".EDIT: Playing this game with the keyboard is fine, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

												Putting an emotional part and a story aside, this is essentially a old-schoold adventure game where you are playing two characters both at the same time on their quest of finding a medicine for their ill mother. The game uses gamepad in a clever way to let you do a hell lot of complicated moves using a tight-packed control scheme and the whole gameplay is based around it. There is a good dose of exploration, a good dose of scenary porn and a lot of small puzzle solving, where some of the puzzles are based on the physics engine and some require a bit of clever thinking. The game is relatively simple and not really stressfull, and I would say it is a bit cute in a way Undertale was cute or old school adventure games like LBA were.What I like about the Borther is how pixel-perfect it is. It's like a good movie - the perfect length, the perfect directing, a perfect pacing. There is nothing that you wish to add and nothing that you wish to remove.It's a great adventure of surpisingly long length, which never makes you tired,  ends at the perfect time and leaves a bittersweet and satisfactory aftertaste that keeps you remembering it from time to time and smiling.

The game is unique in that the language spoken is frictional and the players are free to speculate what the characters in the game talk about.  The game's control is divided between the two brothers (LS + LT for Naia, RS + RT for Naiee).  Playing the game encourages you to coordinate between your left and right hands.The scenic and music are both beautiful.  For people with beefy hardware, I encourage you render the game in 4k and see the beauty yourself.The journey ahead of the two brothers is by no mean smooth or without loss.  Often it's when people lose things that they start to realize how precious these things are.  [10/10]			"

												Beautiful game, with magical atmosphere and fantastic world. Game is focusing on collaboration of two brothers, if they don't help each other they won't get anywhere. Each of them has some unique features, the younger brother is small so he can get to places where the older one can't. On the other hand, the older one is stronger and can lift items which his younger brother can't.There are quite a few puzzles in this game and they are nice, but not challenging at all. But they are still quite fun.I played it with keyboard and mouse and although it's not exactly perfect it works quite well.The only problem this game has IMHO are the clunky animations in some places, it's just look so weird (for example goats in third chapter). And maybe unnecessary long raising platforms, which I don't understand.The story is nice, two brothers working together and trying to find a cure for their father. There are some sad moments, and something what you could call a twist maybe? I just don't think that full price of 14 euros is right for 3-4 hour game.But you should definitely pick it up on sale.

												What a wonderful game!A story telling the journey two brothers undertake to find a cure for their seriously ill father. You control both brothers simultaneously, having to help each other to overcome the many obsticles they encounter.The puzzles can tax your co-ordination, as you try and maneuver the brothers into position and interacting with the correct one - but don't let this deter you; this game is telling you their story and the puzzles are just there to give you the sense of the struggles they come across.The sounds in the game are simplistic, but they work perfectly to set the atmosphere - the game doesn't even need dialogue, the actions of the characters and the random noises they make say all that needs saying to let you understand what is going on and what you need to do.The graphics in the game are beautiful. The art-style I would say is in the same vein as Fable, which again suits it just right, and will leave you wide-eyed at the various environments the brothers must progress through on their journey.The game may be short, but it is an experience you need in gaming. I highly recommend this!			"

												Buying this game I didn't expect much.  But I'm #1 a co-op junky, and I really enjoy cool off the wall games that I don't have to shoot crap non-stop after I just played some hardcore shooters with a few friends.  This game is rated pretty high.  One of the highest of late.  I watched videos of serious gamers trying to explain why they liked it so much.  I do understand why.This game is pretty interesting.  To be played right it does require a controller (the keyboard/mouse works but not smooth like the controller.) Most hardcore gamers on a PC use keyboard/mouse with a few controller games.  (I for example only use a 360 controller for car driving games)  This game is single player and co-op in one.  But the twist is it requires a controller to control both single player co-op guys at once.  (If that makes any sense?) LOL!  The graphics are great.  It's basically a single player game of 2 players you have to control that you need them both to work together.  They talk but talk nothing that makes any sense but you can understand what they are saying.  It's crazy.  The story is pretty serious.  It's extremely touching the entire time.  Bring a controller, good resolution to see the graphics, a heart of gold to experience the story, and have a great gaming experience.  It's just one you have to see first hand to understand.  You won't be disappointed.  Thumbs up from me.			"

One of the best deals I picked up during this past steam sale.  You control 2 characters (little brother and big brother) You do need a controller to play this.  Puzzles are fairly easy to figure out but again the story is so good you are almost playing an interactive movie.  Great visual storytelling and worth the play through.  It's not a difficult game and there isnt too much re playability, unless you feel like going through it for the story again :D  There is alot of emotional ups and downs during the game, one minute you feel happy about the situation and at another you are totally bummed out at certain points in thier journey!  With all that said it is definitely worth the price to buy it here on steam (especially if it's on sale).  Great Great game!			"

												It's hard to write a good review of a game like Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons without adding spoilers. But don't be afraid to read any further, no spoilers here.Brothers is a pinnacle of game design. It's a perfect combination of narrative, gameplay mechanics that just ""work"", and beautiful design both in level design as in general art style. There were numerous moments where I was just blown away by the beauty of this game. It's something you don't expect in the beginning when you see the Unreal Engine logo.They make up for the low polygon count of the characters by beautiful textures, great lighting effects and the best camera positioning you have ever seen.TL;DR:Short but oh oh oh so sweet. Just have a controller handy (unplayable with keyboard and mouse). Definitely worth it.Tip @ any university/college providing a game design course: This game is the perfect use-case of how it should be.			"

For people with beefy hardware, I encourage you render the game in 4k and see the beauty yourself.The journey ahead of the two brothers is by no mean smooth or without loss.  Often it's when people lose things that they start to realize how precious these things are.  [10/10]			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a fine example of a game doing both story telling and gameplay right. Enough focus was put into both aspects making it one of the best games I've ever experienced. The controls are something different and intuitive. I highy recommed this game to anyone who's in the mood for something unique and different.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a beautiful top-down puzzle adventure developed by Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios, who are better known for rather action-heavy games such as Riddick, The Darkness, Syndicate or Payback, so it's definitely a surprise that their first non-shooter game ended up being such a lovingly crafted piece of work.The game tells the moving story of two brothers who set out on a journey across the lands to find a cure for their ailing father. While this is a pretty average story, it is presented with so much strength and emotion that it is really hard not to get touched by it. Even more so due the fact that there is no 'real' voice acting in the game apart from bits and pieces in a made-up language, so every bit of feeling and emotion the game tries to convey is is entirely transported through the fantastic soundtrack, the level design and the character acting.Although the game is based on the PC-friendly Unreal Engine, it doesn't really provide many graphics options aside from brightness, resolution and VSync, but that shouldn't hold you off because the game looks absolutely stunning regardless.The level design is fairly linear, so there is usually just one path to get from A to B, but the varying enviroments are packed with so much detail and love that it is a real pleasure to the eye to just wander around and explore all the tiny details Starbreeze has left in the game, such as a squirrel climbing a tree or bunnies hopping around. You can also sit down on any of the various benches in the levels to get a scenic view of some special spots. Absolutely fantastic.An innovation that I haven't seen in any other game yet are the gameplay mechanics as you control both brothers at once, each brother with one thumb stick on your control, so it's basically like playing a two-player co-op game - but alone. This feels extremely weird at first and will definitely put your coordination and multitasking skills to the test, but the further you get into the game the more you get used to it.The puzzles in the game make use of this mechanic in various ways and while the puzzle solutions as such generally are fairly obvious, solving them by controlling both brothers at once provides the actual challenge.PSA: Despite the fact that the store page mentions 'Notice: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons requires a controller to play', the game can be played with a keyboard just fine and the launcher also lets you rebind the keys (by default you control one brother with WASD and the other one with the arrow keys). I definitely recommend playing the game with a controller, though, as this simply feels better with a game like this.With roughly 3.5 to 4 hours the game isn't exceptionally long by most people's standard, but it has so much depth and emotion that I consider it worth it every single cent if it manages to leave me with both sadness and satisfaction upon finishing it. If I had known what a strong game this is, I wouldn't have hesitated to pre-order it.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a shiny gem among the games released this year and needs all the attention it can get. Especially these days where games rarely tell such an emotional story - or any story at all.			"

												As stated on the store page, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons was desinged with a controller in mind and  makes good use of the peripheral for all gameplay tasks, from walking to solving the easy puzzles. The focus point of the game is the great story. Formidable level design complements the journey and graphics are well in tone with it. Overall this was an outstanding gaming experience, although a little short. Maybe not worth the full price, but a must grab during sales.			"

A tragedy filled with beauty and a delight for the little things.Brothers: A Tale of Two sons checks off a lot of boxes on my list of things that make a great game: innovative gameplay, great storytelling, gorgeous visuals and a good soundtrack.Controlling both brothers at once is this game's biggest novelty and one that I never tired of in my 3.4 hours with it. One aspect of controlling both that I didn't anticipate is that it aids in making you as the player feel more connected to both of them. Each brother also has a unique personality that shows up in what gameplay actions each one can and can't take. For example, the older brother can boost the younger one up to the top of a tall ledge and then the younger one can drop down a rope. Even in optional environmental interactions (like blowing into a huge horn) each boy has a different response.The inclusion of these little details reminds me of the sense of childlike wonder that Studio Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki) movies do so well to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. It's incredible to me how clear of a story and how rich of a world the developers were able to get across entirely nonverbally. There are voices in the game but it is all in a very simplistic, fictional language. Their meaning is conveyed sufficiently through voice tone and body language. The world itself tells its own story and made me feel like I knew plenty of the lore surrounding it, again, all without words.It certainly helps that a game so focused on visual storytelling also has great art design. There are numerous benches throughout the game that you can direct the boys to sit on. When you do the camera pans out to show off some impressive vistas. In most games I couldn't be bothered to go sit on a bench yet here I made it a point to seek out each one. The soundtrack packs an emotional punch during major scenes but can be very quiet or absent during others.With so much positive to say about the game I do have a few negatives. There are a few points where the gameplay gets repetitive. For example you'll climb up numerous cliffs, nets, root balls, etc. and none are particularly challenging or exciting. In general though, they do a pretty good job of changing things up as the game progresses. I also encountered a bug in the PC version of the game where two elevator cranks you'll encounter in the game operate VERY slowly. We're talking roughly 2 minutes for the first one and 3 minutes for the second before you can continue on with the game. You cannot bypass these. Finally, I wasn't much of a fan of the overall tragic tone of the game. I don't mind dark themes but I like them to have a purpose for being a downer besides trying to be different or to tack extra emotional impact to a scene. This is perhaps an area where the nonverbal storytelling is a weakness because I couldn't discern enough purpose to warrant Brothers' somber tone.			"

												Brothers is the first ""single player co-op"" game.  There are two characters but you have to control both of them yourself, simultaneously.  Because of this, the game makes for a serious exercise in multitasking and coordination.  It also makes a gamepad almost a necessity, though I believe the game does have keyboard controls as well.The game plays like an adventure game, following a linear path and solving simple puzzles by having the two brothers work together.  The older, taller, stronger brother is needed for some tasks while the younger, smaller brother is needed for others.  It's a very different experience controlling both characters yourself vs a traditional coop game and I believe it was designed this way to give more impact to the story.The story is told silently with no words spoken or written, though characters will speak in a sort of gibberish when interacting.    Any information they provide to the player is given through gestures, indicating where you should proceed to next.  This is generally unnecessary though since the game is very linear.  The story is very moving and is a very strong point for the game.Brothers has some fantastic scenery and provides benches you can use to view scenic points, though the texture quality is very low and this low quality is quite visible in some areas.  As has been shown in other games though, art design is much more important and helps make up for this lack of texture quality.My overall assessment is that Brothers is a great game, though I find it a bit over-hyped.  People talk about it like it's a new revolution in gaming but it is simply a great game, though short.			"

												This is a beautiful, yet most infuriating game.I read reviews where people complained about the controls, but to be honest I had zero troubles with them as they're super simple (basically just one button and one stick for each, and hardly anything else). Both with a keyboard and with a controller I was able to use both brothers without issue (even if the keyboard wasn't particularly comfortable)... that is, until the game bugged out.This game is beautiful in that it has pretty graphics and (for the first half) a very lovely story. The puzzles are very, very simple, the only time I ever got stuck was because, again, the game bugged out. If you've played Ico (PS2) you might like this one. It reminds you a bit of it, but it's a lot simpler and has a much crappier ending. Besides the ending not being to my taste, the game is, as I said, filled with bugs that made it impossible for me to play properly. When it wasn't crashing with a ""P13"" error and needing to be re-verified for the third time in the same day, it was a checkpoint bugging out that not even a chapter restart could solve (just to count a few I had: puzzle not working, character disappearing through ground and falling to death, character disappearing, cutscene not playing and thus having to restart chapter to move on, character not jumping though the keys/buttons were pressed and falling to death, character jumping across gap... and then jumping right back and refusing to move forward except to jump forward and jump back again.... all that in less than 3hrs gameplay.)What could improve this game: Besides a completely different ending, this game would be highly improved if they fixed the bugs, and would be even more interesting if it had an option to play real co-op with someone else (that is not on the keyboard next to you) if you wanted to. I love controlling both brothers at once, but I think it'd be slightly more challenging if you had to cooperate with another person rather than yourself. :P There's not enough co-op games where you actually have to plan and co-op with someone, which is why this would be nice.To sum it up: I recommend it for the first part of the story, and because I love these kind of games. I recommend it only if it's on a bundle or super cheap, otherwise don't bother because the bugs are too annoying. And I'd recommend it even more if it weren't because of the bugs (maybe you luck out and have none, or maybe you get the curse I did and have them all.)If you want a really really nice story tho, go play Ico.

Very nice sounds. This game was a tearjerker for me. You may get around 4 hours in it if you are trying to experience everything and for the price of $15 that may seem not worth your money, but i highly disagree. The 4 hours I played in this game was so worth it. If you want to play this game I highly suggest using a wired controller (has a usb end on it). I think this game has ingame support for controllers but I don't know for certain (google it if you don't know). If is doesn't have ingame controller support download JoyToKey. My highest recommendations for this game.Infinity/10			"

												Starbreeze Studios aren’t well known for their emotional depth. Responsible for the excellent Riddick games (Escape from Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena), the first Darkness (which administered a gut-punch to our soppy bits with Jenny’s death) and the misfiring Syndicate reboot, the Swedish developers have an inconsistent record with both quality and quantity – which puts them in a perfect position to do what many studios can’t: take risks.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one such risk. A fairytale adventure set in a whimsical land that seems to be assembled from various bits and pieces of Scandinavian folklore, Brothers tells the tale of the titular siblings as they embark on a journey to save their sick father’s life. The target of their quest is the sap of an enormous, enchanted tree located halfway across the world, which they must find and bring back.Along the way they encounter trolls, both friendly and otherwise, a land of warring giants, a menagerie’s worth of weird creatures and a strange young girl who they rescue from an apparent sacrifice. At the heart of the story, and the gameplay, is their relationship. The boys are tied together not only by the bonds of blood and brotherhood, but also by a mutual desire to save their father no matter how far they have to go or what dangers they have to face.It’s an element that pervades every facet of the game. The brothers are inseparable, and only through teamwork and trust are they able to overcome the challenges of the world. You control both siblings with one pad: the left stick and trigger control Big Brother, and the right control Little Brother. It sounds simple but is surprisingly disorienting. We’re so used to spinning the camera with the right stick and cycling between multiple characters that controlling both brothers with only four buttons requires some retraining of our automatic responses, but the pay-off is great. Puzzles that require the siblings to work in unison are straightforward, but others, where each brother is required to complete a separate task, can throw you, and several times I found myself working Big Brother like a Trojan while Little Brother stood picking his nose.Most of the puzzles are very simple, and in fact the game itself is remarkably easy from start to finish. Of a four-hour runtime, the first two are spent travelling and taking in the scenery, and it’s a fair way in before you’re presented with any real peril and even then, it’s easily overcome. Aside a very creepy moment towards the end, Brothers is quite twee about its dangers. Deaths are never shown, for example, despite the fact that some of Limbo’s shock appeal would have translated well.As you take the boys on their adventure you’ll reunite a Troll husband and wife, navigate the walls of a colossal fortress, fend off wolves, traverse a blood-drenched battleground covered with fallen giants and flee from an invisible ogre. Moments of true tension are exacerbated by the often clumsy controls but lessened by the lack of brutality, leading to an experience that rarely thrills but is always interesting.The world itself is beautiful, and Little Brother’s ability to see wonder in everything lends it a magical, magisterial gravitas. Benches are dotted around at specific vantage points, and perching on them offers a view of the land. The sense of scale at these times is magnificent, and the backdrops – particularly towards the end – are occasionally breathtaking. Sprinting along a cliff-side as the Aurora Borealis dances in the sky, or watching a pod of alien, tentacled killer whales leap and dive through the cobalt blue waters of a frozen river are two stand-out moments, but Brothers offers many.The short lifespan is tempered by an ever-changing gameworld. Yes, Brothers is over quickly, but you’ll see so much in that short time that when it’s over you’ll want to go straight back through it in case you missed anything. Stealing a hang-glider and running it off a cliff, or tethering a rope between themselves so they can swing each other around a sky-scraping castle are moments that highlight not only the Brothers’ sense of mutual trust but also their individual bravery.Little Brother’s phobia of water means Big Brother must carry him across deep rivers, while the older sibling’s penchant for following his impulsive heart leads to trouble more than once. Considering the game contains not a single word of dialogue – spoken or written – it’s incredibly affecting and very easy to follow. Everyone communicates in a kind of broken, hurried Simlish that sounds vaguely European but will require some imagination and attention to understand.The aesthetics are solid and evocative of the Fable series, using muted pastel colours to give the world a fantastical, dream-like quality, whether you’re looking at an abandoned, snow-shrouded village, a midnight forest or a giant’s bedroom. As I said, Brothers packs a hell of a lot of spectacle into just four or five hours.VERDICT: From a hopeful beginning to a heart-wrenching conclusion, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an endearing and emotional adventure that will resonate strongly with anyone who has a younger or older sibling. It may not be the most exciting or challenging game, and it is certainly over too quickly, but it’s also a refreshing, beautifully-realised attempt to do something new.My Rating: 8/10 "

												Brothers is a fantastic visual experience and tells a simple but touching story in about 3 or so hours. It's got a fantastictly designed and living world that makes for wonderful exploration.However, the gameplay isn't nearly as good... The ""single player co-op"" is certainly an innovative design choice, but as it turns out it's a nightmare from controlls perspective. It's confusing and bothersome to controll both characters at the same time... I guess they made the puzzles super easy to make up for that, but really, I think a challenge would have been welcome now and again at least.And for such a linear experience, there's quite a few bugs all arround. Nothing game breaking, but stuff that might force you to restart the chapter...So bottom line, as a visual and narrative experience, Brothers is FANTASTIC! But as a puzzle/adventure game... There are many, many other games that do that better and will last you longer than 3 hours.			"

												I have over 5000 hours clocked on my Steam account across a variety of genres.The 3 or so hours I spent playing Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons were some of if not the most captivating and incredible hours I've spent consuming any form of media.However I look at this game, it blows me away.The graphics and aesthetics are outstanding. Every area in the game is lovingly crafted for gorgeous views. The animations on the characters are top notch, which is very important because there is no real dialogue in the game - they speak a form of gibberish but through the context, tone of voice, and body language you can generally understand what they're saying.I'm a heavy book reader, but the story and environment in this game rivals some of my favorite works. The feelings that this game invokes put to rest the debate on whether or not games can truly be an art form.The gameplay is very novel and innovative and quite fun also. It's not lacking at all in that department - as a puzzle/adventure game, it goes where no other games have gone before and for that alone is worthy of being played.This may not be my favorite game of all time - I may not be able to sink loads of time into it. I've got thousands of hours in Counter Strike, nearly 700 in Dark Souls, etc. But dammit this is definitely up there, and one of the most important games you can play this generation.			"

												Simply brilliant adventure-story telling game.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons offers a unique experience of its own and delivers it thru incredible graphic details. When you journey, you'll see the intrinsically beautiful game world and level designs. The OSTs just add more to the awesomeness, so atmospheric and fitting.Gameplay is quite simple as you only need to move around and solve simple puzzles. There's a bit annoying boss battles but it's nothing anyway if you play many more of challenging games nowadays like Bastion. Though, really, the major strength of the game lies not in its gameplay but in its storyline - despite the voice actors speak in made-up language (no English caption sorry!), it can convey the story with the body language and display. Following the story is also another great experience. You'll see the value of your sibling, or brotherhood, through how the two brothers here work together and lend a hand to to each others. Sometimes we forget about that siblings are wonderful gift, eh?Checkpoints are scattered throughout the game so suppose you die from accidental glitches - yes, happened to me - or die in boss battles you don't have to retrack your steps too far. The game offers chapter to chapter selection so you can easily replay the chapter you want to rewatch.While the controller is recommended (xinput based works flawlessly while dinput requires x360ce to play), you can also use keyboard to play the game. Heck, you can coop using gamepad for first player and keyboard for the second player, though it's a bit awkward to play coop in a game like this. That said, controlling two brothers using gamepad, which is recommended, can be a bit awkward at first as usually we use the right stick to aim or shoot not to move.If you want to have a perfect achievements, it's not hard. Basically everything can be done in one playthrough - and that also makes the game quite limited in replayability. zero reason to replay the game unless you just want to remember the story.I myself got this from Amazon with Editor's Choice Coupon 2014 enabled, around 2.5 USD in total. At this price, it's a bargain. Paying full price is, for me, rather not recommended as the game's too short. You can finish the game in one sitting, 4 hours total gameplay. 5 hours if you backtrack to get the achievements you missed.But overall, an excellent game to be added to your library AND to be played. Believe me, it's a good game right from the concept, storyline and implementation. Looking forward to the next game of Starbreeze Studios AB.			"

												Played on PS3Personal rating - MUST play. Do it now.Traditional rating - 98/100I'm going to get this out of the way up front: In my opinion, this is hands-down the best game from 2013, and one of the best games I have ever played. Stop reading this and go play it right now. I will try my absolute hardest not to give anything away, but as with other story-based games, 99.99% of the enjoyment is in the journey, and having absolutely no idea what to expect next. I BEG you to just take my word on faith and go play it before you read or watch anything else about it. I mean it. Right now. Set aside 3 hours, close your door, put on some headphones or turn the volume up, and enjoy the ride.If you're still reading, then here is what I thought: Never before have I seen a game so flawlessly accomplish every single thing it sets out to do. The control scheme works perfectly, the graphics are breathtaking, the story brought tears to my eyes, and the puzzles were just the right amount of tricky. The pacing of the game is definitely on the slow side, but just remember, the game is called ""A Tale of Two Sons."" It's telling you a story, and boy what a story it is.It starts off with the younger brother (named Naiee) kneeling at his mother's grave, and then immediately cuts to a flashback where the mother is drowning in a lake, but Naiee is not strong enough to pull her into the boat. We see her slip beneath the surface, and fade into the darkness. Back in the present, the mother's spirit appears to Naiee and comforts him with a kiss, vanishing into thin air just as he reaches out to her. The peace of the moment is broken by Naiee's brother Nyaa calling for help. Turns out their father has come down with a serious illness, and it is up to the brothers to bring him to the doctor, and ultimately trek across a gorgeous, fantastical world straight out of a Grimm fairy tale.This of course is where you, the player, step in. It is up to you to control both brothers at the same time, controlling their movements with one analog stick each, and making them interact with things by pressing and holding the trigger buttons. That's it, no jump, no inventory, no flashlight, no skills, no nothing. If you groaned when you read that, I completely understand. When I first heard about the control scheme and basic premise, I was immensely skeptical as well, but it is astounding how well everything works. This is essentially a single-player co-op game, and it just might be the most intuitive control schemes I have ever seen in a game.The true cleverness of the controls goes much deeper than just giving you the ability to solve 2-person puzzles by yourself though. The real beauty of the control scheme is that as the two brothers are adventuring and exploring, you are quite literally the glue holding them together. You are pulled into this story world and tasked with being the relationship between the brothers. I didn't really put words to it until the game was over, but it is an unbelievably powerful gameplay mechanic, and it plays a monumental part in how involved you are with the story. Plus, it is used later on in the game in arguably one of the most meaningful and touching ways I have ever seen in any storytelling medium, let alone video games.I am not at all ashamed to admit that this game made me cry, more than once, and for extended periods. No game has ever done that to me before. This is a monumentally important thing, and what it says to me is that video games can be art every single bit as much as any movie, book, painting, sculpture, or live performance. This is not just one of the most emotionally powerful video games I've ever experienced, it is one of the most emotionally powerful THINGS I have ever experienced.It is worth mentioning that there is no understandable spoken dialog in the game at all. The characters speak a completely made-up language, and while the structure of the language itself is familiar, you will never know exactly what's being said. You can always understand based on context and body language, though. This is far from the first game to ever employ such a tactic, but it is pulled off so well throughout the entire game that there was never a spoken moment where I didn't fully understand what was going on.It may seem like I'm gushing, but I'm really not. There are certainly a few things wrong with the game. For instance, other than a few little distractions and side-achievements, it is completely linear, so there is no replayability, and $15 for 3 hours of gameplay might seem expensive to some (it is worth every single penny). Also, sometimes it hurt my brain trying to control both brothers, but the game does a very good job of always lining them up to match the analog sticks. Nyaa is the left stick and is kept on the left side, and Naiee is the right stick and is kept on the right side. I found it instinctually easier to keep them that way the entire game anyway, so I hardly noticed the game's insistence on placing them that way during cutscene moments.The only REAL complaint I have about the game is that some of the puzzles have tricky timing. There are some puzzles where you're holding R2 to grip onto a ledge and you have to point the analog stick in a direction, release R2 to launch, and then press R2 again to grip the new surface. It is very easy to mess up those R2 presses. I found it much easier to immediately re-press R2 after releasing, and the brother in question would simply grab the new surface as he came up to it.The puzzles in general are very pleasant, feel very organic, and are all very satisfying. The solutions were not immediately apparent for many of them, but it never took very long before things started to click. New elements and ways of solving puzzles are slowly introduced along the way as well, so they do get fairly complex near the end of the game. Thankfully, even if you are stuck on a puzzle, the environments never open up TOO much, so you don't have to scour through a mansion looking for a switch or lever. The solution is always close, and always clever. In fact, there is one section in particular where the brothers are attached by a rope that had me smiling and laughing out loud.That right there hits home on why this game is so important. Sad stories are easy. Funny stories are easy. What is NOT easy however, and what the greatest stories of all time have been able to hone in on, is the whole range of emotions. The rollercoaster, if you will. Throughout the course of this game I felt everything. I was sad, then hopeful, then annoyed, then happy, then cautious, then in awe, then nervous, then freaked-out, then disgusted, then horrified, then laughing, then heart-broken, and then hopeful again.I can not stress enough how badly everyone needs to play this game. The graphics are gorgeous and fit the fairy-tale style perfectly, the music is touching and evocative, the controls are perhaps the most cleverly-done thing I've ever seen in a video game, and the story will pluck at your heartstrings even if you thought you didn't have any. Most so-called ""emotional"" games are very ham-fisted. They show you things and tell you how you should feel. This game is very subtle. It is never forceful and it is never pandering. I'm even hesitant to say that the game tells you a story or shows you things. The story is just there. Things are just there. YOU are just there, holding hands with the brothers, experiencing everything.It is weird, it is harrowing, it is beautiful, and it is so perfectly put together that I'm going to beat myself up later for not giving it a 100. I'm pretty harsh on most games, but I honestly can not think of even one significant improvement that could be done.I really could go on for 10 more pages about why I'll remember this game on my death bed, but all that really needs to be said is that I got it free with PS+, and then gladly paid full price for it.

There is no time limit so it's nice to be able to take it all in; The scenery, the story, the game play. I had a tough time at first controlling the 2 brothers but quickly got the hang of it. Overall, Beautiful game with an amazing story! Great job! I wish the story was longer than 4 hrs of gameplay but, I would recommend this to any one!! WARNING: HAS MANY FEELS ;_;			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is basically Ico, except you control both Ico and Yorda at the same time. It features similarly well-designed puzzles that utilize an impressively intuitive control scheme as you run through a world that manages to tell a completely wordless story.I haven’t tried to play this game with a keyboard but I probably wouldn’t recommended it. On a 360 pad you control each brother with one analog stick, and each trigger serves as an “interact” button for each of them. Through this, Brothers puts you through what is every bit the classic adventure game in the Ico, Another World, and Prince of Persia tradition.Each brother has different abilities -- the older brother is stronger and can swim but the younger brother can fit in smaller places. Through this, Brothers manages to give you puzzles that are surprisingly ingenious despite not being very complex. None of the puzzles took me more than a few seconds to work out, but at the same time none of them felt stupid. I’m still not sure how Starbreeze struck that balance. You can see a similar balance in the storyline.The game’s Sims-style gibberish manages to communicate that two brothers -- one in the midst of adolescence and the other reaching the end of childhood, must go on a quest to find a legendary medicine for their ailing father. There’s a lot of other interesting and well-told stuff in there as the brothers meet ever-wilder characters on their journey.Similar to Team Ico’s games, Brothers also takes you through environments that immediately feel like they have stories of their own, like the aftermath of a battlefield or the wake of a natural disaster. Furthermore, the game doesn’t even tell you the full story of what’s transpired in front of you, it just let’s you infer things.The art direction in Brothers serves all these environments and characters well despite it being quite modest in the technical area -- no fancy effects or anything and the system requirements don’t list any recommended settings, only minimum. Everything is in a sort of round, chunky aesthetic which seems to play to the Unreal 3 Engine’s strengths similarly to Gears of War 3.Brothers is a very tightly-put-together little adventure game that hits the hallmarks of what it’s probably trying to evoke: inspired fairy-tale locales, smart-but-intuitive gameplay, and an emotional storyline that doesn’t rely too much on cut scenes or any text, though the whole game will last you no more than three hours.

												7/10A very short interactive story unfolds as two brothers explore a linear landscape with a few scenic stopping points along the way.The various elements come together nicely - the world is well realised, the game wonderfully directed, and the storyline will surprise you. The puzzle/platforming gameplay is fairly sparse, so it rarely provides a gameplay challenge. This can be completed in 3 hours and doesn't have much replay value beyond achievement hunting or showing to friends. Pick it up during a sale one day as it's a nice change fom the norm.			"

This tale is accompanied by a sweeping score and numerous visual motifs that come full circle by the time you hit the credits; a true work of art.

												Okay so I played this game with my sister playing for the younger brother and I can honestly say I enjoyed it much more that way than I was when I had started off trying to play it alone. Of course, my lack of a controller did make things difficult, but I would still recommend using another person to play this game. While I did find the game itself to be somewhat linear and guided at times, that didn't really take away too much from the experience overall. The puzzles were entertaining, and there were moments of excitement, and interest. The game itself looks beautiful and the attention to detail by the developers makes the game feel satisfying. Do not buy this game expecting there to be addictive qualities or pleasing accomplishments, buy this game because the story of it is just flawless. It is definitely not replayable, and the 4 hours it took were well worth it. But by all means wait for it to go on sale, I bought it for $3			"

												I'll ask you this. Would you pay 2.99 for a movie ticket for a film you heard excellent ratings on? That's how I made and justified my purchase 4 hours ago (it took me 3.5 hours to complete the game).The way I see it is it's an interactive movie. Gameplay is innovative and actually works, but what really drives the game is the story, which is told incredibly well through the atmosphere. The score is also incredible.Personally I judge a game's value by it's quality. I much rather have a strong, impactful, memorable experience that's worth my time, then one that is bland, vapid, and stretched-out that takes up too much of my time.If you decide to get this game, do let me know as I'd love to hear what you think! :)			"

												So many manly tears.The game starts out really slow and lawdy lawd knows I was considering not playing it for a huge while. But then once you're past the first main area outside of town, it gets extremely good. The story, and especially the last 30 minutes, pack a really strong emotional punch that if I had been by myself in the room I would have cried like a little girl.It's about 3-4 hours or so for most people. While I wouldn't pay full price for it, I'd wait for a sale, it's an experience that MUST be had. Especially if you like stories of family and loss.9/10 could not be further from the truth.

												I was extremely surprised as to just how much I would like this game. Ever since it was released I was interested in getting it, now that I have it I don't regret it in the slightest. It's not extremely difficult to play, the controls kind of take some time to get use to. I would HIGHLY recommend using a controller for this game. You have to control both characters the big brother with the left analog stick/left trigger and the younger brother with the right analog/right trigger. The way you control the two characters to get through the puzzles gradually gets more... intricate. It is a pretty entertaining game. Usually when I start off playing a new game like this I only play it to try it out but I started it and haven't put it down yet. The graphics aren't bad at all and i find myself enjoying the scenery. They speak... sim type language.. so you kind of have to interpret whats going on but its not too difficult to figure out. I'm not sure if I would have liked more dialog in this game or not, probably not. I think it would subtract from the actual experience of the game. If you haven't played this game and have even the slightest interest in trying it out, I would highly suggest you do so.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a charming short adventure. Although the game uses some simple controls they work brilliantly and the puzzles are varied enough to keep the game interesting. Where the game really excels in though is the world that you journey through. The environment is imbued with life from clever little details, a great and unique sound track and some very slick animations.			"

												I don't think I could say anything about this game that hasen't been said in the other 13,700 positive reviews at the time of writing this. This is an absolutely beautiful and atmospheric game. If you think there is any chance you might enjoy this type of game, just get it, you won't regret it. It's a little short at 4 to 5 hours, but it's worth it.The game was designed for an xbox 360 controller. You can play with a keyboard, but you will have a problem at 2 parts in the game. You can get through these parts, but you will have to hold a button down for a few minutes at those 2 parts instead of about 10 seconds. You can use other dual stick controllers (I used a PS2 controller), but you will probably need to use a small free program called x360ce which is an xbox 360 controller emulator. This will tell the game you are using an xbox controller and the program will let you map the keys on your controller. If you are using a PS2 controller and the right stick doesn't map correctly, search online and there is a patch that will fix it.			"

												I just finished the game... and I was pleasantly surprised. The world in the game is beautiful and interesting, full of charm. And the co-op type of gameplay with the two sticks is nicely done. Let me say this, though; this is a game that you NEED to experience thorough in order to actually appreciate it. It's the whole experience that makes the game. Not just gameplay, beautiful graphics nor the story/characters. Everything. If you're into these ""art'sy"" type of games where the exploration and atmosphere comes first, you'll probably love it. But if you find them dull and too sappy for your tastes, stay away. It's not exactly challenging, but I wasn't really looking for a challenge in the first place. I was looking for a relaxing and interesting journey. And I got it.			"

												I recommend that you subject yourself to this game, because its like come along once in a very long time, and usually on consoles.Visually stunning and with a soundtrack that is perfectly pitched to compliment those visuals, Brothers is an amazing game from a purely technical perspective. That doesn't really matter however.Brothers is an amazing tale, conveyed almost without words in a way reminiscent of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. The charazterization of the characters is also in itself simple, but strong. You will love these brothers and sympathize with their struggle just as you'll stand amazed at the detail and imagination invested into this fictional world, and that's part of the tragedy. The game KNOWS what you think it is. It knows what you expect. It's masterfully directed and built to get you emotionally invested in its story.Saying any more than that would spoil the surprises you'll have along the way, but fair warning: the game is not a happy-go-lucky fairy tale and it will shock you, scare you and ultimately make you cry your soul out.10/10.

												As it stands right now, I was able to beat Brothers in less than 3 and a half hours. A game has to be REALLY REALLY good to be that short and still hold a reccomendation from me at a market price of 15 dollars, but yet here I am, with two thumbs up for this artistic masterpiece of a game. From a gameplay standpoint, Brothers is quite simple at the basic level - no puzzles were too advanced and the platforming is simple and doesn't require any button presses. Where the golden mechanic lies is the fact that you control the brothers simultaneously, a feat achieved by assigning a brother to one stick of a joypad (which is mandatory for play). While disorienting at first, eventually you pick up the pace and find it an enjoyable and innovative mechanic to work cooperatively with... yourself. Very ingenious. But where the game lacks in length and puzzles, it REEAAAALLLY picks up in atmosphere, visuals, and story. To begin, the story is just that two sons are finding a liquid that will restore their sick dad's health, by following a map. Yeah, not much there, but it's interesting in that the entire story is conveyed without a single line of dialouge, but rather with hand gestures and the context of the envrionment. What I find best about the atmosphere is that it is beautiful, one of the most beautiful platofrmers since Trine 2 (which I found really enticing). I found myself staring at the villages, dark forests, snowy mountaintops, and rainy rivers simply for their aesthetic value, not really for their gameplay. The atmosphere is only further enhanced by a somber and dramatic soundtrack, which always accomponies the narrative in a guiding way and really caps off the sad ending. Overall, I'd recomend it if you are in the mood for a short but magnificently beautiful work of art, perhaps one of the most mature video games on the market as we speak.			"

												""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" shows video games can reach the level of art. The mechanics are the gameplay and the story itself. The game has no need for shoehorned quests or NPC's to dole out backstory. You simply play it, and the world emerges as you go. The game is extremely easy, but that doesn't necessarily detract from it in any way. This is not the sort of game you would play if you want a challenge. It is the sort of game you would play if you want an experience of beauty.			"

												A very touching story that can be completed in 3-4 hours of gameplay. Controls on a keyboard take a while to get used to for a single player.  However, there is a section very early on that is not designed for the keyboard. It requires holding onto 2 keys for over 1 minute just to get through while on the controller, there is a way to accelerate it. (You will know what Im talking about once you reach the area where you have to crank up the lift for the cart.)Still worth it despite that little flaw.			"

												Great game. It's only 3 hours of gameplay, but the storytelling is good. No text to read, no narrators, even no English! Let your imagination play part to interpret the story. Gameplay is unique: although at first it might be difficult to move and act both brothers at the same time, after some time it's just easy to do. Controller is recommended, although keyboard will do just fine.Be prepared to get emotionally bound with the brothers. Don't play using walkthrough. Achievements are optional, you won't get it if you just follow the normal path, so explore some more.			"

While not required, it will keep you immersed in the world from beginning to end. Besides, the game is not that long so most people who can set aside 3 hours will have it done in that time.If you are not the type of person to play a game for the story of it then perhaps you might find the puzzles too simple or whatever but the story is decent enough that most people would love it provided they enjoy story telling. This game is one of the best adventure games I have played and I cannot recommend it enough it is worth the price tag for such a unique experience. "

												*me screaming at game* HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?*ahem*Okay, let me give this game a more satisfactory review.(Mild spoilers below)When I was a film student in college, my film professor loved hammering in this idea to his students: sound is everything. And lack thereof. He prefers silent films for this reason: visual storytelling should not rely on sound to create the story. Sound should be a suppliment to that story, not a crutch. And, when done right, the right sound effects in the right place can drastically heighten emotional impact.Good sound design is one of those things that often goes unnoticed in film and game critique. And Brothers has good sound design. The lack of understandable dialogue actually makes the story better because it forces us to discern the story from simple action alone. Oftentimes I found myself rationalizing the actions of the brothers and other NPCs by determining their emotions from their actions. Such as the crying forest giant- context allowed me to discern that someone he loved was gone. That was just one example of many I found myself thinking as I played the game. Don't give your audience 4: give them 2+2. Let them figure it out. That's why this game doesn't need dialogue.The music only has a discernable melody and composition when in emotionally intense situations. Otherwise, it is atmospheric, indecipherable sounds. This is effective because if a musician relies too much on bombarding our senses with fantastic melodies at all times, we will not be able to appreciate a moment when it truly calls for some riveting emotions. So, when you're just wandering the land, accomplishing small tasks, the music remains quiet, pensive, and ambient. When something big is going on... it's spine-chilling. Contrast is everything!The sound effects are immersive because they draw from the environment, and you can often hear things coming before you see them. This is effective because when you are traveling around in real life, out in the woods or even on city streets, oftentimes you will hear things before you see them coming. This is something we have tended to take for granted, but you can tell this was intentionally designed in the game.Of course, the art direction was gorgeous. I especially love the fact that the characters are not rendered in an attempt for photorealism like many triple A titles these days. You simply don't need that. Stylized, abstracted forms are more pleasing to the eye IMO. Attempting photorealistic characters in a video game is just too uncanny valley for my tastes. The *colors*, man. The light and shadows. The composition. It's a visual masterpiece. And the ending. I don't have to explain why it's so chilling and amazing. What are you waiting for... buy this game!			"

												Truly an amazing game in every aspect.The mechanics of the game are good, and it's a bit of a new concept for me to play 2 characters at the same time.Amazing artwork, great music.The story is something you could make a fantasy book out of, a good one.Not much to say for voice acting as the game uses a made up language, which is my only criticism as well.I feel that this game would've gotten way more emotion from me if it had actual English voice acting, assuming the voice acting was good.I also think they could've at least added a few more voice-lines, even though it is just balderdash hearing the exact same voice-recordings over and over is off-putting. A lot of people do not properly appreciate the world, the art in games.This game is a true reminder to those people that there is a very creative, and talented team behind the world you are in.The soundtrack coupled with the world you are in is just fenomenal, at some points I got chills, some points I sat back and took a sip of my coffee to just take it in.The actual gameplay mechanics are great, and I personally feel like they nailed the 'play co-op with yourself' concept, it was done in a way where it wasn't too overwhelming, and I got used to it after the first 10-20 minutes of playing.But I do admit the first minutes it felt very alien and a little off-putting. But yes, I got used to it and I imagine most people will. I can't see a person quitting the game because they got frustrated from controlling 2 characters at the same time.If there are people like that they do not deserve any attention in my opinion.*Please keep in mind that this game has to be played with a controller.The puzzles in the game are fairly simple, nothing you haven't seen before.The premise of the game is simple. You are 2 brothers who's father is sick, you must go out on an adventure to find a potion, of sorts, to save him.But this game is more dark and grim than it may seem on the surface. It has some unexpected, and indeed dark, turns in the story.I belive everyone should go into this game blind, spoiling something may very well ruin the entire game for you.Whether you buy this game on sale or not; it is worth it.3-4 hours of gameplay with an amazing, powerful story, good game mechanics, a beautiful world filled with fenomenal music is worth it to me.It almost feels like that the lower expectations you have going into the game will leave you more and more amazed at the end.

The graphics and soundtrack blew me away and so did the story its a really gripping tale of yes, two brothers, trying to save theyr fathers life and the journey that they sets on to do that. I usually doesnt play that many games of this sort but if i can find anything that matches this of the level of quality i'll surely be buying it, but to be quite frank i think it will be very hard to top this one. The controls of this game is quite interesting as the player controls both of the brothers at the same time with each brother on either left or right stick. The only thing that is a little disapointing for this game is that it is quite short but i really think that nobody should cheat themselfs of this experience. Personally i think even at the current prize at 14.99 euroes its still worth buying this and everyone with a joypad should own this marvelous and in many ways grounbreaking game. I will rate this game at 9 out of 10 and the only reason im not giving it a 10 is because of the length of it and it took me around 4.5 hours to complete.			"

It should take you no more than a few hours to complete. Its real easy, litterally only use four buttons for the entire game. the left analog stick to move the big brother and the LT button to interact. The right analog stick to move the little brother and RT button to interact. Thats it! Litterally! throughout the entire game your using only thoes simple four controls. And I belive they did this so the player can focus more on the story. I would not reccomend this to people who have lost a family member unless your able to handel it.

												I'll ask you this. Would you pay 2.99 for a movie ticket for a film you heard excellent ratings on? That's how I made and justified my purchase 4 hours ago (it took me 3.5 hours to complete the game).The way I see it is it's an interactive movie. Gameplay is innovative and actually works, but what really drives the game is the story, which is told incredibly well through the atmosphere. The score is also incredible.Personally I judge a game's value by it's quality. I much rather have a strong, impactful, memorable experience that's worth my time, then one that is bland, vapid, and stretched-out that takes up too much of my time.If you decide to get this game, do let me know as I'd love to hear what you think! :)			"

												I was extremely surprised as to just how much I would like this game. Ever since it was released I was interested in getting it, now that I have it I don't regret it in the slightest. It's not extremely difficult to play, the controls kind of take some time to get use to. I would HIGHLY recommend using a controller for this game. You have to control both characters the big brother with the left analog stick/left trigger and the younger brother with the right analog/right trigger. The way you control the two characters to get through the puzzles gradually gets more... intricate. It is a pretty entertaining game. Usually when I start off playing a new game like this I only play it to try it out but I started it and haven't put it down yet. The graphics aren't bad at all and i find myself enjoying the scenery. They speak... sim type language.. so you kind of have to interpret whats going on but its not too difficult to figure out. I'm not sure if I would have liked more dialog in this game or not, probably not. I think it would subtract from the actual experience of the game. If you haven't played this game and have even the slightest interest in trying it out, I would highly suggest you do so.			"

												So many manly tears.The game starts out really slow and lawdy lawd knows I was considering not playing it for a huge while. But then once you're past the first main area outside of town, it gets extremely good. The story, and especially the last 30 minutes, pack a really strong emotional punch that if I had been by myself in the room I would have cried like a little girl.It's about 3-4 hours or so for most people. While I wouldn't pay full price for it, I'd wait for a sale, it's an experience that MUST be had. Especially if you like stories of family and loss.9/10 could not be further from the truth. It's not a flawless game, but way above average.			"

												I sat down to play this game for thinking it was going to be a light hearted adventure with a gimmick of unique controls. Through playing the game I was totally blown away by how good it was. Brothers is a fantasic adventure game with an emotional and touching story. The game can get quiet dark at times but is balanced with plenty of lighthearted moments as well. This game deserves all the awards and credits it has recieved. Simply put, Brothers is a game that you need to play.  "

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is exactly what a short indie game should be.  The game is short (approximately 2-3 hours) but what it does in that time is more than some games try to do in 30 hours.  The puzzles and the controlling brothers mechanic are used exretemely well and there really isn't a great deal of repetitiveness in those puzzles.  Each puzzle is a short unique puzzle to solve and then move quickly to the next puzzle/story element.There is not a lot of fluff or down time in the game.  It is paced exteremly well, moving from puzzle to story to puzzle to story.  It's not that the game can be beat in one sitting, it's that the game is so well paced that you want to finish it in one sitting.  There's no big down boring parts or excessively frustrating puzzles, just small simple well excuted game play that makes you want to keep moving on.  The world that the developers created to tell their story in was beautiful.  There was some really unique areas with some unique characters as well.Everything comes together in one great package to make one of the best indie games that I have played.  Highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a great indie experience.			"

A controller is required, but you'll soon see why. There wasn't a moment in the game that was boring. It is a single player co-op game. Meaning, you control both characters. Each analog stick controls the other character. Do not ruin the game by playing with another person. It becomes natural after playing it a bit. Check it out. You won't be dissappointed.			"

												Though the overall gameplay is thin, the story that is told and the way that it is portrayed is very good. It has an ending that you might not expect, and even though it still has some gamey feel to it (such as respawns at checkpoints if you die), that's a minor quibble on an otherwise excellent game.I'm usually not much of an adventure game, but the environments are so grand and the exploration element so tight that I can honestly recommend this to those like me who might otherwise pass it over.

												I was skeptical. I had hear quite a few things about this game so I finally decided to pick it up and give it a shot. To be honest, I went in with low expectations. Boy was I wrong. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, tells an incredibly powerful story of two bothers who go out seeking a special cure for their father, who has fallen ill, and it tells this story all without the characters saying a single word. With stunning visuals, interesting game mechanics, and an attention grabbing storyline, I highly recommend this game.			"

												A beautiful platformer.Brothers- A Tale of two sons is a 3D platformer developed by starbreeze studios. The story is simple, yet it is conveyed perfectly. You play as two brothers who are tasked to retrieve some medicine for their sick dying father. In order to do so, they will have to cross giant bridges, bloody graveyards, giant oceans and meet a variety of colourful characters. Through out the story you will feel a variety of emotions including joy, happiness, wonder, fear, amazement and sadness. There is no voice acting in the game, and honestly there doesn't need to be as you can understand what the characters are saying through their actions. The game will last you 3 hours or a bit more if you want to collect all achievements and explore a bit. There isn't much replayability to be had here.Gameplay revolves around a mix between platforming and puzzle solving. Bearing in mind that you NEED A CONTROLLER to play this game, the controls are quite good. You control the movement of one brother with the left analogue stick and another with the right stick. It might seem tricky at first, trying to control both the brothers at the same time, but after a while you will get the hang of it.The graphics are cartoony and good to look at. The lighting does a great job at making the colours more attractive to the eye. There are also p[enty of scenes that look so good that you want to take  screenshot of as well.I highly recommend this game to people you want to a rememberable adventure with a few platforming and puzzles thrown in.

												This game is truely amazing and i'll recommend everyone who has a joypad to get this game. The graphics and soundtrack blew me away and so did the story its a really gripping tale of yes, two brothers, trying to save theyr fathers life and the journey that they sets on to do that. I usually doesnt play that many games of this sort but if i can find anything that matches this of the level of quality i'll surely be buying it, but to be quite frank i think it will be very hard to top this one. The controls of this game is quite interesting as the player controls both of the brothers at the same time with each brother on either left or right stick. The only thing that is a little disapointing for this game is that it is quite short but i really think that nobody should cheat themselfs of this experience. Personally i think even at the current prize at 14.99 euroes its still worth buying this and everyone with a joypad should own this marvelous and in many ways grounbreaking game. I will rate this game at 9 out of 10 and the only reason im not giving it a 10 is because of the length of it and it took me around 4.5 hours to complete.			"

												Hello everybody,today i wan`t to show you an interesting game.No, more than a game. It`s a journey you will never forget, if you play this game.STORYThis is the story of two Brothers on a journey to help their father.At the beginning of the story the father got ill and his sons bring him to a healer.The problem is, he know a way to heal the father but it will take a very long journey.The sons already lost their mother and don`t wan`t to loose their father, too, so they started the Journey.GAMEPLAYI never saw a gameplay like this before. You MUST have a controller.With it you controll the 2 Brothers at the same time. One with the right half and the other with the left half of the Controller. The same time! Most of the parts of this game you must do Teamwork with the Brothers to get through the game. That sounds a little bit complicated, but it is very easy to control.At the beginning it may be a little bit complicated, but after a short time you´re in and you can enjoy the game and it´s story.GRAPHICSThe Graphics are really awesome. At the beginning it is nothing special. You are in a small village, with some people, normal village life. But the more you play, the Settings gets better and better and you can see how much work it`s in this game. I don´t wan`t to spoil, that is something you must see by yourself. The World of BROTHERS got many nice details and all the characters are very well animated.  MUSICThe music is wonderfull and fits great into the Game Scenes. It also supports emotional moments very, very well.ACHIEVEMENTSYes, Brothers have his Achievements, but these are special ones. Each one stands for a little situation you must find. For example, you have to make a special person dancing, or helping a Turtlemom to get her Babys back. Very nice Achievements.PERSONAL CONCLUSIONYes, this game did it. I`ve had some tears in my eyes and i´m not ashamed of it.This is more than a game. It´s like a movie or like a book. You follow the story and you laugh and cry with them. Each chapter you wan`t to know how it is going on. You can`t stop. And at the End of the Game you sit there, thinking about what you have experienced. Thanks to the Developer and publisher of this experience.It was awesome.TO YOUIf you like great storys with great graphics and music, this is for you.If you are really emotional, don´t forget the tissue. You will need it.This is really a game that should be in every collection. GreetingsWyvern			"

												Perfect game.I enjoyed every minute of this. I was drawn into the world and the story completely while I played. I felt like I was on an epic adventure, and I was truly invested into the 3 main characters. Now that I'm finished I can appreciate things in finer detail.Gameplay is certainly unique, but that's not the main take-away here. I think -everything- comes together to make a truly memorable experience.The unique gameplay mechanic (driving both brothers with one controller) is certainly notable and memorable by itself, and something else will use this mechanic in the future and I'll think of this game. But that doesn't give the full picture. The atmosphere created by the design and the music and the story all- is a new benchmark for me. I'm sure I'll think of it often.You can run through this world, taking the shortest path to your goal, and enjoy yourself thoroughly I think. But you don't have to. Despite the epic adventure vibe, you're not at all rushed, and you can stop to smell the roses of this wonderful environment (and you get an achievement for doing so). There are other characters in the world that you pass in your travels, and you can often play some part in their lives. Looking at the achievments screen now that I'm done reveals that I missed some of this myself, but I don't feel like I missed anything really.I was emotionally spent after completing this game. I took a lot from the experience and that might stick with me longest. As an experience, I think it rates with the best movies I've ever seen. I don't usually get this quality from games, and that probably intensified it for me, but it's excellent to be sure. I took some minutes to bask in it after I was done.It's not a difficult game, although the very first time you come across a new puzzle aspect (particularly at the start of the game) you will be confused until you get it, I think that as a whole, that aspect was good for the game. It doesn't take long to pick up really.Find some quiet hours and throw yourself into this game completely and you ought to get twice as much out of it.			"

												My thoughts on Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons:What an amazingly beautiful game! I picked this up quite a while a go during a sale and only because I heard YouTube personality TotalBisquit say this was his favourite game.After playing (and finishing) it, I can understand why.You follow the two Brothers on their quest to find a rare medicine to cure their father and help them climb mountains, fly across valleys, make their way through villages and castles, across devastaded battlefields and frozen rivers. The level design is just awesome and so beautiful I couldn't help but wish to be living there. The soundtrack too is great and fits the game and the mood perfectly.While it takes some time to really get used to the controls (Xbox controller is required) - you control both brothers at once, using both sticks - it never gets frustrating or annoying as the game helps you out a lot and never really is too hard to be blamed on the controls.There are no fights or puzzles, just some smal objectives like having to pull a lever with one brother while hangling across a pit with the other, in order to create a path for the big brother once you reached the other side. May sound boring, but the landscapes and the characters somehow get you entertained anyway. Plus, the game is easily beatable in under two hours, so there isn't much time to get bored anyway.Biggest highlight of the game however is how it makes you like the characters in a way only few other games do, and the ending deserves a special mention too as it is just beautiful and really really really well made. Did I already mention how beautiful the landscapes are?Highly recommended for anyone, especially during a sale!Also, vote for it as best game to make you cry!			"

												This game is an amazing achievement. A game that creates an innovative, entertaining yet intuitive control system is rare. A game that creates a consistent deeply moving emotional experience in its players is rare. A game that does both? Epic. I will not go in depth into the detailed mechanics or the story itself because doing so would ruin your individual experience. I am not referring only to story spoilers, but your experience and growth in using the ""single-player co-op"" control system. Don't watch a video. Don't read commentary. I started playing this game on a whim in my office when my family was asleep. Speakers on low, door open, lights on, email up on my second monitor. 30 minutes into the game I had headphones on, door was closed, lights and second monitor turned off. It commanded a degree of attention and immersion that I have rarely experienced. Buy it now and play it. I give it an 11/10. No kidding.In fact, you owe it to yourself to play this game. It is well worth the $15, and certainly worth the $3 it is right now on the Steam Fall Sale when this review was written. Please play it. You will never forget it.			"

 Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons	#Well, simply wanna say that this game made me cry. The most emotional and wonderful thing I've ever played. Not unique, but simple and beautiful story made my heart warmer. Playing this game - is travelling and discovering funny and sometimes sad things with two boys, different, but always helpful.It is nice feeling to arrive at the end of a journey chapter by chapter. But it's the journey that matters in the end .... If the end is good ....Thank you, developers!			"

												One of the best, saddest and most beautiful games I've played. I recommend everyone to play this game with patience, Take your time, pay attention to little details in the game, don't just rush through the storyline. I found controlling both of the brothers a bit confusing at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.			"

												Easy and simple but entertaining.It's a nonstandard adventure. I mean, you control two characters simultaneously with both analog sticks (controller required). And there's no killing, violence, prejudice, malice, etc...Also, you don't need a lot of dexterity or instant reflexes, though it takes some time to get used to controlling two characters at the same time. Just two sticks and two buttons for action (and two other optional buttons for camera rotation).Recommended for those times you just want to relax playing something easy and inoffensive, with a beautiful story.

												A short game, but that does mean that it doesn't outstay its welcome. It's enjoyable while it lasts, though you will probably feel like an idiot for a few minutes until you get the hang of controlling the two characters simultaneously. Overall I'd highly recommend it, though be warned that it may make you feel feelings and stuff.			"

I'm not a huge fan of the music by itself, but in the context of the game world, I think it does a great job at setting the mood of different set pieces.This game does have a learning curve, mechanically - both brothers are controlled simulaneously using the R/L sticks and triggers, which can get a little confusing. The gameplay itself isn't anything revelatory, but that ""dual control"" mechanic provides some interesting coordination puzzle opportunities. The only downsides were some technical shortcomings: choppy framerate that occasionally dropped to +/- 20 (but was stable at 30 enough to keep me satisfied) and texture popping can sort of take you out of it. I paid $3 for this on sale, but I think it's worth the full asking price of $15, even as a shorter experience.			"

												It's a fairy tale come to life, about the length of a long movie and just as epic.  You simultaneously control two brothers as they journey through incredibly beautiful fantasy landscapes.  The art is just amazing and the originality of the setting is really a breath of fresh air from the D&D knockoff nonsense that is so common in fantasy.But it is not just the art, Brothers is the best combination of art, theme, story, and gameplay of any game I've ever played.  Every part of the game is made better by the other aspects and it is one of those cases where the sum really is worth more than the total of the parts.  When you get this game, do yourself a favor and don't spoil anything more about it.  I went in blind and it was a great and memorable experience.			"

												""Brothers"" tells a story of beauty and cruelty that explores areas of human experience overlooked or mishandled by the vast majority of games.

												Before I start to try to write a review, I want to give you two points that may give you a better approach to this game:1) It doesn't really need a controller. Keyboard works fine and, probably just for this game, is better than a controller.    You'll understand why, I'm sure of that. Basically, don't use the controller. 2) It is a short game, so I recommend you to buy it at 75% or 90% discount. Before you read (As my review could not appear as interesting nor helpful) Buy it, while keeping in mind those two points I wrote.Shall we start now?This game is enchanting. A fable. Entrancing landscapes reminds me of paintings, a game of lights, strong yet soft colors that you probably dream about when listening to yes, a fable.The music is another turmoil of emotions that blows with the story, the hills, the water, the grasslands. It's the wind itself that lifts leaves and sighs, smiles and tension.Their own language doesn't need to be truly understood. You won't need to understand their words to bond with their footsteps and their story.I used the word ""Fable"" Because is what I truly saw and wanted to believe to when I played this game.As such then, it has a moral: how harsh is not life itself, but living.You'll see how places of sadness and slavery can't suffocate hope and love, you'll live while the past haunts you, growing over a guilt that shouldn't exist.You'll see how mischiefs and purity of a child, even when on a journey to save your father's life, wins against all odds.You'll see that the bright life of your village is a deep contrast to what lies behind its gates, among rivers of blood and vultures.And you'll understand that the only way through everything is to keep pushing forward: it doesn't matter if you are half of what you were when everything began. It doesn't matter if you were a bit spoiled; because life gives and pretends you to give her the same and a bit more, even if you don't smile anymore. Even if you're alone (Although you never are truly alone).			"

												This game creates an amazing sense of place and history of the world you experience, without ever telling you anything. It's all done through the graphics and little touches that you encounter whilst playing. Quite something really. The game itself is a fairly simple puzzle adventure but with unique gameplay elements, and the graphics and design take it to an extra level. Wonderful. Short and sweet, yet with emotional depth. There is one part in particular where you have to do something that I can't spoil that I would never have expected to encounter in a video game...You should definitely play it.PS The spiritual successor to Head over Heels?

												Really nice game, very pretty, wonderfully inventive and some fun puzzles too.  Basically a fairy tale in the Grimm vein made into videogame form.  It is, however, awfully short so don't expect it to last more than a couple of sittings.Oh, and what you're made to do at the end is frankly morbid for morbid's sake, but other than that it's a charming little tale.

												This game is truely amazing and i'll recommend everyone who has a joypad to get this game. The graphics and soundtrack blew me away and so did the story its a really gripping tale of yes, two brothers, trying to save theyr fathers life and the journey that they sets on to do that. I usually doesnt play that many games of this sort but if i can find anything that matches this of the level of quality i'll surely be buying it, but to be quite frank i think it will be very hard to top this one. The controls of this game is quite interesting as the player controls both of the brothers at the same time with each brother on either left or right stick. The only thing that is a little disapointing for this game is that it is quite short but i really think that nobody should cheat themselfs of this experience. Personally i think even at the current prize at 14.99 euroes its still worth buying this and everyone with a joypad should own this marvelous and in many ways grounbreaking game. I will rate this game at 9 out of 10 and the only reason im not giving it a 10 is because of the length of it and it took me around 4.5 hours to complete.			"

												Before i start the review, I'll explain a little bit about my experience playing this game:I first played the first few minutes of this game at a friend's house. He got me interested in the game and a few days later i bought it when it was on sale. Because this game is about 2 brothers, i took the oppertunity to play this game with my little brother (10 years younger than me). We ended up finishing the entire game together, playing at the same time or occasionally taking turns when one of us was about to die of sleep deprivation. This game is meant to be single player, but you can technically make it a co-op if you share the controller. So grab your brother (or better yet, 2 misbehaving siblings you want to teach a lesson about taking turns and co-operating with one another) and start the game up!Regarding myself and the little brother i played it with, we're 10 years apart. I'm nearing my 20's and he's still in elementary school at the time of this review. I wouldn't reccomend playing this game with a younger brother whose uncomfortable with themes of death and darkness. If you decide to play with a younger brother who doesn't understand the concept of death yet or is slowly learning the concept of death, this game may be a good way to introduce them to those themes, but this game CAN GET DARK. The game has many themes of death and it's very much a coming of age story for both brothers. In the game you'll encounter dead bodies, scary graveyards, nature coming to life trying to kill you,  SPIDERS , and an NPC 'tempting his own fate' to put it lightly... So just use your own judgement regarding your experience with your little brother of choice. As for the adorable child i played with, he can tolerate most things and only flat out refused to play the game in one section because he witnessed some gore he wasn't expecting but easily shook that off and played with me again immediately after that section was over. We played the game up until the end, wtinessed the ending together and he is not psychologically scarred by it in any way. We only used a walkthrough ONE time and even after the game was over we jokingly call eachother what the Brothers call eachother in the game.Ok, now onto the review:Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a puzzle/adventure game similar to the likes of ICO and Shadow of the Collasus for the PS2. The world Brothers takes place in is GORGEOUS to look at and feels incredibly massive but dangerous at the same time.  If you love RPGs and puzzles with huge worlds you'll love the way this one looks and feels. Unlike ICO and Shadow, the controls for brothers are extremely simple. You move with the analog sticks and interact with R2/L2. You can play solo controlling both titular brothers or grab any male sibling you get along with and each of you can share the controller, controlling 1 brother each. Both brothers are also very balanced. Big Brother (Maya?) is strong and tall but he doesn't jump very high or run as fast as Little Brother (Maii?), who is weaker and shorter but can jump higher. They can help eachother around the enviornment by picking eachother up, helping eachother up ladders, solve puzzles together in ways renimicent to ICO and Yorda and they're enjoyable to play as despite speaking a nonsense language (also very similar to the language spoken in ICO).The story: a simple fetch quest. The boys' father gets sick and they must retrieve an antidote from a tree hidden up in the mountains. And that's it. The story doesn't get more complex than that save for the fact their mother has died by drowning and Little Brother is also trauamtized by that event and unlike Big Brother, he can't swim. The game isn't so much about a story, it's more about a journey. The landscapes are beautiful and while wandering the world i couldn't help but want to know more about the lore of the world they're travelling through. It feels very Scandinavian in nature, what with all the giants, the beautiful snowscape, the water and the beautiful castles. I can't get over how wonderfult he game looks. At first glance, this looks like one of those games that'll look better than it actually is but in the case of Brothers, i say the looks are just a bonus for the journey. As for the journey is self, all the puzzles are solveable. If you play with a friend or a brother of your own, niether of you will get too frustrated. One thing that prevents me from buying most adventure/puzzle games is if the puzzles will be solveable. It's what makes or breaks a puzzle game. And thankfully despite the occasional camera wonky-ness all of the puzzles are solveable without a walkthrough. For myself and my brother, we only used a walkthrough for one puzzle we were confused on and after 10 minutes of testing theories we gave up and resorted to youtube. But other than that small experience, you could easily get through all the puzzles and they can all be solved without ripping your hair out trying to retrace your steps. Everything you need is always in the right place, where you need to go is always hinted at, you sometimes just need to look from a new perspective or look a little more carefully. For me at least, i enjoyed that the puzzles weren't too complex. If the puzzles are too complex that's usually the point where i give up on the game. And the puzzle layout is especially useful if you plan on playing with your younger brother.This is one of those rare occasions where i can say nothing bad about this game. Maybe 1 thing i can complain about the is the normal price which is 14.99, but i bought this game on sale and ended up getting is for around 3.75 (something like that) and completed the whole game in about 5/6 hours spanning a few different days because i was playing this with another person. Had i played the game solo, i likely would've finished it a lot faster. I'm one of those gamers who wants alot of gameplay for their money. Because i got this on sale i'd say i'm pretty lucky but the normal price may be a bit high if you value how many hours you'll get out of a game, but thankfully this game ain't 60 bucks, so 15 isn't that much of a bad price in my opinion.Yeah, i have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BAD TO SAY. It's very surprising 0_0;This is just one of those games where you love the journey and can't see much bad about it.It was an especially good bonding experience playing this game with my own brother, as we discussed how different puzzles could be solved, helped eachother progress through the journey and occasionally have mom yell at us when we were yelling at the brothers on screen. I can't imagine playing this game alone save maybe for the occasion where you've already beaten the game and wanna play it for nostalgia, gawk at the beauty of the setting or just wanna get all the achievements. I wholly suggest playing this game with another person (especially a brother).I give Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons 10 sets of brothers out of 5!			"

If the directional keys wont work, especially when using S and D, try the POS1, Del, End and Page-Down keys. But you have to tap the shown tutorial keys, because the wont update to your settings.This game is intended to be played alone, but it is also fun cooperational.			"

												I simultaneously love and hate this game at the same time. Even with a controller, this game feels wonky as hell trying to control both brothers at the same time. And by the end of the game, I don't think my skills controlling them had gotten much better, either lol. That being said, there's something about the game that makes you want to keep playing. As the player, you want to see how the story progresses, and part of you just wants to see the what the next area will look like because this game is so damn pretty. You also feel invested in what's going on, and I think if I had to use one word to descibe this game, it would be 'feel'. The game does make you feel, and that's why I said I somewhat hated it. I wasn't expecting to feel anything. I thought I would just play the game to and be able to say that, ""yeah, I played through it, it was a pretty cool story"", and leave it at that. However, I got much more out of it than I anticipated. This game literally has no replayability, but that's ok. I feel like I got my money's worth. Overall, I give this game a solid recommendation. I went into it with quite a bit of skepticism, even with all of the positive reviews I've heard about it. The story and the ending are as good as everyone says they are, though.			"

The character design, the voices, the 'script', the music and all of the ambient sounds and world design that bring this beautiful fantasy planet to life; everything is knitted together so tightly that you will fall in love with this game within the first 5 minutes.This is a short game, but it does more in 3 hours than most games can do in 10. It is an emotional ride with some humour along the way. All of the puzzles are simple and the controls are surprisingly intuitive, so the pace of the story is never interrupted. I can't think of a single negative comment to make about this game, I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												Compré el juego en la summer sale a tan solo $17.99, y la verdad considero que han sido los mejores $18 que he invertido. Lo terminé en 4 horas con todos sus logros, sentí que fue muy corto pero porque en verdad lo disfrute. La historia me pareció muy buena, los paisajes y la ambientación muy bien elaborados. Verdareramente lo recomiendo y definitivamente volvería a jugarlo.			"

Having just finished it, it brought this poem to mind;""The waves are high and the sunset’s red,So now it’s time to go to bed.The tide is up and the wind does rip,But this old ship’ll never tip.We’re far at sea , days from land,But if you’re scared just take my hand.Just hold on tight boy-o-mine,In my arms you’ll be just fine.""

												This was my favourite game of 2013. The game tells a beautiful story that makes the bond between the brothers so powerful that it doesn't even need voice work, the mechanics are enough to convey the power of their friendship. The puzzles are tight, and are never difficult enough to cause frustration. The game is looks fantastic and is complimented by good sound design. The controls excentuate the nattative in a very interesting way. Play this game.			"

Product received for free
												Before I start to try to write a review, I want to give you two points that may give you a better approach to this game:1) It doesn't really need a controller. Keyboard works fine and, probably just for this game, is better than a controller.    You'll understand why, I'm sure of that. Basically, don't use the controller. 2) It is a short game, so I recommend you to buy it at 75% or 90% discount. Before you read (As my review could not appear as interesting nor helpful) Buy it, while keeping in mind those two points I wrote.Shall we start now?This game is enchanting. A fable. Entrancing landscapes reminds me of paintings, a game of lights, strong yet soft colors that you probably dream about when listening to yes, a fable.The music is another turmoil of emotions that blows with the story, the hills, the water, the grasslands. It's the wind itself that lifts leaves and sighs, smiles and tension.Their own language doesn't need to be truly understood. You won't need to understand their words to bond with their footsteps and their story.I used the word ""Fable"" Because is what I truly saw and wanted to believe to when I played this game.As such then, it has a moral: how harsh is not life itself, but living.You'll see how places of sadness and slavery can't suffocate hope and love, you'll live while the past haunts you, growing over a guilt that shouldn't exist.You'll see how mischiefs and purity of a child, even when on a journey to save your father's life, wins against all odds.You'll see that the bright life of your village is a deep contrast to what lies behind its gates, among rivers of blood and vultures.And you'll understand that the only way through everything is to keep pushing forward: it doesn't matter if you are half of what you were when everything began. It doesn't matter if you were a bit spoiled; because life gives and pretends you to give her the same and a bit more, even if you don't smile anymore. Even if you're alone (Although you never are truly alone).			"

												Though there is no clear language spoken in this game, its pretty much understood that two brothers are set out on a journey to find some miracle cure for their father. What makes this game unique is you must control both brothers at the same time, which with the keyboard is especially challenging. Beautiful scenery and a simplified story line make this game worthy. Aside from the challenging game play with the keyboard, which I'm told having a controller is much easier, the gameplay is interesting and amazing. There's not any real fighting per se, but some simple puzzles you must solve to continue on. Took me about 3 hours to complete it but still well worth the money.  stupid ninja onions made my face wet near the end.  "

												This game creates an amazing sense of place and history of the world you experience, without ever telling you anything. It's all done through the graphics and little touches that you encounter whilst playing. Quite something really. The game itself is a fairly simple puzzle adventure but with unique gameplay elements, and the graphics and design take it to an extra level. Wonderful. Short and sweet, yet with emotional depth. There is one part in particular where you have to do something that I can't spoil that I would never have expected to encounter in a video game...You should definitely play it.PS The spiritual successor to Head over Heels?

												One of the games which are about the experience, not challenge.Story has a simple premise and the gameplay is easy to handle which allows you to focus on the experience all the more, especially in the second half of the game (some parts near the end utilize the control mechanics in a way which adds a lot to the story - but I don't want to spoil it for you).Level design is one of the best in the last 5-10 years. There are some puzzles but they're all very easy and you shouldn't have trouble with any of them.The overall art style is stunning. Beautiful visuals (with many small events which happen in the background) and original score create a mesmerizing world which feels very much alive.The game is quite short (~3-3.5 hours) so you will not spend a lot of time with it (recommended for those with huge backlogs).Get it and play it, this game is definitely worth your money and time.Recommended input method: Gamepad all the way. Controlling each character with one half adds a lot of depth, especially later on. Vibration capability further more extends the experience.			"

												A very touching story that can be completed in 3-4 hours of gameplay. Controls on a keyboard take a while to get used to for a single player.  However, there is a section very early on that is not designed for the keyboard. It requires holding onto 2 keys for over 1 minute just to get through while on the controller, there is a way to accelerate it. (You will know what Im talking about once you reach the area where you have to crank up the lift for the cart.)Still worth it despite that little flaw.			"

And the co-op type of gameplay with the two sticks is nicely done. Let me say this, though; this is a game that you NEED to experience thorough in order to actually appreciate it. It's the whole experience that makes the game. Not just gameplay, beautiful graphics nor the story/characters. Everything. If you're into these ""art'sy"" type of games where the exploration and atmosphere comes first, you'll probably love it. But if you find them dull and too sappy for your tastes, stay away. It's not exactly challenging, but I wasn't really looking for a challenge in the first place. I was looking for a relaxing and interesting journey. And I got it.			"

												Brothers is one of the most beautiful and elegant games I've played in a long time. The gameworld's stunning, expansive vistas hold equal measures of breathtaking views and clever puzzles, along with a dozen charming little moments of storytelling in each of the game's hidden achievements. The controls are a fascinatingly simple yet challenging ambidextrous controller configuration which manages to keep you strikingly engaged with what both of your characters are doing at any given moment. The story is short, sweet, and wonderfully crafted. The ending made me cry real human tears. This is a marvellous videogame, and it only takes about three hours out of your day to clear it.

												As it stands right now, I was able to beat Brothers in less than 3 and a half hours. A game has to be REALLY REALLY good to be that short and still hold a reccomendation from me at a market price of 15 dollars, but yet here I am, with two thumbs up for this artistic masterpiece of a game. From a gameplay standpoint, Brothers is quite simple at the basic level - no puzzles were too advanced and the platforming is simple and doesn't require any button presses. Where the golden mechanic lies is the fact that you control the brothers simultaneously, a feat achieved by assigning a brother to one stick of a joypad (which is mandatory for play). While disorienting at first, eventually you pick up the pace and find it an enjoyable and innovative mechanic to work cooperatively with... yourself. Very ingenious. But where the game lacks in length and puzzles, it REEAAAALLLY picks up in atmosphere, visuals, and story. To begin, the story is just that two sons are finding a liquid that will restore their sick dad's health, by following a map. Yeah, not much there, but it's interesting in that the entire story is conveyed without a single line of dialouge, but rather with hand gestures and the context of the envrionment. What I find best about the atmosphere is that it is beautiful, one of the most beautiful platofrmers since Trine 2 (which I found really enticing). I found myself staring at the villages, dark forests, snowy mountaintops, and rainy rivers simply for their aesthetic value, not really for their gameplay. The atmosphere is only further enhanced by a somber and dramatic soundtrack, which always accomponies the narrative in a guiding way and really caps off the sad ending. Overall, I'd recomend it if you are in the mood for a short but magnificently beautiful work of art, perhaps one of the most mature video games on the market as we speak.			"

												""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" shows video games can reach the level of art. The mechanics are the gameplay and the story itself. The game has no need for shoehorned quests or NPC's to dole out backstory. You simply play it, and the world emerges as you go. The game is extremely easy, but that doesn't necessarily detract from it in any way. This is not the sort of game you would play if you want a challenge.

												Mechanics as metaphor and visual storytelling at its best. This tale is accompanied by a sweeping score and numerous visual motifs that come full circle by the time you hit the credits; a true work of art. Your hands may be a little confused at first, but once they start to work together as a unit, you'll draw that correlation to the brothers - and then they'll be one and the same.

												After been hinted by it of Totalbiscuit, I decided to buy it last year. After seeing Totalbiscuit and [AReV]BavarianGod and having them already pointing out their arguments in their respected videos, I wondered if any review would be adding any additional insight. So after some thinking, I thought: lets discuss what the game did for me.To me, the game was a joyous experience, with a twist. Due to the tone of the game being about hefty themes like love, companionship and fear. The hefty themes suggest that the game wants to have those themes be taken very seriously, and for me it did, though not in the extend it happened to the previous mentioned people.One note should go to my favorite (and often overlooked) part of a game is sound: Though it forgoes the use of speech, Brothers does a damn fine job to fill up this gap by using gibberish talks, hand and feet communication and an awesome soundtrack (which you should buy btw) to provide the wholesale immersion.This game felt like a game again, not someone who has set some knobs regarding which few game mechanics should be in a game, press 'create' and voila: a triple-a title.No, this game seperates itself from that, in which it succeeds really well: its gameplay really let you immerse into the world, even though you're not seeing it from a first person view.All in all, I think that this game is for people who dare step off their beloved franchise game, try a single game and find this one.Ups:+ Good Narritive+ Heartfelt Story+ Unique Game mechanics+ SOUND!+ MUSIC!Downs:- Short Story- Difficulty			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is basically Ico, except you control both Ico and Yorda at the same time. It features similarly well-designed puzzles that utilize an impressively intuitive control scheme as you run through a world that manages to tell a completely wordless story.I haven’t tried to play this game with a keyboard but I probably wouldn’t recommended it. On a 360 pad you control each brother with one analog stick, and each trigger serves as an “interact” button for each of them. Through this, Brothers puts you through what is every bit the classic adventure game in the Ico, Another World, and Prince of Persia tradition.Each brother has different abilities -- the older brother is stronger and can swim but the younger brother can fit in smaller places. Through this, Brothers manages to give you puzzles that are surprisingly ingenious despite not being very complex. None of the puzzles took me more than a few seconds to work out, but at the same time none of them felt stupid. I’m still not sure how Starbreeze struck that balance. You can see a similar balance in the storyline.The game’s Sims-style gibberish manages to communicate that two brothers -- one in the midst of adolescence and the other reaching the end of childhood, must go on a quest to find a legendary medicine for their ailing father. There’s a lot of other interesting and well-told stuff in there as the brothers meet ever-wilder characters on their journey.Similar to Team Ico’s games, Brothers also takes you through environments that immediately feel like they have stories of their own, like the aftermath of a battlefield or the wake of a natural disaster. Furthermore, the game doesn’t even tell you the full story of what’s transpired in front of you, it just let’s you infer things.The art direction in Brothers serves all these environments and characters well despite it being quite modest in the technical area -- no fancy effects or anything and the system requirements don’t list any recommended settings, only minimum. Everything is in a sort of round, chunky aesthetic which seems to play to the Unreal 3 Engine’s strengths similarly to Gears of War 3.Brothers is a very tightly-put-together little adventure game that hits the hallmarks of what it’s probably trying to evoke: inspired fairy-tale locales, smart-but-intuitive gameplay, and an emotional storyline that doesn’t rely too much on cut scenes or any text, though the whole game will last you no more than three hours.

												It was famously said that ""[y]ou'd be hard pressed to find 10 games better [than Brothers] this year"" and it was lauded by some as the best game they’ve ever played but I went into Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons with a fair dose of scepticism.What started as a confusing system of solo cooperative play turned into a master class of environmental storytelling as I followed the titular brothers’ quest to find a cure for their stricken father. The journey that started in a quintessential village quickly gave way to the fantastical; each new area tells a story of its own through its presentation and together they are woven into the lore of this new world to explore.Not approaching the game as a puzzle or adventure game greatly enhances the experience. It felt more akin to an 3 hour epic. While it has some minor issues that I can’t mention without spoiling the game, I enjoyed the game overall and would highly recommend it. The last 30 minutes is when the magic happens.PS: play with a gamepad			"

												If you're looking for a quick game to play, get Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. It works best with a controller, but can be played with a keyboard. The gist of it is that you control two brothers simultaneously to solve puzzles and complete action sequences. It gets awfully clever on you, and there are only very minimal cues in the game. That is, it rarely tells you what buttons you need to press. In fact, you've only got the movement controls for each brother and a button to make each of them separately interact with stuff in the environment. There's dialogue but it's audible only in gibberish and only serves to convey character emotion and build on the personalities of the cast. Through the journey you come to know the characters by the quirky way you control them, i.e. you'll probably end up paying more attention to one brother, while the other larks off in some other direction (keeping track of two characters at once is deceptively difficult.) It's only a few hours long, but the price is right. It's almost criminal that during the last steam sale I was able to get it for something like $2.50. Normal price $15, it's actually on sale for $7.50 right now. Get it.			"

												7/10A very short interactive story unfolds as two brothers explore a linear landscape with a few scenic stopping points along the way.The various elements come together nicely - the world is well realised, the game wonderfully directed, and the storyline will surprise you. The puzzle/platforming gameplay is fairly sparse, so it rarely provides a gameplay challenge. This can be completed in 3 hours and doesn't have much replay value beyond achievement hunting or showing to friends. Pick it up during a sale one day as it's a nice change fom the norm.			"

												I dont know whether whimsical thumbstick adventure is a genre or a thing or whatever, but to say that Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is just that would be an injustice towards the title. Its minimalistic yet rich storytelling draws children of all ages in and while it offers little replay value and only lasts for an afternoon, it still qualifies as a gem. Lush, vibrant summits surround the two brothers gone on a quest to heal their father. The puzzles are pretty simplistic and the only initial difficulty will probably be struggling to teach your brain which thumb is which character, but the streamlined journey is less about overcoming challenges and more about watching the plot unfold.BUY it if you:- Own a controller- Value storytelling and polished art direction over all other aspects of a game - Would like an indie (alternative) structure with a high-end art direction.DO NOT BUY it if:- You expect long hours out of every dollar you spend on games.- You cannot abide a lack of replay value / violence / difficult puzzles- Your eyes may feel abused and slightly inflamed after exposure to Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. This may especially be a problem if you wear contact lenses or big horse blinkers. Ask your video game dealer to suggest some less visually demanding entertainment immediately.			"

												This game... oh my god....I have cried out my heart soul and mind. I have never expirenced a game so emotional in my life. Theres fun moments, funny moments, scary moments, and sad moments. all blended in this amazing game. It will take you on a emotional roller coaster. For a very short game, it has alot. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete. Its real easy, litterally only use four buttons for the entire game. the left analog stick to move the big brother and the LT button to interact. The right analog stick to move the little brother and RT button to interact. Thats it! Litterally! throughout the entire game your using only thoes simple four controls. And I belive they did this so the player can focus more on the story. I would not reccomend this to people who have lost a family member unless your able to handel it. Cause the stuff thats on here is pretty touching. Other then that. This is a pretty extrodinary game and you should just buy it right now its well worth $15 bucks. Enjoy the ride!			"

												Great game. It's only 3 hours of gameplay, but the storytelling is good. No text to read, no narrators, even no English! Let your imagination play part to interpret the story. Gameplay is unique: although at first it might be difficult to move and act both brothers at the same time, after some time it's just easy to do. Controller is recommended, although keyboard will do just fine.Be prepared to get emotionally bound with the brothers. Don't play using walkthrough. Achievements are optional, you won't get it if you just follow the normal path, so explore some more.			"

												Plot/setting: This game places you in the shoes of two brothers who take it upon themselves to find a cure for their father. This adventure will take them across a vast land filled with various kinds of fantasy characters and settings. The story and setting are absolutely the main attractions of this game. The plot  starts off as the run of the mill story, but once the game gets going you will run into some interesting situations that makes this game what it is. One gripe I had early on is that all of the characters speak in some sort of gibberish, and while the animations of the characters convey their feelings adequately it can feel like you are missing out. That said the lack of actual dialogue grew on me and I actually prefer it.Gameplay/constrols: This game is unique as you control both brothers using a stick and bumper button for each brother. This is the reason a controller is highly recommended for playing. I did not try using KB and mouse so I cannot compare, but I imagine it is difficult. For the most part the control scheme works with only the occasional mixup in my coordination of controlling the brothers. The game is filled with puzzles that consist of one borther using one strength to do one task like fitting through small areas and the other brother pulling big heavy levers. There are also some puzzles and platforming aspects that require both brothers to work together. Overall the puzzles will not be challenging at all, but they are entertaining nonetheless.Length/replayability: This game is very short and only clocks in at around 3 hours. There are no sidequests, only little interactions with the world you can have; most of which are acheivements. Once you have completed the game and got all of te acheivements though there will be no reason to replay this game for a long time.Overall: The price of $15 for this game is steep considering it's length, but despite that I absolutely recommened this game especially if it is on sale.

And that's how their adventure begins.Both brothers have different personalities, which you can see for yourself when you interact with the both of them.The scenaries are beautiful. Every so often, there's a bench that the brothers can sit and take a minute to absorb the breath-taking view before them.The brothers help and get help from creatures they met on their adventures too.Would recommend this game to everyone.

												Brothers is one of the most beautiful and elegant games I've played in a long time. The gameworld's stunning, expansive vistas hold equal measures of breathtaking views and clever puzzles, along with a dozen charming little moments of storytelling in each of the game's hidden achievements. The controls are a fascinatingly simple yet challenging ambidextrous controller configuration which manages to keep you strikingly engaged with what both of your characters are doing at any given moment. The story is short, sweet, and wonderfully crafted. The ending made me cry real human tears. This is a marvellous videogame, and it only takes about three hours out of your day to clear it. Pick it up when you've got the chance.			"

While not required, it will keep you immersed in the world from beginning to end. Besides, the game is not that long so most people who can set aside 3 hours will have it done in that time.If you are not the type of person to play a game for the story of it then perhaps you might find the puzzles too simple or whatever but the story is decent enough that most people would love it provided they enjoy story telling. This game is one of the best adventure games I have played and I cannot recommend it enough it is worth the price tag for such a unique experience. "

												I was extremely surprised as to just how much I would like this game. Ever since it was released I was interested in getting it, now that I have it I don't regret it in the slightest. It's not extremely difficult to play, the controls kind of take some time to get use to. I would HIGHLY recommend using a controller for this game. You have to control both characters the big brother with the left analog stick/left trigger and the younger brother with the right analog/right trigger. The way you control the two characters to get through the puzzles gradually gets more... intricate. It is a pretty entertaining game. Usually when I start off playing a new game like this I only play it to try it out but I started it and haven't put it down yet. The graphics aren't bad at all and i find myself enjoying the scenery. They speak... sim type language.. so you kind of have to interpret whats going on but its not too difficult to figure out. I'm not sure if I would have liked more dialog in this game or not, probably not. I think it would subtract from the actual experience of the game. If you haven't played this game and have even the slightest interest in trying it out, I would highly suggest you do so.			"

												Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this.An emotional journey of two brothers that you control at the same time. Controls might feel a bit weird to get used to at first but the game never becomes enough challenging to frustrate you. That could be the only downside of this overall great (but short!) experience, as it is more about the journey and the narrative than some deeper gameplay mechanics. That does not mean that gameplay doesn't exist and at times it shows some nice creativity in the ways the brothers continue with their quest. But it is obvious that the game aims to move you emotionally and does a great job and with no words uttered in its entirety! Oh and it's also as fun as Grave of the Fireflies. "

												I don't speak Swedish, but without understanding a word, Brothers left me with lingering emotions long after I completed the game. Brothers is mechanically simple - the puzzles aren't very difficult and there aren't any complex gimmicks. The story is straightforward and progresses at an easy pace. The primary reason for playing this game is the story anyway. It's more than just the plot, I think, that made the largest impact on me and made it stick. The little details peppered throughout the levels tell stories on their own (i.e. complete the achievements!). The landscapes are utterly gorgeous (reminds me of The Lord of the Rings, actually), and vivid as well. It's a game worth playing but don't expect to just casually burn through it like any other - this is one to savor for the details and the storytelling. Highly recommended.			"

It was a bit hard to play all game with Steam Controller, Xbox or PS controllers could be easier because of 2 sticks, one for each brother.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, is stunningly beautiful. In my opinion, it is one of the best examples of video games as an art form. The gameplay is simple and quick; it is only a few short hours, but is well worth the journey. The story is masterfully crafted and powerful. The music is phenominal and full of emotion. The graphics are exquisite. This game was a real treat. An experience. I would recommend it to anyone that can appreciate any of the qualities I've mentioned.			"

												I was skeptical. I had hear quite a few things about this game so I finally decided to pick it up and give it a shot. To be honest, I went in with low expectations. Boy was I wrong. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, tells an incredibly powerful story of two bothers who go out seeking a special cure for their father, who has fallen ill, and it tells this story all without the characters saying a single word. With stunning visuals, interesting game mechanics, and an attention grabbing storyline, I highly recommend this game.			"

												A beautiful platformer.Brothers- A Tale of two sons is a 3D platformer developed by starbreeze studios. The story is simple, yet it is conveyed perfectly. You play as two brothers who are tasked to retrieve some medicine for their sick dying father. In order to do so, they will have to cross giant bridges, bloody graveyards, giant oceans and meet a variety of colourful characters. Through out the story you will feel a variety of emotions including joy, happiness, wonder, fear, amazement and sadness. There is no voice acting in the game, and honestly there doesn't need to be as you can understand what the characters are saying through their actions. The game will last you 3 hours or a bit more if you want to collect all achievements and explore a bit. There isn't much replayability to be had here.Gameplay revolves around a mix between platforming and puzzle solving. Bearing in mind that you NEED A CONTROLLER to play this game, the controls are quite good. You control the movement of one brother with the left analogue stick and another with the right stick. It might seem tricky at first, trying to control both the brothers at the same time, but after a while you will get the hang of it.The graphics are cartoony and good to look at. The lighting does a great job at making the colours more attractive to the eye. There are also p[enty of scenes that look so good that you want to take  screenshot of as well.I highly recommend this game to people you want to a rememberable adventure with a few platforming and puzzles thrown in.

												*me screaming at game* HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?*ahem*Okay, let me give this game a more satisfactory review.(Mild spoilers below)When I was a film student in college, my film professor loved hammering in this idea to his students: sound is everything. And lack thereof. He prefers silent films for this reason: visual storytelling should not rely on sound to create the story. Sound should be a suppliment to that story, not a crutch. And, when done right, the right sound effects in the right place can drastically heighten emotional impact.Good sound design is one of those things that often goes unnoticed in film and game critique. And Brothers has good sound design. The lack of understandable dialogue actually makes the story better because it forces us to discern the story from simple action alone. Oftentimes I found myself rationalizing the actions of the brothers and other NPCs by determining their emotions from their actions. Such as the crying forest giant- context allowed me to discern that someone he loved was gone. That was just one example of many I found myself thinking as I played the game. Don't give your audience 4: give them 2+2. Let them figure it out. That's why this game doesn't need dialogue.The music only has a discernable melody and composition when in emotionally intense situations. Otherwise, it is atmospheric, indecipherable sounds. This is effective because if a musician relies too much on bombarding our senses with fantastic melodies at all times, we will not be able to appreciate a moment when it truly calls for some riveting emotions. So, when you're just wandering the land, accomplishing small tasks, the music remains quiet, pensive, and ambient. When something big is going on... it's spine-chilling. Contrast is everything!The sound effects are immersive because they draw from the environment, and you can often hear things coming before you see them. This is effective because when you are traveling around in real life, out in the woods or even on city streets, oftentimes you will hear things before you see them coming. This is something we have tended to take for granted, but you can tell this was intentionally designed in the game.Of course, the art direction was gorgeous. I especially love the fact that the characters are not rendered in an attempt for photorealism like many triple A titles these days. You simply don't need that. Stylized, abstracted forms are more pleasing to the eye IMO. Attempting photorealistic characters in a video game is just too uncanny valley for my tastes. The *colors*, man. The light and shadows. The composition. It's a visual masterpiece. And the ending. I don't have to explain why it's so chilling and amazing. What are you waiting for... buy this game!			"

												Though the overall gameplay is thin, the story that is told and the way that it is portrayed is very good. It has an ending that you might not expect, and even though it still has some gamey feel to it (such as respawns at checkpoints if you die), that's a minor quibble on an otherwise excellent game.I'm usually not much of an adventure game, but the environments are so grand and the exploration element so tight that I can honestly recommend this to those like me who might otherwise pass it over.

												Okay so I played this game with my sister playing for the younger brother and I can honestly say I enjoyed it much more that way than I was when I had started off trying to play it alone. Of course, my lack of a controller did make things difficult, but I would still recommend using another person to play this game. While I did find the game itself to be somewhat linear and guided at times, that didn't really take away too much from the experience overall. The puzzles were entertaining, and there were moments of excitement, and interest. The game itself looks beautiful and the attention to detail by the developers makes the game feel satisfying. Do not buy this game expecting there to be addictive qualities or pleasing accomplishments, buy this game because the story of it is just flawless. It is definitely not replayable, and the 4 hours it took were well worth it. But by all means wait for it to go on sale, I bought it for $3			"

												Hello everyone, my name is TreeTon! Before you read my review, please check out my YouTube channel!(You will be able to find there the full game footage!)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnptJcpeO8cQIrbRgaAamASome people have commented that the game doesn't worth its price; however, I have to disagree with their opinion, even though I have purchased the game when it was on sale! The game is great, and the main future of the game is that the player allowed to use two protagonists (brothers) at the time! Making a fictional language was the best idea of the developers, because the player is able to make his own story by understing the game the way he sees it. The story itself is great, and the game is not that long (about 3-4hrs), but believe me, it will be the best 3-4hrs of your life! The game is very unpredictable, because it is almost impossibe to say what is going to happen in the future, and the ending is very shocking.I would like to say special thanks to the developers for giving me the opportunity to play this game and especially to record it! Thanks for reading my review, and please, take a look at my channel! "

												Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons is a beautifully crafted journey of Naiee (Little brother) and Naia (Elder brother) to find a cure to their fathers disease. This game is full of wonder and the growing companionship of the brothers in the journey. Even without understanding anything that the people say, the emotions and situations are greatly expressed thru the brothers reaction, music and visuals. Even though the game is short, it makes for an amazing experience and an even better one if shared with someone you care about.All in all this game is something that you will love if you see someone in your life as your brother or sister (or simply just very important). The visuals are fantastic, the music is on par with the feeling of danger or discovery and the voice acting (though in a language you wont understand) will convey you to experience many emotions.IMHO- This game (although short) is something that you should play. It was an amazing experience to play and share it.9/10			"

												This game felt very complete to me. It was not particularly complex in any of its aspects, the individual challenges were very straightforward, the music was appropriate yet inconspicuous, and the dialogue (intentionally unintelligible) was also consciously, and sparingly included, but all of the aspects were synthesized perfectly. I was quite impressed with both the art and the controls, but more than anything, this game is about the story and the emotional connection to the characters. This game focuses on experiences that everyone has experienced and is concerned with expressing those experiences honestly, rather than ideally. I have to say it is one of my games of the year (though I probably play fewer games than many) and I highly recommend it to everyone.			"

												This game. This game is one of my all-time favorites.  Not only does it have breathtaking artwork and scenery, flawless character design, and quirky humor, but it also has moments that inspire sheer wonder. One moment you're flying on the back of a gryphon, another you're reuniting trolls, but all the while the game makes you feel as if you truly are a part of the experience. I often found myself talking to Big Brother and Little Brother as if I was both of them in one being; when one was in trouble, I assumed the role of the other. The game pulled my hopes so far up that I truly thought nothing could go wrong. I won't spoil any endings, but having just completed this game moments ago I find myself unable to function. This was the first time that I ended a game crying. This game is very truly a 10/10.			"

												Plot/setting: This game places you in the shoes of two brothers who take it upon themselves to find a cure for their father. This adventure will take them across a vast land filled with various kinds of fantasy characters and settings. The story and setting are absolutely the main attractions of this game. The plot  starts off as the run of the mill story, but once the game gets going you will run into some interesting situations that makes this game what it is. One gripe I had early on is that all of the characters speak in some sort of gibberish, and while the animations of the characters convey their feelings adequately it can feel like you are missing out. That said the lack of actual dialogue grew on me and I actually prefer it.Gameplay/constrols: This game is unique as you control both brothers using a stick and bumper button for each brother. This is the reason a controller is highly recommended for playing. I did not try using KB and mouse so I cannot compare, but I imagine it is difficult. For the most part the control scheme works with only the occasional mixup in my coordination of controlling the brothers. The game is filled with puzzles that consist of one borther using one strength to do one task like fitting through small areas and the other brother pulling big heavy levers. There are also some puzzles and platforming aspects that require both brothers to work together. Overall the puzzles will not be challenging at all, but they are entertaining nonetheless.Length/replayability: This game is very short and only clocks in at around 3 hours. There are no sidequests, only little interactions with the world you can have; most of which are acheivements. Once you have completed the game and got all of te acheivements though there will be no reason to replay this game for a long time.Overall: The price of $15 for this game is steep considering it's length, but despite that I absolutely recommened this game especially if it is on sale.

												I recommend that you subject yourself to this game, because its like come along once in a very long time, and usually on consoles.Visually stunning and with a soundtrack that is perfectly pitched to compliment those visuals, Brothers is an amazing game from a purely technical perspective. That doesn't really matter however.Brothers is an amazing tale, conveyed almost without words in a way reminiscent of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. The charazterization of the characters is also in itself simple, but strong. You will love these brothers and sympathize with their struggle just as you'll stand amazed at the detail and imagination invested into this fictional world, and that's part of the tragedy. The game KNOWS what you think it is. It knows what you expect. It's masterfully directed and built to get you emotionally invested in its story.Saying any more than that would spoil the surprises you'll have along the way, but fair warning: the game is not a happy-go-lucky fairy tale and it will shock you, scare you and ultimately make you cry your soul out.10/10.

It requires holding onto 2 keys for over 1 minute just to get through while on the controller, there is a way to accelerate it. (You will know what Im talking about once you reach the area where you have to crank up the lift for the cart.)Still worth it despite that little flaw.			"

All characters you meet on on your journey are well fleshed out and they have an own backstory that you can find out by playing attention to the environment which you should do since there are also some non-mandatory minor side quests. Gameplay wise it's pretty well done in terms of controlling two characters, the puzzles were all pretty easy but had nice variety. A short but fantastic experience. Highly recommended.			"

												A nice looking platformer. Pretty landscapes. Colourful graphics. Might get the kids to play it. That's what I thought when I saw this game. I was wrong. Yes, this game looks fantastic and plays well. Some beautiful landscapes and scenery. But this game is DARK! I mean that in a good way, but don't let the cutesy look of it fool you. I was pleasantly suprised. It's a brilliantly realised fantasy world (that I hope Starbreeze will visit again). The game mechanic of controlling 2 characters at once is challenging enough and doesn't get cumbersome. The game is a nice length, a lot of fun to play, and the story has heart. It really doesn't pull any punches. Only downside is the PC version seems to be very glitchy. I had to restart a couple of chapters to get around potentially game-breaking bugs. But I think only a minority of people have had these issues. This game is well worth investing a few hours in.			"

There's a certain atmosphere here that begs you to stay even once you've beaten it.

												Brothers is a neat game that uses nothing but a stick and a trigger, each pair controlling each brother independently.  Gameplay is comprised of platforming and some coop style puzzles.  None of it is difficult in the least but it has a small sense of satisfaction I guess.  The people who play a game for art style and story is where this game is at home.  Overall it's an ok game and worth a playthrough if you get it on sale.  Doesnt have a lot of replay value in my opinion and the story only took me ~2.5 hours.  But it has some neat gameplay elements and the art style is neat.			"

												Wow, was not expecting that! I picked this up in a sale for $3 and even though its short the experience is easily worth $20. I finished it in 3.3 hours but was captivated from the start until the end. The art style is absolutely gorgeous and at certain points in the game there are benches where you can sit and just look at the beautiful vistas and usually get an overview of where you'll be heading next.With a control scheme that works perfectly there's no need for any HUD elements so you can totally immerse yourself in the game. Auto-save system worked well. The puzzles aren't going to strain your brain but they're fun enough to work out. Controller rumble effects are used sparingly and are saved for moments that suit the effect.Sound effects are decent and the musical score fits well to enhance what's happening in the game at any moment. I think the decision to have the dialogue is in what I assume is a made up tongue actually benefits the story as everything else comes together so well that you know what they're saying even though you don't know what they're saying.Solid 9/10Note: A controller is not technically required but playing on keyboard is a much lesser experience. Basically, if you already have a controller; buy this game.If you don't have a controller, buy one, then buy this game.			"

												This game had a lot to live up to - if it's near perfect reviews weren't enough, the fact that it'd touch on such a personal and subjective experience as brotherhood left me doubting that it could live up to it's name.The core of the game revolves around two brothers, that set out in search for an elixer that will save their father from a deadly illness. While this seems like a rather weak call to action, the world really is so beautiful that you won't care. A playthrough lasts about three hours, and the story really flourishes in the second half of the game, once you've had time to get your head around the mechanics.The brothers are unique and lovingly crafted, each with his own personality and flaws. And the world itself cuts no corners; reminiscient of the beautiful (and sometimes dark) lands of fairy tales that we grew up with.If you're on the fence, don't be.

												Buy? Likely. I was convinced to buy this game thanks to TotalBiscuit - I didn't know this game existed until I saw his video. Is this a great showpiece of gaming that made me cry? Honestly, no. I didn't cry. Whether that's the fault of the game or if I'm too emotionally unresponsive is impossible for me to answer, but you do have a good story based puzzler with a clever mechanic of controlling two characters with a separate analogue stick and trigger. I don't think that the tale alone of a random father who is on his deathbed thanks to an undescribed condition as well as the ending is enough to make me cry - gaming has desensitized me to death.There is some gameplay contrivance, such as why is there a funky, switch activated bridge just to get to one family's house? Puzzles are cleverly implemented in my opinion, but all are simple to solved - you'll rarely if ever be stumped. This game has plenty of photogenic moments as shown by my screenshot library, and this can be completed by most around 3 hours. It's arguably pretentious, but I don't think it's trying to force some abstract artistic or literary vision.Brothers - AToTS looks like something Pixar could do if they weren't limited to doing purely ""Disney friendly"" content. I enjoyed the game, but I was not as moved as many people said - I will no longer let people's fawning over a story experience influence my buying habits.			"

												Brothers is a perfect example of where I think video games should be going. More than anything else, I am incredibly impressed by Brothers' ability to integrate gameplay mechanics and storytelling in such a way that each complement each other. The thing is, despite video games being an interactive medium, few games seem to take full advantage of this fact. I've played games with great mechanics. I've also played games with great stories.  Hell, I've even played games with both great mechanics and great stories. But Brothers is even more than that. What this game manages to do is give emotional weight to gameplay mechanics. By doing this, Brothers takes full advantage of the agency of the player, deepening the emotional bonds produced over a relatively short few hours. I hope developers take a close look at this game.

												If you're reading this, do yourself a favor and just buy Brothers - A tale of Two Sons right now.Brothers, for lack of a better term, is a masterpiece IMHO. Somehow, Brothers delivers an emotional, compassionate story, without a single word of dialogue in the whole game. Charcaters do speak, but their language is Simmilar to Simlish (The Sims) I suppose. Although you cannot understand the language, You will still understand what is going on. You will have to prepare yourself for many emotions throughout the game. I will list a few I've experienced: Sadness, joy, wonder, curiousity, horror, excitement, and despair. Sounds a bit over the top? Well go see for yourself. You may experience emotions you never new existed.Brothers perfectly marries Story with Game Mechanics. The best way i can explain it is that you play the story. Again, for lack of a better term, Brothers is a Singleplayer Co-op game. If you were not aware, You control two Brothers independently using the joysicks of your controller (Provided you use a controller). Contrary to the Notice above, The game will work with a keyboard, But I would not recommend it. Seperately controlling the two siblings, you traverse the game working together. I would not classify Brothers as a Puzzle Platformer, however. It's simply a journey. Which brings me to the final point.Brothers took me roughly 3 hours to complete. I would say there is some replayability, but thats only because there are achievements you will miss and areas you may have skipped. So maybe 5 - 6 hours will be all you get out of Brothers, unless you play through games several times. I know that so few hours may not warrant the price for some people, but I promise you'll remember this game for as long as you live. I know I will.			"

												This is a coming of age tale where two brothers embark on an epic journey to retrieve medicine to save their dying father.The game play is unique because you control both brothers at the same time.  For this reason, the game requires a gamepad an cannot be played with a mouse and keyboard.  Each brother is controlled by an alalog stick and each brother has an action movement that is controlled by a trigger.   It takes a little getting used to controlling two characters with one controller, but since the game play is pretty simple, it's not too difficult to pick up.   The visuals in this game are beautiful and the story is captivating.  And most importantly, the game is fun.Overall, this was a great game and I highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that it's pretty short.  I beat it in about 3 hours. "

												Wow. This game... just wow.Brothers was an absolute joy to play. The largest reason being that Brothers is extremely immersive, connecting the player to the game better than almost any other game I have played. This can be attributed to the unique ""single-player co-op"" mechanic whereby the player uses a single controller to control two in game players. Just as the controller cannot be ripped in part at will, nor can these Brothers. As a player you are connected to the brothers immediately and that connection only becomes stronger over the next two an a half hours as you travel the stunningly beautiful lands, solving puzzles, meeting other creatures, and exploring the world, all in search for the elixir to save your ill father.While the game is short, and the gameplay is very easy, Brothers as an overall experience is beautiful, immersive, heart-wrenching, and pleasurable.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a spare 2-3 hours to dedicate to an extremely impactful and memorable experience.			"

												This sad tale is beautifully rendered with lush graphics and attention to detail.  Brothers is a unique puzzle game because you control two characters on the screen at the same time.  The puzzles aren't extremely difficult but they are fun as you are constantly maneuvering the brothers around the screen to complete tasks.  All of the achievements come from finding extras that were put into the game that don't have to be accomplished to complete the game.  The whole game lasts from 4-5 hours, longer or shorter depending on how much you explore and complete.  I would say get this game and have some fun.			"

												Though people are no longer with us, that does not mean that they are gone forever. We do not need to have the person next to us to have them influence us. And this game portrays that idea perfectly. It is a simple story of two brothers and their journey together to help find a cure for their father. You control one brother with the left thumbstick and the other brother with the right thumbstick. And throughout the journey, they have to rely on each other to get past certain obstacles. The story is very moving and portrays life and death in an interesting way through its cutscenes. The game is not all doom and gloom though. There are many beautiful moments that depict the beauty of life, whether you're stopping a man from committing suicide or reuniting a mother turtle with its children. Although those are optional tasks, it is left to the player to make those decisions and make this tough journey bearable.The game can get a little glitchy from time to time but it left such an impact on me that the negatives did not bother me so much. It is a fairly short game but this is definitely something that is going to stick with you.			"

												I have seen and read reviews about this game that give credit to how this game uses the controller in a ingenious way but I have been, for some reason, sceptical about how a controller could be used in a ""ingenious way"" in a game. Now, after completing the game, I understood what they meant and I can only agree. Without saying too much I must at least say that this is one of the most cleverest ways to actually make the controller a part of the game and it's story to the point where it made an emotional impact on me.Although I got to admit that the controls can be confusing for the brain at times but it only caused me problem at one point in the game.In short: Brilliant use of the controller, touching story and beautiful landscapes to visually explore.Highly recommending buying this for a 3-4 hour experience.

												This game is completely amazing. Don't read or watch anything about it, just set aside 3 hours and play through the whole thing. The controls remain somewhat difficult throughout since you use each thumbstick to control a different person (you need a 360 controller) but that should not get in the way of playing through this fantastic game. The music, story, art, and gameplay (even with control difficulties) are all superb, unique, and beautiful. Gameplay is mostly simple to moderate platforming puzzles with unique twists throughout. Nothing is given time to get old or repetitive due to great variety to gameplay and scenery, and the relatively short length. Just play it.			"

Posted: November 3, 2013
												An incredibly powerful short story about 2 brothers on a quest through a dangerous and fantastic land to find a magic water with healing powers that can save their dying father.The mechanics play just as big a part in the story as the story itself.The design is nothing short of masterful. Every new puzzle is simple yet never easy and always rewarding to complete. Challenges are explained without the use of specific audio or textual direction; only pantomime and vocal tones without the use of a dechiperable language. I do think I knew the brothers' names by the end of the story, only because throughout the game each brother calls out to the other ever so often, each always repeating a specific word (similar to how you as a player come to grasp the name of the hero's horse in Shadow of the Colossus). Every dangerous situation with a new puzzle mechanic had always already been taught to the player in a safe sandbox area so that they are always prepared for when a situation called to re-use that mechanic in an unsafe part of the world. Never was anything similar to what you might call a ""modern tutorial"" was ever needed.One particular moment near the end of the game must be recognized. In this moment, the designers pull off one of the most amazing feats of creative direction I've ever seen. There is a very specific set of challenges with an ostensibly new mechanic that is not explicitly explained in the ways most of the previous ones have been... but the designers know from your experiences in the game, you will naturally try to solve it in a very specific way. To ""count on"" a player to not only figure something like this out but to also grasp WHY they made this decision usually is a bad idea or requires a tutorial or some sort of cookie to let you know why some choice was made, but in this specific instance, the magic moment you understand what was trying to be done would have been shattered if you were not given the chance to figure it out yourself.This might sound a bit confusing, but that moment, even if you aren't worried about spoilers, is indeed a hard moment to explain. I hate to refer to a specific trope often used for hyperbole, but the only comparison I can think of in a similar medium is that of trying to explain what ""The Matrix"" is. No one can show you what it is, you just have to see and experience it for yourself to understand it. That near-end game scene in Brothers is like that. Someone explaining it to you won't impact you the same as experiencing it.To those planning on playing this masterpiece, do NOT read anything about this game's story or watch any playthroughs. The game will always challenge you to think, but will never prove frustrating. And the best part of it is discovering the answers to the questions it asks you on your own. Looking up anything on it will surely lessen your experience. The achievements should be discovered and completed naturally as you play. I recommend holding off trying to follow any walkthroughs or guides in an effort to conquer every single one of the game's hidden side quests until after you complete the game at least once.Speaking as someone who has an older half-brother, and a younger brother, if you have any siblings, you need to play this. You will be moved beyond words.Oh, and buyers who tend to collect and not play, don't let this sit on your ""wall of shame"" either. It's really short. Only about 3 hours to complete. Set aside a few hours and do it all in 1 or 2 sittings. It is an important game that marks a point in gaming history when designers were able to evoke a feeling in a way that no other medium could do. Other designers will be talking about and trying to understand and mimic this perfect execution of this moment for years to come.If this still isn't enough to convince you to buy the game, then listen to a much bigger game critic celebrity, TotalBiscuit, call the game ""the best game I've ever played in 25 years.""

												This game had a lot to live up to - if it's near perfect reviews weren't enough, the fact that it'd touch on such a personal and subjective experience as brotherhood left me doubting that it could live up to it's name.The core of the game revolves around two brothers, that set out in search for an elixer that will save their father from a deadly illness. While this seems like a rather weak call to action, the world really is so beautiful that you won't care. A playthrough lasts about three hours, and the story really flourishes in the second half of the game, once you've had time to get your head around the mechanics.The brothers are unique and lovingly crafted, each with his own personality and flaws. And the world itself cuts no corners; reminiscient of the beautiful (and sometimes dark) lands of fairy tales that we grew up with.If you're on the fence, don't be. It's one of the best three hour experiences that you can have for under five dollars. Buy this now and play it through like a movie. You definitely won't regret it.			"

												This is a coming of age tale where two brothers embark on an epic journey to retrieve medicine to save their dying father.The game play is unique because you control both brothers at the same time.  For this reason, the game requires a gamepad an cannot be played with a mouse and keyboard.  Each brother is controlled by an alalog stick and each brother has an action movement that is controlled by a trigger.   It takes a little getting used to controlling two characters with one controller, but since the game play is pretty simple, it's not too difficult to pick up.   The visuals in this game are beautiful and the story is captivating.  And most importantly, the game is fun.Overall, this was a great game and I highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that it's pretty short.  I beat it in about 3 hours. "

												Wow. This game... just wow.Brothers was an absolute joy to play. The largest reason being that Brothers is extremely immersive, connecting the player to the game better than almost any other game I have played. This can be attributed to the unique ""single-player co-op"" mechanic whereby the player uses a single controller to control two in game players. Just as the controller cannot be ripped in part at will, nor can these Brothers. As a player you are connected to the brothers immediately and that connection only becomes stronger over the next two an a half hours as you travel the stunningly beautiful lands, solving puzzles, meeting other creatures, and exploring the world, all in search for the elixir to save your ill father.While the game is short, and the gameplay is very easy, Brothers as an overall experience is beautiful, immersive, heart-wrenching, and pleasurable. I highly recommend this game, it is fantastic.Pros:• Well written and rich story. • Simple, elegant presentation.• Stunning visuals.• Extremely immersive controls.Cons:• Graphical fidelity suffers at points, mainly close ups.

												A nice looking platformer. Pretty landscapes. Colourful graphics. Might get the kids to play it. That's what I thought when I saw this game. I was wrong. Yes, this game looks fantastic and plays well. Some beautiful landscapes and scenery. But this game is DARK! I mean that in a good way, but don't let the cutesy look of it fool you. I was pleasantly suprised. It's a brilliantly realised fantasy world (that I hope Starbreeze will visit again). The game mechanic of controlling 2 characters at once is challenging enough and doesn't get cumbersome. The game is a nice length, a lot of fun to play, and the story has heart. It really doesn't pull any punches. Only downside is the PC version seems to be very glitchy. I had to restart a couple of chapters to get around potentially game-breaking bugs. But I think only a minority of people have had these issues. This game is well worth investing a few hours in.			"

												This is a little gem. I wouldn't recommend it for sophisticated or challenging gameplay or it's play time [~3 hours) but it's succeeds on so many other elements, some of them being truly unique. Everything about this game making it fascinating is kind of a spoiler, so I advice you to read and watch as less as possible about it.My only advice without giving anything away would be: Don't rush through the game. Take your time. Let the little brother play some pranks on the village people, be kind to animals and have a rest on a bench once in a while. I wasn't too fond of most of the popular indie titles relying on atmosphere in recent years, but this one catched me totally off guard. Absolut fascinating.			"

There are so many little animations that the studio *didn't have to do*, which I know costs money and is often cut from games... and I adore them for this. The narrative is seamlessly woven into the game mechanics, which makes it deliciously immersive and fun instead of repetitive. This game is set in a gorgeous world. It is short, but it fills you with a sense of childlike wonder and adventure.  Thank you, Starbreeze Studios. Please continue to make beautiful little gems like this. 10/10			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a well tailored adventure, based on the journey two brothers undergo to save their father. Filled with emotions, feels and enthusiasm, this game is best enjoyed in one sitting. The single-player co-op approach, allows you to control both brothers as a single player, from the same control unit (keyboard/mouse or gamepad), eliminating thus the local co-op feature for you and a friend to enjoy. Its stunningly pleasing aesthetics and narrative, emerge the player in a mystical quest through a world inhabited by fantasy, family, and mystery.+ Story rich filled with a vast sphere of emotions+ Control two characters simultaneously+ Clever puzzles integrated into a visually crafted Indie experience+ Easy Achievements- No Co-Op feature- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- Short storylinePersonal Ranking: 8.5/10 "

												To be honest, the first thing that caught my eye was the ability to control two characters at a time. Then after I got the game, I started the game and I have to say the atmosphere and surroundings are simply beautiful accompanied by soothing background music which is relaxing to my ears. There are bits of puzzles here and there to solve as you proceed with the story and fun part sometimes you get to do some mischieve with the little brother, for instance breaking someone's flower pot, ruining someone's garden or ruining a kid's day by throwing her ball away somewhere he/she can't reach. Its fun to be mischievious once in a while~ Although I don't do it IRL but sometimes I am pretty sure I am not the only one who thinks about doing these once in a while >:]Anyways, a short bit about controls. The controls are simple, just movements and one button to interact, BUT it might take a little time to get used to since you are using 2 characters SIMULTANEOUSLY to solve puzzle etc etc. It is not a must to use a controller but you really should as recommended on steam as  it makes controlling a whole lot easier (I tried on the keyboard first, even though its doable its rather hard and unnatural(?) on the fingers). The controls are simple but might take a little time to adapt to but once you get used to it its pretty cool.There's only one problem I have with this game, I can't understand a single word they are saying cause there are no options for subtitles. Still it doesn't change the fact that this is a really good game and you can interpret what they are saying quite easily.If you are someone like me who enjoy games with good atmostpheres, good background music, and a nice steady paced story/plot, this is a game I will recommend to you.

												Wow, was not expecting that! I picked this up in a sale for $3 and even though its short the experience is easily worth $20. I finished it in 3.3 hours but was captivated from the start until the end. The art style is absolutely gorgeous and at certain points in the game there are benches where you can sit and just look at the beautiful vistas and usually get an overview of where you'll be heading next.With a control scheme that works perfectly there's no need for any HUD elements so you can totally immerse yourself in the game. Auto-save system worked well. The puzzles aren't going to strain your brain but they're fun enough to work out. Controller rumble effects are used sparingly and are saved for moments that suit the effect.Sound effects are decent and the musical score fits well to enhance what's happening in the game at any moment. I think the decision to have the dialogue is in what I assume is a made up tongue actually benefits the story as everything else comes together so well that you know what they're saying even though you don't know what they're saying.Solid 9/10Note: A controller is not technically required but playing on keyboard is a much lesser experience. Basically, if you already have a controller; buy this game.If you don't have a controller, buy one, then buy this game.			"

A game, so masterfully crafted, it's breathtaking;Brothers: A tale of two sons puts you in the shoes of two young brothers (hence the name of the game), trying to help their father by finding a cure.You venture out into the mysterious and strange lands, populated by creatures you'd not expect to exist.Brothers is a game made solely for the purpose of telling a good, interesting story, which would be more than good enough to sell as a book.The artwork and music are both ingenius and although the visuals may be outdated, they immerse you anyways.At this point I'd like to point out the following things:This game is ONLY playable via a compatible controller!The visuals are not top notch, please view ingame-screenshots or watch a short video to see, if you're okay with that!The story is VERY short. If you calculate achievement hunting into the mix, you'll barely scratch the 3 hour mark!If you can look past all that, I'd say, that you should go pick it up. Otherwise I'd advise to wait for the game to be in sale!I hope you found my review helpful and that it aided you deciding, wether or not to buy this product!			"

												I held off playing this game for a long time because it claims to require a controller, which I can't stand using most of the time, and because it was published by 505, who published Payday 2 and How to Survive - neither of which I enjoyed.  This game was quite the pleasant surprise, though.  First off, a controller is not required; using a keyboard can be a bit awkward at times, but will work just fine.  Second, unlike How to Survive, there were no game-breaking bugs, meaning I actually got to finish the game, and I'm glad for it.  This was an amazingly innovative platformer with beautiful artistic design and a well-told story.  It's brief, but it doesn't need to be any longer than it is - in fact, trying to stretch things out to pad the length would have hurt the overall experience.  The puzzles aren't too complicated, and are all very logical - the challenge comes in controlling 2 characters at the same time, who need to work together to solve the puzzle.  It's one thing to play a game like Portal 2, where you and a friend have to work together, but having to work both brothers at once takes some getting used to.  It's a completely unique mechanic I don't recall ever seeing before now, and it was a fascinating way to play the game.  The entire story is told without a single line of dialog - there is a language being spoken, but it's gibberish and you're not meant to understand it.  Everything is conveyed via gesture and inflection, the mood is set through the music, and it's all done very well.  It helps that the story is very simple and straigtforward - this game is about the journey, the bonding and the loss, and the spectacle of it all, and to that end it was very well crafted.  I'd say it's definitely worth a playthrough.			"

They had pretty good ideas for the world and the atmosphere changed really well with the music, background details and other things.You go through each area relatively quickly though and it almost feels like just a snapshot of what could have been,At the end I couldn't help but feel this entire game was simply a prologue for a bigger game.  You can see how the little brother develops and becomes stronger both physically and mentally after his elder brother's death, and I sortof thought this game would work as a good prologue story for a story where the little brother grows up to be a hero or something. This is all just personal opinion and has nothing to do with what the developer intended. Ultimately, its a very simple but beautifully made game with alot of heart put into it.			"

												Brothers is a perfect example of where I think video games should be going. More than anything else, I am incredibly impressed by Brothers' ability to integrate gameplay mechanics and storytelling in such a way that each complement each other. The thing is, despite video games being an interactive medium, few games seem to take full advantage of this fact. I've played games with great mechanics. I've also played games with great stories.  Hell, I've even played games with both great mechanics and great stories. But Brothers is even more than that. What this game manages to do is give emotional weight to gameplay mechanics. By doing this, Brothers takes full advantage of the agency of the player, deepening the emotional bonds produced over a relatively short few hours. I hope developers take a close look at this game.

												Brothers is a neat game that uses nothing but a stick and a trigger, each pair controlling each brother independently.  Gameplay is comprised of platforming and some coop style puzzles.  None of it is difficult in the least but it has a small sense of satisfaction I guess.  The people who play a game for art style and story is where this game is at home.  Overall it's an ok game and worth a playthrough if you get it on sale.  Doesnt have a lot of replay value in my opinion and the story only took me ~2.5 hours.  But it has some neat gameplay elements and the art style is neat.			"

I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates beautiful world design and video games as a way to tell profound and deep stories.			"

												Probably one of the best games I have ever played. It brought me right back to my days of playing Fable II on the Xbox due to it's beautiful art design. The story itself is a very good one, but I often found myself staring at the environment instead. Everything about this game is amazing. There's a certain atmosphere here that begs you to stay even once you've beaten it. Each area you go in the game is unique from the one you were last in and it causes you to spend atleast five minutes looking around just so you can soak in what the weather and biome is like.			"

												Modern videogames struggle with the idea of marrying gameplay to narrative. More often than not, modern game stories end up feeling very detached from the core gameplay elements, making the overall experience feel unbalanced. Brothers manages to avoid this pitfall, leading by example and making its control scheme an  entirely integral piece of the overall narrative. Rarely does Brothers ever rip control away from the player for a flashy cutscene. You're free to experience the game's world, full of breath takingly beautiful and surreal sights and positively gorgeous musical cues, at your own pace. The size and scope of Brothers' adventure is astonishing in and of itself. There's an honest sense of childlike wonder and fairy tale adventure seeping out of every locale and setpiece the game offers, and you're often encouraged to take your time and let the world and characters around you breathe, as evidenced by all the game's achievements being tied to simply exploring the world. Without ever saying a comprehendable word in any language at all, Brothers is able to communicate all it needs to the player without ever resorting to dialog boxes or tutorials. The world around you and characters' interactions with one another always provides enough context for you to know what's going on or what you need to do next. As trite and silly as it may seem to say, Brothers is one of the truest examples of how to create expressive and emotionally engaging interactive fiction without sacrificing either side of the equation. Wholeheartedly recommended.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a well tailored adventure, based on the journey two brothers undergo to save their father. Filled with emotions, feels and enthusiasm, this game is best enjoyed in one sitting. The single-player co-op approach, allows you to control both brothers as a single player, from the same control unit (keyboard/mouse or gamepad), eliminating thus the local co-op feature for you and a friend to enjoy. Its stunningly pleasing aesthetics and narrative, emerge the player in a mystical quest through a world inhabited by fantasy, family, and mystery.+ Story rich filled with a vast sphere of emotions+ Control two characters simultaneously+ Clever puzzles integrated into a visually crafted Indie experience+ Easy Achievements- No Co-Op feature- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- Short storylinePersonal Ranking: 8.5/10 "

One of the most touching games out there.One of the most beautiful,touching and relaxing video games out there.Brothers-A Tale of Two Sons is a co-op adventure game wich is played by a single person,simultaneously controlling the two characters.The game itself is not very long,but it's totally worth it.Here are the things I liked the most about the game.The visual style is very appealing and colourful.Great soundtrack and little bit of humor.A story that is not complicated at all,but will leave you sad for eternity. :DThe two characters have different skills wich you often have to combine to traverse trough the level.Puzzles wich are hardly challengeing,but fun to solveFive or six environments through wich you travel,all very different than the previous one.Although the controls are not very bad on keyboard I strongly recommend playing with a controller,your expirience will be much better.These are the things I liked the most.The game is fantastic and although small,I'll always remember it as one of the best games I've played.

												Clocked in at about 2,5 hours. A very sad game, not fit for the weak-willed like me. Some sad moments, some scary, some happy and some thrilling. This game is best played in a dark room all alone a lonely night, that's all I can say.Beautiful graphics so I recommend playing on a higher-end PC for the full immersion. +Beautiful graphics+Cute little story+Appropriately short game length (IMO)+Simple game, not a lot of thought is needed gameplay-wise.-Annoying voice acting (it can get a bit repetitive)-Annoying controls. The idea of using the two joysticks is cool but it gets a bit clunky. (I'm looking at you underwater and flying scenes...)Definitely Recommend. Picked it up for 1.20€ during the sale so can't really complain about anything.			"

												This was a fairly enjoyable game.The story is nice and simplistic.The speech is mainly random gibberish but the actions makes what their saying obvious and the characters are actually portrayed quite well and there is even a little bit of character development.The gameplay and controls is interesting and original, although it is ultimately very simple.I think what really makes the game shine is the story telling and the world itself. They had pretty good ideas for the world and the atmosphere changed really well with the music, background details and other things.You go through each area relatively quickly though and it almost feels like just a snapshot of what could have been,At the end I couldn't help but feel this entire game was simply a prologue for a bigger game.  You can see how the little brother develops and becomes stronger both physically and mentally after his elder brother's death, and I sortof thought this game would work as a good prologue story for a story where the little brother grows up to be a hero or something. This is all just personal opinion and has nothing to do with what the developer intended. Ultimately, its a very simple but beautifully made game with alot of heart put into it.			"

												The good:*  The gameplay is innovative.  Controlling both characters is neat.*  The puzzles are fun, if a bit simple.  *  The world is fantastic and exciting.  Beautiful art and interesting setting.*  For the most part I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen on the next part of their adventure.The bad:*  The main storyline is aweful.  Extremely cliche, and where the designer expects the player to feel emotional impact there is none, because he never bothered to develop the characters in a meaningful way.  The last 15 minutes of the game were painful to paly through because of how forced it felt.  Luckily through most of the game the main story stays out of the way.*  The controls are cludgy when they work, and I had to edit a .ini file burried in the games configs in order for it to use my controller correctly (the left sticks Y was flipped, and the game's built in menus don't have ways to change things like that)*  The game is very slow to start (and slow to end)  The first 15 minutes of the game feel like pointlessly running around a town.*  The game is very short.  All of it high quality but it wont last you very long.Despite my gripes I found the game to be a lot of fun to play, and well worth the price of admission if you can pick it up on sale.  Just don't expect a deep story, and be willing to deal with some wonky controls.  8/10			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure/puzzle game with a unique control scheme, and an outstanding story that is one of the best around. This game is set in a somewhat fantasy world, boasting stunning vistas the brothers adventure forth in. The fantasy nature isn't as heavy as in games that make it a huge focus, since this game is more realistic in its graphical approach with well designed nature scenes. The fantasy elements pop up with some of the things the brothers interact with. Each of the characters are stylized with a less realistic style, but do stand out from the beautiful landscapes. As for the music, there are some instrumental and vocal tracks, but they are sparsely played throughout the game. They do put the mood when a song starts playing, and they do help emphasize some key parts of the story very well.What makes Brothers one of the most well recieved games is its story. This is one of the games you want to have no spoilers before playing. Two brothers, an older and younger brother, must recieve a special healing liquid from the Tree of Life to save their ill father. The story is driven in the game mainly by gestures and actions, as the people in Brothers speak in a fictional language.The other reason that Brothers is a great game is its unique gameplay. Players control both brothers at the same time in a kind of single player co-op game. Each brother can move around in all directions and have a context specific action button, making this game best played with an Xbox 360 controller or equivalent. The brothers mainly explore around and climb things. For some parts, both brothers have to work together in tandem or do specific tasks with each brother. The older brother is stronger and can pull levers and give a boost, while the younger brother can move between bars. The puzzle aspects of this game by using each brother in specific uses is great, along with the general idea of using two characters at once.This game is pretty short though, so expect the game to last about 3-4 hours. The difficulty isn't too hard as most puzzles can be self-explanitory, save for some parts that may be unclear as to what to do. The achievements take some exploring and thinking to complete, but they are optional side quests and not part of the main story.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has its strong story along with a unique control scheme. Well recieved by many to recieve various awards, this game will certainlly enthrall players with a good emotional story and an interesting adventure with puzzles controlling two brothers at once.

												This is a fantastic game but it's quite hard to justify what makes it that good.* The story is decent but not as good as people make it look like. It's simple and it does the job but that's about it.* The controls (I'd recommend a controller) are simple, can be obnoxious at times but you get used to them.* The game is really easy when you get past the controls, there is hardly any challenge and the few challenges you face are quite easy to beat.* The world and graphics are great. No cons here.* The voice acting (they speak in an invented language) can be a bit mediocre at times but it does the job.So why is this game so good? Everything works together and the mediocre elements of this game, since they are so well implemented, instead of dragging the game down make it better. This game wanted to tell a story and everything in the game worked towards that objective.This is trully a different game and a must play.			"

												By far the most the best story-driven game I've ever played. The storytelling is as good as it can get. Even though the characters speak gibberish, their every emotion, intent and action is made clear to the player by the excellent animation and voice acting. The beginning of the story itself might seem a little clichéd, but trust me, it's worth it to see the end.The developers' attention to detail really shows in the level design, optional interactions, cinematic camera movement and the magnificent vistas the game keeps offering you.The gameplay is simple, yet very enjoyable. Despite all the warnings, you DON'T need a controller to play, I had no trouble using a keyboard.The next time someone claims video games are not art, I'm going to show them this game. "

												This is a rather unique game. There is no dialogue really, everything is in another language. The story is told through actions such as pointing, showing objects, nodding etc. The characters and locations are well designed and give a genuine fantasy setting which oozes history and lore. But this isn't really where the game excells, it's the control method and puzzles that shine the most. You control both characters in the story with individual controller sticks and triggers. It can get a little confusing, especially if the characters move across the screen and you get confused about which stick controls which character. That said, the puzzles require you to move each character quite precisely at times, rotating objects held at each end by the two brothers or pushing a lever one way whilst pulling it another. The puzzles aren't hard, they aren't really there to tax the mind but when combined with the control method, it can provide a fun little challenge of timing and precision. The game is a couple of hours long but it's very high quality. Perhaps wait for a sale if you want your money's worth in terms of time spent but if you're looking for a good story and neat little challenge, this is worth the asking price.Some gameplay:

												A masterpiece; that's what Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is.It's emotionally gripping with the storytelling as you watch the two brothers bond while adventuring to find healing water for their ill father. Straight from the beginning, you can tell that this isn't exactly a game suited for kids, as you watch your mother drown to her death in flashback cutscene, when the younger son, Naiee tragically tried to save her, but isn't able to do so in time. I don't wanna spoil anything, but the game is an adventure game that is charming, creepy and lastly, heartwrenching.The gameplay starts when Naiee and his elder brother Nyaa carry their father to a doctor, and from there the doctor has them embark on an epic quest to find the healing water. During the epic quest, you encounter folk in the village, farmers, sheep, rabbits, mountain goats; friendly trolls, evil trolls, whales, invisible monsters; giants that fought to their death, wolves, griffins, and much more.While you don't fight any of these beings, and really, only some of them are evil, (the mean trolls, a giant spider, wolves, and some angry cultists), you avoid them by controlling the two brothers. The game plays like a twin stick fighter or shooter, but as a 3rd person, over head view, and puzzle solving, one stick for each brother, and a trigger to interact with objects.The game really is epic with the interactions, as you climb, swim, swing, fly, use torches, use various gears and handles; there's a large number of puzzle/interacting; but it's pretty straightforward. The graphic style is reminiscent of Fable and Ico, but in its own way, and it works well as the game is gorgeous. The audio is perfect, the music and atmosphere really add to the charm of the game, as well as to the creepiness of certain areas (like the guy who tries to hang himself and you have to choice of stopping him, or the bloody rivers where the giants fought to their death, or the children whose bodies are hanging in the forests).I managed through the game pretty well, but I have to say that the ending is f*cking depressing. It leaves an emotional impact unlike any game I've ever played.10/10			"

												A tag that should be higher for this game is 'platformer'.  Fortunately, the game guides your character and does most balancing, jumping, etc for you so you don't have to worry about falling off ledges.  But there are quite a few instances of skill jumps.  They aren't particularly difficult, but aside from the minipuzzles of figuring out where to stand your characters to activate the next thing, it's the primary game element.I recommend this game, but it's a minor recommendation.  It's an easy platformer/puzzle game with a unique control scheme, controlling 2 characters at once.  Finished in about 5 hours.The scenes are cool looking.  There is an overarching storyline, but 90% of the game is ""here we are, in this room, how do we get out...oh there's a thing we can push/pull/lift/activate...click on that' cue cutscene leading the characters to the next room, ""ok, now how do we get out of here..."".I would not purchase at full price.  But on sale 80% off or something, sure go for it.			"

The soundtrack is really amazing.Overall, considering the price you think you'd get some silly quick game. However, this is top notch work if I every saw one. The only downside for me is that you can easily finish the game in a couple of hours. Trust me, after you finish it the game you're gonna keep wanting more.I rank this game as ""Must-have"".			"

												""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" is an amazing indie puzzle storytelling with beautiful graphics and a touchin' plot mixed with funny moments. It's game control mechanic is creative and transmits a powerful message: you need to control both brothers together to progress through the game. If they don't work together correctly, you'll fail and will be stuck. They need to work together properly during all the game - and isn't that what a good brotherhood is all about? Also, it can be played as a local co-op game with a friend - each one of you controlling one brother.The world is detailed, charming and vibrant. Despite the game story being only 3-4 hours long if you have good coordenation (I've a pretty bad one, so I've suffered a lot and spent like 10 hours to full complete the game and get all the achievements), it takes you through a multitude of environments and a rollercoaster of feelings. Every chapter feels fresh, compelling and interesting.Sometimes in a adventure, we grow stronger but there is so much that we lost along the way... ""Brothers"" showed us how immensely powerful a game can be, when it's gameplay and story complements each other perfectly.			"

												Brothers – A tale of Two Sons is one of the most beautiful games that I have played in a long time. This game is a gem and the story is gripping, touching and moving. This game plays best with an Xbox 360 controller. With the controller you control the two brothers at the same time – with the two thumbsticks. It’s a game where you’re on a journey thru impressive landscapes solving puzzles.Supports 21:9 resolution (2560:1080).Highly recommended!! And don’t forget to try to get all of the achievements - some of them unlock a little animation in the game.			"

												I really enjoyed the world depicted in this game. It looks like a fairy tale and is wonderfuly brought to life with an amazing soundtrack.The singleplayer cooperation mechanic is really awesome, and it makes the ending that much powerful.Few games have been able to sucessfully marry gameplay and narrative, and that is a feat I feel is done right here.It's a short but superb and emotional adventure.

												Within a span of three hours, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons manages to build a world more engulfing and tell a story more compelling than some of the most expensive 40-hour-gameplay titles created by big studios, and does so without the use of any real spoken language the players can understand. You won't know where you are going until you get there, but the journey to the brothers' destination is beautiful and fascinating to see unfold. Although there is a notice saying that the game requires a controller to play, I did so with a regular keyboard. Just use WASD and spacebar for the elder brother Naia, and arrow and Ctrl keys for younger brother Naiee. Whatever you do use, controlling the two brothers simultaneously can be a bit disorienting, and I recommend keeping each brother on the side of the screen that corresponds with the side of the keyboard/controller where their buttons/joysticks are located. It is pretty fun to figure out the little puzzles along the way, as much of the game requires the boys' cooperation to move the story along.Even though it is short, Brothers is worth every penny. If you can catch it on sale, as it is at the moment of this review being written, you really have no reason not to buy it. If you find yourself frustrated occasionally, give yourself a break and pick up the game again soon. You will want to play it through to the very end. (And grab a hanky when you get there.)			"

												Increible and charming game. The control scheme allows for a set of unique and very creative puzzles. Although they are fairly easy and straightforward, they are well thought and entertaining. The fact that they where designed with the brothers cooperation in mind makes them quite unique and you won't see anything like it in any other single player experience. Contrary to what the store page says, it appears that the game CAN be played without a controller. The excellent and yet simple storytelling in this game is yet another proof that well-designed videogames can be a form of art. Through a made up language the characters interact with each other and is up to the player to decipher what's going on by paying attention to the characters' body expressions and gestures. The game is obviously designed so that the story and emotions are easy to understand without the need of explicit dialogues, allowing the players to immerse themselves in this beautiful story by their own interpretations.The game makes good use of the Unreal Engine, creating a fantasy-like universe with consistent elements  with the overarching story and interactions between the Brothers. But it doesn't stop at that, as the game manages to create different environments for each chapters that are one more breathtaking than the other. From the remnants of a giants' battlefield to a glacial landscape filled with singing whales, every path the Brothers traverse was meticulously designed to resemble the syle of a pop-up storybook. This manages to convey the huge scale of the world that surrounds the characters and the significance of the journey of the two Brothers.I can't find words to describe how much this concept is enhanced by playing the game in 3D. Making the game work with a 3DTV is fairly easy with some software like Tridef 3D (I guess Nvidia's 3DVision should work aswell). And I must say, it looks like the environment objects and the camera angles were designed specifically with 3D in mind (and I suppose it wasn't like that, seeing as the game does NOT natively support 3D). This was easily one of the best 3D gaming experiences I ever had, and I look at the 2D screenshots I took while playing and unfortunately they feel extremely underwhelming compared to the sense of scope I felt during those parts.Overall, this game is a must-buy/must-play. Even if you can't find a way to experience it in 3D, the art design is strong enough to stand on its own and the beautiful story of the two Brothers may still be something to catch you by surprise and actually make you feel for the characters. The lenght of the game is approximately 3 hours. Maybe more if you decide to go for a second run in order to get the achievements you may have missed, but they weren't much an incentive to me.One detail (Spoilers?): I still can't figure out if this game was designed for kids, or if it was made for grown ups. It begins as a colorful and charming game, but it quickly turns dark and gritty, full of scenarios I'm not sure how a kid would respond to. The easy puzzles also trew me off. But either way, the game is still something that should be experienced from beggining to end, even by adults.			"

												""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" recounts the story of two brothers whose mother has passed away, on their journey to save their dying father. And it does so in a beautiful and sometimes surprisingly dark way. Brothers owes much of its magic to the wordless storytelling that plays to your emotions, perhaps more than an old fashioned narrative could, accompanied by a soft background music. Not even the few glaring glitches* or the simple graphics (the settings are breathtaking nonetheless, even if the characters aren't) can hinder the game experience. While the controls may freak you out in the beginning, learning to move and play both characters simultaneously will eventually come easier as you practice some hand coordination. I must say I didn't feel like this game *required* a controller, although I can see how it could make for better gameplay.There was no boring moment - although I must admit there were times so troublesome and frustrating that I contemplated Alt+F4ing the whole thing (only for a brief second). It was the proximity with the young brothers and their quest, and the will to see them through this painful and exciting journey that kept me going until the very end, by which I dried off a tear and gathered what pieces I could of my just broken heart.Beautiful, 8/10.*Regarding glitches:In chapter 2, if the gate does not open, restart the whole chapter. Restarting from last checkpoint will not work, and although it is possible to open the gate (with a lot of work) without doing this, it will give you trouble later on and you won't be able to finish the chapter without restarting it anyway. Just do it! "

												Usually if a game moves me from inside and makes me cry... That's a good sign.. I think I can dare to say that Brothers is, without any contest, one of the most beautiful and touching game I played those last years, if not THE most beautiful and touching. And beautiful not only by the Art Direction. The soundtrack, with that imaginary language made so comprehensible through the staging and the scenes direction. The plot, that how so strong bound between the characters, the magic of this universe lulled with Nordic references, that constant cinematographic feeling that makes the transitions between game phases and cutscenes very smooth, without any clashes. That inventive gameplay, that kindly forces you to use both of your brain hemispheres as if you were playing an instrument.I can't find the words to describe such a masterpiece... This game is simply formidable and extremely touching, in a similar way to the excellent Papo & Yo, but with... something better. If a notation was possible, I'd give it without any doubt a 20 outta 20. Yes. It's that good.------------------------------------------------------------En temps normal, si un jeu me remue de l'intérieur et me fais pleurer... C'est souvent bon signe.. Je pense pouvoir m'avancer et dire que Brothers est sans aucun doute l'un des plus beaux jeu auquel j'ai eu l'occasion de jouer ces dernières années, sinon le plus beau et le plus touchant. Et beau non pas seulement en termes de DA. La bande son, avec cette langue imaginaire mais pourtant si compréhensible grace à la mise en scène et à la direction des scènes, le récit, le lien si fort qui uni les personnages, la magie de cet univers bercé de références Nordiques, le côté cinématographique constant faisant que les transitions entre les phases de jeu et les cinématiques se font tout en douceur, sans heurts. Cet inventif gameplay, vous forçant gentiement à faire travailler vos deux pôles du cerveau, comme si vous jouiez d'un instrument. Les mots me manquent pour décrire un tel chef d'oeuvre... Il s'agit tout simplement d'un jeu formidable et extrêmement touchant, au même titre que l'excellent Papo & Yo, mais avec... quelque chose en plus. Si une notation était possible, je lui donnerai sans aucune retenue un 20. Eh oui. Il est bon à ce point.			"

												There are games that you enjoy to play. There are games that you love to watch. There are games that make you feel special. But when you manage to combine all that together you get Brothers A tale of two sons. A game that makes you aprreciate one of the most important things you have in life and that is a family that loves you. From the beginning till the end this game is a testament to the hardships of life, the importance of family and the grandeur of the human will and soul. A story so simple and yet so grand that makes you understand how great it is to have sm1 you can love and support unconditionaly. In the end of the game you will feel exactly as the the protagonists do and you will glimpse for a moment why the people you have around are the most important thing to you.  There are literally no flaws in this game whether is the story, the graphics, the music everything works in harmony and balance. One of the best games i have ever played and one i can say without a doubt i will remeber for a long time. 10/10 Masterpiece			"

AUDIOSoothingVISUALBeautifulDIFFICULTYChild's PlayVIBEMelancholyCRAVINGJourneyON SALEConstantPROS: There is a good chance you will finish this game in one sitting. It is easy to get invested very quickly. Gameplay is incredibly creative, and battle is not solely evasion tactics like you'd expect. Each level presents a new challenge, so there is no repetitiveness. You would think it would be hard to control two characters at once, but within minutes it was second nature. The story is told with no words, making it powerfully-poignant. CONS: It is almost nauseating how desperate the game is to tug at your heartstrings. If forced emotional investment through kicked puppies and weeping, legless orphans irritates you, don't bother installing; The game starts on a low note, and ends on a low note. It's got great artistic value, but that may make it a real drag. It is also very short, if you are purchasing for elapsed gameplay time, you will want to wait for this to go on sale. (My hours were racked up through completionist play.)WORTH: Brothers goes on sale all the time at a whopping 90% off! Wishlist it and wait for a sale to get it for $1.50 USD!OVERALL: I certainly believe that games can be art, but I've often questioned whether or not art can be a game. Brothers proves that there are successful marriages between the two worlds that don't land you in the ""walking simulator"" zone. It is reminiscent to the works of Team ICO, which I feel is a fitting description and the highest compliment I can pay a game.SCORE: 10/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. It is a relatively short game, but the pacing of the game means you are encouraged to explore and interact with your surroundings (necessary if you want to get all of the achievements). The storyline is compelling, taking full advantage of the whimsical world you play through. The characters speak a made up language which I personally feel only enhances the experience as it means you're forced to pay attention to what the characters are doing, how they interact with others, and the tone of their voices. The game takes you through a series of environmental puzzles which are generally rather simplistic in solution, but the control mechanisms are challenging enough to keep it interesting. As soon as you've mastered the controls in one area you move on to another puzzle which introduces new mechanics. This game is an emotional journey- you encounter situations which bring the player in touch with feelings such as playfulness, fear, jealousy, joy, and grief.  I personally think that by making the controls so challenging and making them operate in such a way that you really have to pay attention to what you're doing, it makes the storyline all the more powerful and the ending that much more poignant. You don't always realize what you have and how much you rely on it until it is gone, and this game captures that experience beautifully. Basically, brace yourself for some major feels.			"

Also, it was on sale for next to nothing when I picked it up.Though I played the game with my kids, I did most of the playing myself, lol. A gamepad is HIGHLY recommended though I managed to play the entire game with a keyboard.  Eventually I bought an xbox type controller and man, what a difference.The only thing I can nitpick about this game is the length; quite short, I think we beat it in 4 hours of playtime or so.All I can say is I felt like a kid again playing a great SNES game.  That's the feeling I got throughout this game.This game is a MUST for any gamer.Masterpiece, 10/10.			"

												While playing this game I had this feeling of fairytale and adventure and hardship that was so familiar to me. I kept wondering, what does this remind me of?? It was ""The Neverending Story"" book. It is my favorite story of all times and the game, as the book, will take you in places full of wonder where you will face dangers and magical creatures. You will help and be helped along the way, face treason and face LOSS. Heartbreaking, soul-wrenching loss. Now, if you experienced loss of loved ones in real life, you will know what I mean. It will take you back. But in this game, just like in life, you learn to cope and you learn to accept that life is what it is. However deeply wounded you get, you will heal, whether or not you feel this is fair. Emotional-rollercoaster aside, the game has beautiful screenshot-material scenery, a gorgeous soundtrack and a gameplay that I like to call "" a brain exercise"" :), cause you need to control both brothers at the same time, one with your left hand and one with your right. I recommend this with all my heart, but bring some tissues :)			"

												Brothers uses a very interesting control mechanic, where either analog stick controls one of the two brothers. All levels are designed and take full advantage for this.But that's not why you should play this game.Brothers has no real speech throughout, and what music there is is perfectly matched to the levels. The art design is also beautiful, at times as if you're in a LOTR-kind world. You move through several environments here from villages to high mountains to a frozen world, yet all belong to the same world clearly and it is a wonderful journey. But that's not why you should play this game.So many games try to touch emotion and portray a feeling of loss, but few succeed as well as Brothers does. One of the most impressive games ever made. Play it.			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons had some of the best gameplay elements I'd ever seen! It's just like a ""regular"" RPG, but as you probably already know, instead of just controlling just one character, or brother, at a time, you control both at the same time. The puzzles that were designed around this gameplay mechanic are awesome and really fun to do, along with the immersing story and well developed atmosphere.The main plot is set around two brothers, or two sons, that are on a quest to save their father, who is deathly ill. Their mother had drowned previously and the brothers don't want to lose their dad as well, so they set out to find the special liquid from a magical tree, which is the only thing that can save him. There are absolutely no distinguishable words throughout the whole game, apart from some basic instructions on how to control both brothers at the very start, but the story is still super smooth and easy to follow, so the lack of words won't mess up your understanding of what’s going on. No spoilers here, but the story of the brothers and their “adventures” is really good, you might even cry.There are enough levels included in the game to make it long enough. It's only around 3-5 hours, but I reckon it's just the right length to keep a story as this one interesting. Every level is a new experience and there are always new things to do, even with the basic controls, (you only use the triggers and thumb sticks). Hang gliding, throwing balls down wells, riding mountain goats and sitting on benches and looking at the view are only some of the things you can do to keep yourself entertained in this amazing game.So, the real question is, should you buy this game? Absolutely, I guarantee you'll have a great time with it. It's a little short, but don't let that stop you from getting it. There a many memories to be made as you play this.			"

												I understand if you are reading these reviews as you are sceptical on whether to buy this game or not.  I was once like you.  I originally witnessed this game release on Xbox LIVE Arcade on the Xbox 360 and soon after a media storm ensued - praise was given everywhere from nearly every major gaming outlet.  I still didn't bite.Roll around Steam Winter Sale 2013, I buy Brothers for £3.  Yep, £3.  Possibly the best £3 I have ever spent, on anything.To truly experience this game you will need a controller as this is a ""Single player co-op"" experience, you will be controlling the two brothers on the one controller - One brother using the Left analog stick and trigger and the other brother using the right hand side.  It is difficult to get used to, it is very unfamiliar, at times uncomfortable and it is absoloutley incredible. The way the controls are mapped and how they are used in gameplay tell a narrative that you are probably thinking is impossible, especially when the characters speak a kind of ""Simlish"" language.  Without spoiling anything, these controls are mapped in an EXTREMELY smart way - Please think, if you play this game, why each brother is mapped to that specific side of the controller. Hint: It was not done on accident.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons takes so many conventions we have become used to in gaming and completely flips them on their head, and then some.  Take nearly everything you know/have learned about modern games and throw it away before heading in to this.The audio is great, the visuals are near perfection.  I can not say any more without spoiling this experience... Just buy and play this game, It will be like nothing you have ever experienced.			"

												It was surprisingly pleasant to play this game. After watching the trailers and screenshots, I thought this was a game I would not enjoy or find interesting at all. It was by pure chance that I found myself playing this title but I am glad I did.The game is not hard, the gameplay is simple and that gives you the opportunity to focus on the story, the unique levels and the beautiful scenery, which is by far one of the game's strongest points.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons had some of the best gameplay elements I'd ever seen! It's just like a ""regular"" RPG, but as you probably already know, instead of just controlling just one character, or brother, at a time, you control both at the same time. The puzzles that were designed around this gameplay mechanic are awesome and really fun to do, along with the immersing story and well developed atmosphere.The main plot is set around two brothers, or two sons, that are on a quest to save their father, who is deathly ill. Their mother had drowned previously and the brothers don't want to lose their dad as well, so they set out to find the special liquid from a magical tree, which is the only thing that can save him. There are absolutely no distinguishable words throughout the whole game, apart from some basic instructions on how to control both brothers at the very start, but the story is still super smooth and easy to follow, so the lack of words won't mess up your understanding of what’s going on. No spoilers here, but the story of the brothers and their “adventures” is really good, you might even cry.There are enough levels included in the game to make it long enough. It's only around 3-5 hours, but I reckon it's just the right length to keep a story as this one interesting. Every level is a new experience and there are always new things to do, even with the basic controls, (you only use the triggers and thumb sticks). Hang gliding, throwing balls down wells, riding mountain goats and sitting on benches and looking at the view are only some of the things you can do to keep yourself entertained in this amazing game.So, the real question is, should you buy this game? Absolutely, I guarantee you'll have a great time with it. It's a little short, but don't let that stop you from getting it. There a many memories to be made as you play this.			"

												Pleasantly surprised.The non-verbal storytelling was completely unique, with every character speaking an imaginary language.  If you get stuck somewhere, you have to glean clues from the pointing cues of the brothers on where to go next. The scenery was amazing.  It's a shame the art of the characters themselves wasn't as polished, because some of the settings in this world were genuinely beautiful.  The game, while short, has a fantastic main plot with a lot of optional side content that you can explore to develop interactions with additional characters.  I said I was pleasantly surprised at the start of this review because somehow I hadn't heard more about this game.  It's a great Indie title, and I feel like I should have heard more about it sooner.  Pick this up, especially when it's on sale, as it's well worth your own review.			"

												Amazing game! I primarily play FPS games, but I bought this on a whim because I noticed it's powered by my favourite game engine,  the Unreal engine, and it looked beautiful. Also, it was on sale for next to nothing when I picked it up.Though I played the game with my kids, I did most of the playing myself, lol. A gamepad is HIGHLY recommended though I managed to play the entire game with a keyboard.  Eventually I bought an xbox type controller and man, what a difference.The only thing I can nitpick about this game is the length; quite short, I think we beat it in 4 hours of playtime or so.All I can say is I felt like a kid again playing a great SNES game.  That's the feeling I got throughout this game.This game is a MUST for any gamer.Masterpiece, 10/10.			"

												A moving story with an interesting control system held together primarily by a strong artistic vision and creative story-telling mechanics. You learn a lot about the characters without ever understanding a word they say to one-another. Unfortunately, I felt that the gameplay didn't really grip me fully until an hour or so in, and even then it had a lot to do with the feel of the environments evolving to become truly magical. The last half of the game is arguably its strongest in terms of both story and gameplay.Perhaps I sound cynical, but in the end my expectations based on reviews and recommendations from friends had probably been too high, as I felt like I had been given a mere taste of a full game, rather than the complete, satisfying product. I do recommend the game, but I don't think I'd play full price as it clocks in at barely 3 hours, and replay value is rather limited in my opinion - I'd return to experience the beautiful world, as the story and puzzles hold no more secrets after one play-through.

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. It is a relatively short game, but the pacing of the game means you are encouraged to explore and interact with your surroundings (necessary if you want to get all of the achievements). The storyline is compelling, taking full advantage of the whimsical world you play through. The characters speak a made up language which I personally feel only enhances the experience as it means you're forced to pay attention to what the characters are doing, how they interact with others, and the tone of their voices. The game takes you through a series of environmental puzzles which are generally rather simplistic in solution, but the control mechanisms are challenging enough to keep it interesting. As soon as you've mastered the controls in one area you move on to another puzzle which introduces new mechanics. This game is an emotional journey- you encounter situations which bring the player in touch with feelings such as playfulness, fear, jealousy, joy, and grief.  I personally think that by making the controls so challenging and making them operate in such a way that you really have to pay attention to what you're doing, it makes the storyline all the more powerful and the ending that much more poignant. You don't always realize what you have and how much you rely on it until it is gone, and this game captures that experience beautifully. Basically, brace yourself for some major feels.			"

												One word can define this game: Beautiful. Graphics (made a lot of screenshots), music, history, gameplay... everything is beatiful. I had a great time with this game and I think I will always remember it.Is not a long game, you can beat it around 2.5hs... but believe me, every minute counts, every single minute. The gameplay... really original. Controlling both characters with the same gamepad is amazing, sometimes a bit confusing and difficult, but amazing.I believe everybody should play this game, is a masterpiece.			"

												Brothers is one of the best games I've ever played. It was instantly memorable, immediately engaging, and impossible for me to put down once I had begun. The single player co-op design is unlike anything I've experienced in a videogame - playing on a dual analog stick controller is practically a necessity as you are controlling the titular brothers independently using the left & right analog sticks & shoulder buttons. There is a learning curve to this ambidextrous design, as you'll be getting the brothers to work together to solve puzzles and navigate a variety of terrain from separate locations. Being able to play an instrument that requires independent hand movement helps, though most players should get the hang of it relatively quickly. The difficulty is very consistent, steadily increasing without ever being too easy or too hard, and the puzzles are remarkably intuitive & creative. They are close to perfect in design, and solving them is sublimely gratifying - there are many ""Eureka!"" moments in which a lot of varied elements suddenly gel together like clockwork, and never once did I find myself needing to look online for a solution or getting stuck on a puzzle long enough for it to be an annoyance. Equally compelling is the immersive world in which you play - for such a short game (taking my time, I finished it in a single 3 hour sitting), you traverse a vast variety of settings, including idyllic farmlands, haunted forests, snow-covered hills & icy rivers, and an enormous castle near a battlefield littered with the bodies of dead soldiers hundreds of times your size. Brothers' art design & score draw from Swedish, Nordic, and Scandanavian influences, and much like its dialogue (delivered in a fictional language in which the characters' feelings & motivations are expressed entirely by how they emote the gibberish they speak), they help tell a story, create a densely detailed world, and establish a strong, emotionally-driven narrative. Brothers manages to do a lot with very little and never overstays its welcome; it really feels like a labor of love from developer Starbreeze Studios.This game is special to me in the way my favorite books, movies, and records are; the level of wonder and intrigue I felt playing it is largely unrivaled in the world of videogames, even in many titles that were made by bigger developers working with a much larger budget. Its art design and music are staggeringly beautiful and creative, it has some of the most unique and fun gameplay I've ever experienced, and the journey undertaken is filled with high emotional peaks and analogous of the journey of life itself. The final ten minutes in particular moved me to tears with a climax that utilizes the unique core control mechanic to express the completion of a character arc - something I've never seen prior or since. This game comes with my highest recommendation as an unforgettable experience and work of fine art. A+ (10/10)(My nomination for ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" in the 2016 Steam Awards) "

												Indeed, being an indie game, I could see the ways the storyline would 'subvert' your expectations a mile off. It would build you up to knock you down, grind at you with grime and supplant you with achievment. What I could not forsee is how the level and puzzle design would be so wonderful that however I thought the story would go, it went with a sense of overcoming and good gameplay. Despite the lack of graphics options, short length and unashamed controller exclusivity, there are moments in this discourse you will not easily forget.			"

												Epic in every sense, a true fantasy adventure.  Not only is the concept amazing, telling a story about brotherhood in both plot and mechanics, this game delivers on every level. The art direction hits home its fantasy roots, and the score is wonderful, enhancing every moment. However, perhaps the most impressive is the cinematography. Yes, cutscene cinematics are great, but Brothers is one of the first games I've played where the in-game cinematography is more nuanced than a pre-rendered camera. The third person perspective does a fantastic job of highlighting objectives and story details, while providing a fantastic frame of the gorgeous set pieces, all without obstructing gameplay in the slightest. I could go on and on about the details, but the best way to see it is just to play for yourself. The player camera is expressive yet functional, and few games can claim such. If I was to get critical, the only drawback is the gameplay. The mechanics are solid, ingenious really, and I was impressed with just how much of the world I could interact with (even if such interaction weren't always meaningful). However, it is simplistic. A couple of puzzles made me smile out of sheer ingenuity, but most, if not all, can be solved without much thought. If anything, I'd say that the greatest puzzle lies in the controls itself, as controlling two characters simultaneously on a single gamepad is quite the mental obstacle, and the game highlights this throughout. Still, there were a few moments where I wish the designers had pushed mastery of the controls further, as you can stumble your way through every chapter without much problem. However, providing such a challenge could possibly distract from the experience itself, so it's hard to fault the creators for going with accessibility over difficulty. The bottom line is this; if you want a great story where gameplay enhances the user's experience, play this game. Brothers is a great glimpse into the possibilities games present in the narrative arts.			"

Try this game and you won't regret it, but if you hate puzzle don't buy this game.Overall Ratings:  9/10    If you ask why 9/10?   that because this game is hurt my finger and I take 1 score to heal my hand lol			"

												Without a doubt one of the best games I've played this year. It combines game mechanics and story telling so well, it should be held as a prime example of how to do this - something which 99% of games fail to do correctly or well.Would highly recommend this game! Haven't finished it yet (I'm about 2 hours in at the time of writing) although I've heard it's only a few hours in length. But to put that to scale, something like Metro LL = 10 hours and is triple the price of this! So even though it's only a few hours long, its still worth playing!I guarentee this will be one of your favourite games of this year, possibly even of all time - and I don't say that lightly.			"

												Really torn on this but at full asking price it has to be a NO, completed the ""story"" in 2.5 hours and 100% all achievements in under 40 hours total.Really good visuals, world, the story is interesting and the interplay between the brothers is well done but it is no sad at all like people claim. End of the Walking Dead game season 1 was sad and really hit you hard, or even To The Moon. This was just .. meh. I was not emotionally invested.The puzzles are simple and you should never find yourself reaching for a solution guide. One huge annoyance is that when you play through again to 100% you are unable to skip the constant cutscenes... really?I got this either bundled or dirt cheap in a flash sale, sure only a couple of $. At that price it is well worth it but at full price too little for too much imho "

												I don't get the love for this game.  It's an ok game, but that's about the best that can be said for it.  The story is pretty straight forward, nothing wrong with it, but nothing that interesting about it.  The world is somewhat interesting, but nothing is explained or expanded.  It's simply go here, look at this new area, ok we're done here, now look at this new area, and repeat over and over.  The graphics are pretty, but I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ so that doesn't matter much to me.  The game is short and linear, lasting around 2 1/2 hours, and you spend a lot of that time walking on straight paths to get to the next puzzle.  The puzzles are way too simple, there wasn't a single one that took more than 2 seconds to look at and figure out, and they are often repeated.  If they had spent a little time making some puzzles that took some thought, the game probably would've been more enjoyable.  Controlling each of the brothers seperately is an interesting concept, but it's not used to the full extent that it could've been.   The dual movement also results in occasional moments where you lose track of your control on the brothers and send them running off in random directions until you stop and think about what you're doing.  It's not a big deal but might explain why they went with very simple puzzles.Overall, there's nothing really wrong with the game, but I feel like I wasted my time.  The game doesn't do anything particulary well and there's no challenge to be found here.  Why people seem to enjoy it so much, I'll never know.  I guess people are mesmerized by no challenge games, pretty graphics, and pushing arrows impaled on some dead bodies for the third time.			"

												I have not yet finished the game, but if the first level is any indication it may be heading to my list of favourite single player games. This game has caught me by surprise (much like XCOM: Enemy Unknown did). However, unlike the technical praise I might give XCOM:EU, I found the story and simplicity of the game to be a refreshing change of pace.The interface to the game comes in the form of a ""unique single player cooperative experience"". That description is quite accurate but I would not label it as the biggest selling point of the game. Although the experience is very unique, it can at times be a bit overwhelming. The unique controls are not enough to detract from the presentation of the story. I've found many of the puzzles challenging enough without being impossible. But the interface to the game is not what draws me to it, rather it is the presentation that gives it a special place in my collection.We live in a time where all forms of media are pushing the boundaries of privacy, violence and sex. Rarely do we see anything from music videos to video games that can't succeed without a healthy dose of one or all of the above. I only point out this fact because this game is presented with what you might call a traditional sense of innocence. It reminds me of simpler times when movies like Milo and Otis and Homeward Bound would provide enough escape from the oft-times drab realities of our daily lives. Don't get me wrong the game does have violence, so did Milo & Otis and Homeward Bound. There's a vast difference between the violence presented in those movies (and in the game) and the kind we see on HBO's latest ""adventure"" TV show.This game doesn't replace those more adult-themed shows, movies and games that I do enjoy. Rather this game is something apart from them, it strikes that simplistic adventure nerve just right to keep me coming back for a little more every night.Do I recommend the game? Absolutely, just remember to hang your cynicism at the door and bring your heart and a sense of humour and you'll love it. :)			"

Not only are the controls differn't but the story itself is unlike any other.  It's cute, sad, thrilling, and even scary in some parts. But the ending. The ending is so great. kjfgbsdkfgj I wish I could go into detail without spoiling it but I guess you'll just have to play for yourself.			"

												Honestly, what can I say... I never cried so much in my life. This is not a game for very sensible persons (like me). I just finished the game and I need to hug my teddy bear really long to get over the story.In terms of gameplay, I actually have nothing negative to report. The controls are simple but can still confuse as you go on in the adventure. The puzzles are quick to understand and can be solved without experiencing much frustration. Sometimes, I think it might be a little bit too easy. There is no part where you can get stuck or that is really challenging in my opinion. Still, I don't see it as a problem since the game is not about feeling awesome after solving a hard puzzle or bypassing a large obstacle and more about telling the story of the brothers. Difficult puzzles would maybe ruin this experience.The narrative of the story is just fantastic. Even without using an acutal understandable language (the characters in this game speak some a made-up language + there are no subtitles), it is always clear what the characters in the game are saying or what they are talking about (also because they use gestures which helps out a lot). The story and (if existend) the relation of the individual characters is easily understandable.Sure, the game is pretty short (it took me two hours to finish it without having all achievements) but I think it's the right length. Since the gameplay is simple, you can only do so much to keep it fresh and entertaining. Maybe one level more wouldn't have hurt but I don't think it's necessary either.All in all, Borther - A Tale of Two Sons is an entertaining, small and also emotional experience. If you're looking for a quick and fun game and you're not the most sensible person out there (*sob*), definitly check out this game!			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is exactly as the title suggests, the story of two boys, connected by the bonds of brotherhood, unified in their quest to find a cure for their dying father (this is relayed to the player in the first minute or so of the game).  From the moment we pick up the controller (more on this later), we too, are tied to these boys.  We guide them forward, facing the adventure that lies ahead.Brothers is in every way an experience refined to its most vital, leanest, core.  There is no dialogue to read, no complexity or depth to the controls, or even mindblowing technical detail to the environments.  What we have instead is not by many standards an objectively better game, but one which utilizes its design choices to create an incredibly engaging and meaningful experience.Brothers’ story is “told” to the player through an almost primal but ultimately simple and refined manner.  No English nor any known language is spoken (as far as I know) in the world in which our fated brothers inhabit.  Instead, the intonation of the voice and the expressions displayed by the characters serve as the primary method of narration.  In this way, engaging our senses without having language and words to get in the way, we begin to empathize at a core emotional level with the brothers and the people around them.  Wanting to smile at the sound of their laughter; tensing at moments of stress, tearing at moments of pain.  Without “telling” us anything, Brothers makes us feel.  And that in itself is an achievement.Upon recommendation, I was told to play Brothers using a controller.  After playing through Brothers, I can understand why such a recommendation was made.  The controller is split in half, one action button, a camera button, and an analog movement stick for each brother.  In this way, each brother feels like an extension of the self.  As you struggle to coordinate the movements of your own hands, you watch as they too, struggle to work together.  As you improve, so do they, traversing the terrain with the ease of a well oiled machine.  In this way, running, tiptoeing, sneaking around, moving in general just feels good in analog, as it should.And while Brothers is by no means a technically impressive game, it does pull off awe inspiring spectacle.  The terrain is highly varied, puzzles never overstay their welcome, and moments of pure exhilaration and smile inducing giddiness play at odds with true moments of adversity, rounding out the experience as a whole.  In this way, the variance of the environments reflects the range of emotion that occurs in Brothers.  Wrapped in what in hindsight looks like a 2-3 hour rollercoaster ride, but in the moment, felt like days of adventuring, Brothers is an experience worth having.  Not to watch someone else experience, or to even read about, but to have and experience and live yourself.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The story, the gameplay, and the setting! All of it blew me away!This is my reaction to this game: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m08mhdrcxs1rqfhi2o1_400.gifWARNING: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERSThe plot is that you have to travel a large distance to get a special medicine for your sick and dying father. The two brothers help each other on this quest to save thier dad. An example is the Blue Brother helping the Gold Brother swim as the Gold Brother is too scared to swim because of his mother drowning infront of him. Also the interesting characters you meet on the way gave life and also feeling to the story. The two brothers' bond gets you really sucked in and it is what made the ending even stronger.The setting of the story will leave you speakless. I loved looking off the hills and mountains and seeing the valleys or towns below. The game had a warm and bright feeling for most of the game. The setting also being able to be manipilated with interaction was another fantastic feature. Some of the interative setting was as simple as moving gates or making a bridge. You could make a path and continue with the story.The gameplay was simple using control sticks to move the charactors and triggers to interact. It was simple and easy but still a great experence. Only problem for me was I kept confusing myself with which character I was trying to control with the stick. I often made them walk into walls trying to remember who is controlled by which stick. Overall this is a fantatic game and I want to play it over and over.If I had to rate this game it would be a 9/10			"

												Brothers - A Tale Of Two Sons is an amazing game. Maybe it should be considered more as an interactive story than anything else, since it is very linear and lacks a challenge in itself. The interest lies without a doubt in the emotion conveyed by the story, the rather original gameplay with the two brothers, and in the observation (or should I say contemplation) of the environment. For the graphics are gorgeous (the unreal engine together with Nvidia Physics do wonders) with breath taking sceneries and superb light effects, not to mention an impressive depth of field. Other than that, the music is really beautiful and contributes greatly to the atmosphere of the game. As for the story... well it is a simple one, but very well told (it sometimes feels like an old tale). And extremely emotional...Overall, the game is not hard at all, and it is very short: less than four hours to complete the story, even if you do the secondary actions. It is the only negative thing I could point out, but I paid it 3 euros so I sure cannot complain. And I believe you can take great pleasure in playing to the game more than once. Anyway, an amazing indie gem, which is definitely worth a try and offers a rather unique experience.			"

A truly fantastic game, visually stunning with an amazing musical score.You soon forget its linearity in favour of the unique artistic style and story, which is further enhanced by the use of a game controller to make the most of the dual character mechanic; sort of reminiscent of Banjo Kazooie for N64.While it's not a difficult puzzle game, the characters help you become sucked into the story and you find yourself attached to  them.It's good for about 4 hours playtime with some replay value even if its just for the screenshots alone!I'm proud to say it's a 100% completion game which I can't recommend highly enough.

												As someone who loves story-driven game, I had always had my eye on Brothers, just wanted to wait for it to go on sale. Now I've finally played it and I have to say it was everything I had hoped and more. As you probably know, you play as two brothers, each being controlled with a seperate hand on eithert he controller or (as I played it) a keyboard. Either brother has different tasks they can preform, the older being able to pull heavy levers while the younger can get into small spaces or between bars. All this leads to a very unique experience as your brain tries to tell either hand to do different tasks for ither brother or maybe the same task but in reverse, etc. The game never gets terribly difficult, and in all I beat it 100% (for achievements) in about 3 hours, which includes re-playing a few sections I had missed an achievement in. It's not a game for those who want to grind, or have hours of questing adventures. It's an experience, you play through a story, a tale of two sons, if you will. So in the end, it all comes down to, do you wnat to have a fun and heart-wrenching experiene with a game? Then I say definately play this game. If you're not really into that, then don't bother, this games not for you.So lets get down to the story - oh wait... spoilers incoming, I recommend playing before reading more, or if you don't intend to play it but wnat to know some critical points about the story, read on.The story is amazing! It starts light, then gets very dark pretty quickly, to the point where I think I yelled ""WTF!"" at my screen. I felt like the game took me for a ride through a series of emotions from a sense of adventure, fun and mayhem to a somber mournful reality. All these emotions did not happen at individual times, they are interwoven throughout the story, character or people off to the side will die or live or love will blossom. Not all lives are caught up in the boys story, and thus have their own endings while you're still playing. Even a simple silly thing of two bird they you set free finnding love is tucked away in a corner of the game you would easily miss, and less them 10 minutes later a new beloved creature will pass away from starvation and exhaustion as you finally gave it it's last flight from it's brutal cage. You'll have to side-step giants corpses or cut off their limbs to make it to the next path, bathing yourself in the behemoths blood and feeling nothing but pity and sadness for your actions. Or be thrilled and delightled only a short time later as silly sea-turtles coo at their mother.But nothing stung me as the ending, the final series of events you play as only one brother. Feeling as if one of my hands had been cut off, I pressed on with only the right pressing buttons. It was so strange how to game made me feel wrong about a way I would play most games. The younger brother is afraid of water, and would alwyas hold onto the older brother shoulders to help him swim. But now, without his brother, he wouuld have to swim to the final area to hel his father. So I spend like 2-3 minutes just trying to get the kid into the water, but he wouldn't do it until I just instinctivly began pressing buttons with my other hand again and felt a huge gut-wrenching bundle of emotions when he began swimming using the keys which in my mind where reserved for his brother. A game has never made me felt os many things, with it's controls alone. The younger brother has to do a few more tasks with his brothers 'help' or just the left hands keys, however you wnat to think about it. Which is so odd and painful and moving at once. This game is not perfect, I wouldn't even say I liked the overall ending. I felt hollow and just sad when it was done. Yet, it made me feel all these things, and more, throughout the game. So do I think it's good, heck yeah, like I said it's an experience. But not if you just to just play something light.I try to tell people to think of some games like movies. You don't want to watch A clockwork orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey when you're not in the right mood for it. Games like this are very similar in that regard. You need ot be in the right kind of mood. Sometimes I just want to turn off my brian and watch a dumb action moive, or play minecraft and mine for a hour of non-brain requiring fun. This is not a game to play when you're in that kind of mood.Okay I've rambled enough, I hope thaat helped some. Love the story, very neat controls, very effective ending.			"

The setting, the atmosphere, the cut scenes. All of what shortly after the beginning was incredible. It got super emotional and powerful at the end.The best thing about this game was how it didn't just shove a good story in your face, it made you live it and right at the end, there were some incredibly powerful uses of the game mechanics.

												This. This is what I like. This is what I want. Right in the feelers. This game is simply amazing. 2.5-3 hours of high quality and gorgeous game play, great interaction with the game's mechanics, and an emotionally charged ending.This game has solid game mechanics while only making use of 6 total buttons. There is literally no dialog comprehensible past ""mama"" as the characters speak in their own made up language and the story was reeeeallly good. Graphics were solid and the artwork was gorgeous.You play as 2 brothers, each half of your controller (L/R trigger and analog sticks) control each one. You traverse a fantasy filled world looking for the ""Tree of Life"" to heal your sick father. The game has simple puzzles to solve, but the real joy of this game is the game mechanics and the constant enjoyable scenes, my personal favorite was the goat scene.I highly, highly recommend this game. Please... PLEASE take 2-3 hours out of your day to play it!!*I want to add- due to the way the story and game mechanics are weaved together, a controller is required to fully experience this title. I personally recommend the Xbox 360 for Windows controller which retails for about $33 on Amazon.			"

												This is one of my favorite stories told through gaming that I've played in a long time. I recently bought an Xbox controller with the idea I'd be using it for Dark Souls 2.  I loaded up Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and noticed that my controller was prompting me.  HOLY CRAP so that's what I needed! - This game blows with the keyboard, but is genius with the controller.Highly recommend if you have a controller, otherwise it will probably be too frustrating.Gameplay 10/10Graphics 9/10Story 10/10If I was a girl on my period I definitely would've cried at the ending.

												I'm not sure what I can say about this game that people haven't said already.The gameplay is fun.The graphics are beautiful.The music is amazing.But most of all, the story...to call it incredible would be an understatement. I have never seen a game tell a more powerful and emotional story...let alone without using any real dialogue.That being said, if you're looking for a heart-warming and happy story, full of rainbows and sunshine... don't look here.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is no ordinary game. Unlike most puzzle/platformer games, repetetive themes feel minimal and always tastefully done. As the game progresses, it forces you to adapt and learn how to make the brothers interact in a challenging though intuitive way, through visual clues and forgiving reminders that each brother has their own set of special skills. In addition to the challenging and fun puzzles, the environments in the game were beautiful. I owned this game for months before I played it, because although my friend gifted it to me, I wasn't fond of the art style of the game at the time. After deciding to bite the bullet and play through the game, I realized that the relatively simplistic art style was necessary and helpful in creating an environment in which the progression of difficulty of the puzzles flowed naturally, as mentioned previously. Additionally, the relatively simple environment became an art masterpiece as new setpieces consistently increased in scale, depth of interaction, and danger/wonder. A sense of awe comes over the player as they sit at the benches in the game which give you a chance to take a moment and admire the environments in the game.Finally, Brothers is not just a game, it's a cinematic experience aided by the control scheme. Per the recommendation of my friend who gifted me the game, I played with a wired Xbox controller. This is definitely the preferred method of playing the game, though it is forgiving enough to be suitable on keyboard/mouse as well if you prefer or lack access to a wired Xbox controller. The control scheme, though as simple as an interact button and basic movement for each of the brothers, started off clumsy and hard to maintain, but as the game progressed, the simplicity of the scheme showed itself as a marvel of modern game design as the story was translated not only through the actions of the brothers and various supporting characters on screen, but also of the control scheme. When one brother could not complete a task another brother could, you could feel the difference in the way each brother completed each task in front of them, and you could really feel the strengths of each brother being properly utilized in a way that made each brother feel equally important to gameplay, not just one being overall better. The end of the game left me reeling as I discovered how well thought out each combination of buttons was for the story, and how the interaction between the brothers transcends their physical strengths and accentuates their emotional bond as well. 10/10, this game is quite literally perfect.

												Picked up and played ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" on a Steam sale last year, I definitely recommend it! It fits right into that nook with Portal, Flower, and Journey as a really engaging short game with surprising impact. The bizarre control scheme isn't as off-putting as I expected and is tied into the rest of the game in a way that makes it a better choice than actual co-op play.			"

												This game... This game is excellent. I'll do my best not to spoil it. Also, to those who may be wondering, it does NOT require a controller but it's certainly better with a controller.The game uses its mechanics to tell a story, a relationship even, between two brothers. Which is something you just don't ever really see. It is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, with its highs and lows and sad parts and whatnot, and the story is certainly what's pulling the game together.However, the actual game is a pretty good time too. A lot of the platforming is very fun and feels quite good to play and a lot of the levels have interesting puzzles, although most aren't too difficult to solve.Now, yes, this game is short and has little replay value, but you'll certainly get $15 worth out of it, or just pick it up in a sale for $3. Definitely worth it then.All in all, buy this game.			"

												A beautiful little game in which two brothers go on a quest, initially presented almost like a child's storybook where bad guys are defeated with poofs of smoke and the world is detailed in a manner that almost look painted. Despite the content of the introduction, this sets the tone which makes many of the later discoveries hit so much harder than they otherwise might. While only about the length of a movie, that also makes sure that nothing ever overstays its welcome and the pacing is consistently spot on.Thankfully, it takes a gameplay route somewhere between The Adventures of Cookie and Cream and Ico, giving it a proper feel of interaction and exploration without saddling itself with half-baked and overdone combat as many cinematic games are wont to do. Perhaps not as remarkable as similar games such as Another World and Journey, it nevertheless certainly deserves a playthrough for fans of that style.			"

												Wow. Just wow.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an absolute gem of a game. The mechanics and controls of the game are very simple, giving you control of two brothers with each half of your game controller and presenting you with various puzzles to solve within a beautifully vibrant world. Different puzzles and obstacles manage to keep the gameplay fresh despite its simplicity and allows you to focus on the true power of this game, the story.Told through a majestic combination of sound and emotion, the game is an absolute rollercoaster of feelings that you will never forget. Completion time is around 3-4 hours depending on your playstyle. Video and audio options are somewhat lacking from the game, but I have a feeling that this was intentional from the devs, giving you no distractions from the experience this game provides.In my opinion, this game is a masterpiece!

												Brothers is an interesting short title which showcases innovative controls and an enjoyable story. The main draw is the 'single player co-op' mode of play, each joystick controlling a character (this is most certainly a game made with joysticks in mind) and the gameplay revolving around a series of puzzles exploiting the use of both characters. Whilst it's undoubtedly enjoyable, I left with a slight feelingt that there could have been a lot more to this game. The story line was good but it was played very straight. There was a lot more to develop on, both the controls and gameplay were interesting but lacking in variation and there was no growth at all.Still, for a short game it's alure is plain to see, and although perhaps leaving some room for growth, it's a good story and a good few hours entertainment.

												Brothers - Adventures of Big and Little T-wat.Gameplay is aggravating at time. Left stick / Right stick action can be difficult to get used to. At times it felt like someone was inside my brain with a chainsaw trying to buzz away at my corpus callosum, and at other times it felt like trying to choreograph two cocker spaniels to trance music. The game gives you a long time to figure all this out with a seemingly endless opening sequence where you have to outwit this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag with a wooden sword. The story is really the key here. Little T-wat is afraid of water and can’t swim, so Big T-wat has to carry him around on his back when there’s water around. Obviously, Little T-wat isn’t going to learn to swim being carried around all the time (the whole give a guy a fish and he’ll only beg for fish kind of reasoning). The two brothers have a bit of a falling out over spider tail, and mystical stagnate tree sap water doesn’t heal those kind of wounds. Finally Little T-wat is set to try swimming on his own. Can he do it? Play the game and find out.All that aside, this was an enjoyable game with slightly above average fanciful graphics. For $2.24, I can’t complain too much. It was worth the money.			"

Pese a su historia sencilla, en la que dos hermanos tienen que encontrar una cura para su padre enfermo, nos consigue transmitir todo el dolor y sufrimiento por los que tienen que pasar los dos hermanos a lo largo del camino.Es un juego cooperativo de puzzles y estilo plataforma, pero que manejamos como un unico jugador, es un concepto ingenioso y muy simpático. Tiene una belleza de paisajes increíble. Podemos interactuar con muchas cosas del escenario, y nos hace simplemente explorar continuamente por curiosidad a que hará cada uno de los hermanos.Realmente es un titulo que recomiendo, a mi me ha fascinado.En fin,  pena que el juego dure tan poquito, no llega ni a las 3h, tal vez es el único ""pero"" que le pongo.

												I have only played 48 minutes of this game so far and I can already tell this is going to be a rich ride. The game mechanics are really fresh; requiring the player to manage both brothers with the analog sticks is a really neat idea. I can not recall the last game I played that had the player do this. The graphics are serviceable and the sound is of a high quality. The general mood at the beginnig of the game is mixed with some drama and light-hearted exploration. There is an undertone of gloom that has me worried that there may be some heart-tugging moments later down the line.I would like to go into a little detail about the brothers themselves. When you start the game they are fairly blank pages using ""Sim-speak"" to convey some of the plot. As the game progresses, there are little nuances that really bring their personalities to the light sans actual dialogue. From the older brothers stoic demeanor, to the little brothers practical jokes, you get a sense that the two have a great deal of depth; more depth than I have seen in full blown AAA titles. I nearly died laughing along with the younger brother after he slapped a bent over villager in the butt. I am looking forward to seeing how they interact with the rest of their world.			"

												Without doubt the most stunningly beautiful ""short"" game currently out there.  The landscapes and ambience, paired with the game's music make it such an immersive and emotional journey.  It is an incredibly brief game in terms of overall gameplay time but I highly recommend at least one play through for every PC gamer.  The way the devs have set-up the achievements is also a nice touch, with no achivements given for in-game milestones or 'checkpoints.'  Rather, achievements are awarded for going off the beat and track and sometimes doing unconventional things.  By this I in no way mean the environment is open sandbox, it is extremely linear with little scope for exploration.  An excellent gaming experience that is definitely worth the money.			"

												A really memorable and well-crafted experience. It's one of the few experiences that actually reminded me of how I remember my childhood: it started with a strong fairy tale feel where something is not quite right, and gradually grew progressively grim as the brothers were thrust into a world where children are not immune to hardship. Before playing it, I was concerned it would be another recycled story about annoying/sad/bratty stock-character kids, but I'm pleased to say that it's one of the more balanced and mature portrayals of children that shows them as human beings with an actual personality.In terms of gameplay, the way they combined it with the story development makes Brothers one of gaming's gems: all the story is told through the environment and the interactions the player has with the world, and there is no (comprehensible) dialogue. The best story moments are twists based on how you control both brothers in different situations. One of my favorite examples is an area where you need to avoid detection from a monster by hiding in specific positions behind frozen statues. Another is a battlefield for giants, where navigating the environment becomes a nice twist. All the areas you explore are filled with little contextual interactions that will make you will feel like you ""toy""with this unforgiving world and its inhabitants, just like a child would. Complementing this approach is a truly special and stylized art direction, the kind that makes me stop and take screenshots every minute or so.The amount of soul & care put in the details of this game, from memorable story moments to little interactions in the world, is rare to find in games nowadays. Very short but very sweet.			"

												It was fun but short.  Bought the game for 1.99 on sale and it took 2 hours and some change in time to beat playing a ""blind"" run.  Nice game, but the puzzles are easy, the story was predictable, and the graphics felt cartoony.  Over all this title is more a short story and less a video game.  If you can play a game and appreciate it for the story over the game play, then this will be a great experience.  If you favor game play over story and settings, then pass on this title.			"

												I would recommend that you get this game; on sale if you can. The mechanics of controlling two separate characters at the same time can be challenging (See Infuriating) but once you get used to it, this game's atmosphere, music and minimalist story (Which is delivered through game mechanics and visuals)  all shine. A definite recommendation. I sped through this game in 3 hours, but judging by the achievement list, there's probably more game time you can squeeze out of this title.			"

												Relaxing, beautiful, fun. Also emotional.  Graphics/scenery is great, music is good.  A very nice chilled adventure...but not for children (this becomes rather clear about half-way through).  Very very glad I played this through.Puzzles are fairly trivial, which I like as I'm rubbish at puzzle games and this helps keep the flow of movement going.  Its pretty short, but fun all the way through.Only criticism...why are elevators so slow to move up!?!  Also why do I feel so sad now :/			"

												I played this as a good test for my controller, and I think it was lovely. It took me around 3 hours to finish, and that felt right. It's a lovely story, and good alternative for a movie night, etc. Played it with my partner watching, and we were both very impressed. Would play through for the first time again if I could. Will put on the list of media to consume regularly when I grow senile.Upon reflection the day later, I will recommend it even more heavily. It's exactly the game I wanted to play.			"

												Brothers – A tale of two sons tells a well-crafted story in a short time frame. I finished the game in about three and a half hours. Despite the game being so short, it is worth your money and time. The control scheme is simple. You control the older brother with the left analog stick, and the younger brother with the right analog stick. You use the Left trigger to interact with the older brother, and the right trigger to interact with the younger brother. The controls are awkward at first, but you’ll get used to it in no time.Although there is spoken dialog it’s a made up language. Meaning you won’t understand a single word of what the characters are saying. However, the game will still create an emotional response from you just based on gameplay. It’s just fun to interact with objects and people with both brothers to see a glimpse into their personalities.The puzzles are fairly easy, but make great use of the control scheme.It is recommended that you have a controller before purchasing this game, as it would be fairly difficult trying to control both brothers using the keyboard.Overall, this game deserves to be experienced by everyone.

												This is an excellent game that drives home the “game experience” more than anything else. Not many games can portray a story as successfully as Brothers without a single line of dialogue. As a player you become quickly immersed in the story and sucked into the game. You start empathizing with the characters throughout the emotional events you encounter. The entire experience—the duality of controlling two characters, the puzzles involved with the control setup, the beautiful environment artwork, and the music that brings it all together is something that will stick with me for a very long time. I highly recommend this game and greatly encourage players to support game studios that create games with this high-level of game design.			"

												Brotherhood and adventure overwhelmed me as I ventured through this vast land of giants and folklore. The sheer scale of the world and its beautiful intricacies are enough to be worthy of your time playing, but the pure originality and phenomenal game mechanics are the true gems of this game. You progress through the land controlling both brothers simultaneously, which at times is tedious and would steer many away from playing. However, once you get the hang of handling your characters, you will become emersed in a realm that you've likely never experienced before. Certain points along the storyline possess genuinly original puzzles that will leave a lasting impression of ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"" inspiring a sense of accomplishment as you discover their secrets on your own.I highly reccomend this title to anyone looking for an emersive experience in a game unlike any you've ever played. The story is told without dialect and the challenging mechanics cannot be copied, which draws in your focus and at times makes you feel as the characters do -- in sadness, joy and accomplishment alike.Graphics - 10Story - 8Cutscenes - 9Gameplay - 10Overall - 9.5			"

												Although it's relatively short, clocking in at around 5 hours of gameplay by time I finished it, this is one of my absolute favorite games. It has an extremely well-written storyline and it had me hooked from the moment the game started.I've always loved adventure games and this one certainly was quite the adventure, taking you through many dangerous terrains and trials to reach your ultimate goal. But, I think one of the most charming aspects of the game is that they don't speak a real language. And although you don't understand the words being said, you still understand what's going on and what you have to do. It really gives you the feeling that you're in a world vastly different from (and yet similar to) our own.I'll have to stop myself or I'll ramble on forever, but this really is a great game and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that loves a good adventure!

												Two brothers set out on their adventure and seem to be crossing half the land for their quest. This game has (to my knowlege) it's own language. I didn't undestand a thing of what they were saying, but at the same time, thanks to brilliant camera use and great body language in the characters I didn't have to guess what was going on at any time.The game itself blew my mind. Stunning visuals, great places/levels, real easy controls even though you might have to get used to controlling both brothers at the same time. The story took me in and didn't let me go. No loading screens so you can really feel connected. Puzzles in this game get a bit tougher, but all work on the same principle as you get familiar with in the beginning. This game is really a classic. It should be in everybody's list, mind and heart.Final verdict 9.5/10+Awesome story. Shows you don't need to understand a language in order to know what's going on,+Amazing visuals,+Short, but packs a punch,- Too bad you NEED a controller for it, but once you've played it, you'll know why.

												This game is something else. A true ""co-op single player"" as you never experienced before. Getting used to  control two characters at the same time can sounds hard at first, but that will last only 2 minutes, after that you will get involved by the amazing visuals and story of the game. Everything in this game is a labour of love, the details, the music, the graphics....All the puzzles and challenges are so well crafted that it won't take you long to solve them but at the same time they make you  feel greatly rewarded for finish them. The game lasts about 5-6 hours of gameplay but I can assure you that it will last in your mind for days, months and years. ""Brothers"" is one of those games that can't be totally described, the only way to understand it is by playing it. Get it on a sale. You won't regret it.			"

Even if you aren't a 'Gamer'. Its such a great and heartfelt experience. Seriously, go and play it. Its downloadable on PC, PSN and XBOX Live.I finally got around to this gem after spending months going through my backlog of games. I am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to play it now. The controls are very awkward, but simple. A controller is more or less a must for this game, as you control one brother with stick and another brother with the other stick. Trigger buttons to interact with the environment and shoulder buttons for camera rotations. That it! Simple. You will immediately think that the game will be boring with such limited controls, but you would be wrong. The level design and mechanics of the game turn the simple controls into a story of its own. The artwork is breathtaking. The game is one of the most gorgeous around. And that story...﻿			"

												This review refers to my experience with the game using the Xbox 360 Controller. I have no idea how the game runs on the keyboard.At first, I felt hindered by my inability to multitask by controlling the two brothers using the two thumbsticks on one controller. I would get confused and try to move one brother using the wrong thumbstick and feel infuriated by it. After a while, however, I get used to the controls by assigning each brother's color to the side of the controller. Once you get passed that, the game unfolds into a wonderful journey. Great use of the Unreal Engine makes this game beautiful and optimized so you should be able to enjoy the sceneries even on mid-range computers. The only video setting in this game is a gamma slider and the resolution picker, so it isn't that great a game for the lower range computers, possibly, should you wish to lessen the ambient occlusion and rays for the sake of performance.The levels are lovely to go through and the puzzles are easy, so even casual gamers should enjoy this. For the more hardcore gamers, there are some hidden puzzles to be found that are slightly harder (but not by much.). Ultimately, this game is for those who enjoy discovery and stunning vistas as well as a story that reaches the heart.This game is about loss, and about sacrifice. Without spoiling the story, it would be hard to say much except that its moving. Most players should be able to complete the entire game and get every hidden puzzle under 2 hours, but it is a good 2 hours, with a great storyline that doesn't drag on more than needed. If you loved games like ""To The Moon"", this is a game for you.			"

												This game isn't your typical puzzle co-op game. You have to control two brothers simultaneously while solving several tasks and overcome obstacles along your journey. It may be hard at first try (especially if you're using a keyboard instead of a controller), and the challenges scale up as you progress further. Still, you'll get used to it in no time.The story itself is filled with many adventures and emotional scenes, and is undoubtedly the main spotlight of the game. So prepare yourself until you reach the very end, it will never cease to take your breath away.			"

It's mechanics may be simple once you are accustomed to controlling two characters but the world (incredibly pretty) and the narrative are sublime.This game is well worth the cost despite it's relatively short length and it's a must play.

Do not watch a Let’s Play of it, do not let a friend tell you what it’s about, just lock yourself up in your room with a controller (and for Pete’s sake please use a controller) and play it in one sitting. $15 is a pittance to pay for this game; you've seen awful blockbuster movies for that price, so you owe it to yourself to play this instead.

												I played this as a good test for my controller, and I think it was lovely. It took me around 3 hours to finish, and that felt right. It's a lovely story, and good alternative for a movie night, etc. Played it with my partner watching, and we were both very impressed. Would play through for the first time again if I could. Will put on the list of media to consume regularly when I grow senile.Upon reflection the day later, I will recommend it even more heavily. It's exactly the game I wanted to play.			"

												Relaxing, beautiful, fun. Also emotional.  Graphics/scenery is great, music is good.  A very nice chilled adventure...but not for children (this becomes rather clear about half-way through).  Very very glad I played this through.Puzzles are fairly trivial, which I like as I'm rubbish at puzzle games and this helps keep the flow of movement going.  Its pretty short, but fun all the way through.Only criticism...why are elevators so slow to move up!?!  Also why do I feel so sad now :/			"

The ending is far from what you'd expect and will stay with me for a long time. You would do yourself an injustice by not giving this game a chance! ....10/10			"

												This is a game where the story packs a real emotional punch right from the opening scene. Prepare to be invested in the fate of the characters to an extent that I wouldn't have thought possible. You will care about what happens to them. That there is a real sense of the individual personalities of the two main characters, and that the story is clealy and sensitively told is a real tribute to the developers given that this is all achieved without any real dialogue at all. The main characters use simple sounds and gestures to convey meaning and emotion.There are events and twists throughout that give a real depth to the storytelling. The control system is both simple and innovative.  The world that the characters inhabit is beautifully drawn,  and the atmosphere is completed by a fabulous score. And whilst the overall length is fairly short that is more than compensated for by the whole wonderful experience which leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommended.			"

												One of the most enjoyable and surprising games I've played.  Very fun to play, I didn't run into any bugs at all that others have been complaining about - not to say they don't exist, but I never once ran into any bugs with the game at all.  This was a very enjoyable game that was fun to play, gorgeous to look at, and full of emotions.  Gameplay was probably ~3-4 hours but I spent a lot of time playing around.  It could easily be done quicker than that if one desired.  The puzzles were fun but not exceptionally challenging, but I wasn't looking for a very hard game with this.			"

												I gotta say that all those great reviews kinda ruined the game for me because my expectations where very high. If you want to play it purchase the game with ""I heard it's all right, i should give it a try"" attitude and you will not be disappointed.Now to the game itself. It's simply beautiful and touching. Graphics are minimalistic and simple but the designers managed to create astounding sceneries spiced with norse tales and mythology. The gameplay brings a new element where you control both brothers at the same time with different analog sticks on your gamepad (in my case on keyboard since I didn't manage to make my trust gamepad work in this game, not even with x360ce) and one interaction button for each character. Then you have to use both brothers to solve simple yet clever puzzles like climbing a rock tied to each other using swinging to reach otherwise unreachable areas. The game is not hard in any way but that is not what it is aiming for.The main aim is to deliver a touching story about two brothers who lost their mother and in fear of losing their father as well they set up on a dangerous journey to find a cure for their sick father. First it feels like a fairy tale when you meet a troll who lost his wife and is trying to help you but later on it turns into more like a horror atmosphere.To sum up this game is great yet I had slightly bigger expectations since everyone has been calling it the game of the year. The only negative I found is that the game is pretty short. It took me 3 and a half hours to complete and when it ended I was hoping for some more material which didn't come. Well but since I bought it on sale for 4,12 euros I don't give a damn. Buy it because this is a one of a kind game even though it could be longer and imo it has a lot of dormant potential.			"

												This game is a fable.It tells you a story, and it's a familiar one.  There's hardship in the home, and two young boys do what they feel they must.  They set off on a quest together, inseperable and interdependent.They journey through a world they find familiar - but as the player sees more of it, the world reveals its surreal and magical bits and pieces.  The journey shows glimpses of grand scope and mysticism, but don't forget: your two young heroes have a task, and they journey on to succeed.But... As soon as you think you have a handle on things, the game begins to test your resolve.  Mechanically, what you do isn't difficult: two analog sticks, two triggers and timing.  Emotionally? ... Well, if you feel any investement in the characters you encounter, the game might make you FEEL things.There is no intelligible speech in the game; the inhabitants of this world speak their language just fine, but the player has no idea what is being said.  Of course, the body language/mimeography reveals just enough for one's imagination to take off and run with all sorts of meanings.There is no comat in this game, but there is a measure of challenge.  It's a story that asks you to try in order to reveal more of itself.  The trial may be more one of morbid curiosity and courage.While playing it, I got strong memories of Neverending Story, that same feeling of discovery and adventure, as well as the realization that every fantastical element in this world is matter-of-fact to its inhabitants and serves as allegory to something more familiar, mundane.Over the course of 4 hours or so, I saw this story through to its conclusion, encountering a few of the side-stories within (optional activities and further glimpses into the world).  The levels are linear and well-paced, but this pace is slower; the game is meant to be savored rather than devoured.I love this story.  It is so very simple in its idea, so old in its roots; the pace is natural and doesn't offer (nor require) handholding.  Buttery smooth and saccharine-sour, this delicious morsel is worth sampling, then pausing to savor and reflect; then, should the mood strike again, perhaps coming back for a second helping.I love a good fable.  This is a good one. Come see for yourself.			"

												If you have the smallest shred of a heart you will appreciate the beauty of this game. The art, sound and storytelling are astounding. The lack of voice-over, apart from the minimalist Germanic-gibberish, perfectly evokes the characters' personalities and feelings.Then you get to the gameplay. This is a game where simply watching gives you only 3/4 of the story. The controls, especially when using a 360 or PS3 (with motioninjoy) controller, provide a sense of closeness to the characters and at times give meaning to the situation.You control each brother independently with the analog sticks and interact with the world for each with the left and right triggers. Those are the controls. Contextually, each brother will react to the current situation and positioning (which is extremely forgiving).I finished the game in one sitting. It took me about two to two and a half hours. Do not let this deter you from this wonderful experience. I didn't spend as much time in the world my frist playthrough as I intend to the next. I simply cannot recommend this game enough. It is easily the most powerfully moving game I have ever played.			"

												This is one of the most fun adventure puzzle games I've played in a long time. The controls allow for more in-depth puzzles, and can sometimes make the charcters run in crazy cirles, if you lose track of them. The world this takes place in is beautiful, and there are plenty of opportunities to look around and take in what there is to see. The story is compelling, and makes you want to continue playing to finish the quest of the young brothers. Very much recommended.			"

												A stunning game which I highly recommend.  It is short (3 - 5 hours gameplay) but it makes up for it in the engaging storyline, the characters, the beautiful graphics and the way in which you control both brothers at the same time.You do need a controller to play this game as it makes controlling the two brothers easy and intuitive.  The storyline whilst reasonably simple takes you into a number of different lands where you will meet several other characters.  Throughtout the game the graphics are visually stunning, perhaps the best I have experienced in a game (watch the shadows of not just your own characters but those of others you interact with, even those you can see a long way down the mountains you climb).  The colours are superb and the whole experience is one of quality.  The puzzles are relatively straightforward but nonetheless satisfying to complete and the added bonus of unlocking achievements adds both game time and an element of fun.Above all I felt the game was a very fulfilling experience (yes I wish it was longer) and I have never felt so engaged with a character in a game.  A real emotional gaming experience, one which I can not recommend highly enough.  A game I have already returned to, go buy it!			"

Its melding of story, art and sound assets, gameplay, and interface is unparalleled, and perfectly suited to the Video Game medium; in fact, I would go so far as to say what you experience in this game CANNOT be replicated in any other medium. Do not watch a Let’s Play of it, do not let a friend tell you what it’s about, just lock yourself up in your room with a controller (and for Pete’s sake please use a controller) and play it in one sitting. $15 is a pittance to pay for this game; you've seen awful blockbuster movies for that price, so you owe it to yourself to play this instead.

As well as its innovative play design - it really does make you forgive the fact it is a controller only game (which is very obvious as to why as soon as you begin gameplay).A thoroughly enchanting storyline - no dialogue (just motions and sim-ish noises) getting in the way of the interesting yet heartfelt tale which is spun.I could replay this game quite a few times more and still be entranced by it.

Brothers a Tale of two sons is an absolute treasure of a game, though not terribly difficult the game play elements them selves are fun (played with an xbox style controler) and differnt then your avarage game. I have to say that though there is no translation to the speach used in the game (for I do not think it an actuall laguage) it was so universal that it dose not take any leap of your imagination to understand what is being said. The story telling done made me feel for not only the main characters but created a depth in the side characters that you do not see in many games today. The art style was amazing and capitured my imagination immediatly and the work on the landscapes is breathtaking. It is true that I may be a sap for these kinds of sorrowful tales but reguardless I strongly recomend the perchase of this game for anyone who wishes to support the many artizans who made it and to pave way for more like it to come.

It is adventure platforming game with coop gameplay that you control the big brother with your left analog (or WASD if you use keyboard) and right analog for the little brother (directional buttons in keyboard). You will control both of the character at the same time to cooperatively solve the puzzle throughout the gameYour father is dying sick, and your mother has died prior of the game. You, the two brothers, begin the quest to find the magical ancient tree that believed to have the cure of the disease. And the adventure begin. You will journey the beautiful world that's so believable. Every detail in this game is really well made, imaginative and even your adventure is short, you will still find something surprising in your journey. The story itself, it's simple, really simple that you won't struggle to understand what's going on. But not predictable and will arouse your emotion. Even they speak in ""not an actual language"" like how The Sims character speak and the animation is not like L.A. Noire that motion capture the expressios of the actors, you will still able to feel the emotion of the character, amazed by how the thing turned out. Playing this game is like you read very good pop up fairy tale books but with the story development that is not like usual fairy taleThe gameplay is simple, just movement, rotate the camera, and interact but can be quite entertaining. You need to do a combination of the older and little brother to solve the puzzle and do the platformer in this game. The elder brother is bigger and stronger, capable to handle heavier task like pick up a sheep or pull the heavy lever. And the little brother is smaller and lighter, so he can pass the fence or being boosted by his big brother to reach a high platform. Each character has it's role and the cooperative combination of them make an solid puzzle solving adventure. The puzzle itself is simple and relatively easy to solve but not boring, entertaining and unique in every encounter you will face. Don't expect to see a same puzzle in a different place in this game. Every stage has it's own unique puzzle and platformingBut this game has zero replayability, except you want to look achievements that you may overlooked in the previous playthrough. But despite of that, there are no reason to play it in the second time. And people who seek for challenge in their gaming experience will be dissapointed in this game. This game is very easy and not gave me a hard time at all. And off course the game is really short. Four hours to finish it including some exploring or interacting with some of the NPC'sMy score is 8 out of 10. The game is short, really short but so enjoyable. Fear not, with a cheap price tag this game is worth your money. If you like some simple and emotional story with unique and easy gameplay but can be very entertaining. This game is maybe for you. If you are someone who want a challenging puzzle platformer or someone who want more complicated story telling, I don't recommend you to play this game			"

												A new take on story walkthroughs, as this can only be a story walkthrough with the incredibly linear design with puzzles too simplistic to garnish thought. The design choice of simultaneously controlling both brothers with analog controls (controller based) works well, however the abilities of the characters are minimised to a simple 'action' key (toggle) and nothing more outside of movement.Graphically the scenery is well design and provides a thoughtful environment. On the opposite side of the coin, character interaction with objects and characters themselves leaves much to be desired.The game/story is relatively short (2.5 to 4 hours), however the story is what makes this game worth playing. Without spoiling any of the story, it can be said the story is akin to one found by the original Brothers Grimm.Overall an interesting take on story playthrough and the control mechanism is something different, I would recommend waiting for this one to be on sale before picking it up for a run.

												Before playing this game i'd seen a lot of praise for it and having played it i can say it exceeded my expectations. The story see's two brothers set off to find something to help there very ill father.  It's a really original platformer with you controlling the two brothers at the same time. While this sounds like a difficult process at first it's actually handled quite well. The left joystick is used to move the older brother with the right trigger used to make him interact with things while it's the right side for the younger brother. The simplicity of it makes controlling the two at the same time quite  easy.The games environment is quite a beautiful one with some great scenery and the world it takes place in is amazing with you encountering all different kinds of fantasy creatures and animals with some brilliant settings for the different levels. The puzzles you encounter in the game aren't very difficult but they still manage to be fun and there's some great use of the fact your controlling two characters at once. The games story while seeming basic at first has a very powerful ending which i loved. I'm going to add my voice to the clamour of praise this game has gotten and say buy this game if you can. A 9.5/10 from me.			"

												In Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons you control two brothers at the same time with an analog stick each. You use this creative control scheme two solve puzzles where you need to do two things at the same time while being a bit clever. The two brothers set of on a journey to find medicine for their sick father. As you play you'll visit several beautiful and unique environments which really creates a great mood while you solve the fun and unique puzzles.I recommend Brothers to anyone who enjoys puzzle games that both pretty and creative.

It's probably designed for one man holding the controller and playing the game, but we shared one, so we both could play.This game is very short, hovewer brilliant. I actually like it being short because that way you can complete it quite fast and it doesn't get repetitive. The storyline, gameplay, characters, atmosphere are great. Graphics are not on the Battlefield 4 or Crysis 3 level, but the environment and characters are so well made/designed that it just sinks you in the imaginary world.This one is a definite must own if you have a controller.

												Brothers is a puzzel game for people who don't like puzzels and its an RPG without a complex lore and meandering quests. It has a beautiful asthetic and great visual direction. My only complaint is you have to hold down LT and RT throughout many puzzels in the game to hold/interact with certain objects. Holding down those triggers strained my index fingers. The normal price of $15 might be a little steap for some gamers, but if the game goes under $5 than snag it. Its a great game to sit down alone one night and experience a simple and poignant tale. Play with a controller. I recommend it.			"

												Absolutely amazing. Easily one of the greatest experiences I've ever had with a game. I don't think a game has ever evoked so many personal emotions from me. I am a younger brother and my elder is 6 years apart from me. This game truly touches me on a deep level with the utilization of sound, music, lighting, voicing, expression, and atmosphere. Although the characters speak in an indistiguishable language (mostly, apart from the brothers' names), their vocubulary leaves nothing to be desired and is communicated flawlessly. I believe this was intentional and means to give the player the ability to fill in the blanks with what (s)he feels appropriate, which is likely something personal and easy to connect with.The characters themselves are easy to relate to and offer excellent development as characters. The story is extremely simple, but communicated in such a beautiful way, I can't help but be floored this game lasted me nearly 3 hours. I already want to play it through a second time and find if there was anything I missed (other than achievements which are very satisfying and well hidden) which would give more richness to the world itself. The character models may not suit my taste, however, the art style makes up for any personal issue I have with the models themselves. I've taken a handful of screenshots from this game and am one right-click away from setting one as my desktop background.The game itself offers many puzzles and challenges which are never frustrating, yet still require thought and patience to accomplish. The flow of the gameplay has never once been interrupted for me and leaves very very little room for criticism. I'm greatly impressed with how the developers managed to keep such a simple mechanic of using two joysticks to control each brother sp fresh and entertaining even while repeating some puzzles over again. The game continually gets easier as the player becomes accustomed to the mechanics, but there are plenty of instances where I've had to stop and rearrange the brothers because I had trouble keeping the two moving naturally. This is not the game's fault at all, rather it is my own and the game should be praised for continuing to challenge me with such a simple and logical mechanic, but still retaining its challenge by requiring constant attention. Excellent puzzles and mechanics; they offer many challenges.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, challenging multitasking, rich worlds with deep story, has an appreciation for music and environment, and especially anyone with a brother (hell, even a sister) who they care deeply for. You will not regret this purchase or the time you invest into it.			"

												This is a game where the story packs a real emotional punch right from the opening scene. Prepare to be invested in the fate of the characters to an extent that I wouldn't have thought possible. You will care about what happens to them. That there is a real sense of the individual personalities of the two main characters, and that the story is clealy and sensitively told is a real tribute to the developers given that this is all achieved without any real dialogue at all. The main characters use simple sounds and gestures to convey meaning and emotion.There are events and twists throughout that give a real depth to the storytelling. The control system is both simple and innovative.  The world that the characters inhabit is beautifully drawn,  and the atmosphere is completed by a fabulous score. And whilst the overall length is fairly short that is more than compensated for by the whole wonderful experience which leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommended.			"

												quite easily one of the best games i ever played (and i played a lot of games so far). the rare combination of a deep and atmospheric world to dive into and unique, never-played-before gameplay mechanics are comparable to portal (2) quality wise, eventhough it has nothing to do with that sinister, sarcastic humour of the valve series. ""brothers"" is a downright honest and moving fairytale that reminds the (adult) audience of how wonderful simple yet heroic stories can still be, without the need of zynicism, sex or ultraviolence. but dont get me wrong here: its not a fluffy, happy world to stroll around in. its an emotional very challenging journey about fear and death and grieve and eventually trust and love and courage. it should be said however, that its a very short game. i took me less than 3 hours to finish. but instead of being sad or angry about it, i started wondering why i have to spent hours and hours of repetetive gameplay in other games without ever reaching an emotional experience that might be somehow comparable to the journey of the 2 sons. thats how good it is.i am looking forward to play this game again someday or even watch a friend play it and i think when you even read that, because you think this might be something for you, than you should definitely buy it.

It's more of an emotional game rather than a puzzle one, its focus is on the brothers' interactions(very fluent) and their struggle. You(both brothers) can also interact with the environment, such as animals, people, etc. And each brother interact differently. The language they speak is fictional, the only aspect I didn't like much. The soundtrack is great, and the plot is fine.

												This is the first game that I bought and played on steam. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a marvel of storytelling and clever gameplay and a must buy for players who enjoy such.The first thing that I should say is that unlike what the notice says on the store page, this game does not require a controller to play. Gameplay and story:During the game you control these two characters with the arrow and wasd keys as the camera adjusts itself to the area that you are playing. The game itself is relatively simple and linear, requiring the player to overcome easy obstacles in the way of the protagonists' journey to save their ill uncle. In the course of their quest, they assist others in need and grow closer as brothers. It is slightly challenging to get ahold of controlling the brothers simultaneously at the start of the game but becomes much more fluid and easy as you progress through the levels even with a keyboard. Complement to the controls, the challenges along the way begin to require more ingenuity as you learn to control the brothers.Graphics:The areas themselves are beautifully designed and the game pauses every once in a while to allow you to enjoy it. From climbing crumbling ruins to scaling massive caves the game uses every area to show you just how beautiful and well crafted it is. Sound:There is no major dialogue so to speak but everything in the game is clear without it using too many words. What the lack of dialogue gives way to is a wonderful soundtrack that captures the emotional range of the story in ways that dialogue would never have. As the game becomes darker the longer you play, the sounds and music mature likewise.Overall: On the front, Brothers may look like a simple, light hearted puzzle adventure for a casual player. Playing it, I've come to appreciate the subtle and fine ways that this game was made elevating it in quality above many of the other games that I play. The story and gameplay are simple, the music complements the graphics excellently, and the entire experience is an emotional journey as two brothers enter dark and dangerous worlds to save their family. I cannot recommend this game enough and constantly badger anyone who would listen. It is a quick (approx 6 hr) playthrough and the ending left me sobbing. I have to say, this is a different caliber of gaming. I've never experienced anything like it10/10 "

												Brother - A tale of Two Sons is both a well written story and well thought puzzles! You learn pretty much all of the control mechanics within the first 10 minutes but it's the clever way in which the game implements them that keeps you thinking throught the 5-10 hour campaign. The game starts off very much as a light hearted fairy tale, albeit with a sad back story. Yet half way through it shift's very much from a pleasant, whimsical fairy tale and follows the path more akin towards Brothers Grim. This sombre tone compliments the soundtrack beautifully, which overall is really quite enchanting. The puzzles themself never feel overly taxing which allows the story to flow nicely. As for the controls they can be a little tricky to start with even for the most ambidextrous of people. Big brother is controled with the left analog stick whilst little brother is the right. The respective back buttons are used to control the brothers action and the trigger buttons rotate the camera angle. The end result is a game that allows you to experience a really moving story and also lets you attempt puzzles that will still give a sense of saticfaction when you complete them. Worth looking at if you have an interest in puzzle games :)			"

												This. This is what I like. This is what I want. Right in the feelers. This game is simply amazing. 2.5-3 hours of high quality and gorgeous game play, great interaction with the game's mechanics, and an emotionally charged ending.This game has solid game mechanics while only making use of 6 total buttons. There is literally no dialog comprehensible past ""mama"" as the characters speak in their own made up language and the story was reeeeallly good. Graphics were solid and the artwork was gorgeous.You play as 2 brothers, each half of your controller (L/R trigger and analog sticks) control each one. You traverse a fantasy filled world looking for the ""Tree of Life"" to heal your sick father. The game has simple puzzles to solve, but the real joy of this game is the game mechanics and the constant enjoyable scenes, my personal favorite was the goat scene.I highly, highly recommend this game. Please... PLEASE take 2-3 hours out of your day to play it!!*I want to add- due to the way the story and game mechanics are weaved together, a controller is required to fully experience this title. I personally recommend the Xbox 360 for Windows controller which retails for about $33 on Amazon.			"

												This is one of my favorite stories told through gaming that I've played in a long time. I recently bought an Xbox controller with the idea I'd be using it for Dark Souls 2.  I loaded up Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and noticed that my controller was prompting me.  HOLY CRAP so that's what I needed! - This game blows with the keyboard, but is genius with the controller.Highly recommend if you have a controller, otherwise it will probably be too frustrating.Gameplay 10/10Graphics 9/10Story 10/10If I was a girl on my period I definitely would've cried at the ending.

I felt something for those brothers, the journey they took together, the journey that I helped them through. An absolutely gorgeous journey that made me think. I would call this game a peice of art, give this game a title it deserves, as any peice of good art should leave the consumer thinking, pondering and discussing for days after, and that is what this game is capable of.

The puzzles are fun but not too challenging, the little mechanics that are added as the game goes on keep it fresh and the pacing feels just right, the game doesn't overstay its welcome like most games tend to do these days. I would highly recommend you play this in one sitting like I did, it's really best experienced like that. Next time it's on sale I'd highly recommend grabbing it, it's well worth and if you go into it blind to the story you'll enjoy it so much more (which is why I've avoided talking about it at all).

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a quite unique gaming experience. It has some very emotional moments and I did like how the story was told. It is like an adult fairytale and it actually has some very heavy moments. and it does focus more on the storytelling than on the actual gameplay. So, it's actually quite easy to play and it doesn't really have difficult moments to master. While this can be seen as a contra for the game, I guess it's up to oneself to judge. Personally I was a little bit bothered that the characters didn't speak an acutal language, I guess this was a choice by the developers to stress the pictorial metaphors used in the game. Also it is quite a short, I played through it in around 3 hours.Although it isn't a perfect game, due to some minor flaws, I do recommend this game to everyone, because it's one of those rare and unique games you just don't see very often.Rating:82/100			"

												First and foremost, I'd like to start off by clarifying one thing. This game does NOT require a controller to play. It is a bit tricky to get used to the keyboard controls at the very beginning, but after a while it shouldn't be too difficult to get the hang of. I've personally only played this game on keyboard and have only had one or two experiences where it was kind of tough to pass a point in the game because of the keyboard controls. I'm not sure why the game's store page says having a controller is a requirement. Yes, a controller would probably make the game more enjoyable as it would be easier to control both brothers, but not having a controller doesn't make playing the game anywhere near impossible. If the only reason you're hesitating to get this game is because of the ""controller requirement"" on the store page, get this game. Especially when it hits around $1.5 during sales, there really isn't any reason not to get it.Moving onto the game itself, it's a nice little adventure game that you can apparently finish in 4-5 hourse (I don't know how I managed to squeeze 13 hours out of it on a single play-through). The artwork is visually stunning. Really nice soundtrack. Gameplay is fun. Provided there is virtually no comprehendable dialogue between the characters, the story was also fairly good. The story gets even better near the end. The ending itself is really nice (won't go into any details to avoid spoilers). Somebody dies and unlike the million other videogame deaths you've experienced, the game makes sure that you're really affected.Overall, I'd say this game is a must-play, especially because it doesn't even take that much of your time to finish. I don't know if the full price is really worth it considering the amount of content you get, but on sale at a bit over a dollar or as part of a bundle, this game is a must-grab.Taking all things into consideration, I'd give the game a 9/10.The biggest thing that really drawed me in was it's artwork. The game even has benches where you can just sit down and enjoy the view. Another reason I loved it was the ending. The only reason I didn't give it any higher is because I think they could've worked on the story a tad bit more and also make it longer. But again, like I already said, there isn't any comprehendable dialogue that goes on between the characters, and I understand that by doing this the game-makers wanted to show you the story and make you see it for yourself rather than have the characters tell you about it. Taking that into regards, the story doesn't dissapoint.If this game has just been sitting in your library and collecting dust, or you've been eyeing it every sale but haven't decided on actually getting it because you aren't sure whether you'll actually enjoy it, give this game a chance. I promise you it'll be a very unique experience from what other games have to offer.			"

												This game was amazing! Probably one of the best games I have played in years.The story is extremely well written and the emotions of the characters are expressed very well without the use of real words.Although very linear the game does have a lot of little hidden features in each chapter. The puzzles are very good but not very original and some were fairly simple to complete. This of corse does not take away from it's great story.The idea of controlling two characters with one controller sparked my interests at first but after a while it slowly became a bit irritating and did get me a bit fustrated as I would sometimes mix them up and have one running into a wall whilst most of my focus was on one character.All in I loved this game and you should definitely play it!

It's a minimalist decision that I rather enjoyed, and it fit rather nicely with this fairy tale adventure through its beautiful world.			"

												There are not enough superlative adjectives to properly describe this game.This game is the best emotional experience I have ever had. This is a more impressive work of art than any book I have read, any music I have heard, any movie that I have seen. And I'll try to dive into why and try to explain it.First of all - while a lot of the story and emotions are told with graphics and music and gestures and gibberish dialogue, this game manages to make you emotionally invested in the characters both because you play them both at the same time, and you constantly have to cooperate and interact, but also because you develop your feeling for them as the mechanics of the game develop and changes. The real experience of this game lies in holding that controller in your hands. In fact, if you as a PC gamer don't have a controller, this game alone should be motivation enough for you to get one.Second - the game has gorgeous, fabulous, amazing, stellar, fantastic graphics design. It is cute and incredibly well made when it comes to the characters, they present their personality through an amazingly well developed series of animations and articulations of their own emotions and thoughts, and use plenty of body language. The environment is a gorgeous watercolour-style and you even have a specific game mechanic just to watch the surroundings in the form of benches to sit on. The game progresses through a diverse set of environs that are very vertical, which gives you an amazing world to look at in addition to the nearer parts you can actually go to and through, which are just as good looking. Waterfalls and rock trails and town environments and mountains and battlefields and castles and woods, the game is fantastic in every aspect. I would say maybe half of the entire game time, you are looking at a view that would very well deserve to be a dektop screenshot, because it just looks that good.Third - the game is full of interesting interactions with the world, of characters and items that build the atmosphere, and who reacts to what you do in a way that really fleshes out and makes everything feel more immersive. And when things get tense and your controller starts rumbling, it enhances an emotion and setting you are already feeling from what the game has already managed to express to you.Fourth - Brothers has an amazing atmospherical sound design, from the gibberish language that makes dialogue work entirely through how things are said rather than any content of what the character say, to the ambience that makes the settings and environs feel amazingly well developed, from wind to waterfalls to strange mechanical apparatus to characters in the background, to the soundtrack that couldn't be a better fit to the emotions of the moment.Fifth - the game lets you tell the story, cutscenes are only used for telling story in amazingly small and short bursts, the vast majority of the storytelling is made by you, on the controller, guiding Naiee and Nyaa through the world.Sixth - while the aesthetics of the game are nothing short of stellar, the mechanics are solid and very well put together. Animations and actions are snappy and the characters' movements are very much not only well connected to what you do, they also tell some of the story in the form of changing slightly to adjust to you for example swimming, or holding two ends of an item, to one of the brothers being hurt, or even his emotional state.Seventh - when it comes to storytelling and world building, this game has it all. When you play it, it will be the most immersive piece of storytelling you have ever experienced. The setting goes from cute and wondrous to tense and dangerous to playful to sinister to somber to gross to harmonic to bereavement. It tells a story of a fantasy world where the sinister and the playful live side by side, where carefree happy life is just a stone's throw away from wizards turnings armies into snow sculptures, giants waging war, wolves hunting you and sinister trees trying to kill you.To categorise, this game is a single player cooperative 3D puzzle platformer adventure game. It is not long, but it is meaningful. It is a piece of art.This is the single best piece of storytelling, the most emotional of all works of art, the most immersive game I have ever experienced, and I do not doubt that if you play it the right way, undisturbed and undistracted from the game and the controller in your hands, you will feel the same. I cannot praise it enough. This is the best game I have ever played. It is the first game that has made me cry from the emotions it conveyed. And I want you to experience that too.Don't watch it being played on youtube or twitch. Don't watch a friend play it beside you. Don't play it in an environment full of distractions and sounds and people that interupt you. Play it where you can fully enjoy it, find a time and room free of distractions, put headphones on and take the controller in your hands, and just play it. When in the game, don't rush through it. Take the time to sit on the benches, view the environments, interact with the people and animals and items, immerse youself in the world and the setting, and you will be rewarded with a highly emotional and beautiful experience in a way I don't think any other game does.

												Working with award winning Swedish director Josef Fares, Starbreeze Studios presents us with a downloadable story-driven adventure game. Question is can the influence of a movie director provide a fulfilling narrative and satisfying gameplay without sacrificing one or the other? Let's take a look.The premise is simple. Two brothers must find an specific object located on a map in order to cure their father of a life threatening illness. Whilst the plot itself is pretty barebones, all the subtle nuances make up for it. From the different ways the brothers interact with objects to the interchanges between them both “Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons” is firmly under the implication that actions speak louder than words, which is further accentuated by the characters speaking in gibberish which relies a lot on body language to get the exact emotion or exchange across. Thankfully the game gets this right and later on in the game hits some truly dark and morose moments that’s sure to make most people choke up slightly.The gameplay provides what can best be described as a single player co-op experience. You control both characters with each individual stick and triggers which can be difficult to wrap your head around at first but once the player is accustomed to the play style then it becomes a unique scenario where the gameplay works in tandem with the story so that these brothers feel more connected. This is especially used well in the later sections when the tone shifts and segments are given much more weight and power. Visually the game holds up great with its simple painted story book style to create some impressive looking scenes, the only drawback is that the animations can sometimes be a little jerky which is only a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar visual package. The only other major issue is the game’s length which only provides about 2-3 hours of playtime which could be a turn off for some. However this shorter length makes the game keep a steady pace and avoids any filler that could have otherwise bogged down the experience so it’s a decent payoff.Some may want to hold off until the game is cheaper but be assured that it’s definitely worth recommending. By providing a grim fairytale and unique gameplay Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons creates a memorable, albeit brief experience that is sure to stick with you.			"

But the 3 to 4 hours that you spend playing, are well worth the money. Decent graphics for a DX9 title, but don't expect new standards visually. All in all, the gaming elements create a sum much greater than its parts.			"

												A heartwrenching tale of two brothers who will travel to the end of the world to save their sick father. You would be forgiven in saying that the story premise is not entirely original but certain design choices still make the character interaction interesting such as the use of an unknown language by the characters in this game with the tone of voice and body language completely conveying the story and character dialogue. The game plays well on an xbox controller with the left stick controlling the big brother and the right stick the little brother. The advantages of each of their stature is used to create interactive puzzles which although are extremely simple are still well thought out and entertaining.One thing i must mention is that the game is short and can be completed in 2-3 hours. There is enjoyment to be had here but due to the length i'd recommend picking it up on sale. "

												Okay. Once you get the hang of the controls, this game is amazing until the very end. This game is more of an experience than it is a challenge. But it really doesn't matter considering the game is only 2-3 hours long. The way you play is unique and the puzzles are also fun. One of the great things is that you have no unecessary stuff like health bars, so all you get to focus on is the beautiful landscapes rendered in unreal. This game is beyond beautiful and atmospheric. It tells you a story without words. No voiceacting. No subtitles. Just a beautiful gaming experience. Definetly going to play it again sometime soon.

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a co-op game in single player mode in which you control two brothers at once. I saw this a perfect opportunity for my 8 y.o. little sister who wanted to play ""serious games"" like this so I gave her the control of the right thumbstick of the controller. Naturally, we were screaming at each other within the first 15 minutes.The puzzles are not that hard, if you are playing alone the challenge comes from coordinating both of your fingers. I had someone else so it wasn't a big deal for me (she just sometimes tend to wander a bit and do her own thing). Also, the puzzles were never boring, the obstacles are pretty varied so there was always something to enjoy.So there we are, pretending to be the two protagonists in the game who must find the magic pool of water to heal their father. We enjoyed the scenery and the music, thanked the trolls, laughed at goats, and gradually enjoyed working with another for real. We were both engrossed as the story progressed. Consequently, the yelling and the pointing of fingers stopped. The two siblings in the game, like us, had to rely on each other, despite not being equal in terms of strength or skill. It was a very obvious lesson but nonetheless it’s still something always forgotten by most people.The main theme of this game is about the importance of family. It was extra special for me because I shared the experience with another family member. My sister said she would cry so hard if the sad ending happened to us. It was a ridiculous thought, but still, it was the nicest thing she has ever said to me.  If you have a sibling or not, or a family, I still recommend this game. It has this quality that makes it impossible to put down.Overall:Gameplay and visuals are good, and the story is sweet, captivating, and moving. If you are being economical though, buy it during a sale. With its short length it’s just like going to the movies, except this one is much better than watching a movie.			"

												I'm not normally a fan of Indie games, but this game is beautiful.You control two brothers with each analog stick [cannot be played without a controller]. It takes some getting used to.The game takes the brothers on a quest to find medicine for your sick father. You encounter various puzzles and challenges along the way. This game is as dark as it is beautiful, a brave call by the devs. The world is breathtaking and music is pleasant. This is one of those games that will leave a bitter-sweet memory with you after you finish it. Its 90% off during the sale so there is no real excuse not to buy it.9/10			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a pretty short game but still impressive in a way that sort of makes it necessary to describe it in what in other places rightfully can be called drop-words. Brothers offers an experience, an experience of mystery and fantasy carried by beautiful and haunting and gruesome pictures and music.The controls are somewhat strange but you will get used to them quickly and then easily intuit your way around.Even though I completed the game in every way in less than four hours I feel this was a very worthwhile game giving me more satisfaction than some 10-15 hour games. This game is a very well-produced gem of a game.I seriously recommend Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and it happens to be on sale right now.			"

												4/5This game is quaint, refreshing and beautiful. Everything from its soundtrack, to its visual design, its unique mechanics, and its cathartic and original story telling makes this game a must play.You play as two brothers, journeying across a beautiful, unfamiliar and often hostile land as they search for the waters of the mystical tree of life, in an effort to save their dying father. The only real set-back (and, unfortunately, it's a substantial one) is the fact that the controls are a little buggy at some integral points in the game and, if your experience is anything like mine, you will only move past these points by sheer chance and not by any feat of problem solving, which is a little dissapointing.

												""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" is a quiet, magical adventure. It's more of an experience as a actual game. Although it has mechanisms, puzzles, levels, chapters and opponents, but it is mainly a journey into the unknown. And on this trip you will experience an amazing range of emotions: excitement, exuberance, shock, sadness, triumph and amazement. And all this happens without words are spoken.The game puts you in the role of an unequal pair of brothers - somewhere in an idyllic fantasy world in the style of Scandinavian myths. The big brother is strong, brave and experienced. The little one is a bit hesitant. He can't swim, for example. But his size is a clear advantage. He has no trouble squeezing through small gaps. You control both guys at the same time - with the two analog sticks of your gamepad. The keyboard control is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up, so don't waste your time on that. With a pad in hand, however, ""Brothers"" turns quickly as clever finger exercise in game design.The adventure starts quite slowly. First, you explore the local village but later you will meet Fable figures, explore a mine full of strange equipment, crosses creepy forests, and visit the scenes of past battles. I took some of my personal best screenshots, while playing ""Brothers"". Feel free to check them out.I would really like to describe the brillant moments now, but to enjoy the game right, I will stay with suggestions. Also: ""Brothers"" is moving, surprising, unique and for me one of the most thrilling games of the last years.			"

												Absolutely beautiful and intriguing - I could not put the controller down! However, a little simple, could be more challenging (I mean even though each character must be controlled at the same time with opposite halves of the controller - which is an intriguing way to play - I felt like it exercised both halves of my brain at once) and I was *having a lot of problems with saving the game until I went and manually added a folder to My Documents with the game's name (then it started saving check points automatically). I love the ending - I won't give it away but it is so depressing and amazing that they make you do that - serioiusly saidstic in a way but I am in love with it - couldn't have been a better ending!Thank you - make more games!

												Perfect. If I had to use another word it would be epic. The noun, ""An extended narrative poem in elevated or dignified language, celebrating the feats of a deity or demigod (heroic epic) or other legendary or traditional hero."" Change that last bit to heroes and strike extended and you have this game.There was not a moment in this game that wasn't beautiful to the point of breathtaking, not a mechanic that didn't work perfectly, not a puzzle that wasn't a joy.The screenshots mostly show the pastoral opening, but there are many more and completely varied yet seamlessly linked settings, all at least as beautiful.And last, but certainly not least, the story.

												If you were dismayed that you were never able to play Journey because it was a Playstation exclusive, or played it and wanted more, look no further: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is the Journey for the PC platform.The characters are silent but expressive. The environments colorful and vibrant, yet at times dark and twisted. The path is straightforward, but full of hidden secrets along the way. This is not a game of reflexes and precision - there is no user interface to distract the player from everything that goes on. This is one of those fancy shmancy 'all about the experience' games; if you're not the type of player who likes a slower paced game, Brothers will not appeal to you. However, if an odyssey through gorgeous unknown lands with a silent storytelling scheme sounds like your kind of game, Brothers is the kind of game where you can get lost in.The game is played from the perspective of the two Brothers, controlled simultaneously. Despite the label, you do not need a controller to play this game; keyboard alone will work fine, though a controller will feel more natural. The two brothers have only two actions: moving, and a context-sensitive action button. It may not seem complex, but when you coordinate the two brothers at once to navigate puzzles, a single action button per brother is plenty. The brothers may move in similar fashion, but you soon learn they have their own strengths, which I will not spoil as some of them are story-centric.And did I mention the environment is astounding? There are countless hidden secrets and interactables, with the two brothers reacting differently to most of them. Everything in this game is hand-crafted and visually stunning. No lens-flare, no blood-on-the-camera, just luscious amounts of scenery porn. If you're packing a good graphics card, this is where you'll be happy to have it.You would think a game where one controls two characters independently to be confusing, but it successfully creates a challenge rather than an annoying gimmick. Imaginative and inspiring, melding gameplay with adventure, Brothers is going to be a must-have for most people. If one wonders whether or not gameplay is art, wonder no longer - you'll be too engrossed in this game to care.The only criticism is the stupid lever at the start of the game. God damn that lever.The game is also pretty short; there's no doubt it's thorough, well-paced, and end at a good time, but it does leave one wanting to find more....P.S.: As a side note, the game can also be crudely played with two people, one controlling each brother. While it may take away from the mechanical challenge of having to control two entities, it throws in a fun teamwork element and allows you to enjoy the game with a second person. We played with one person on keyboard and another on controller, but having two people on keyboard is also possible. Since the game is not 'meant' to be played this way, you may find some parts easier or more difficult than normal, but I can attest that the game will still be satisfying to play.			"

www.suchgameshame.com For my first game of 2015 I decided to give Brother AToTS the time it so rightfully deserves.I have had this game sitting in my library since the summer sale on steam in 2014. Truth be told I tried to play it before, only committing 23 minutes to it before stopping and subsequently never playing it again. THE SHAME.But now, I am delighted to say I have finished it and oh my days, what an emotional roller coaster! The notebook which I used to jot down important moments or feelings I had it filled with tear stains and smiley faces. This game is of the standard of The Last of Us... WITHOUT using any bleedin' words!! :/  WOW.The very first thing I wrote in the note book was - ""Brothers begins with kicking you full force in your emotional testicles.""And the last thing I wrote in the notebook was - "" : ( "" (sad face)I feel ashamed I haven't played this already! It took only 2 hours of my time, but left a bigger impact than any other game I can think of (except for TLOU). This game goes for €2.79 during the sales.  BUY IT, AND PLAY IT.The story is about 2 brothers who set out on an adventure to save their father from an illness. You are given a map and sent on your way to find a cure for him. The game play is interesting, I used a DualShock 4, my left analog was the older brother and the right analog was the younger. It took some getting use to, and I had to stop every now and again to switch the brothers back to their left and right side respectively because my brain couldn't cope with them being on the opposite sides to their positions on the controller. I think that's a problem with my brain though, maybe some people wouldn't have any issues here.The game uses simple platforming and puzzles to allow you to traverse the environments. I was never frustrated by any of them and I think they were used to the best of the developers abilities to include interesting game mechanics that supported the player experiencing the story and world and never becoming bogged down my the controls themselves.The aesthetics's in the beginning bored me...I'll be honest. I thought they where child like and fable-ish. Maybe that's why I stopped my first play through. But let me tell you the game quickly grows into itself and within the first half an hour you encounter creatures and vista's that genuinely make you smile, you know like that smile your dog does when you come home from work. That sort of silly smiley, dopey in a way but utterly infectious and it instantly makes everything better? YEAH, this game does it to you every couple of minutes. :OThe world is filled with some many interesting concepts and creatures, from Giants to crazy Cults, Griffins to Orca creatures. I was captivated and kept in the lore of the world. You'll explore desolate spider dungeons and mountains where Giants fight. The game is engrossing and adorable. It has a charm that I was not expecting at all, I found myself invested in the world and I loved every second.Music is top notch and would frequently gave me chills & thrills depending on what was happening. I was certainly not left wanting by it in anyway shape or form.Ok so I'll wrap this up with listing off  the order my emotions and feelings during my playthrough :Emotional kick to the nuts,Adorable,Exciting,Haunting,Lighthearted,Fun,Devastated,Speechless,Whimsical,SPIDER BABY,♥♥♥♥ No,Stupid Spider Baby FUUU,Incredible Magic Tree,Chills,Relief,Distraught,Can't Even, :(.And that's just what I could make out on my tear stained pages. lol. If you have this game and haven't played it then stop being a Procrastinating Gamer and do it already you won't regret it. If you don't own it... GO BUY IT.... and then play it... RIGHT NOW!			"

												Brothers is a game where two brothers embark on a quest to bring back water from a giant tree far away from home to cure their father. I didn't really expect anything when I bought and played this game, and boy I was in for a treat. The cinematography in this game is amazing, there are many times you would have that urge to just stop for a moment and take a screenshot of where you are.In this game, you have to rely on what you see to understand what is happening. The characters do speak, but you won't really understand much since they speak a fictional language. This does raise a few questions here and there, but overall they do a fantastic job at painting the tone of the world. The gameplay is unique, and I recommend using the controller for the best experience. Storywise? Amazing. There are several memorable moments, some of joy while others of somber and they sure know how to hit them feels. During my initial playthrough I had mixed feelings about the story. But upon rethinking I can appreciate how they did the story. This is a story of two brothers, travelling in a beautiful but harsh world. They live in a world where there is love and kindness, but they must also be cautious and prepared for the dangers hiding in every corner.The only thing I would complain is that the playtime is a bit short, but other than that it's a 10/10 to me. Highly recommended game.			"

												Bought this game during the Winter sale. Beat it in almost three and a half hours. The game is beautiful, both in the visuals and the storyline. Though the characters speak in a made up language and there is no way to possibly know what's being said, you still know what is happening at the moment. The gameplay itself is different, as you must control both brothers at the same time to get anywhere (there's only so far one brother can go without the other). I thought I could control them no problem. I have never been so wrong in all my life.This game is definitely worth picking up if you want a fun, pretty game with a great story. Plus you get to throw a child's ball into a well and make her cry!			"

												A beautiful game.  A Narnia-esque world accompanied by a musical score that accents all the emotional moments, as well as utilizing silence in some of the best ways I have seen in video games.  A modern twist on a side-scrolling platformer, 'Brothers' has you controlling two separate characters with each joystick (or opposite sides of the keyboard), and I recommend keeping each brother on the side of the screen that corresponds to his control side.  This control scheme works brilliantly and I am sure will be copied for years to come.All I will say about this game is that it is a must play.  The collision detection can be off, some pop-in may occur and your character might not do exactly what you want on occasion, but to let any of these minor flaws deter you from playing this game would be a shame.  It manages to bring together ideas from games like Uncharted, God of War, Journey and Heavy Rain all into a 3 hour storytelling masterpiece.Worth it at full price, easy, and the biggest steal ever when it goes on sale (80% off on occasion!). Do yourself a favor, buy this game.  Take your time.  Explore off the beaten path, when you can, and just enjoy it.  Do your best to avoid spoilers and you will be handsomely rewarded.			"

												Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a neat little game with a well-structured plot that is interwoven rather well with its novel control scheme. Unfortunately, however, it leaves much to be desired in terms of core gameplay.Despite the presence of weak puzzling and platforming elements, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is little more than a “press forward to win” game albeit one with a somewhat interesting, but often derpy, control scheme. I used a gamepad on my playthrough and found the controls to be quite intuitive for the most part. If Lefty/Righty finds his way to the right/left of his sibling, however, what was once practical quickly becomes a derpfest of wrestling with the controls. It's not particularly bothersome but it does serve to emphasise how, with a duration of just two to three hours, I barely had time to get comfortable with the controls. Yet, in this short time, I still found many elements of gameplay tedious and repetitive. Expect to slog through the same “puzzle” several times in quick succession and spend most of your time moving forward unchallenged by NPCs or the environment.Without any sense of challenge or urgency, I felt like I was just going through the motions and waiting for the climax. I believe the pay-off in the final stages of the game was fantastic but the larger experience left me unsatisfied. The story itself was fine and characterisation was done quite well, and rather innovatively, despite the short play time. The use of a gibberish non-language throughout, however, really detracted from what might otherwise have been emotive moments. I laughed when my characters were frustrated, upset or afraid and I urged them to STFU when they expressed their anguish.Looking back on some of the screenshots I took, there were many areas that struck me visually and I thought the art direction was beautifully executed. One visual gripe I have with the game is that every time there is a cutscene, a substantial portion of screen real estate is wasted on black bars. This was a design choice and one that audiences, as I certainly did, may find jarring throughout their time with the game. The intended audience of this game is a little murky; I kept thinking the gameplay might be well-placed in a game for children but that notion just doesn't sit well with the game's many grim tonal shifts.Overall, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a technically polished game with a lot of potential but it's hard to recommend it on the basis of anything but its fleeting novelty.Unidimensional, unchallenging, mercifully short.Still worth a look.

I always considered myself Mr. ""PC Master Race"" keyboard/mouse guy, so I thought to myself, ""yea yea whatevs...I'll give it a shot"". Within 2 minutes of firing up this gem I was hooked. The art design is absolutely gorgeous. The environment and scenery are lush and beautiful. The character animations are mind blowing. Little touches, like stopping to pet a kitty, or messing with an old curmudgeon...things that don't forward progress, yet they took the time and effort to give the animations such care and character. True art. The puzzles are quite unique as well. Not difficult, but because of controlling two characters at once, they are unusual. Trapping the ogre in the cage...and then getting to taunt him! Classic stuff! Above and beyond all else though, the story is universal subject matter that most everyone can relate to, and will gloriously pull at your heart strings. Heavy moments, coupled with all the cute and clever moments, make it one you will remember forever.Playing this game feels like living out a childrens book. I truly believe we have a timeless classic here. The kind of game that won't age, or become obsolete over time, like most video games do.			"

												Fantastic game, you really do need a controller to enjoy the game properly though. My first attempt to play without a controller put me off the game, I hadn't a clue what was going on, but once I switched to my controller everything made sense. It's full of little extras waiting to be poked or explored, the game looks beautiful and plays smooth. Didn't run into any issues other than challenging puzzles :)			"

												This is a wonderful immersive game. Don't expect spectacular gameplay, but the story and atmosphere definitely make up for it. The game isn't very long, it took me about 3 hours to complete and another 1,5h to complete the achievements in a second run. I would recommend using a controller playing this game (I used a XBOX 360 controller, which worked great).			"

												Bought cheap on sale and was very happily surprised. It's not a challenge and it's not something that's replayable or has long term goals/progression.BUT for a couple of quid it'll give you 4/5 hours of enjoyable fun, following the story of the two brothers. The unique feeling however comes from the different way it portrays that story. You control both brothers at the same time but only have movement and 1 interact button each and follow a linear but not exactly 2d setting through the world. There are lots of fun puzzles to complete and a well  told story through cutscenes.Like I said it's not going to give you months of play time but it's novel, unique and down right entertaining, definitely money's worth.

												Brothers is a puzzel game for people who don't like puzzels and its an RPG without a complex lore and meandering quests. It has a beautiful asthetic and great visual direction. My only complaint is you have to hold down LT and RT throughout many puzzels in the game to hold/interact with certain objects. Holding down those triggers strained my index fingers. The normal price of $15 might be a little steap for some gamers, but if the game goes under $5 than snag it. Its a great game to sit down alone one night and experience a simple and poignant tale. Play with a controller. I recommend it.			"

												Absolutely amazing. Easily one of the greatest experiences I've ever had with a game. I don't think a game has ever evoked so many personal emotions from me. I am a younger brother and my elder is 6 years apart from me. This game truly touches me on a deep level with the utilization of sound, music, lighting, voicing, expression, and atmosphere. Although the characters speak in an indistiguishable language (mostly, apart from the brothers' names), their vocubulary leaves nothing to be desired and is communicated flawlessly. I believe this was intentional and means to give the player the ability to fill in the blanks with what (s)he feels appropriate, which is likely something personal and easy to connect with.The characters themselves are easy to relate to and offer excellent development as characters. The story is extremely simple, but communicated in such a beautiful way, I can't help but be floored this game lasted me nearly 3 hours. I already want to play it through a second time and find if there was anything I missed (other than achievements which are very satisfying and well hidden) which would give more richness to the world itself. The character models may not suit my taste, however, the art style makes up for any personal issue I have with the models themselves. I've taken a handful of screenshots from this game and am one right-click away from setting one as my desktop background.The game itself offers many puzzles and challenges which are never frustrating, yet still require thought and patience to accomplish. The flow of the gameplay has never once been interrupted for me and leaves very very little room for criticism. I'm greatly impressed with how the developers managed to keep such a simple mechanic of using two joysticks to control each brother sp fresh and entertaining even while repeating some puzzles over again. The game continually gets easier as the player becomes accustomed to the mechanics, but there are plenty of instances where I've had to stop and rearrange the brothers because I had trouble keeping the two moving naturally. This is not the game's fault at all, rather it is my own and the game should be praised for continuing to challenge me with such a simple and logical mechanic, but still retaining its challenge by requiring constant attention. Excellent puzzles and mechanics; they offer many challenges.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, challenging multitasking, rich worlds with deep story, has an appreciation for music and environment, and especially anyone with a brother (hell, even a sister) who they care deeply for. You will not regret this purchase or the time you invest into it.			"

												At first I thought the controls were insane and that such a mechanic could never work, but after probably 10 minutes of playing I found it to be relateivly easy to control the two brothers simultaneously and discovered 'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons' to be one of the most enriching and emotional puzzle games I have ever played. I laughed, I wept, and I wept some more (seriously dude, this (insert slang for fecal matter) is emotional). The sound track pairs perfectly with the amazing Nordic environment in which this great tale plays out in. My only quarrel is that it was short, as I was left wanting more and more. An amazing game, recommend blazing it before playing. 4/5 waffle irons. p.s. My favourite part was when you ride the goats.			"

												A very short but fantastically paced game, moving from local shenanigans to exploring desolate castles, assisting trolls, barren battlefields filled with dead giants and giant invisible yetis in the snow. All this contained in a wonderful visual style and fleshed out with (what appears to be) interesting Nordic lore. Mechanically fascinating due to its two character system, taking something that could be multiplayer but maps it all to one pad. Due to the mechanical reliance of the characters with one another it enhances the story's impact.Possibly one of the most fantastic short game experiences I've had in a very long time. If you were a fan of games in the style of team Ico's this is very highly advised.			"

												I played this game with an xbox controller so this is how I am reviewing it. It was really interesting and challenging to control both of the brothers at the same time. One half of the control controlled the younger brother and the other half controlled the older brother. The controls, however, weren't difficult to understand since only the 2 scroll buttons and the triggers are used. Past the controllers, there was absolutely no dialogue which kind of threw me off at first, but once I played a bit more, I realized the game didn't need dialogue. The story was pretty straight forward, however twisty it DOES get at the end, and it gives you exactly what you need as you go through it. The graphics and artwork in this game are absolutely astounding. I'd play this game over and over again just so I could get a look at the scenery. There are little benches all over so if you see them, PLEASE sit down and scroll around you really will not regret it, it's amazing. The story isn't very long, but it still makes you feel very attached to the characters. This is much more like a visual story game than anything, even though you control the brothers, because there is only one ending but the story is so interesting that it's worth it. I didn't really find anything I disliked about the game. I mean, yes, it was a bit difficult to control both of the brothers at the same time, but I think that added to the interest level. I feel like if I was only playing one of the brothers, it wouldn't have been so imersive. This also made me feel connected to the two brothers because I was able to see how most of the things you needed to do, came with the reliance of the two brothers. You wouldn't have been able to finish the story if you didn't have both of them...			"

												A riveting experience, though it is a rather short one. I finished the game in about 3 hours, but I did not thoroughly investigate all of the areas, so some might get an extra hour out of it. While the game isn't difficult, I don't think that's the point of it. Rather, the fun part of the game is experiencing the absolutely wonderful world that the developers have crafted. The variety and creativity of the locales that you visit is stunning. Although the character models look slightly jarring in their quality, the world itself is well-textured and modeled. Lastly, it's a pretty emotional experience that really hits home, as the  game's story really gets you invested in the two brothers.			"

												First off ignore my playtime, the game took me about 4-5 hours to complete, but steam inadvertantly crashed halfway through the game.(the game strangely enough kept running)   I'm going to avoid saying much more about the game to avoid spoilers but let me just say this, its a casual 3d puzzle platformer with a unique gameplay twist of controlling 2 characters at the same time.  It has a beautifully written story that is told through atmosphere not lengthy cutscenes or dialog.  The game will wow you on many occasions and it will break your heart on others.Pros: Wonderful storytelling, artwork, sound effects.  Gameplay is simple but inventive.  Made me cry more than once.  Low asking price.Cons: A rather short game, not many graphics options(though the game ran amazinging at 1900x1200 for me but of course milage may vary)  The game doesnt offer much in the way of difficulty and many might be put off by this.while I didnt put this in the cons list because the mechanics of the game simply demand a controller, some might find the requirement of a controller a dealbreaker, but when you play the game you'll understand why its necessary.

												Really enjoyed it. Quite simple but very addictive story, many great looking environments (I was sitting on every bench I encountered just to take a look at beautiful view).But biggest and most surprising element of the game for me was, how controller is used to tell the story. It's hard to explain without spoiling the game for you, so I won't even try it. You have to trust me on that ;)To fully experience this game it is important to play it yourself. Don't try to watch ""let's play"" of it. You won't experience it the way you should. Just make sure no one will disturb you, start playing it  and enjoy it. :)One thing I would suggest to consider before buying it, is how much you're willing to pay for it. It's between 2.5 and 3 hours of gameplay, so best way is to decide, how much 2-3 hours of having fun is worth for you. If you're willing to pay full price - great. If you prefer to pay a little less, that's OK too. Just wait for discount in that case and get it then.			"

												Brothers has motivated me to write my first review on steam. This game is truly a piece of art that provides a deeply moving human experience. 9/10ProsVisually spectacular.  - Not pushing any graphical boundaries but each landscape is masterfully thought our and I found myself just wanting to stop and stare at the artMost unique game mechanic I've experience in years- I thoroughly enjoyed a fresh spin on game play. Controlling the two brothers independently was an enjoyable challenge. - Most emotionally stirring use of a game mechanic I've ever experienced. Amazing Story Telling without understandable language- The game does not have one word of English and does not have subtitles but it works.- Distinct characters with a clear identity.- Perhaps the most moving ending I've experience in a game.ConsGame play doesn't push boundaries enough.- Game was fresh but the new mechanic could have been pushed a bit further. ( I hope other people take up the format to take is even father.)Short- I'm not sure if this is a con. "

												It's been a while since I bothered commending a game but this has been a real pleasure to play from start to finish. I bought it because a friend had said they'd enjoyed it and the graphics looked welcoming and fresh. It was, however, the story and gameplay that captured me. The idea of using one controller to move and interact with two characters was fascinating and fun - I had to think a little more when it came to movement as puzzles which I really liked. The story though was love;y. Simple, yet deeply touching. I finished the game on New Year's Day and shed a tear in its subtle yet moving telling. I woulc recommend this story to anyone who wants to play something new and different. It doesn't take long to finish but the environment and pace of the story makes it all very worthwhile.			"

The only criticism I have is the random moment when the game minimized itself and went back to my desktop while in mid-play; it only happened once, so I'm not upset about it. There were also a couple of times when it lagged just a bit, but again those were not a regular thing. I'll probably play through it again to get the few achievements I missed.

Most of the puzzles were solid, but there were some that felt contrived, as if they'd been added only to show off some twist on the mechanics. Despite these minor issues, the game is really, really good overall. It's worth buying for the visuals and sheer epic-ness of the story alone... and the way the mechanics tie in with the story (especially in the last sections of the game) is something truly special.

												From the very beginning - this game is trying to captivate you - and you should let it. It's a fantastical fairy tale about two brother's adventures to get to a magic spring with water to heal their father's ailment - lots of interesting graphical eye candy regions, this is another one of those games that makes the line between story, art, and game very blurry. It only lasts about 3 hours, but its much like a good movie - you'll want to play it again after seeing the story the first time, and to also look for all the hidden spots!			"

A strong impactful story that's beautifully crafted and even taking into account how the gameplay mechanic can play a part in being an impact in the emotions of the story. Truly a one of a kind gameplay.Take your time slowly to explore the environment rather than just breezing through and ignoring all the little things around.

												No words can describe how amazing this game is. You are fully immersed in this game from begining to end. The simple motivation of two brothers wanting to save their dad is an honest goal in itself, but for these two to go above and beyond to continue. With no dialog (thats understandable) what so ever, you feel deep down what is driving these two. Other people might not see it as I do, but the younger brother continues out of fear; the fear of losing a father, not knowing the fate they are to be left in without a watchful protecter- while the older brother acts out of love; love for his little brother, to show him not all is lost, that their is always hope. Well not those words exactly, but whatever.Replay value is high especially when you want to show an incredble adventure to others who have never played. The game is bitter sweet so if you can't handle feels you should brace yourself. This game will forever be in my top 10 Favorite games, atleast as indie games go.			"

WARNING: SPOILERS WILL BE COVERED BY BLACK BOXES LIKE THIS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO SEE THEM, DO NOT MOUSE OVER THEM.After replaying through this game again a few nights ago, I realize that I still haven't written a review for it. Well, better late than never (holy crap, it's already been almost a year?!).If I were to run into you on the street, and (for God only knows what reason) you wanted my overall thoughts on the game in a single sentence, I'd tell you, ""I don't know why you're talking to me and not playing this game."" I'm not exaggerating when I say that Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is the best indie game and possibly the greatest game I have ever played. Honestly, if you're just reading this to see if the game's worth $15, take my word for it. I would refuse to pay a cent less for such a fantastic game.For those who don't know, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a short adventure puzzle platformer in which each half of your controller (or keyboard, as I hear does work, but I'd imagine it's a bit wonky) controls a separate character - brothers Naia (older - left half) and Naiee (younger - right half). As far as I'm aware, the game is virtually glitchless, although I did have an instance where Naiee fell through the floor and died while picking up a turtle for a sidequest. Speaking of the quest, it's actually incredibly linear, but not in a bad way. The game's layout could not be better suited for the story. Not EVERY game has to be ""like Skyrim with guns"" as the saying goes. The gameplay is innovative and even plays a crucial role in the story. SPOILER TAG: ""A friend is one soul in two bodies."" -Aristotle When the creator tried getting companies to publish the game, he said it's a singleplayer experience in the guise of a co-op game. Thank God Starbreeze came along and took interest in the game, else we wouldn't have this masterpiece to talk about. However, personally I played this with a friend sharing a controller the first time through, and I would have to disagree. It's equally as great either way. With a friend, it's easier to manage, having to only focus on one character, and the storyline immerses you into creating almost brotherly bonds. However, it's just as good to play alone, because you can experience the story the way it was intended - by not fearing to shed your manly tears in front of your comrades.Speaking of which, the story is written by Josef Fares, a Swedish film writer who had a really rough childhood. SPOILER TAG: Remember the ending burial scene? Of course you do. How the hell could you forget something as touching as that? It turns out that was a childhood memory of Fares'. He always wanted a little brother, so when his mother went into labor, he was so excited. In the end, the baby died, so Fares had to bury it himself. Try thinking about that next time you play that part and try not to cry. For those who haven't played the game and are avoiding the spoiler tag, I apologize for tempting you with the enormous spoiler box. Needless to say, Fares' past experiences had a huge impact on his works, so despite what you may think, it may look cute, but there is a monster hidden within. With several instances of morbid scenes and scenery hardly scattered throughout, this game rightfully deserves its rating of T for Teen.The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen in any game ever. Screw Battlefield 4, Skyrim, or any other stereotypical games with ""realistic"" graphics. Despite having a cartoonish feel to it, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has the most atmospheric landscape of any game I have ever played. Water, foliage, shadows and sunlight, everything looks absolutely incredible. But every aspect of this game has something morbid or sad, and the graphics are no exception. Have you ever played an FPS and thought about how unrealistic blood looks? In this game, blood looks disgustingly realistic. I gagged a little bit in the land of the giants. At one point, you have to push a corpse holding an axe to chop an arm off that is blocking your path. It's incredibly morbid, and you should expect nothing less from this game.And finally the soundtrack. Whether the mood of a scene is sad, happy, epic, or scary, the music is always there to accompany it in perfect harmony (see what I did there?). With its orchestral, cinema quality soundtrack, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons uses music to make you feel the emotions that characters would feel as if these scenes had happened to you. In a story driven game like this, a fitting soundtrack is essential, because unless you are like Fares, you can't relate to all these dark and depressing events, and an emotional soundtrack can give you a push. Obviously, this feeling is nothing close to how it would be if these things actually happened to you, but it's probably as close as we would ever want to be.TL;DR: The game's graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, and most of all storyline are all phenomenal. Don't be fooled, this game is dark. It's a bit short at around 3 hours, but it's fun to replay and reexperience the overwhelming emotions it will give you.Overall rating: 10/10			"

It could have been better with real dialogues, but it could also have been worse as it is often difficult to obtain real emotions in games.Quite simple puzzles, but totally worth buying anyway, then the environment and the story is simply incredible.

												Honestly, what can I say... I never cried so much in my life. This is not a game for very sensible persons (like me). I just finished the game and I need to hug my teddy bear really long to get over the story.In terms of gameplay, I actually have nothing negative to report. The controls are simple but can still confuse as you go on in the adventure. The puzzles are quick to understand and can be solved without experiencing much frustration. Sometimes, I think it might be a little bit too easy. There is no part where you can get stuck or that is really challenging in my opinion. Still, I don't see it as a problem since the game is not about feeling awesome after solving a hard puzzle or bypassing a large obstacle and more about telling the story of the brothers. Difficult puzzles would maybe ruin this experience.The narrative of the story is just fantastic. Even without using an acutal understandable language (the characters in this game speak some a made-up language + there are no subtitles), it is always clear what the characters in the game are saying or what they are talking about (also because they use gestures which helps out a lot). The story and (if existend) the relation of the individual characters is easily understandable.Sure, the game is pretty short (it took me two hours to finish it without having all achievements) but I think it's the right length. Since the gameplay is simple, you can only do so much to keep it fresh and entertaining. Maybe one level more wouldn't have hurt but I don't think it's necessary either.All in all, Borther - A Tale of Two Sons is an entertaining, small and also emotional experience. If you're looking for a quick and fun game and you're not the most sensible person out there (*sob*), definitly check out this game!			"

												I have not yet finished the game, but if the first level is any indication it may be heading to my list of favourite single player games. This game has caught me by surprise (much like XCOM: Enemy Unknown did). However, unlike the technical praise I might give XCOM:EU, I found the story and simplicity of the game to be a refreshing change of pace.The interface to the game comes in the form of a ""unique single player cooperative experience"". That description is quite accurate but I would not label it as the biggest selling point of the game. Although the experience is very unique, it can at times be a bit overwhelming. The unique controls are not enough to detract from the presentation of the story. I've found many of the puzzles challenging enough without being impossible. But the interface to the game is not what draws me to it, rather it is the presentation that gives it a special place in my collection.We live in a time where all forms of media are pushing the boundaries of privacy, violence and sex. Rarely do we see anything from music videos to video games that can't succeed without a healthy dose of one or all of the above. I only point out this fact because this game is presented with what you might call a traditional sense of innocence. It reminds me of simpler times when movies like Milo and Otis and Homeward Bound would provide enough escape from the oft-times drab realities of our daily lives. Don't get me wrong the game does have violence, so did Milo & Otis and Homeward Bound. There's a vast difference between the violence presented in those movies (and in the game) and the kind we see on HBO's latest ""adventure"" TV show.This game doesn't replace those more adult-themed shows, movies and games that I do enjoy. Rather this game is something apart from them, it strikes that simplistic adventure nerve just right to keep me coming back for a little more every night.Do I recommend the game? Absolutely, just remember to hang your cynicism at the door and bring your heart and a sense of humour and you'll love it. :)			"

												Amazing 3d  platforming aduventure puzzler game that requires you to controll not one but two brothers as they journey on a quest. The only thing going against is that a joypad is pretty much a must for this game. It can be done by keyboard as well but ofc its even harder. Anyways the game is one of the most enthralling game I have ever played			"

												This game man, this game.Due to the effectiveness of the controls and their involvement with the story and the player, this is a game that MUST be played, not watched. It uses deceptively simple platforming and mechanics to involve you in a world that, as little as you see, still feels alive.Definitely give this game a try if you are interested in puzzle platforming and love a good story. Be prepared to fall in love with it by the end.			"

												A game that makes you feel away from home. You get to experience from the thrill of adventure to the depressing yet beautiful consequence. Yes, this is a game you play to experience, not to win. On technical side, you control 2 brothers simultaneously to solve puzzles. For this, a controller with two sticks is recommended. That's basically all you do in this game, but the magic lies in atmosphere, not the actual puzzle solving itself.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a controller and ready for simple puzzle.

												Just completed this. Game was short, about 3-3,5h but it was still worth the money.Few games can bring so many emotions through without even using any words during the whole game.In the game you control the two brothers at the same time and solve puzzles and progress forward in your quest. I recommend using 360 or other game pad for this, with keyboard and mouse I presume that controlling them would have been some what frustrating.Really can't say much without spoilers, just try it and play it. It's worth it.			"

												Rating: 4.5/5Brothers is a relatively short game, but is rich in story and art.  The single-player co-op experience is handled very well: the puzzles challenge your multi-tasking ability without seeming too unfair.  There are plenty of checkpoints so it's never stressfull.  The world's scenery is simplistic, yet stunningly beautiful; the accompanying music sets each scene's tone perfectly.One aspect that I like about the game is that the brothers can interact with the world around them - even if it doesn't add to the story; it makes them seem a lot more human than a lot of other linear games I've played.The only part that I didn't like too much was the end.  While I get the reason for the ending, the way the scene is shot before the credits roll conflicts with the rest of the narrative.Once you've played through the whole game, there isn't much other replay value besides collecting all the easy achievements.

												Beautiful, Emotional, cinematic and at all times engaging.  This is a fine example of what can be acheived when film creators make the effort with a game.  Battlefield it is not and I love it for that very reason.  In a world where the same format keeps repeating itself year after year, Brothers stands apart.The graphics are simply stunning, not because of any amazing high resolution claims or because it has super high FPS but because the designers made sure that every step looked correct, flowed properly and added to the atmosphere and emmersion or the players experience.Brothers is the very essence of a game, it does not take long to complete (approx 3 hours) but you feel like you could play it for days.  In fact it has left me wanting more from this team.A must purchase for all serious gamers and fantasy loving film buffs.  Do you want to loose your sense of reality for a few hours?  Forget the cinema, give this your attention and you will wish for more.I should add that I had the luxury of playing this on three 27"" Dell Screens in true widescreen format (FOV 143.30) and it is without doubt the best multi display game that I have played.  The game felt huge and very emmersive.  So if you want to WOW your friends with your three screen gaming rig, put this on and watch their faces. (Remember to setup the correct FOV for your setup first or everything will look too big and close up) "

This was a very enjoyable game that was fun to play, gorgeous to look at, and full of emotions.  Gameplay was probably ~3-4 hours but I spent a lot of time playing around.  It could easily be done quicker than that if one desired.  The puzzles were fun but not exceptionally challenging, but I wasn't looking for a very hard game with this.			"

												""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" is a quiet, magical adventure. It's more of an experience as a actual game. Although it has mechanisms, puzzles, levels, chapters and opponents, but it is mainly a journey into the unknown. And on this trip you will experience an amazing range of emotions: excitement, exuberance, shock, sadness, triumph and amazement. And all this happens without words are spoken.The game puts you in the role of an unequal pair of brothers - somewhere in an idyllic fantasy world in the style of Scandinavian myths. The big brother is strong, brave and experienced. The little one is a bit hesitant. He can't swim, for example. But his size is a clear advantage. He has no trouble squeezing through small gaps. You control both guys at the same time - with the two analog sticks of your gamepad. The keyboard control is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up, so don't waste your time on that. With a pad in hand, however, ""Brothers"" turns quickly as clever finger exercise in game design.The adventure starts quite slowly. First, you explore the local village but later you will meet Fable figures, explore a mine full of strange equipment, crosses creepy forests, and visit the scenes of past battles. I took some of my personal best screenshots, while playing ""Brothers"". Feel free to check them out.I would really like to describe the brillant moments now, but to enjoy the game right, I will stay with suggestions. Also: ""Brothers"" is moving, surprising, unique and for me one of the most thrilling games of the last years.			"

												4/5This game is quaint, refreshing and beautiful. Everything from its soundtrack, to its visual design, its unique mechanics, and its cathartic and original story telling makes this game a must play.You play as two brothers, journeying across a beautiful, unfamiliar and often hostile land as they search for the waters of the mystical tree of life, in an effort to save their dying father. The only real set-back (and, unfortunately, it's a substantial one) is the fact that the controls are a little buggy at some integral points in the game and, if your experience is anything like mine, you will only move past these points by sheer chance and not by any feat of problem solving, which is a little dissapointing.

												After coming off fresh from playing this game, I will go ahead and say, I thought this game was gorgeous.  Granted, the puzzles weren't too difficult, but then again, the game is called A Tale of Two Sons, not A Puzzle of Two Sons.  In its essence, this game is more of an interactive story.  However, to really get the full enjoyment and characterization out of this game, you really need to go out of your way to explore and interact with your environment.  For example, through interactions I discovered  that the younger brother is better with animals than the elder but the elder is more liked by adults .  Some take issue with the story the game tells but I found it enjoyable and enough to tug at my heartstrings at moments.  Periodically throughout the game, there will be benches that allow you to see the carefully sculpted vistas that give you a sense of the magical world these brothers live in.  Granted, the game may not have too much replay value, but you definietely owe it to yourself to play it once.  Even if you have to wait until it goes on sale to be able to do it, buy this game when you have the chance.			"

												A very outstanding game. The mechanic is very simple. Control two brothers simultaneously using a twin stick control scheme. One brother is right stick and interacts via right trigger, while the other brother is left stick and interacts via left trigger. The game manages to come up with a lot of creative ways for the two brothers to work together to overcome various types of situations. I'd like to go into specifics about all the ways the cooperation between the brothers is used, but I'm afraid it might be too spoilery to do so. Discovering each cooperation scenario is part of the discovery and fun.If there were any aspects of the game I did not like, I would say these small---very small---nitpicks:1) There were two or three spots where what I was supposed to do in a particular situation was not clear or an object that was supposed to be a handhold was not super apparent. I killed one of the brothers a few times just on account of not understanding what the game was trying to signal to me. But these moments were tiny and few.2) This is more of a peeve than an actual problem with the game but---while I typically don't mind when creators use their own made-up languages for character dialogue in a work (e.g. Ico, SotC, Ewok, Klingon, Elven, etc)---something about the made-up language in this game was sort of irritating to me. I don't know how to describe it other than to say that it was just too obviously gibberish. There was no illusion of it being an actual language. But language study/analysis is sort of close to my heart in a way that it probably won't be for most players, so this is most likely just an idiosyncrasy of mine.The game is a tad bit on the short side (about 3 hours), but it is fun and VERY beautiful to look at. I don't just mean the graphics, I mean just artistically. The composition of some of the vistas and area changes are just masterfully done.Using my own scale below, I give Brothers the full seven.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a game about puzzle,storyline,and art.While the game doesn't have any subtitles or interaction in english language, you will understand by the actions and progression of what's going on.The game lets you control of two brothers in which you must use both of them in order to progress in the game,and the more you play the more you realize of how much these brothers need each other in order to survive.While the art and the heroes may seem innocent, the story and the ending is very mature and heartbreaking.I won't spoil anything and the best way to understand of what I'm talking about is to play the game. In my opinion the game is perfect in terms of graphics,character development,gameplay,puzzle,story and so on,usually short games which are less than 4 hours of gameplay is a downside but I can't help and think that Brother - A Tale of Two Sons has caught the exact length it should be.In the end I conclude that this game is a 10/10, It a must buy and its one of the best games in 2013.

												Beautiful game. I was describing it to someone and rather liked my comparison to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. This game is an adventure/puzzle game where you control two charming young boys as they make their way through the world on a simple quest. The game is linear and the puzzles are fairly easy, but nevertheless I find myself falling in love with the game. After crawling your way through a cave and scaling the walls of a cliff, you'll find yourself with a breath-taking view of the landscape, part of which you just traversed and part of which you've yet to delve into. It's very well-polished, controls intuitively, doesn't scream in your face or break immersion with pointless tutorials. No worrying about rpg-grind elements to pad those numbers, just pure joy as you explore a world made with care. This is the kind of game that hipster gamers point to when extoling the virtues of indie gaming.			"

Unique in that the story would still  be strong even if in a different medium, although it does use the video game medium to its advantage. It has real emotional punch, and some subtle but very effective world-building. A delight all the way through. A truly lovely experience.

												I have always wanted a video game to make me cry. It is mostly my own fault as I tend to be a mechanics first, narrative second kind of player. I think it's rational enough considering that the medium should focus on the degree of interactivity first and then supplement that with a strong narrative. I wish that would happen more often. When a game focuses solely on its mechanics, the story tends to seem like an afterthought. This model has evolved over the years with new technology and larger budgets, but the primary problem is still present: there has yet to be a video game that has the perfect marriage of both. Like what Don Quixote is to books and Citizen Kane is to movies, there must be a game that can single-handedly shift this paradigm and create a new precedent. And in the most unexpected of places, I believe that I have discovered one of the most compelling narrative experiences of all time: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons. Brothers was created by Starbreeze Studios, a developer who is not typically known for small, story-driven games sold at a $15 dollar price point. In fact, the majority of their most popular titles are first person shooters with the phenomenal Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena and PAYDAY: THE HEIST leading the charge. In addition to Starbreeze's development, Brothers was aided by visionary Swedish film director, Josef Fares. It was an unusual and ambitious notion to consider a film director to help create a video game, but Starbreeze felt it was necessary, and they were right. Brothers tells the story of two brothers, one young and one old, working together in an epic journey to save their dying father by obtaining the waters at the Tree of Life. The dialogue between these brothers is done through utter gibberish as opposed to recognizable language. I wouldn't call it gibberish in the traditional sense, though, as there are some common words, such as the names of the brothers, Naiee and Nyaa, which are words heard consistently throughout the story. However, at no point does the game try to translate the language that is being spoken. It does not rely on intelligible language to tell the conventional tale; you know what you have to do even if you do not understand what you are told, either through gestures or the way that the environment presents the problem. It tells a coherent and recognizable story through complete ambiguity, and that is a remarkable achievement. On a fundamental level, Brothers is a single-player cooperative adventure game. As dichotomous as it sounds, this cooperative mechanic is true as you control each brother individually. It’s remarkably simple. The older brother, Nyaa, is controlled by the top left analog stick of the Xbox 360 controller, whereas young Naiee is by the bottom right analog stick. I have never seen a controller used in such an unconventional manner. Most games have to adapt to the interface technology; they have to build games around the way the controller works. And, of course, Brothers does that as every game has to do that to some extent. However, what Brothers manages to do is create a game that is perfectly suited to its controls and takes full advantage of what that controller has to offer.The core mechanics of Brothers exist in its platforming, puzzle solving, and control of two characters at once. The puzzles in particular are a testament to Starbreeze’s mastery of the genre. They never overstay their welcome and are always supplemented with more challenging and varied obstacles. They are not necessarily difficult puzzles, but they are satisfying ones that take advantage of the game’s unique controls. For instance, there was one sequence in which both of the brothers are tied together by a long rope. Unlike the normal freedom of movement presented throughout the game, the rope creates a unique restrictive dynamic to many of the usual tasks in the game. It makes the usually-mundane act of movement a more alien and onerous undertaking. Brothers consistently shows that it is not afraid to challenge the traditional gameplay approach in hopes for a more engaging experience.Brothers delivers the most emotionally charged stories I have ever experienced within a video game. Have I cried at the movies before? Sure. Have I cried when reading a book? Absolutely. However, I have never felt such a powerful emotional reaction with any video game until I played Brothers — and I am thrilled to admit that. I not only cried, I experienced a full breadth of emotional responses including sadness, happiness, wanderlust, horror, and most importantly in a game about family, compassion. And all of these emotions are delivered in a fantastic and mature way that at no point ever feels forced. Everything feels genuine; and it elicits all of these emotional responses without ever telling you to feel in a certain way. It does not tell its story through exposition-laden cut scenes or a bunch of celebrity voice acting. It did it by simply showing you this thematically beautiful world and allowing you to get immersed and involved in it, and many games struggle to achieve that. Brothers, unfortunately, suffers from some problems. There is no real question about that. Most of the time it comes from the game’s rigid adherence to the physical location where each brother must stand when taking part in an action. The game requires that each of those characters stand in a set position, and if you are standing in the opposite position it will awkwardly swap them over and rotate the characters. To see such unnatural movements within a mechanically focused game like Brothers is jarring, and unfortunately it made for a less immersive experience at times. I would also heavily criticize the aesthetic of the game. While its art direction is serviceable, the actual graphical fidelity leaves something to be desired. There were a few textures that looked outright hideous, and the design of many of the character models felt uninspired. It then became glaringly obvious that Starbreeze allocated most of its resources to the design of the brothers rather than the fidelity of the world in which they inhabit. Nevertheless, in those spellbinding moments before the games conclusion, it is hard to remember what, if anything, was wrong with the game in the first place.The culmination of the Brothers experience lies in its masterfully presented ending.  It doesn’t just show you this powerful ending moment and expect an emotional response; it lets you play it. It lets you conduct this horrifying moment in its entirety. And suddenly, you realize that this game was never telling you a story; you were playing the story. Your journey was the story. And that’s when I cried.			"

												Beautiful, Emotional, cinematic and at all times engaging.  This is a fine example of what can be acheived when film creators make the effort with a game.  Battlefield it is not and I love it for that very reason.  In a world where the same format keeps repeating itself year after year, Brothers stands apart.The graphics are simply stunning, not because of any amazing high resolution claims or because it has super high FPS but because the designers made sure that every step looked correct, flowed properly and added to the atmosphere and emmersion or the players experience.Brothers is the very essence of a game, it does not take long to complete (approx 3 hours) but you feel like you could play it for days.  In fact it has left me wanting more from this team.A must purchase for all serious gamers and fantasy loving film buffs.  Do you want to loose your sense of reality for a few hours?  Forget the cinema, give this your attention and you will wish for more.I should add that I had the luxury of playing this on three 27"" Dell Screens in true widescreen format (FOV 143.30) and it is without doubt the best multi display game that I have played.  The game felt huge and very emmersive.  So if you want to WOW your friends with your three screen gaming rig, put this on and watch their faces. (Remember to setup the correct FOV for your setup first or everything will look too big and close up) "

But there is one thing in particular that this game made me do, and that is (for the first time in gaming history in my life) made me cry.

												This game proves that a game doesn't have to be made by some big publisher or need to have hours of gameplay. This game shows that a game just needs to have a good story as well as some good gameplay and ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" does just that.The story follows two brothers - the younger brother Naiee and the older brother Naia, the story begins with Naiee praying at his mother's grave who drowned at sea while he was unable to save her. Naia then calls upon Naiee to help carry his ill father to the village doctor. Upon arriving to the doctor, the doctor informs them that he cannot save their father unless they collect the magical water of a mystical tree in a far away land. The story then follows them on their adventure to retrieve the water to cure their father with them facing many challenges and meeting many interesting characters while on their adventure. The story is very immersive and emotional even though the idea is very simplistic and gets enjoyable right after the first 5 minutes.In terms of gameplay, the game is very innovative when it comes to its gameplay where both brothers are controlled by one half of your controller at the same time and requires coordination by the player to pull off the brothers ""teamwork"" to overcome various obstacles and puzzles. Even though the gameplay only lasts for 2-3 hours, the game is very satisfying and I doubt that anyone will be dissapointed about its length after finishing the game.The music and sounds are one of the strongest points of the game as it is the key immersion factor of the game and it does a good job in adding the right sound track at the right time. The dialogue may be debatable, since the game has no dialogue and the vocals are like those in Sims where the game tries to show everyone as incapable of producing actual words and can only grunt or make obnoxious sounds. I feel that it added to the emotion since it was mainly expression and kind of made it as though you could decide how happy or sad the characters were but that is just my opinion and some people may dislike this factor.Overall I would say this game is a must buy for those who love immersive and emotional stories and would give this game an overall of 8.75 out of 10.

												A really memorable and well-crafted experience. It's one of the few experiences that actually reminded me of how I remember my childhood: it started with a strong fairy tale feel where something is not quite right, and gradually grew progressively grim as the brothers were thrust into a world where children are not immune to hardship. Before playing it, I was concerned it would be another recycled story about annoying/sad/bratty stock-character kids, but I'm pleased to say that it's one of the more balanced and mature portrayals of children that shows them as human beings with an actual personality.In terms of gameplay, the way they combined it with the story development makes Brothers one of gaming's gems: all the story is told through the environment and the interactions the player has with the world, and there is no (comprehensible) dialogue. The best story moments are twists based on how you control both brothers in different situations. One of my favorite examples is an area where you need to avoid detection from a monster by hiding in specific positions behind frozen statues. Another is a battlefield for giants, where navigating the environment becomes a nice twist. All the areas you explore are filled with little contextual interactions that will make you will feel like you ""toy""with this unforgiving world and its inhabitants, just like a child would. Complementing this approach is a truly special and stylized art direction, the kind that makes me stop and take screenshots every minute or so.The amount of soul & care put in the details of this game, from memorable story moments to little interactions in the world, is rare to find in games nowadays. Very short but very sweet.			"

												A very moving game. This is an example of gameplay mechanics blending with the story to create something more. Powerfully moving, I would recommend this game to anyone who things that games are nothing but shooty shooty wartime shooters. The mechanic to move both characters is unique, and also very intuitive. I didn't find it as difficult or uncomfortable as I thought it would be. It's an idea that I had never thought of and haven't seen before. It creates a feeling of attachment to both of the characters, preventing the dreaded, ""escort quest"" feel. Their lives are in my hands as a player and I feel comfortable taking responsibility. This game does deal with mature themes in a way that doesn't completely digest or resolve them. The setting and atmosphere starts ""safe"" and somber. Then, through advancing the story the game gets into some very dark and twisted themes that are real, and also unpleasent. I am very happy I bought it. I'm very happy I stayed up all night playing it. I'd go through it again for the very first time if I could. Unfortunately I can't. So I'd ask that you do it for me.  "

												Clocking in at around 3-4 hours of gameplay Brothers might be considered a short game by some, but you'd be wise to ignore the Metacritic reviews complaining that the game's length is an indication of lazy developers; or that the game didn't capatilize on its full potential.Brothers is a charming game, that manages to provide scenic vistas and an astoundingly vast amount of narrative into those few hours that it puts some of the bigger titles this year to shame.As far as gameplay goes, puzzles are rarely difficult, but there's still enough fun to be had with what's on offer. It is important to note that using a controller is very much recommended - if you don't have a controller, go out and get a cheap one so you can play this game!			"

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a rather unique, very charming 2-3 hour adventure. It has some great art direction and some truly imaginitive areas. In an industry where some studios believe the only colours are brown and grey, it's great to see a game with such a rich colour palette. It impressivly also manages to tell a compelling and personal story without uttering a single word of dialogue, at least none that the player is meant to understand.Brothers does unfortunally have some adjusting when it comes to the controls. Using an Xbox controller you move both brothers with each analog stick, which is often confusing, but this is okay after about a half an hour or so. This problem isn't too bad and doesn't affect the expierence too much but is still a minor annoyance. Other than that Brothers controls only use two buttons to interact (one for each brother). It's a beautifully simplistic system and dispite there only being one button it always does what you expect it to thanks to clever design.Still Brothers to me is all about the journey, it creates some jaw dropping environments and contains some of the most memorable moments for me all year. You'll start off in a simple village with your dying father and go to places that seem right out of a fairy tale. It consistently introduces new gameplay mechanics and does away with them before they get stale or repetitive. Same can be said for the environments and the entire game as it's well paced and designed. As David Cage of Quantic Dream would say the game makes you feel emotion and it understands what it needs to do in order to achieve this (now if only he knew how to do that in his games). It's not for everyone, gamers who like a lot of content for their money will undoubtedly be disappointed as Brothers is quite a short expierence which really only needs to be played once for the non-completionist and it's not exactly the hardest game in the world. On top of that the game has a slow start, which is mainly used to get immeresed in this world, but may cause those who want instant gratification to be put off. Assuming that these things don't put you off then Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an easy reccomendation.			"

												If you don't believe videogames can be art, play this game and then come back and try to make that argument. You can't. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is profoundly beautiful and adventurous and packs an emotional punch that will take you a while to come back from, and all with just two thumbsticks and two action buttons. This is a great story that isn't relayed by just stringing a bunch of cutscenes together, like some sort of interactive movie where you control the action parts. In fact, not one real word is spoken or written in the entire game: all voices are a sims-like babble. The emotional impact comes from, and is deeply tied to, the interaction with you the player. It's a story that would lose something vitally important if it was told in any other medium than a video game, like trying to translate an opera into flip-book form.It's short for a video game, about two hours or so, but that's because it's pared down to almost perfection, every chapter a delight with surprises and adventures, and never overstaying it's welcome. There are no doodads to collect, and no achievements for just completing a chapter. All the achievements are just little interesting moments added to the main storyline, that you might miss the first time around. One of them involves just ignoring the urgency of the main quest to get a magic elixir to save your dad, and going to the beach and skipping stones.Play this game if you haven't already, it's great, and I doubt you could find better entertainment more worth your two hours.

												Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a pretty short game but still impressive in a way that sort of makes it necessary to describe it in what in other places rightfully can be called drop-words. Brothers offers an experience, an experience of mystery and fantasy carried by beautiful and haunting and gruesome pictures and music.The controls are somewhat strange but you will get used to them quickly and then easily intuit your way around.Even though I completed the game in every way in less than four hours I feel this was a very worthwhile game giving me more satisfaction than some 10-15 hour games. This game is a very well-produced gem of a game.I seriously recommend Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and it happens to be on sale right now.			"

												It's a coming of age story told through video game mechanics and folklore. The game really beautifully explores the dual relationship between the brothers and manages to keep that fresh throughout. It constantly introduces new concepts for traversing a really breathtaking environment. I was really stunned by Brothers and I'd definitely recommend it as something that introduces really original and thoughtful gameplay and expresses the power of video games as a storytelling medium. Additionally the game made thorough use of the controller by joysticks and triggers. I personally played with a ps3 controller. I'd recommend playing it with one.			"

												This game is short but was a nice introduction to playing PC games with a controller for me. I bought the steam controller with the hopes that this game will be more immersive or just more fun to play. It actually wasn't that smooth out of the box, at least to control the little brother I had to go into the settings and adjust sensitivities. But that was a nice thing to get exposed to, I'm glad.The game is beautiful, especially in the landscapes. The story and settings they developed are actually awe inspiring and the climax really made me tear up. What a nice soundtrack too, really makes it feel like a world of unknowns and interesting things.			"

												I think it’s easy enough to skim through the other reviews and know that Brothers is a fresh, innovative, beautiful game with very few elements capable of being considered a flaw so instead I want to do my best to explain how it feels to play this game. Additionally, all of my game time was with a 360 pad and I cannot recommend enough that you use a controller when playing Brothers.The controls are about as straight forward as controls can be; left stick and left trigger move and interact respectively for one brother, right stick and right trigger controls the other brother. That’s it. Yet with only 4 controls this game pulls you in and makes you feel like a part of the world in a way I have not seen in a game before. I think because of the simplicity of the controls, your mind has more attention to invest in the story, the emotions and the world stretching out before you. I wish I could explain one of the most impacting moments of the story without giving any spoilers, but there comes a point late in the game where the controls change in a very deliberate way and there are not enough words on this earth to explain how heavy of an emotional impact that change made.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one of the finest adventures in gaming that I’ve been on, but when you combine the game with the absolute masterpiece of a control scheme it’s no longer an adventure I played.. it’s a memory that I lived.

												Spoiler free review:Gameplay was so tedious and the co-op is unplayable; there was even more co-op between prisoners and captors in a concentration camp. Characters were completely flat and void of any depth, soundtrack was subpar and at times misplaced, and the art design was so poorly done it could only have been the work of an individual suffering late stages of glaucoma. Each puzzle was so simplistic it essentially boiled down to a game of walking around holding down the interact button, but, the platforming was revolutionary; it combined the best platforming aspects of Deadly Premonition, Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, and Typing of the Dead (Dreamcast 2001 Edition). The stories depth was written so well to the view of a child that it makes the entire game irrelevant.It would appear that the writer took too much creative freedom in developing the story of two childhood friends travelling through a world in which the writer could not settle on a genre. The story begins in a beautifully set middle earth world as we follow the tale of two roommates whose landlord suddenly falls ill. To the great guidance of the town drunk, these work colleagues set out on a journey through a village of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, to a steampunk cathedral where we meet a cage dancer and rescue her from her pimp. The game then takes a grisly turn when it delves into animal cruelty as these two civil partners kidnap, abuse, mutilate, and mount a majestic griffon to death. It soon becomes clear that these two felons are completely void of any human decency; corpse mutilation, limb ripping, decapitation, blood bathing, these are all of a few of the satanic rituals they conduct. When the two scholars save a poor woman from being sacrificed to the giant gods with seemingly no ulterior motives, she offers them a place to rest, and even shows them her vulnurable motherly form; creating a nice web of love to keep them warm in the night. To repay in kindness, they quickly remove each of her eight limbs and leave her to die. In her dying throes she attempts to hug the two tenants one last time as an act of love. The most sadistic of the two proceeds to impale himself on one of her limbs to let her know that she's nothing but a monster in her last moments alive. She then dies in anguish as the two revel in her death. The kouhai (TN Note: kouhai is korean for junior) shows no signs of remorse as he digs a hole and throws his senpai's newly mutilated body into a ditch on the side of the path. He fills the hole with various scat that he can find. He then finds the elixir of life and selfishly pours it onto his senpai's body; mocking him that he is void of life. The story ends when he returns to his landlord with the rent (the elixir). This tale was truly an enthralling adventure that teaches us the dangers of technology abuse. It's commentary on social media is a clear cut warning to us all.10/10, would not recommend.			"

However, what gameplay is there is interesting enough to keep you going, despite how simple it is, and there are some emotional moments that aren't ruined by the plotline.It also lasts 2 hours.

												I got this game on a whim after seeing all the rave reviews. When I finally got around to playing it I found it enchanting.Trying to control 2 characters with one controller is pretty novel, but after a while you kind of get it (for about 10 seconds at a time anyway).Basically, you travel through a variety of stunning landscapes with a background narrative that keeps you invested in the story and often surprises and rewards you. They got the pace just right and the game flows well, allowing time to explore and find those little hidden activities.It's a compelling story, with varied and interesting puzzles to solve. There is no speech yet you understand everything they are saying. There are happy moments, sad ones, mischievous and even slightly mean ones. All fit just right.I loved it and I’m gutted that I finished it already. "

												This game is pretty interesting. You control two brothers at the same time using, preferably, a gamepad, but it plays ok with a keyboard. I can say that moving both characters can be a bit awkward, but eventually I kind of got used to it. I found a way to lessen the confusion by aways leaving the brother controled with my right hand on the right side of the screen and the other on the left side. The story is simple, your father is really sick and the only way to save him is to go find the tree of life, but of course the path to the final objective is a lot trickier. Along the way you'll find many interesting characters, stories, vistas and casual puzzles that require the use of both brothers, each with their own set of skills. I would say that the most interesting aspect of this game, besides you having to control two characters at once, is how well the controls are tied to the story telling and when the moment comes you'll know that. Saying anything else would ruin the fun, so if you are courious don't miss out on this quite unique experience. For those who are interested, this game is short (four to six hours) so you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												I have played many games in my lifetime. So many, that it is too easy to see similarities between games, storylines, gameplay mechanics, and themes. I have gotten used to being amused - but not surprised - by pretty environments and clever controls. Brothers takes what at first seems like a novel way of using a controller and turns it into a powerful storytelling device in itself. Coupled with awe inspiring scenery and a compelling journey with just enough 'game' mixed in makes for an amazing experience that is hard to classify as either a fun experience or a deeply emotional art appreciation. I have to say, however, that it took me about 30 minutes to get into the game. I'm so glad I stuck with it until it hooked me...the beginning of the game, while pretty and somewhat interesting, belies the amazing and truly incredible oddyssey that lies ahead.			"

												Interesting story for a game without one single spoken word from any characters. But then again one image is worth a thousand words. It's pretty easy to know what's going on with the two brothers and the others “side quest” characters. The environment is gorgeous and fascinating, while it's absent at the start, there's a lot of fantasy creatures later on. There's tons of place where you wonder what the hell happened here, which makes the game even more mysterious.The gameplay is pretty easy, but fun. The two brothers have each their own advantage and disadvantage and you try to solve the puzzle with teamwork.While this is one amazing adventure, it's pretty grim overall. But it's still worth the time.Prepare to get dem feels. Curse you evil spider lady for taking advantage of my lust! It could have worked between the two of us!  :'( "

I am a fan of puzzle games, but being able to control 2 characters at once in a way that made sense to solve puzzles was something entirely new to me, and a really fun way to immerse yourself in the game. I was really drawn into this game. I really liked the ending, and the fact that this game was made by an indie film director made the game feel like an immersive film a lot of the time.

												Despite being very short, this game is very good at what it's supposed to be: an enjoying, epic, relaxing and yet kind of intense adventure. Also despite having no actual voice acting (it has ""gibberish""), it's visually very expressive and quite touching. It has beautiful landscapes, pretty good graphics and lot of variety of ""puzzles""/situations.This game is VERY good at keeping you addicted until you finish it, some of the best 5 hours of my life. Enough said.			"

												A very beautiful and remarkable game, I could not get my hands off it once I started it. The puzzles and challenges were not too hard or easy yet creative enough to give you a very enjoyable experience. Although it was a bit tricky to control the brothers, but I thought this twin stick mechanic was a very unique idea and I really enjoyed it. The storyline was emotional and touching, it will definitely be one of my most memorable games as it made me cry even though no real dialogues were spoken. One of the best games I played in a long time!			"

												I was skeptical of this game at first: single-player co-op; controlling two characters simultaneously. My fears were dispelled within 20 minutes of play time, as the controls are simple and fluid enough that there is never any real problem controlling separate characters.The gameplay is casual; nothing is terribly difficult to figure out. Some would say it is too easy, but I think it lends well to the progression and design of the game. This game is about the story, and should place higher priority on forward progress than challenging puzzles.This is not to say that the flow of progression is too quick: it is right where it needs to be. When combined with the artistic style, story and atmosphere of the game the whole thing comes together as a relaxing, heartfelt and thoroughly enjoyable experience.This game is worth every dollar you pay for it. You might even have a laugh at yourself when you try to control one character and move the other.			"

												One of the best short games I have ever played, and one of the only games that I have played that actually tugged at my heart strings. Controls are a little difficult if you do not have a consol controller, but not game breaking. The beautifully rendered world is straight out of the fairy tale books you read as a child and the puzzle elements keep you thinking, but never to the point of frustration. I highly recommend picking this up if you are looking for a new, refreshing gaming experience.			"

Here are my thoughts on the gamePros:-Interesting and different gameplay-Casual “low-stress” gaming-A good story, or rather ending-Good value title-Kid appropriateCons:-Graphics were very simple when the game was released and its starting to age-You are pretty much required to have an xbox controller to play-Even though the characters speak in gibberish they make you watch long cutscenes of people talking without any way to skip through.Overall, it is a good game and I think its worth a play; but I don’t see the amazing innovation that most critics gave it.

Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a beautiful game, nonetheless. Even though I have completed the game, I still confused the controls for each brother toward the end. It tells a good story, and it was darker than I thought it would be. I thoroughly enjoyed the unexpected more sinister parts of the game. I bought it on sale, but it's definitely worth the full price, even with only about 4 and a half hours of gameplay. Achievements were easy to obtain because I could go back and revisit each chapter.			"

												For such a short game, with dialogue you can't even understand I spent quite some time questioning what was so great about this game while trying to get a feel for the controls (keyboard yo). It was actually quite funny to watch how my brain could not comprehend the controls if the character controlled by the set of movement keys located on the right side of the keyboard was walking on the left and vice versa. Total mind♥♥♥♥ right there and it never went away completely to be honest. However, I got better with the controls and the puzzles became a piece of cake, fun even. As the game progressed I started to understand this funny, little language they spoke quite well and through the characters and the environment; began to perceive the world they lived in through their eyes. Pretty things became beautiful, jokes became heartfelt and emotional moments became ♥♥♥♥ing heartbreaking. For such a small game that's a lot to achieve and thus deserves another + from me.			"

												I'm not really sure how exactly should I review this game. But I want to do it anyway.What is this game?It's an adventure game where you play as two brothers who are on an important quest.First of all, the controls... they are a bit confusing at times, but interesting - you control each brother with a separate trigger and analog stick on the controller.Something... as if you played some coop adventure game like the Lego games, but by yourself, controlling both players at the same time. Yeah, it is as confusing as it sounds at first (at least this game has no attack or jump buttons, or it would've been insane and mind breaking).And yes, the game REALLY requires a controller, since without it the whole concept of the game breaks and some ""qte's"", such as spinning two valve handles with the analog sticks are just not possible with a keyboard.Still, the game was insanely overhyped for me, the gameplay was repetitive and the puzzles were obvious. The game really is easy and I don't know if it's even possible to die from something in it.As it goes for the story... nothing really unusual, but it's nice and rather relatable. And it doesn't get boring for 3+ hours it takes to beat this game.The graphics and music are often really good and they create a really nice atmosphere at times.Overall, it's a nice little adventure game that brings something unique and interesting to the table. It might not be worth it for its full price tag for somebody, but as it goes for the sale price, it's definitely worth two or three dollars (depending on your region).			"

												This game is amazing, but imagine how much better it would have been if it could pass the bechdel test!!!!All jokes aside, this game is sublime. Even though the theme is somewhat dark, you'd be hard pressed to find a game with more ""make you smile"" moments. The way the two brothers interact differently with different people and objects is a joy. The way the brothers work together and care for each other without the use of words. The game compels me to want to be a good person to the people I come across, even if it's not always an option. The puzzles themselves are usually pretty obvious, without the use of any cheap visual hints. They typically aren't very difficult either, but they never lose their novelty as the game goes on. But they're really only a stepping stone to get to what the game is really about. If you want a game that will make you smile, make you sorrowful, and take you on a truly amazing adventure, this game nails it.			"

												A very short but fantastically paced game, moving from local shenanigans to exploring desolate castles, assisting trolls, barren battlefields filled with dead giants and giant invisible yetis in the snow. All this contained in a wonderful visual style and fleshed out with (what appears to be) interesting Nordic lore. Mechanically fascinating due to its two character system, taking something that could be multiplayer but maps it all to one pad. Due to the mechanical reliance of the characters with one another it enhances the story's impact.Possibly one of the most fantastic short game experiences I've had in a very long time. If you were a fan of games in the style of team Ico's this is very highly advised.			"

												Despite being very short, this game is very good at what it's supposed to be: an enjoying, epic, relaxing and yet kind of intense adventure. Also despite having no actual voice acting (it has ""gibberish""), it's visually very expressive and quite touching. It has beautiful landscapes, pretty good graphics and lot of variety of ""puzzles""/situations.This game is VERY good at keeping you addicted until you finish it, some of the best 5 hours of my life. Enough said.			"

												It has been a while since i played a game like Brothers, a game that's not simply about smashing buttons as fast as you can, killing dudes or monster or whatever, Brothers is a game that tryes and mostly succed telling you a story, a story of two young brothers trying to save their dad. The gameplay is fun and relaxing, most of the puzzles are relatively easy, but rewarding, you'll probably finish the game in 2-3 hours at most, but i promise you that, even if it's really short, you'll remember this game for a long time.

												A stunning game which I highly recommend.  It is short (3 - 5 hours gameplay) but it makes up for it in the engaging storyline, the characters, the beautiful graphics and the way in which you control both brothers at the same time.You do need a controller to play this game as it makes controlling the two brothers easy and intuitive.  The storyline whilst reasonably simple takes you into a number of different lands where you will meet several other characters.  Throughtout the game the graphics are visually stunning, perhaps the best I have experienced in a game (watch the shadows of not just your own characters but those of others you interact with, even those you can see a long way down the mountains you climb).  The colours are superb and the whole experience is one of quality.  The puzzles are relatively straightforward but nonetheless satisfying to complete and the added bonus of unlocking achievements adds both game time and an element of fun.Above all I felt the game was a very fulfilling experience (yes I wish it was longer) and I have never felt so engaged with a character in a game.  A real emotional gaming experience, one which I can not recommend highly enough.  A game I have already returned to, go buy it!			"

												Brothers is a very pretty game. It is definately charming with its lack of a discernable dialogue and gorgeous graphics that look hand painted at times. The story is 'touching' I suppose, but it's nothing you can't see coming from a mile away.The control scheme has you controlling one brother with a left analogue stick, and the other with the right. Each trigger controls a contextual action each brother can take, making the controls very simple, but you can get yourself tied in knots trying to control each brother, which is kind of amusing. You'll feel good when pulling off certain tasks in tandem though.On the downside is the fact that the game is around three and a half hours long, and there is little reason to play again unless you really want those achievements. I think the $15 price tag is ridiculous for such a short experience, good as it is. Pick it up for $5 if you can, $10 if you really enjoy these 'games as art' joints.Overall I recommend Brothers to everyone, even to family members that you want to try to get into gaming. Barring that though, get it on sale to take the sting off the price.			"

But the beauty and wonder of the world that has been created for you to explore with these two brothers appears to be endless for much of the game.

The game lives up to the hype especially with its price tag and the quality of the story. It achieves in 2 -3 hours what most AAA titles fail to do in 15.

I give it all 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and highly recommend to everyone to play. It is worth the time and money.  "

The puzzles aren't that hard though.The fantasy world is great with a lot of room for interpretation. While following your main story of the two brothers you encounter other side stories - all of them interesting. Over all the story telling is the main reason you should play this.The game characters speak in a fantasy language with no subtitles. Nonetheless the characters are able display their emotions perfectly. In the end I was totally captivated by the events in the story and the character development.It's a short but great game I would recommend everyone to play if they like story driven games.			"

The story is mainly told through gameplay, pulling the reader in because they are not being told a story, they are living. I am not a deeply emotional person I ussually care more for fun gameplay, but when brilliant gameplay tells the story I truly felt for these brothers. The puzzles and other challenges strengthen the relationship between brothers and therfore strengthens your feelings toward the brothers. You feel like you are each brother and feel a brotherly relationship towards the other. I can not state enough how much I enjoyed and recomend this game.			"

												If the characters can be made loveable, rememberable and relateable without any words, something has been definately done right.Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure with great visuals and beautiful sceneries. The benches that have been placed around the routes you travel give you a nice little pause and another angle to look at the world around you. Technically the game does not amaze you, but how the gameplay immerses you into the story is quite an achievement. Play with a controller.Once in the first chapter I ran into a glitch where the younger brother fell through the sand on the river shore. Nothing game breaking, but little funny atleast.I played the game through in a little less than 3 hours. But those were really, really good 3 hours.Video games are an art. And this is a fine example what it can be at it's best.			"

												""This is a simple tale about the two sons of a father aka brothers (as the titular says), not more than that"". No wonder why this masterpiece deserves a lot of huge praises from critics and gamers alike (and  several honorary awards too). Engaging and deep story, emotional moments, perfect character development, clever and unexpected plot twist,creative gameplay and not-so-stressing and enjoyable environment puzzle (credits to the level designer) and most important powerful message portrayal to the audience about the importance of family in our life. I just bought, played, and unlocked all the achievements on a Christmas Day.  All I can say is this game is a must-have for all Steam players besides making it one of the best game of 2013 to be added into the collection			"

												wow, this game really got me. ill probably never play it again but the story was an emotional rollercoaster that really touched me and left me with an experience i wont soon forget. some people have mentioned how short the game is. i beat in about 6 hours spread over 2 sessions. some say 3 hours and i could see that (i took it pretty slow, thoroughly enjoying the environments and soaking in the beautiful and artistic settings). let me say this though, would you spend $10-15 to see a major motion picture in theatres? i guarantee this will last longer and be far more satisfying and touching than anything youll see on the big screen. the controls and interactivity really have a way of drawing you in and getting you emotionally involved. a couple notes on the subject of controls. i have a 3rd party controller that wasnt supported by the game (actually it really only seems to support the xbox 360 controller period). however using x360ce solved all my problems and the game ran fine (though it does require the extra stuff beyond just the base program). also, i would recommend using the same setup as with the default 360 layout as the controller layout is relevant to the story and how it affects you. either way keyboard also works fine without any controllers.

												It is short, there's not much going on story-wise, there's no replay value, the graphics aren't exactly spectacular and it is very easy. But i cared about the plot, gazed at some of the vistas with their beautiful art style, had fun controlling both brothers at once (with my keyboard btw., which worked just fine for me) and had several moments of emotional investment throughout (the most important part).It doesn't do it's hype justice, because nothing does, but comes a lot closer to it than other games (like ""Gone Home"" for instance). Lovely little gem. I do recommend to get it on sale though. Got it for a buck and a half or something, felt like a steal.			"

FOr me, the brothers devotion to helping their father and eachother right till the very end was very touching.

												I have played many games in my lifetime. So many, that it is too easy to see similarities between games, storylines, gameplay mechanics, and themes. I have gotten used to being amused - but not surprised - by pretty environments and clever controls. Brothers takes what at first seems like a novel way of using a controller and turns it into a powerful storytelling device in itself. Coupled with awe inspiring scenery and a compelling journey with just enough 'game' mixed in makes for an amazing experience that is hard to classify as either a fun experience or a deeply emotional art appreciation. I have to say, however, that it took me about 30 minutes to get into the game. I'm so glad I stuck with it until it hooked me...the beginning of the game, while pretty and somewhat interesting, belies the amazing and truly incredible oddyssey that lies ahead.			"

												Interesting story for a game without one single spoken word from any characters. But then again one image is worth a thousand words. It's pretty easy to know what's going on with the two brothers and the others “side quest” characters. The environment is gorgeous and fascinating, while it's absent at the start, there's a lot of fantasy creatures later on. There's tons of place where you wonder what the hell happened here, which makes the game even more mysterious.The gameplay is pretty easy, but fun. The two brothers have each their own advantage and disadvantage and you try to solve the puzzle with teamwork.While this is one amazing adventure, it's pretty grim overall. But it's still worth the time.Prepare to get dem feels. Curse you evil spider lady for taking advantage of my lust! It could have worked between the two of us!  :'( "

												One of the best games I've played. It was pretty small, and I managed to complete the game in just over three hours, but the immersion and story was a big seller. Not only that, but the game mechanics brought something new to the table. I am a fan of puzzle games, but being able to control 2 characters at once in a way that made sense to solve puzzles was something entirely new to me, and a really fun way to immerse yourself in the game. I was really drawn into this game. I really liked the ending, and the fact that this game was made by an indie film director made the game feel like an immersive film a lot of the time. I really liked it.It's cheap, it's fun, and it's something really different to the usual. I really recommend you try this game out :)			"

												In terms of replay value, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is not a good buy. It's only got one main storyline with a few sub-objectives, and once that's over, that's it.However, in terms of overall worth, it is by far worth the buy at any reasonable price.The narrative of the game follows two brothers (no duh) traveling to a great tree in a far away land in order to save their sick father. While it starts off alright, with the player (namely myself) thinking ""Why exactly am I playing this game?"" That feeling actually remains for the next hour or so. However, as the story progresses and one sees more of the characters and who they are, the story gradually becomes gripping and emotional; while it is a short game (roughly 3 hours), it holds themes and motifs that are easily worthy of high quality movies, and it takes the player on a proper emotional rollercoaster that leaves him or her thinking about it afterward.The gameplay is kind of intuitive--controlling two separate characters with your analog sticks (controller only, I don't know how the keyboard works) is unique and compelling for a bit, but it wouldn't last long. Luckily, as I said before, this game is short and therefore its gameplay remains fresh throughout the first playthrough, which is a valuable component to any game. It even consistently switches things up and introduces variations of its few mechanics so that by the end of it, the player doesn't feel bored or underwhelmed.Along with the side quests and absolutely beautiful world design, this game is a must-buy. I can't recommend it enough if you have a couple of hours to spend.			"

Posted: December 6, 2014
												Finally purchased and played through this game after hearing rave reviews from sources I trust.  A simple game really, two brothers going on an epic quest to save their father.  No combat, minor puzzles, and most of the game isn't even sensitive to timing/controls.  Those pieces that are are exceptionally forgiving.  Gameplay isn't what makes it great, and realistically not even the visuals, even though they are stunning.  The story is key here.  No dialog, no text, just a few voiced nonsense words in a language that's never translated.  It conveys emotion, and that's all it needed to do.  Most of why this game was something special for me is going to be in a spoiler section at the end, but I'll go ahead and break down the rest.So a quick breakdown:ControlsSo basically the controls were a touch frustrating.  I don't do that well with dual stick and keeping things straight as I just don't spend much time with a gamepad in my hand.  That said, gamepad really is the way to play.  Thankfully the gameplay was forgiving enough that I could get past it.GraphicsTop notch.  Visuals were stunning.  Don't pass up the park benches.  Sit down, take a minute or two and just enjoy the awesome vistas they put together.  The artists deserve incredible credit for what they did.GameplayIt's a really simple game with a few puzzles to keep the journey interesting.  They serve to give you a sense of each brother's personality and to give you some challenge so you're not just walking through.  Nothing special, but servicable for what they needed it to do.  The game is short, but I'd actually say if it wasn't it just wouldn't work.Story CommentHere's the heart of it.  The story is also a simple one, and one that has been told before.  The difference here is in the telling.  They've told in a way only a video game could do.  It's impressive, and because of that they've earned every bit of praise this game will ever receive.  The rest of my thoughts on the story are in the spoiler below.The whole game you go through working with the two brothers, one stick and one button each.  They set off to save their father from an illness by seeking magic water.  It quickly establishes their characters despite the minimal ways the game can based on it's design.  The older, more serious, more goal focused.   The younger more prone to playing around, joking, and causing mischief.  As the story goes on there are some aspects of the two working together that reminded me of myself and my own older brother.  Details are unimportant on the rest of the journey until just before the end.  You encounter a dangerous creature and the older brother is badly injured.  The magic water is in sight and the younger brother goes to get it.  Unfortunately, the older doesn't make it until you return.  The game continues with having to move the body into the grave and bury your brother.  You stand at the grave for a time, then head for home to save your father.  When you're close enough you can see where you need to be you encounter obsticals that throughout the game were only solvable using the older brother, not the younger.  As the younger alone you still can't solve it.  The moment I realized I had to hit the trigger that was assigned to the older brother actions to get around the obsticals was pure magic, touching, but also extremely sad.  After reaching for a tissue, I finished up and started thinking about my own brother and times when we were younger.  That is something I 'm not sure any game I've ever played has done quite like this.  So final thoughts.  It's an understatement to say I recommend it.  I may not call it one of the best games I've played, because if the gameplay is all that was there I wouldn't have enjoyed it.  Brothers is almost feels more like something you have experienced than as a game.  That said, it's well worth a few bucks and a few hours of your time.			"

												This is the proof that games can be more than mere ""games"". B:ATTS  is precisely that, a tale, a tale that, unlike reading a book or watching a movie, you can experience yourself. You quickly feel invested with the main characters and grasp the innovative control mechanics, that allow you to control both brothers at once in a very fluid way. The game is beautiful with a very artistic façade, at times gorgeous. The plot is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, but you need to experience it yourself.			"
