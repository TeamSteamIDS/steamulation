												In an era where the video gaming industry has done away with art direction, atmosphere, brilliant writing, fun gameplay, unique mechanics and design, it's games like this that you appreciate a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more now than you did back in the day. Soul Reaver is a shining example of how a game should be made today and contrary to being told that 'everything has been done already', this pisses in the face of that theory with the level of creativity and love put into it, which also happens to be a thing of the past.In Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver you play the role of Raziel, formerly the vampiric Lieutenant of the vampire lord Kain, who stripped Raziel of his wings out of jealousy and cast him into The Lake of The Dead, Raziel is then resurrected as a wraith by The Elder God to become his Soul Reaver and gather souls and the strength to eventually gain enough power to kill Kain.The level design is of Metroidvania-esque influence , giving you a massive open ended layout where you collect items which increase your health and energy, find powers (special attacks), uncover tons of cleverly hidden secrets and gain special abilities from defeating each boss that allow you to progress to places previously inaccessible on your quest to become the ultimate badass. At it's core it boils down to combat, basic puzzle solving, exploration and platforming, but is set completely apart from any game of the kind with it's incredible (to say the least) plot, writing & lore, Godlike pacing that mixes all of said core elements together amazingly well so that none of them ever feel monotonous and stale, a genuinely evil art direction & theme, thick atmosphere, great level design, badass ♥♥♥♥in combat in which you have to 'fatality' enemies in varied manners such as impaling them with spears, throwing them into sunlight, spikes on the wall, pits of fire, pools of water which dissolves the ♥♥♥♥ers and many other badass ways after weakening them in combat which is then followed by devouring their souls which restores your life. On a technical level, the visuals may appear dated to most at the first few glances but you get over that the instant you see how brilliant, unique and badass the art direction is, which is of far more importance than having millions of polygons that make up a bland, uninspired and soulless piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The sound design is fantastic with everything sounding how it should, brilliant OST that blends in extremely well with the situations at hand and the voiced dialogue is simply of another caliber. I HIGHLY recommend you play this with a controller and you're going to need to use Xpadder to map it as a keyboard as this game has a lot of issues with analogue sticks, that being my only gripe.This is an essential game that is near flawless in every aspect that defines gaming and is a sad fact that a damn PS1 game nukes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of any game of it's kind today.

												Soul Reaver begins hundreds of years after Blood Omen and works from the premise that when you, as Kain, were given the choice of sacrificing yourself to save the world of Nosgoth or ruling it, you chose the latter, plunging the world into darkness. Over the millennia, Kain and his vampiric lieutenants evolved new abilities, with Kain always developing them first and the others soon following. When Raziel, the ""hero"" of the new game, grew wings before his leader did, Kain saw it as blasphemy, tore them from Raziel's back, and cast him into a giant swirling watery grave. After his features have been almost completely eaten away by the water, Raziel is saved by a being known as the Elder God, who sets him on a quest to free the world from the parasitic influence of the vampire clans and destroy Kain. For the time of the release of the game the graphics are good. The levels are fairly big and well designed. The movement is smooth and clean. The sound, for the most part, is excellent. The voice acting is some of the best I have heard.Overall, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is an excellent game and if you like adventure games with puzzles, this game is for you.

												Good game...BAD PORT. Why? Not optimized for modern hardware like the store page insists. It's riddled with; polygon clipping/ glitching issues, random crashes during certain areas in levels, and NO xbox360 controller compatibility. Steam needs to get stricter with publishers when it comes to distrubuting older games. This game isn't the only game that is not optimized for current gen hardware. They need to get publishers to update these games with compatibility issues. Quite honestly I feel ripped off and I was! And no refund policy? You got to be kidding me! As I said before, it's a good game just a terrible port. Pick up the PlayStation or Dreamcast versions and there are VERY EASY ways to do that...which in this case I feel would be EXTREMELY JUSTIFIED! Thank you Steam/ Square Enix...I hope you enjoyed my ""donation""...but what did I get?			"

Soul Reaver""Tumbling, burning with white-hot fire, I plunged into the depths of the abyss. Unspeakable pain... relentless agony... time ceased to exist... only this torture... and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this hell. An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the precipice of madness.  The descent had destroyed me... and yet I lived."" ~RazielThis game, to me, was the start of the Legacy of Kain series. Although, technically, that was actually Blood Omen. As a matter of fact, the first Blood Omen unknowingly set the stage and essentially serves as the backdrop for all of the Legacy of Kain games. In Soul Reaver however, you do not actually play as Kain. Instead, you play as one of his vampiric lieutenants, Raziel. But almost immediately, things immediately go bad as when Raziel approaches Kain and shows that he has evolved by gaining a set of wings (the first evolution of all of Kain's vampiric brood), Kain considers this a transgression against him. In an act of rage, he rips your wings from you, and then has you thrown into the Lake of the Dead. Burning, trapped in the abyss, Raziel reaches the bottom but he is lifeless, his body practically destroyed.But centuries pass, and Raziel awakes, somehow still alive, but a twisted shell of who he once was. Then, as he looks around at his surroundings in the Abyss, an onimous voice booms: ""Raziel, you are worthy."" This being, only ever referred to as ""the Elder God"" in the Legacy of Kain games, claims that it is he who is responsible for your rebirth, or rather... your undeath. He calls you his Soul Reaver, and gives you the mission of hunting Kain down, for it is him that is responsible for the decay and ruin of the world, Nosgoth. But to reach Kain, Raziel will have to also hunt down and kill his vampiric brothers, long since corrupted while Raziel was away from the mortal world. Raziel himself had only just gained a set of wings before his execution, but his brothers... they had became monstrous to say the least.This game, like all of the other games up until Nosgoth, are action adventure games. As this is a PC port of a game that is  sixteen or so years old, it's important to have reasonable expectations. For instance, some textures may flicker or not appear properly like they were meant to every once in a while. Controller support for this game is unfortunately borked, for when I tried to use my 360 controller, it appeared to work at first, but then Raziel would not stop moving at all. I at first recoiled in disgust and anger, using keyboard controls, but eventually became used to it and also remembered how much I still loved this game so it didn't matter to me after a while. Controller support does in fact apparently work for the other Legacy of Kain games, although, I can only confirm this for Soul Reaver 2 as that is the only other one I've started to play after finishing the first Soul Reaver. Personally, Soul Reaver 1 crashed for me about five or so times. But as you can save at any time while playing the game, I shrugged it off and considered it only a mild annoyance.Yet, keyboard controls aside, I found combat as fun as it always had been in this game. As most of the enemies you face are vampiric in nature, simply knocking it down and shouting mean words isn't enough. Either pick up a weapon, impale, and then devour their soul, or beat them down a bit, grab them, and toss them either into water, a spike, or onto a fire. Combat becomes a simpler matter once you obtain the Wraith Blade, however, if you get hit and are no longer at full health, you lose it, forcing you to go back to the earlier methods. Another thing I always loved about this game is the bosses aren't ""hit it until it's dead"". A spider boss? Grab its eggs, set them on fire, and toss them back at them. A boss that is immune to water but not sunlight? Break some windows to let a little sunshine in and watch as it screams in agony. A certain boss near the end of the game that is invulnerable otherwise, you literally lure into a gigantic incinerator and burn him alive. There are only two specific boss fights that are... well, disappointing, and honestly, frustrating.As you adventure through the wastelands of Nosgoth, as an undead vampire turned Soul Reaver, you have the ability to go between both the spirit world and the material one. As a matter of fact, if you run out of health in the material realm, you are forcibly sent back to the spirit world until you consume enough souls to regain your strength. Unfortunately, this does somewhat make there be little stakes in the game... as you can only receive an actual game over if you run out of HP in the spirit world. It makes bosses an easy matter as well. Get sent to the spirit realm, eat souls, find a portal, and try again until you win. Still, I always (and still do) thought that going in and out of the spirit world to bypass obstacles and solve puzzles was such a cool thing to do. I just love the visual effects it has on the world. It's not literally just the absolute same area but with a blue tint, no, these columns become shorter in the spirit world, allowing you to climb up them and then using a portal, you're back in the material world in an area that would have otherwise been inaccessible.Eventually, when playing this game, it becomes second nature, but I'll just say it beforehand: ""If you are in a spot and are seemingly stuck and it absolutely seems like a dead end, transfer over to the spirit realm.""Perhaps for me, the only truly infuriating aspect of the gameplay of the game is... well, block puzzles. I can't blame the game for having puzzles, no, but good god, if you actually explore the side areas, there are just so many block puzzles. There are other puzzles that are not block related but every time I ran into another one that did involve blocks I just... I hate block puzzles so much.But in the end, I recommend this game (and series, as I wouldn't consider this a spoiler whatsoever, but Soul Reaver 1 ends by directly leading into Soul Reaver 2, so I don't know why you'd buy and play Soul Reaver 1 and then not buy and play Soul Reaver 2) not for its gameplay but... well, for everything else. The story, the music, the voice acting, the atmosphere. As long as you are able to appreciate an old game (and be willing to use keyboard controls) and move past the issues of... well, less than perfect PC ports, you'll probably enjoy this game/series.So yes, even though I somewhat feared that the nostalgia I felt for this game was greater than the game itself, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not perfect of course, but it's very much worth playing.One last thing to note, though. A couple of days ago, one of my friends actually recommended Nosgoth to me. I said I had it in my Steam library, and had been meaning to try it out because I loved the original Legacy of Kain series. He responded with: ""What's Legacy of Kain?"".8/10.			"

												I love this game.This port is trash.Basically if you have windows 10, it'll be a crap shoot if it'll work or not. You might get into the game, but it only has keyboard controls. So you think plugging in a controller will help? Well, if running to the right forever is your version of help, then sure. Good luck using Xpadder. Sound is broken. FMVs are broken. The 'best' part of this port is that it's the PS1 version, not the DC, so enjoy muddy textures.Go get it on gog, where it'll actually work, it's also a dollar less. If you have a DreamCast, find a copy for that instead.			"

												(Ignore my time on record as I've spent most of my playtime offline)Easily one of my most favorite games of all time! I remember playing this on the original Playstation like it was only yesterday. In my mind this game set the bar very high for what video games were capable of. Wonderfully written script and rich dialogue, Extremely clever puzzles that make you consider all possibilities. A unique and large open world game that managed to pull off one of the first concepts of streaming data directly from the disk, cutting out loading screens from area to area. Crystal Dynamics had outdone themselves when making this game, and it's a shame that we don't get games like this more often.By today's standards this game would be considered a little rough around the edges (remember, this is 1999 we're talking about), but if you can look past its dated graphics and very rare glitches you will find a well crafted story with unique characters, all of whom are well rounded and are even pursuing their own goals.Following the noble vampire Raziel, now turned undead wraith, on his journey to seek revenge for the betrayal of his creator Kain, you will find that the world they inhabit is dark and desolate, but not without reason. As their destinies unravel, you soon realize that there is more at stake than just Raziel's personal vengeance. The Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is heavy on storytelling and puzzle solving, but the combat isn't the best (in fact the combat is terrible). Many of the puzzles are far from obvious. Some are on such a large scale that you may have to visit several areas just to solve one and move on, but they are definitely rewarding as the further you go the more you learn of kain's actions, Raziel's resolve, and this dark, slowly dying world and how it came to be the way it is.I have tried this on several computers and can easily say it runs quite well on modern machines. It runs on essentially any resolution, although I'd recommend playing at 4:3 resolution as that is what this game was made for. Widescreen works, but the game stretches. If it doesn't run well on yours then there may be a complication or something affecting its performance. There is a problem with the audio, however. Sometimes the audio suffers from problems and you may miss some dialogue and key ambiant effects without realizing it, but it's easy to figure out as you can identify it when the sound starts to get choppy or, say, when you jump and the grunting noises you normally hear are missing. It's an easy fix, simply quit and restart. Now I know some people might find this a daunting task, and all I can do is assure you that this game is well worth the time and patience.When I saw this game on steam, I was a little apprehensive to play it at first, as I was afraid my nostalgia would cloud the fact that this may be a terrible game after all. But once I ran it, I fell in love with it all over again. It can stand on it's own merits, and comes from a time where people were more worried about clever storytelling and breaking new ground than trying to introduce exclusive features and new DLC packs to increase product longevity. It's a masterpiece from another era, and shows that video games can be more than the generic ""Action Adventure"" label that is used to describe them.I wholeheartedly recommend this game and any other in the Legacy of Kain series.

PROS:+ awesome kick♥♥♥♥♥story+ cool game soundtrack+ great voice acting+ original concept (for both story & gameplay)+ challenging combat+ boss fights+ two realms - physical and spectral+ puzzles+ atmosphere of NosgothCONS:- clunky and outdated graphics- occassional audio glitches- controls are difficult (but customizable at least)- open ending hinting to Soul Reaver 2- can have compatibility problems on some PCsComment:I will be honest to you from the start - I am biased towards this game. It has been a fundamental pillar in my gaming life, it was one of the first PC games I played and I love it. Just look at my avatar - it's Raziel. First time playing it was way back in 2002 but I have fond memories of how awesome this game was. Yes, I can see the flaws it has today, it did not age that well ... but please hear me out. Soul Reaver is a game that was revolutionary in it's time. It combines combat and puzzles in the big post-apocalyptic world of Nosgoth. Both are difficult so if you like more casual games I guess this one is not for you. The game does not take your hand, you have to try stuff out for yourself. And die a lot in the process. But not really die since this game created a great mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. If you die in the spectral world you reset at the Elder God. You can however shift when you want and this gives the game it's dynamic feeling. Boss fights feel very satisfying when you finish them. You also get a power from each boss you beat, adding extra layer of gameplay each time. All of this was fun, but the story and narrative is why I LOVE this game! The story telling is what this game nailed - from the writing to the voice acting. Plus it has a really cool soundtrack as well. Some downsides are here as well, the game is old so graphics and compatibility are not that great, though it runs fine on my Win7 laptop. The open ending can also be annoying for some people, although it is not that bad (and continues well in SR2). And I could write all day about this game but I will stop right here because you already know if you want it or not from what you have read. I will end this review and give one of the most true and heartfelt recommendations I ever gave on Steam!			"

												One of the best story driven video games with amazing voice acting , great immersion , chilling music and fun gameplay .Soul Reaver is a 3D platformer with 2 realms (material and spectral) which you can use to solve puzzles and bypass enemies . Physics in each realm behave differently which creates complex enviroments and thought provoking gameplay . Note that controller does not seem to work properly without third party software so you may have to play on keyboard .This game attempted a lot of new things when technology was not quite there . There is a lot of potential for getting confused and not knowing what you need to do . Camera angles are a nightmare and you will often not see a path in blind spots .You play as  Vampire Raziel who surpassed his creator(Kain) in evolution and payed ultimate price for making his master look weak  .Kain broke his wings and Raziel's comrades threw him into abyss to suffer infinite agony . Now Raziel is a soul eating Wraith who seeks nothing but Revenge !The cinematic Trailer in this game is so ♥♥♥♥en badass . This game oozes atmosphere especially with flawless voice acting . Many lines in this game are like poetry and it stays that way the hole journey . Soul Reaver is just a great example of a game that can carry itsself with story alone .One of my favorite games but keep in mind that its very old 3D platformer . It gets extremely confusing and you will get frustrated.			"

												The game that spawned a completely amazing yet incredibly confusing series (I'm not counting Blood Omen because that's a different part of the lore). Take on the role of Raziel as you destroy the monsterous vampiric spawn of your now demonicly-mutated bretheren with weapons such as spears, fire, burning light, and water (Wait, really? Is water actually a vampiric weakness in some lore?) Oh, and let's not forget the wraith version of the famous SOUL REAVER, the most badass weapon of all weapons, because it's the GHOST OF A SWORD!!!!!!Seriously though, this is my 2nd favorite game of all time, and while the steam version is a little pain-in-the-assy to get running, it was worth reliving some childhood memories.(Also, I've played this more than steam says, now it for some reason doesn't register when I'm playing it.)

												Brilliant game. First played this title on the PSX on release. Loved the storyline, game mechanics, background music and everything about it at the time. Though aged it is still brilliant to play on the PC (Windows 10).Don't listen to the spoon fed whiners posting negative reviews. This game works excellent on windows 10, just need to change the compatibility setting to xp as follows:Just find the  Kain2.exe  in  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver then right click on the exe and select troubleshoot compatibility and follow the prompts.

												Steam asks what I think of this to convince you're in for good. Turning the old-school mode on; Edit: Like many old-times characters, Raziel is on the likeable list of bad@ss-ery (together with others such as Fulgore, Predator etc) The intro is a classic and the saga starts very strong. The main theme is immortal, the voice acting is so good it makes nowadays games looking like a joke, the game was almost known solely for its good dialog 'cause they're like the work of some book's adaptation, the plot isn't cheesy at all and the gameplay used to be a new thing in gaming. It's an spiritual interdimensional power-to-continue kind of game, and a pretty creative one. So why you don't take a look on this old rare piece, are you affraid of the challenges of the old games? Don't care much for the artistic factor? At least my job is now done.Some remarkable quotes: ""The birth of one of Kain's abominations traps the essence of life. It is this soul that animates the corpse you *lived* in.  ""And this, Raziel, is the demise of Nosgoth."" ""Become my... Soul Reaver. My angel of death."" ""I would choose oblivion over this travesty."" ""As Melchiah and Zephon fell before my blade... the Reaver was consumed with my rage and I was intoxicated by its bloodlust. "" "

												Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a fantastic game. I remember the hours upon hours my childhood years playing this particular game. Coming back to the series years later, the story behind the Legacy of Kain series is one that was really rich in the content of the story to make up for the lack of graphic and detailing capabilities. The storywriters for this game in particular really did a good job in keeping your appetite going as you progressed in the game and through the series as well. This one of the many games that really defined the 1990s as the golden era of video games. I would recommend this game and series to people who enjoy a great storyline in a game.			"

												You're better off playing the PS1 or Dreamcast version. This PC port, while servicable, is an inferior version as it doesn't do anything to improve on the original and in fact really only takes away from it. It omits the dynamic music system, whereby the music would dynamically change depending on the situation in the game and instead uses a handful of low quality tracks that don't loop and awkwardly fade in and out during gameplay. You do get better graphics and 60FPS and higher resolutions (if you apply some fixes) with this version though, so if that's what you're after, this version has it. But it comes at the cost of having worse music, and music is one of the most important things when it comes to building atmosphere.			"

												My hours for this game on Steam are slim...but the hours I put forward on my original playstation version are far greater.  I was gifted the Legacy of Kain collection for my birthday last year and I'm thankful for that because I enjoy having digital copies of old beloved games.  As a warning, I find this difficult to play with just a keyboard and mouse, although it is possible. I’m currently looking for another way around this, as my controller does not hook up well either.  That is my only complaint. Keep in mind, as well, that this game was released almost 20 years ago so it has clunky graphics and textures but this makes me love the game even more. Nostalgia.Even with it’s old graphics, I find this game quite eerie and creepy, although it has no horror tag. The characters, the story, the vampires/creatures and the music, ambience has always given me chills. I think what makes me recommend this game is the plot.  It’s hard not to love a game with deep and captivating storyline.  Kain raised Raziel (the protagonist, whom you play) and his brothers from death, turning them into undead vampires. Kain saw an unfortunate fate in store for him in the future, and had plunged Raziel into the Abyss to save himself.  The vampires depicted in this game are supposed to evolve over time, becoming stronger, while gaining new abilities. Unfortunately many vampires were left weak, with few valuable skills after Kain took over Nosgoth. The “Elder God” brought Raziel back to life but not in his original form nor his vampire form. Many centuries had passed and the God deemed Raziel as his  ‘soul reaver’, to hunt down Kain and seek revenge, to save what was left of Nosgoth, which Kain had left in ruins.You are given an option to switch between the living world and the spirit realm.  Raziel doesn’t necessarily have or need a weapon either. You can pick weapons up when you find them but you can also use your claws and tactics such as tossing your enemies in an open flame, sunlight spots or into water.  There’s also some strategy involved - mostly block puzzles - and you can collect glyphs to gain new abilities.TLDR; 7/10 overall... Rich storyline, confusing controls at first. Worth a try if you like classic oldies, or dark fantasy/gothic adventure games.			"

												Back in my day we didnt have Dark Souls. We had Soul Reaver. The games are different in many ways, but similar in the most important. Both are very vague in pointing you in the right direction. Every bit of progress you make feels like a great accomplishment because you figured it out yourself. The biggest difference from a Souls game is combat. SR's combat isnt very difficult at all, but it functions kind of similar to DS with a lock on and dodge. But thats not the games main focus. The game is really one big puzzle. Figuring out where to go, how to get there, how to progress through the levels and even the bosses themselves are puzzles. Gameplay wise, its pretty easy to compare SR to Zelda. Only its a very dark game with a mature storyline. If you like Zelda style games and dark themes along the lines of Dark Souls or Berserk, you should do yourself a favor and try this out. Its an all time classic.Hopefully one day they reboot this series. Theres many a gamer who never got to experience the tale of Kain and Raziel. There was a sequel called Dead Sun that got canceled, but after seeing leaked footage Im glad it did. It looked average at best, didnt star Kain or Raziel and it wasnt made by Cystal Dynamics. If they bring this series back, they really should retell it. The characters and storyline might be even more relavent today then they were back then. Please Square Enix, just let it happen. And let Crystal Dynamics make it and give them a break from Tomb Raider. They earned it.+mature storyline+character design+great voice acting even by todays standards+unforgetable soundtrack+world design+save anywhere+/-box puzzles-clunky controls-easy combat-enemy variety-no 360 controller support/need to use xpadder-no subtitlesPort:I havent had as much trouble as others have reported. The game starts up just fine and only crashed on me 2 times during my playthrough. I did experience sound glitches a few times that I had to fix by restarting the game. That was kind of annoying, but not a huge issue. There is texture tearing in certain areas thats not pleasing to the eye, but its not game wide and not a deal breaker imo. I hear that the GOG version is more stable, so I would suggest you just buy the Kain games there to be on the safe side.System:Win7i5 4570HD 7850			"

												Legacy of Kain is a well known franchise amongst many oldschool players. Some were introduced to the series with Blood Omen, others began with Soul Reaver. While the core gameplay was different both of them shared rich story and nice voice acting. Soul Reaver is the second game in the franchise and is a direct sequel of Blood Omen.The gameplay consists of exploration, battles with vampires, boss battles, platforming and puzzle solving. While I do like the franchise I also do not have bias due to nostalgia and do not like to see the game through pink glasses. Exploration is fairly nice, game offers interesting locations and architecture and there's a lot of backtracking and hidden secrets. Battles (at least at first) are interesting, but quickly start to get redundant and boring. While the game introduces a couple of new enemies the core battle mechanics stay the same, as you advance more through the game you get more power and enemies aren't a real threat, just an annoyance to stall you a bit. Boss battles are good, but short. They're not the ""win by brute force"" type of battles as you need to find a weak point / solution to defeat the boss. Platforming is fairly frustrating as the camera and controls are far from perfect. Nothing is impossible and can be mastered after trial and error, but jumping onto series of tiny ledges can be painful, especially if you fall down and are forced to redo the entire segment. Puzzle solving is fairly Tomb Raiderish, but also gets too repetitive: ""Block puzzle A is introduced, now do it a couple of more times. Block puzzle B is introduced, now do it a couple of more times again."". The best part of the game (aside from story and voice acting) is the soundtrack. It's great and memorable, a lot of people know Soul Reaver's ""Ozar Midrashim"".The PC port has flaws. It runs on newer systems, it's possible to run at 1080p and 60fps. However, it suffers from audio issues. The music has crackling noises, dialogue skips. The only solution is to play it in software, texture unfiltered mode. Another flaw is that the hardware mode goes up to 1080p, while software mode goes up to 2160p. Makes sense, right? When compared to PS version the soundtrack is pre-recorded. It has less tracks and doesn't really change according to what's happening around you.Should you get this version of the game? That's up to you. If you can oversee no texture filtering then go for it. If you prefer better overall experience, but lower framerates then go for the PS version. Dreamcast is supposed to be the best version.			"

												A classic. The game is difficult to play on current machines and gamepads, but if you can find a way to make it work it's worth a play. The Playstation and Dreamcast versions are hard to come by these days, so this is one of your few options of giving this game a shot.			"

												I give this a recommendation with fair warning that you will want to use X-Padder or something similar for use with a controller.   Upon taking a few minutes (maybe a touch longer if you're new to these types of apps) the game runs great.  As with all aged games, it looks the part.   Old clunky models and horrid textures by today's standards.The games highlights include it's story and overall presentation.   A stellar soundtrack which may arguably be just a 'touch' repetetive at times.   Also the voice acting (for it's time) was absolutely stellar also.   By today's standards, it still holds up rather well at least.  It's certainly not laughable by any means.As mentioned before, I certainly recommend the game, and the Legacy of Kain franchise as a whole, to anyone who doesn't mind playing old looking games, and likes a good gothic setting, with great character presentation.  On of Crystal Dynamic's early treasures right here.			"

												Is it a bad game? No, it's actually quite good, easily one of the best games to come out of the PlayStation's catalog.Do I recommend it? Absolutel not. If you still have a PS1 laying around, find an old copy of that version instead.Why? Controller support. It's abbysmal. It barely supports enough of the buttons from the Xbox controller base drivers. In order for it to be barely playable, I had to fidget with the drivers to assign keys regularly used, to keys that were not. In order for the camera to usable, I had to assign two shoulder buttons to the start/select button, as for some reason those are the default camera buttons? WHAT? Not to mention they're the only open keys that you have left after assigning all the other gameplay actions to your buttons [action, jump, aim, etc]Even after all this, good luck using the joysticks to aim, or move. The game doesn't support incremental input from joysticks, so if you move that thing barely when aiming or moving and it goes FULL BORE! PLATFORMING YAY!!! PRECISE AIMING YAY!!!!Until the controller support is expanded, and refined, I'd give the PC version of this a pass.(Unless ofcourse someone has modded it already? I haven't found anything about it)			"

												The series that sets the standard for voicework. Michael Bell (Raziel) and Simon Templeman (Kain) are voiced perfectly, and provide an emense depth to the characters they portray, The series has provided so many epic moments between Kain, Raziel, Janus Audron, the Sarafan and the Elder God, that will live in my gaming memory for the rest of my life.The writing is superb , the gothic world is a perfect setting, and the story is marvelous. I only wish we could have had one more game to wrap it up.I will say that anyone wishing to enter into this series should be prepared for poor grapics (its 20 years old now), terrible platforming, a whole lot of puzzles, and lots of repitive gameplay elements. The story is worth the frustration though.To get the full experience you cannot just play SR1 though. You should play Blood Omen, Soul Reaver, Blood Omen 2, Soul Reaver 2 and finally Defiance.			"

												I don't know if there's much point in reviewing old classics but nowadays I try to sum up my thoughts on every game I play, so here we go. Maybe in the future, some videogame-rating AI algorithm will have use of it as input data.First I'll note that this really is quite an old game by now (it came out in 1999, 17 years ago at the time of writing this). What you get on Steam is not some remake or even an HD remaster. This is a game exactly as it was back then, as far as I can tell. Personally, I had no major problems with it, running it through Wine, although I could only play in software rendering mode. I even was able to choose my native resolution of 2560x1600, though that didn't really change anything. Also, I could choose between 32 and 16-bit color depth which is just so sweetly old-fashioned.""Old-fashioned"" is something that is going to reverberate through your mind as you play this game. The intro cutscene is so simplistic it seems childish by today's standards. However much the games of today may be dumbed down, the quality of presentation and story-telling has definitely gone up. In many other respects, though, Soul Reaver is very ambitious from a technical standpoint, in ways that impress even nowadays. The two main things you will notice are:1. Level design — locations you visit are just huge, consisting usually of ancient structures that tower over you, and natural landscapes of majestic proportions. There are also no loading times as you traverse the areas, so you may visit a great canyon, then climb all the way up and from some weathered ruins look a hundred meters down at where you started. (This must be even more awesome when you're playing in hardware-accelerated mode...)2. The spectral world — this is the dimension of the souls that is available to you, the Soul Reaver. It mirrors the material world but is only inhabited by demons and the spirits of the dead. The most amazing quality it possesses, though, is that it is crooked, twisted as if you were looking through a funhouse mirror. This change of geometry can happen in front of your eyes as you shift from one dimension to another.LoK: Soul Reaver really is a game that stands firmly between visionary and outdated — as well as awesome and flawed.For instance, combat shows signs that it could be really visceral and gory. Vampires you fight are immortal so in order to annihilate them, you will have to throw them in water, fire or intense sunlight; impaling with a stake also works to immobilize them. That means that every encounter has an environmental factor — you will need to push the foe into an open fire or skewer them with a standing candelabra. But very soon you've tried all the different ways of finishing enemies off and combat becomes a nuisance rather than fun. And when you ""die"", you go back to the spectral world where you have to eat a couple souls to bring your health up, and then get back to the material dimension — rinse and repeat.The whole game is actually like that, it consists of segments of contrasting quality. There's cool platforming and lame platforming (this is before more context-sensitive animations that you get with, say, Assassin's Creed, so one wrong step on that thin wooden beam and you just plummet down). Cool exploration and lame exploration (sometimes the structures you visit are extremely convoluted and hard to find your way around). Cool puzzles and lame puzzles...Actually, this last one is the worst. While some of the puzzles are very original (the entire game is), most of the time you'll be stuck not because you don't know how to solve some particular conundrum but because you may not even know what the conundrum is, or what your goal is, or where you are, or where you need to go. Typically, when you get to a major new room, a short cutscene has the camera fly around, finally getting centered maybe on some door or something else. From then on you're on your own, with little or no further clues.(Partly the reason for some confusion may be that the game was shipped in a hurry, and about 2/3 of planned features were cut. That left some empty spots where it seems like something should be etc.)The state of having no clue is actually going to accompany you throughout your journey as Raziel. This game does not hold your hand. I mean, there are literally whole game mechanics that are optional and have to be discovered. Hidden areas you have to find yourself actually make a substantial part of the game. And what you're exploring is an open world, you can go anywhere, go back to any location... and there is no map.So, would I recommend Soul Reaver? If you're afraid of messing around with ancient games that may or may not work, then maybe you should wait for a remake or something. But if you're not, and if you like action-adventure games (this one reminded me somewhat of Prince of Persia: Warrior Within), then it may be worth your time. It has a pretty cool fantasy story and is dripping with really awesome dark atmosphere. Took me about 19 hours to one-hundred-percent, although something like half of it was time I spent while being completely lost.			"

												It's a good classic game. I love that dark dirty atmosphere, the mythology and the design of characters (especially bosses). I love the puzzles. I love boss fights, where you can have time to think about their weak spots. Finally, I love the idea of two planes - if you're too weak, you move to the spectral realm and you can do other stuff before going back to material realm. Feels good, no immersion-breaking ""you died, try again"" scheme. However, the game is still far from perfect in my opinion.The camera and controls are just messed up. Seriously, it feels like they weren't tested enough. For example, seeing Raziel's butt zoomed in when you need to judge distance is nothing but good gameplay design. The level design often doesn't conform the camera movement, which, combined with camera-dependent movement direction, makes it very easy to fall off narrower platforms.I understand that many of those issues were common in that gaming era, especially the camera work, which apparently was a plague of TPP games back then. On the other hand, it's weird that noone complained about that during testing stage. It just feels bad and makes the game unnecessarily repetitive and frustrating on some locations (especially Rahabim clan's).Anyway, if you're immune to frustration, you should play it just for the atmosphere. It's so dark I sometimes felt like I didn't want to go any further into that darkness. It's like you never know what you're gonna meet in the next chamber/corridor. The graphics is also good, just low-res. Good colors, good textures and good models. It's still immersing, even though it's so old. The music makes you sink ever deeper.That ugly world, corrupted with pure evil, makes me want to drink fresh human blood.			"

												I HIGHLY recommend this game. I cannot stress this enough. I will seldom go in to detail for my reviews unless the game truly merits the extra information. If you can get past the dated graphics, the entire series is a must have in my opinion.There are a lot of interesting concepts here. The story has a lot of depth but the game can be confusing because there is nothing here to hold your hand while you play. I recommend a guide if you are looking for a smoother playthrough especially if this is your first time playing a Legacy of Kain title. If you are playing the entire series, I recommend reading the synopsis on Blood Omen prior to playing. It will serve as a primer for the series and you wont be confused when strange names are brought up within the game. Reading the synopsis will allow you a basic understanding of the game.If you are a fan of games like Dark Souls you will appreciate the freedom given to the player although the difficulty might not feel the same. Enemies within the game feel unique from lowly vampire fledglings all the way up to the bosses. I really have to emphasize how cool the boss fights were, especially when the game released. On my first playthrough I wound up skipping certain sections by accident and revisiting them later but at no time did the game ever feel incomplete. The environments felt compelling and whenever I reached a new area I was impressed.This was a great game and even if you cant stomach playing it I would suggest reading about it as that might compel you to take a second look. In my opinion this is a game that was created for a different time and a different generation and so might not appeal to everyone but it deserves true recognition in consideration that lots of work went in to the soul of this universe (mind the pun).A few names you might recognize that helped create this game are the famous Uncharted series creator; Amy Hennig. Tony Jay the voice of Raziel, Simon Templeman as Kain and so many others. This game was created when the player was still truely held in the forefront of the developers minds and could very well be the foundation for which a lot of newer games are built on.Please, Amy Hennig, hear my cries. Restore and remaster this series to give it the glory it deserves!			"

												I remember the demo of this game on PSone. When I got my hands on the full version, I was in awe. The opening scene alone was enough to inspire a movie. The puzzles, though difficult at times, were very satisfying to solve. The atmosphere was foreboding and dark, and the music took your emotions and wrapped them into the game. Raziel is one of my most beloved video game characters of all time. Deep in storyline and lore, this game was one of a kind and nothing short of breathtaking. I still watch the cutscene movies on YouTube to this day, and enjoy them like a movie series. Although the controls are wonky on the PC, a little fiddling and the use Xpadder makes the game very playable. If your looking for a nostalgic 3D platformer/puzzle/action game deep in storyline and meaning, look no further.			"

Raziel is resurrected as a soul devouring goul bent on the destruction of those who betrayed him as well as finding out the truth behing his ominous resurrection. Legacy of Kain's Soul Reaver is a 3rd person puzzle/action game set in Nosgoth, home of the ""Soul Reaver""- the vampires most formidable weapon ever forged, as well as ""The Pillars of Nosgoth""- a monument left to decay by Kain's willing hand. the legacy of kain universe is one with a rich storyline, monumental architecture, and with excellent dialogue.8/10			"

												I am not a keen retro-game player BUT this is one game that has remained my favourite ever since first playing it as a child. Legacy of Kain series may be outdated for its combat but the complex puzzles, compelling premise, character-driven plot and ability to use weapons in your environment to your own use outshine that. I am not bragging. The boss fights involve more than just hits and slashes, there are more hidden areas than you could imagine possible with upgrades of glyphs and power ups.  The environments are pretty open for exploration, enemies can be challenging especially in the spectral realm. This is the only game I'd score 10/10. Its sequels however....not so much.			"

												I don't believe words alone can describe how amazing and groundbreaking this game was... so here's a link to a picture of a man juggling cats: http://monkeypickles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cat-Juggling.jpgI'll properly start by voicing a complaint that the original Blood Omen is still not on Steam or GOG... Well now that that's out of the way I can move on to the game. Soul Reaver was my- well most peoples introduction to the Legacy Of Kain series and holy hellblazes did it leave an impression on me. The realm shifting gameplay was truly innovative at the time and the voice work, particularly the infallible Simon Templeman is incredible. That man has a voice crafted by the gods. On top of that the plot is astounding and a lot of it is all down to luck. If I recall correctly this game was heavily rushed by the publishers forcing the team (featuring video game goddess Amy Hennig) to cut out the original final portion, this led to them making a sequel. It could've ended here. Oh and the port is flawless so far, you might need a program to map an Xbox controller but my Nyko Airflo worked with it off the bat. The music by Kurt Harland of Information Society in a time when video game scores by famous industrial musicians were increasingly popular creates the perfect soundscape and more significantly the song Ozar Midrashim that features prominently throughout the game adds a lot to what is possibly the single greatest opening FMV of all time. In fact I highly recommend you just go on YouTube and look it up, if that doesn't convince you I can pretty much bet that no words I could write here would.This game, along with Metal Gear Solid are, for me, the absolute pinnacle of the PS1 era. I can't recommend this entire series enough.Edit: I last played this on Vista on my old PC so I don't know how it runs on Windows 10.			"

												Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver is the sequel to Blood Omen, and my god did it ramp things up quite a lot.The plot is, after the main character of the last game conquered the world. He kills you and throws you into an abyss. After that your corpse is resurrected and you have to traverse a dead world you helped destroy inorder to kill your murderer.The game is focused on puzzles moreso then combat, due to the fact you actually cannot die. The player instead shifts between the lightless and weightless dimension of the dead to the material realm. This is very important for specific puzzles and sidequests. The game takes place in a semi-open world with no loading screens. Another big part of Soul Reaver is just how many sidequests there are. Just running through the game will land the character with no health upgrades and no special glyph powers. Should the player return to prior areas you can find new things that you didn't see previously.However there are some minor flaws.The game ends on a cliffhanger that leads directly into Soul Reaver 2. There is also an entire website devoted to all the content that was cut prior to release.The other important aspect of this game is it's port. SR1's PC port is flawed in a few ways. Much of the soundtrack doesn't play at specific moments, and this reduces the quality of the game in a lot of unfortunate ways. It remains a bit of buyer beware in that regard.			"

												One of my favorite all time series. I only wish game's had story telling on this level now a days. It is admittedly very hard to get a controller to work on it right. but after a lot of work it got it going. Worth the trouble and the money any day to me. Amazing character development and voice acting all the way.			"

												While this game shows its age. You can't help but feel to be impressed just how far video games have come since that time.First and foremost is to rebind ALL of your keys if your playing on keyboard. It will be hard at times but by the end of the game you will get use to it. But my personal prefrence is to get a gamepad, much easier, and less annoying.Anyways, onto the game itself.As the impressive intro explains. You are Raziel, a trusted liutenant of Kain. After ""surpassing"" him. You are then betrayed and thrown into the abyss. For it's time the game can be considered scary especially when you run into the bosses. Also the game, doesn't really give you explict lore details. The game capitalizes on it's puzzles, dialouge, and impressive boss fights and places. The game kinda fills you in as you progress through the game. By the end of it. You should have a clear picture on the whole story.			"

												This game is great, it's a gem from a time when none of my friend's PC had the power to actually play it.  To me it was a darker version Ocarina of Time, with a relatively open world and a progressive set of abilities/equipment to help you unlock the paths throughout the world.  There is even a somewhat Link to the Past themed light/dark world mechanic at play, where you manifest in the physical and spirit worlds to solve puzzles.  And the puzzles are rewarding, mostly revolving around moving blocks around a 3D space, sometimes requiring proper orientation or stacking/destacking of blocks to add more challenge.Unfortunately the PC version (not sure if only Steam's) has an issue with the sound that begins to loop sound effects after playing for a while, so I would recommend purchasing this for the legal ownership and then emulating the Playstation version that doesn't seem to have this glitch.  Of course there is a graphics patch for the PC version so if muting the sound or just ignoring the out of place sounds doesn't bother you..TL:DR This game is worth your money and time, even in 2016.

												This was one of my favorite games of the PS1 era. It felt like a mature, horror version of the Legend of Zelda games I played so much of. It's a great adventure with decent voice acting for its time, decent combat with sometimes brutal kills, puzzle solving, and a sort of metroidvania aspect where you get new abilities and therefore are able to reach new areas of the game world. Unfortunately, if you're hoping to play with a controller, this game is unplayable. The left stick on my 360 controller is extremely sensitive, to the point that there is no dead zone, which means it thinks I'm always holding it in one direction or another. So as soon as you get past the long, unskippable cutscene, Raziel just starts running in circles and doesn't stop. For the record, this doesn't happen with any other game I play. The camera controls are garbage and you can't change them, and in the few minutes I spent watching Raziel run in circles, I noticed a lot of graphical problems. My refund request was denied. The problem is that I tried it for 10 minutes when I first bought it in 2013, and the controller didn't work so I just thought I'd hold off on it and wait for a patch. Obviously a game with controller support would get patched if the controller makes it unplayable, right? So skip to today (Sep 2016) and I see it in my library and think, ""oh man, I'd love to play that game! Maybe they fixed the controller issues after having 3 years to work on it."" NOPE. So because I bought it in 2013 and ""played"" it for 10 minutes, they didn't give me the refund. Classic PS1 game, unplayable port. Steer clear of this one.			"

												I cannot say a whole lot yet about the game except my first findings.As a Nosgoth player I got in touch with the Legacy of Kain series, this because a big part of the community I know, recommended these games to me. I normally don't really bother with games that are aged, but I thought lets give it a try and learn something about Legacy of Kain.I was supprised how much fun I have until now in this game. The graphics are of course out dated, but that seemed more that logic. The idea and the lore behind this game makes the Legacy of Kain series this great I guess.I do recommend this game to anyone who likes this kind of games, but I also recommend it to Nosgoth players who are not very familiar with the Legacy of Kain lore to learn something from these (LoK games) games.I do recommend using a controller cause I notice with a keyboard it sometimes can be quite hard to keep your aim at your vampire or human you want to slay.

												With Nosgoth coming soon, i thought i might write a review of one of its predecessors, and the one that I THINK is the best of the series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a journey throughout the now ruined land of Nosgoth. Many MANY years ago, the land was beautiful, but the Pillars of Nosgoth, which holds the world's balance together, became corrupted. Kain, the final Guardian of the Pillars, refused to sacrifice himself, damning all of Nosgoth to ruin. In the game, you are a Vampire that goes by the name of Raziel, who is the first-born son and First Lieutenant of Kain. Kain has a strong empire, but it grows weak, and as such, Raziel evolves aheadd of Kain, which is considered Blasphemy. You are thrown into a giant whirlpool of water, and that is where your journey begins. Raziel's Journey through the game is one of many twists and turns. I would reccomend this game to ANYONE who is thinking of joining the Nosgoth Alpha or just playing it when it comes out so you can get a feel for the Lore of the game. 10/10 would play in a locked basement for eternity.

												Easily the jewel in the Legacy of Kain crown, Soul Reaver's 3D metroidvania gameplay offers more exploration and a richer world than the series' later titles that moved to far more linear progression.This game has some of the best music, voice acting, story telling, and lore in any game I've ever played that just compounds with the great gameplay and level design to make it at the very least one of, if not my very favourite game.Getting the game to run in widescreen and using a modern controller requires a little work. The controller support doesn't include modern controllers (which is a pain), but I bought a $3 (including postage) controller on eBay that works fine, and the widescren fix is from one of the programmers (I believe).

												This was my first LoK game, that I played to death when it first came out and loved every second of it. It's a massive, open-world game that gives the player a lot of freedom to do what they want, whilst also offering a superb story to boot.It has dated somewhat since it was released. Graphics are forgivable, but the controls suffer from not allowing you to use a mouse. This leaves you with a gamepad - which I could never seem to get working properly. To elaborate - Raziel randomly seems to run off in a direction on his own (and no, my gamepad is fine). This can be solved by using Pinnacle Game Profiler. It also has some annoying sound looping problems, which can be fixed by running in software video mode.Issues aside, it's still a cracking game. None of the newer LoK games seemed to be quite as ambitious as this one, which is a shame. It remains a classic.Jimbo Rating: 5/10 (this would be a lot higher if the game did not suffer from sound and controller issues)			"

												This is painful to do but I can't recommend this game in the state steam had it when I bought it here.  One of the most memorable and greatest games I have ever played and a story I will never forget, but steam doesn't do anything to help the glitches.  I depends on your system, and if you really want to try this game then first check the discussion board about which versions of windows have had the most problems.When I played on Windows 7 the game was smooth other than the sound, which would run fine for a certain period of time before popping out and skipping.  The soundtrack is so good in this game, and dialogue is so crucial to this story that you need good sound if you want to get the full experience.  Keep track of the boards and any mention of sound fixes before buying this game.			"

The camera follows the same movement dynamics as if you were using the Playstation 1 controller.

												Literally the best game ever made in my opinion. Take Ocarina of Time style gameplay, mix in Tony Jay, Michael Bell, and Simon Templeman as voice actors, have Amy Hennig write the Elizabethan style dialogue, and have no loading times (unique for it's day in the late 90's) and you have Soul Reaver.DON'T BUY THE PC VERSIONS THOUGH, NOT EVEN THE GOG OR RETAIL DISC VERSION.Buy the Playstation version instead. The PC port is really bad, it's even lacking lot's of music tracks and even lacks the dynamic music the Playstation version did have. I don't know about the Dreamcast version, somebody else will have to vouch for that version.My top five list of all time great games:1. Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver2. Life is Strange3. Metal Gear Solid4. Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time5. Medal of Honor (Dreamworks Original)			"

												10/10 I want games to be made this good again.... PleaseSeriously this game was apart of what probably is THE best series ever made in gaming. None have stood out and have been as enjoyable as The Legacy of Kain. Soul Reaver is probably my favorite. (although If I had the patience for a Dos emulater I'd play the first Blood Omen as well and be just as happy) The game has an equal amount of combat and puzzle solving and the puzzles for the most part are straight forward, but some what confusing... until you remember the spirit realm will alter the room your standing in and hopefully help you reach that ledge that's to high or make a hole in a room you didn't think would have one and lead to a boss (hint hint sarafan hint hint) Also there are plenty of secrets you can find that can be possibly holding a power as a reward when you have found it.Not to mention the Lore in this game is fantastic and the amount of history that exists in the world that is sometimes only lightly touched upon but does exist in the gothic dying world known as Nosgoth is just as abundant as the lore that thrown at your face. The game's Narrative I think is what really makes it a legendary game. The morals discussed between Raziel and Kain. The concepts are enthralling and the roles each character plays no matter how small it seems still has a major impact on the world.This game turned it up to an 11 out of a possible 5. Thank you Crystal Dynamics for such an amazing Game.			"

The actions buttons work but Raziel will just start running and random directions and you cant make him stop. Playing with just the keyboard can be somewhat tough, at times.

												Upon launching into Soul Reaver, I was immediately disappointed. This is mostly my fault for not reasearching this particular port and not refunding the game in time. (This was less than $2 on sale after all)  Reviewers (and the PCGamingWiki) aren't exagerrating when they say this is a port of the Playstation version - it has the same blocky models and pixelated textures (that includes the company logos and menus). The game doesn't recognize mouse or X-input, so you need a DirectInput controller (pre-X360 era) or use clunky keyboard controls to platform and move your camera (thankfully, some controllers can DirectInput). I would recommend the Dreamcast version (the one I beat LONG ago), but the PC version allows retextures and an unofficial 60 FPS and widescreen patch.I only can recommend this if you're basically willing to play the PSX version with a DirectInput Controller. The 60FPS patch MIGHT give it an edge over the Dreamcast version, but I don't remember it's framerate.			"

												This game will only play when you run it as an administrator and the game pad support is terrible. If you want a controller you have to download third party software to map the key board keys to it. Your probably better of just playing a rom of this game.			"

												Soul Reaver was a timeless classic. Rich voice acting and a dark enthralling story makes the journey a compelling experience. You play as Raziel, a reborn, immortal, vampire on a quest for vengence against your vampire brothers who betrayed you at the command of your former master, Kain. Slay your enemies, solve puzzles, and slip in and out of the spirit world as soul reaving wraith.Sounds really cool, right? Pity, this game is completely unplayable. The PC port is worthless, controller compatible is non existent, graphics clip in and out, and crashes randomly. If you want a somewhat playable Soul Reaver experience try Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Watch the story on youtube.It's almost a perfect metaphor for the character Raziel, immortal and undying thanks to the steam port, but in such a grosteque form, it may as well be dead. Don't buy this game.			"

												Game is 'ok',  when comparing this to other 3d adventure games at the time (like: banjo kazooie, mario 64, crash bandicoot, etc) I have to say this one is more on the mediocre side (gameplay wise). It can be very confusing on where to go and what to do next but once you get the hang of the mechanics it starts to get less confusing. I had to use a walkthrough a few times here and there to help with progression but thats after I spent 1+ hours trying to figure it out myself, the game could really benefit from a map system. Nonetheless I could see it being a gem at one point and its a shame I missed out on this gem back in the ps1 days, I wouldnt call it a gem now since its dated really poorly but playing it in 2015 it was an alright game.6/10 (pc version)WARNING: Steam version can have some serious problems, may need to download a fix.

												The Legacy of Kain series is awesome and well deserves your interest but do not buy this game here. It is hideously broken and riddled with issues. The controller support is an absolute joke and it lacks mouse support entirely, relegating you to either playing it all with the keyboard or to acquire Xpadder or a similar program. The game also inexplicably corrupted itself and I lost all my progress. Aside from that the graphics and game play have not aged well and I made it to the third boss before quitting because the platforming frustrated me to the point of almost snapping my controller in half, made worse by the flimsy and roundabout way in which I had to use my controller. Raziel apparently has the need to hurl himself forward after landing on platforms so half the time I would fall off and have to start the section again. The only upside is that the story and dialog are still rock solid but if that's all you want you'd be better off watching all the cut scenes on YouTube. If you really want to play it your best bet would be to find a hard copy. I bought the series on steam in a bundle, here's hoping Soul Reaver 2 fairs better.			"

												As soon as i saw this on Steam i knew i had to buy it. Classic game with great gameplay. Different weapons, cool bosses, nice level design. I liked the Castlevania style unlocking of abilities as you progress. A great gothic story. Awesome characters with great voice acting. Good platforming sections and good puzzles. I didn't like the combat system though it felt clunky. The levels and puzzles get a little boring and easy towards the end.			"

												Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is the second game in the Legacy of Kain series, changing up the formula from a top down hack and slash to a third person puzzle platformer with heavy Zelda influences. Taking place some fifteen thousand years after Blood Omen you play as Raziel, one of Kain’s lieutenants who started to evolve past the Kain and he did not like that. The plot can be summed up as Raziel growing wings, Kain being jelly that he did not have wings, then deciding to break said wings and toss Raziel into a water vortex to send him into a painful death… there is more to it than that but without spoiling anything that’s the gist of it. Raziel stays dead for about five hundred more years before the Elder God brings him back to life as a wraith because vampires have taken over the world and he’s not getting enough souls to reincarnate which causes the land to decay, so he needs a ‘Soul Reaver’ to help kill off some vampires and what better one to use then one who would have a reason to go to hell and back to kill the vampire lord Kain?Overall the plot is solid, I enjoy the story and the feel of the gothic world they created and it stands the test of time, delivering great writing and voice acting which considering Amy Hennig of now Uncharted fame was the director, it is not a surprise. On top of that the graphics still somewhat hold up and for its time I am sure it was an amazing looking game. Now it has that PS1-era fabulous polygon look to it but even still I enjoyed the look of the game.However that being said it is -very- hard for me to recommend this game in this day and age. Combat with vampires is horrible with repetitive button mashing and having to find a way to ‘kill’ the vampire, which means beating him up enough to toss him onto spikes or into sunlight and then eating the soul to make sure it doesn’t come back. Because of this I found myself in the later stages completely avoiding all combat as much as I could, only fighting off creatures in puzzle rooms. The puzzles are the second core part of the game, and for the most part they still hold up at being challenging while never being too frustrating, though near the end they start to feel like busywork as you do pretty much the same puzzle three or four times in a row, sliding blocks around to match up some picture on the floor being the major offender of this.This all hinges on you knowing where you need to go however and the game does a bad job of telling you. It’s ambitious for its time to make this open world with a realm shifting mechanic allowing you to switch between a material and spectral world with the environment sometimes changing between the two, but when you are actually trying to get from point A to B and move the story along and the Elder God tells you its north of somewhere, you’re going to have a somewhat hard time figuring out just where he mean and how to get there.The controls are straight up bad and at many times unresponsive, I found myself falling off ledges tiny ledges due to how fast you jump or how hard the gliding is to control and because of this the dungeons become a slog very quickly, when the game asks you to do lots of platforming you’ll want to tear your hair out and smash your keyboard when one little mess-up makes have to walk all the way back to where you were before. And the bosses… oh my how they are horrible. Pretty much all the bosses are puzzle bosses because you can’t really fight them directly, but once you figure out the puzzle they all become incredibly easy, breaking down to smashing a few windows or pulling a few switches at the right time.Overall I can’t recommend this game. As much as I love the mood, tone, story, and characters, at the end of the day it is still a game you have to play and after about ten hours of tedious platforming and combat just to get an ending that gives you the middle finger and explains nearly nothing I was done. I can sum up the gameplay as ‘Off-brand Zelda’ in that you fight through dungeons, solve puzzles, fight a boss, and get a new power to help you out but it all just feels worse than how Zelda or other platformers of the same ilk do it.

												I\'m not sure if the game itself is any good or not, because I literally can\'t play it. I was finally able to get to the main menu without it crashing, just to have crashing in the very first room of the game. I have tried all suggestions from eidos and steam forums and cannot get this game to work.  It has \""Controller Support\"" if you can call it that, but it is literally unusable because your character just moves forward. Everyone, even the eidos forum moderators (which shouldnt be telling you to use 3rd party software) tell you to use xpadder, but I couldn\'t even get xpadder to work. Maybe cause i was just fed up and tired idk If you want to play this game, find some other way to play it. DON\'T buy it on steam to play on your modern PC			"

This game stands the test of time and if you are like me grew up playing this game on console it is a welcome addtion to my steam library.Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver action-adventdure game that is set 1500 years after the events that hand unfolded in Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain.Raziel is killed by kain but The Elder God revived him with the purpose of him becoming the god's soul reaver so he can get the revenge he so long desires against Kain.8/10 True Classic that is still as good now as it was back in '99 it is not without its faults but over all I advise you make this purchase or just wait for the collection to come up for sale again on steam.

												So far I have found this game to be fun to play, unfortunately since upgrading to windows 10 I haven't been able to get it to work. So for all I care it could be the best game in all of existence but if I can't actually play it then there is a problem, even if you can run it please note that there are some issues like the keyboard controls which are very unintuitive. In addition there is no way to control the camera at least not with the mouse, you have to press ctrl and 0 to move the camera left or right. Although you can use xpadder to adjust the control layout, but if you don't want to download it for whatever reason, then you better get used to the archaic controls. So as much as I have been enjoying this game, I can't recommend it because it simply isn't up to the level of quality that it should be. However if you really want to play this game check the steam forums for it first to see if you can found if people have gotten it to work.			"

The mouse is in-effective, so everything is done via the keyboard, this includes panning the camera, to pulling off multi-key movements. So you are forced to two hand the keyboard, which is awkward to say the least.This game is a damn classic, one of the best of its time, but this port is let down soley to the controls, and so unfortunately, as much as would hate to do so, I must give a non reccomendation.

												I LOVED this game to little bits when it came out.  It's the best.  The voice acting is top of the range (and made in a time when voice acting in games at all was rudimentary at best), the story is intricate and well-crafted, the level designs are beautiful, the music is wonderful and atmospheric.  The graphics are dated (it was made in 1999, what did you expect?), but everything about this game screams top quality, and I would love to play it again.However, this version is completely and irreparably broken.  The game starts (sometimes), the opening credits for Eidos and Crystal Dynamics appear, and then the game crashes, no matter how much you tweak the settings.Soul Reaver is a brilliant game.  But you can't play it, so don't pay for it.			"

												This is a great classic game, but the glitches are uncalled for.  Steam really needs to test run this stuff before putting it on the market.  I had to delete one of the files to make it work in the first place and it won't respond when I start it up half the time, forcing me to reboot my computer every time I want to play it.  And once you get it going, it's pretty glitchy.  At one point, there was a rushing water sound effect that got stuck and was loud that I couldn't hear any of the dialogue.To be fair, there are some good aspects.  It looks great and I think the controls are a smooth adaptation.  Their responsive and work well at least.  But they really need to work the bugs out.  I realize that this isn't exactly high priority for Steam, but if we're going to pay for something, we expect it to work.  So, I would hold off for a while or just find it used.  A PSX and a copy of Soul Reaver will run you about 25 bucks total depending on where you get it.  Just don't bother buying it here unless you're prepared to fight with it.			"

												This is my first review... and sadly I have to use it to turn you away from one of my favorite games. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is an amazing character action platformer that released during the PS1 era and gameplay-wise, still holds up today. Though not on PC. Running on Windows 8 with a mediocre laptop, I could get the game to run with no audio problems or graphical issues, but as anyone who's played on PC for more than az week knows: you need a controller for these kinds of games. Simple enough. The game has controller support and it's plug and play. And there's the problem. It's controller support is total♥♥♥♥♥ The in-game character likes to run up to the right when you idle, and he never runs straight. You can't just use the d-pad like the original game either. The only way to make it work is to download multiple control mapping programs. Sure, there are keyboard controls, but there is sincerely no viable way to play like that. You can't map the mouse whatsoever, so good luck scrunching in on your keyboard trying to make an accurate jump. I'm really depressed with how this port acts and I'd like to save anyone who was wither a fan like me, or new to the game from that feel.			"

Plenty of people can't get it to work on their computer and then after trying all the known fixes are able to get it to work.Maybe that'll be you.But you pay for the game either way.Only buy it if it is worth the gamble for you, because you might get absolutely nothing.

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out my  Steam profile, the  Youtube channel, and the Twitch channel[twitch.tv]!!So this is the very first time I've ever played through any Legacy of Kain game, and after beating down Soul Reaver, I am overwhelmingly impressed.  Soul Reaver is an action/adventure/puzzle solving game in where you (Raziel), are harnessing a deep hatred for your former leader and pseudo-father figure, Kain, that runs so deep that an elder god decides to  utilize you as his weapon of destruction against Kain and his forces, as they have left the entire world in shambles from centuries of war and butchery.  So let's get down to it!Gameplay:  Definitely one of the high points of this game (and there are many) is just the overall gameplay.  The controls might be a little loose, but the targeting and the executions are spot on.  And fun.  Like, suprisingly fun.  Nothing quite like taking a spear from a wall and impaling a demon/vampire creature straight through the abdomen, while absorbing it's soul afterwards for sustenance.  If this sounds like fun, definitely get this game because you will be doing this a lot.  Don't misunderstand though.  Incredibly, this game actually focuses more on puzzles rather than direct action.  Even boss fights are generally a small puzzle that needs to be solved, rather than directly assaulting the giant, horrific monstrosities (because let's face it, that immediately doesn't sound like a good idea as soon as you see any of the bosses).Oh, and this game is not exactly easy.  Some of the platforming can be very difficult due to the loose controls, and the world does not exactly hold your hand.  It is very open-ended.  Very few hints are littered throughout the world to guide you on your way, but just enough is given to you if you really pay attention to what is being said.  In an age of games that practically play themselves, this particular type of difficulty in a game is a very welcome feeling.The only slightly negative part of this game are the overwhelming amount of block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  Block puzzles.  BLOCK PUZZLES.  At any point in time through the game, it's a good bet that a block puzzle is within at least two rooms of where you are currently located.  They are interesting, but the developers really went all out with these puzzles.  None of them are too overwhelmingly difficult, but when they're in every room, it becomes mundane and repetitive.  Graphics:  Fantastic graphics for it's time.  Remember that this game did come out in 1999.  A mere three years after Super Mario 64.  There are a lot of clipping issues obviously for this particular period in time when this game was developed, but overall the game is pretty gorgeous.  Animations are very smooth, enemies are interesting, environments are gloomy and downright spooky, and bosses are horrendously disgusting looking.  Even for today's games, those bosses are the things of nightmares.Sound:  So the sound in this game is phenomenal, and probably the highlight of the entire game (at least it was for me).  Every movement makes a sound that is very adequate for what it is representing, but the sountrack that kicks in every once and a while is perfect for the theme of the game.  Dark, gothic, and eerie.  Partners perfect with what is happening on the screen at all times.  Especially the opening cutscene music, that also just happens to play near the end during a particularly important part of the game.  Oh, and the voice acting talent is, for lack of a better word, incredible.  Tony Jay is still severely missed.  The script is so well written that several games that are released these days, could learn a lot from sitting down and playing this game.Lasting Appeal:  So the total game took me about 12 hours to beat, and that's exploring a good amount of the world.  Didn't go for 100%, but pretty close.  Beyond reliving the adventure again, there is not too much reason to revisit this game after beating it.TL;DR - Great gameplay with a few flaws + decent graphics + fantastic audio + incredible story = 8/10PC PROBLEMS:  I would strongly recommend against using they keyboard and mouse controls (even though it is possible to just use them), and follow the community guide in the hub that points you to XPadder so that controller use can become enabled.  It is a very short and easy to follow guide that will have you using a controller flawlessly within ten minutes.Also, I know other Steam users are claiming that the game would crash on them constantly, but I personally never had this problem.  I only ran into a few glitches in which I decided to restart because the audio would fall behind drastically, but if anything that was just an annoyance and I wasn't forced to restart if I didn't choose to.

												This game was one I had vague memories of playing a demo of. So, when I found the collection was available on PC for $5, I quickly scooped it up because Gaben.TLDR: Moar Puzzle, Less Fight. Like? Buy. Not like? PASSOverview: This game takes place in a land called Nosgoth. You play a death angel who turns into a zombie-vampire hybrid who can't die now. Your job is to get revenge on Kain, for leaving you in this ghoulish state, and then ruining Nosgoth while you were in the underworld. The game truly is an Eidos title in more ways than one.Pacing:The game's pacing is nonexistant. It managed to feel the same during all 10 hours I played. Maybe it picks up later on, I don't know tbph. Once could call it postapocalyptic.Gameplay-Combat:The combat just seems to lack flow. Many many areas are full of enemies that respawn so constantly that it's almost not worth it to fight them every time, and just run+jump past them. Or use Spirit Realm if you can get away with it. The first boss of the game is a puzzle boss. Bleh. Without spoiling anything, I had to use a walkthrough in the same manner I used a walkthrough with HeXeN.Gameplay-Puzzles: BLOCK PUZZLES, SON. Also, stuff that isn't obvious. Painful and requires a walkthrough beyond the first twenty minutes or so.Story: The story is an odd thing, one that doesn't irk me or compel me. Perhaps it's because the first game in the series isn't available for PCs. The game manages to advance the story without drowning you in exposition too much, although there are a few too many cutscenes for my liking.Controls: Standard clunky PS1-ported-to-PC controls. Can't even use a mouse. A shame, because i'd love to LOOK UP.So, in conclusion, I can't wholeheartedly reccommend or deny LoK:Soul Reaver, in spite of me being forced to put a NO. It depends. Do you like Tomb Raider and other similar games? Liked HeXeN? Dive right into this gem. Want a more actiony thing to play? AVOID. The puzzles get to the point of feeling forced, imo.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM. It will not work. The entirety of game time I have spent on this game has been spent trying to get the game to work. Every time I start it it stops responding. I did get it to run once, and a blaring noise was playing for the entire time, and I couldn't hear any of the cutscenes, making the game all but unplayable. It's ridiculous that a paid game on Steam doesn't work right after purchase. I haven't checked the version of the game on GOG, but I would assume its more playable than the version on Steam. When this version of the game actually works (which it probably never will) I might be inclined to recommend a purchase of this game. If you do want to buy this game, buy it on sale. I'm glad I bought this on sale and didn't pay the full price for it.			"

This port is a travesty--buggier than an entomologist's trophy room with massive gameplay and sound issues.  I can't recommend this Steam version.  I recommend finding a PS2 emulator, because this one will just reaffirm your belief that Steam and game developers hate players.			"

												I give this title a 'no' because it's unplayable for me. The sound is skippy and lags atrociously. Unlike some games, the video/gameplay doesn't outpace the audio by more than a sentence or two, but when the audio only plays half a sentence at a time, it makes cutscenes painful and tutorials nonsensical. The series is a fabulous one, and Blood Omen 2 and LoK: Defiance seem to be excellent ports. Soul Reaver 2 also seems to be working much better than this. Only this title suffers from unplayability.			"

												Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver is a forgotten gem that spawned one of the best written and best voice acted franchises I've ever seen. Sadly, the industry is at a constant change and this game couldn't just keep up with it's speed.Let's start with the good elements, the story.Soul Reaver tells the tale of Raziel, a vampire damned to an eternity of agony by his creator Kain. Who somehow survived his descent into the lake of the Dead and is now transformed into a ghoul, a shell of his former self. Raziel then swears to get his revenge against the man who once betrayed him and who has now led his land to ruin.First things first, the writing is just amazing. From the brooding, gothic narrations of our character Raziel, to the shakespearean speeches of our antagonist Kain. Amy Hennig surely did a great job of defining who these characters were and a way to identify this game among the ocean of poorly written cash grabs that plagued the industry at it's time. World building is in every corner of this game, from little tidbits about the lore to just small visual details of the dark and Gothic steampunk fantasy setting of Nosgoth. Which was something you didn't really see that much in 1999.The voice acting is amazing and it still holds up to this day, from Michael Bell's gothic narrations of Raziel, to Simon Templeman's defiant and perfect representation of the amazing villain that is Kain.In fact, this game's opening sequence has to be the best opening sequence I have ever seen in a game, it's visuals look great (even today kinda), the voice acting and narration not only manages to set the character motivations and general setting, but it also manages to be great at it.The problem with the story though, is the ending. Without spoiling that much all I can tell you is that the game ends in your average ""To be Continued..."" cliffhanger, which is not satisfying at all.On the other hand, the thing that draws this game back is the gameplay. Not that it's bad, but it's horrifically dated. Soul Reaver is a Zelda-esque game that features a fully 3D open world with explorable dungeons and collectibles, but the catch is that in the game you are allowed to visit another realm of this world, The ""Spirit Realm"" let's you see things that are not normally present in the physical realm and it also acts as a warp place whenever you lose all of your health. Now, the main draw in all of this is that the Spirit Realm kinda makes the game a little too easy, because there is no real consequence to dying, it really just makes most of the tension go away from combat, which also get a little too repetitive sometimes. But of course, the main draw here are the puzzles. Now, do you expect to see puzzles that creatively use the realm switching mechanic? Well, Yes and no. Because for the most part you are treated to just block jigsaw puzzles (A little too much like in Zelda), these get VERY repetitive, VERY quickly and as I said really don't do more than just make the experience less enjoyable. Now, but when you're treated to realm switching puzzles it always just comes down to plaforming while switching back and forth between realms. Now, this could be enjoyable if only the controls weren't so dated. The camera is the biggest offeder here, because the game constantly requieres you to look up, but the camera can only rotate left and right. Another problem with the open world is that most of the collectibles featured in this game are completely useless, because the game is far too forgiving. I often found no difference between having a long health bar and a bunch of OP power-ups or not having them at all. Another problem with exploration is that the game gives you no sense of direction in any way, and there are no unique or indistinguishable areas in all of Nosgoth that help it either due this game's graphical limitations.Another thing that hasn't aged well about this game either, are it's graphics.Most of the areas just look very same-ish or would look good back in 1999. Another issue I take with the graphics is that many cutscenes are poorly rescaled more often than not leading to some mess of blurry pictures that are supposed to be FMV's.The soundtrack is also good, but not something amazing. What's really good about it is how it dynamically changes depending on the environment you're on. Overall, the only way I can reccomend Soul Reaver is if you buy it in the Legacy of Kain Collection bundle, when it's on sale at that. It's a good game, one I will certainly remember in the years to come. But it's just such a chore to drag through this game's flawed and clunky gameplay just to get to an unsatisfying ending. Because in the end, most of the good elements this game once had are now gone. Why? Because this is no longer 1999. Most of the things this game does (Lack of loading screens, amazing voice acting, great writing, open world, etc...) are now standards to the game industry and they are just no longer impressive when you play it nowadays. If this was 1999 I would've given this game a must buy, but sadly in the year 2015 this game cannot find a proper place to fit in.Maybe you'll like it, but for your own sake try to not to buy this game individually.PC PORT REPORT:Now, the main reason you shouldn't buy this game is because of the god forsaken PC port. This game was clearly intended to be played on a Playstation 1, and it shows in this port. Because the controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ with weird camera controls (LCTRL and RCTRL?) that while they can be rebinded, never offer an experience as gratifying as playing with a mouse. Plus, this game restricts controller support, only offering support for now dead gamepads (I tried with my DirectInput controller and my XInput controller and niether of them worked). The menu's are poorly rescaled and as I mentioned so are the cutscenes. And of course, the crashes. I didn't get as many crashes in my playthrough of the game, but they are here.This is just a lazy straight-up port of the PS1 version of the game. If you ever plan to play this game, just get it for the Dreamcast or the PS1, and if you don't have either of those consoles, just emulate it. If you don't want to emulate it either, do not buy it standalone. Buy it in the Legacy of Kain collection bundle when it's on sale. I got it for 5$ with the rest of the series and so should you.			"

												I wouldn't recommend buying this but that's not to say it's without it's merits - the writing and voice-acting in particular have been greatly praised and from the very beginning these make the game easy to love, especially if you are a fan of high fantasy and dictionary use. However, equally noticeable are the inadequacies of the game engine in realizing the ambition the devs had regarding ""the bits in between cutscenes"", or ""gameplay"" as it is otherwise described.The first, and perhaps most irritating problem is that this is at heart a console game, and the port is BAD. The controls are, by default, WASD for movement and the arrow keys for actions. That's right - NO MOUSE. I know this is an old game, but it's a real shame that including support for one of the most basic faculties of a PC wasn't considered a priority, it couldn't have been too difficult to implement considering how much better the game would be for intuitive camera controls.  Without them establishing even a basic awareness of your surroundings can take around half a minute of slowly shuffling around and resetting the camera, which makes even simple tasks extremely fiddly and only accentuates further problems.Secondly, the combat. I can see what the devs were trying to do but it comes out too clunky and situationally a nightmare in the hands of some poorly designed environments. The combat is based off some novel principles - most of the games enemies are undead, and as such require more killing than usual, most encounters will involve incapacitating enemies before destroying their body, with the use of fire, water, sunlight or simply impaling them. This is an interesting mechanic but quickly becomes at best a chore and at worst extremely frustrating. The worst example I can provide is when the player is required to enter a room which contains 3 aggressive enemies but no environmental means of finishing them off, by this time the player has access to a weapon which can incapacitate and finish enemies, while remaining available at all times - but only when the player has full health, as a result, taking even a single hit will remove the player's only means of winning the fight and will require the player to retreat to heal before trying again, this would perhaps be a ""fun challenge"" if the combat possessed any depth, but the lack of any means of blocking or countering enemy attacks makes this an almost impossible task, requiring either luck or to get enemies stuck in the terrain - there is only one attack type (which I might add, is assigned to the same key as USE, have fun bashing doors), this gives the player basically no options regarding combat and allows no means of skill to assist in most encounters. (BTW the example takes place in a room with a multi-level block puzzle. Also the enemies respawn occasionally. FunFunFun.)Like I said, the story is excellent, but if that's all you're there for then you might as well just watch a silent playthrough on youtube, which I actually do recommend.But as far as playing the game yourself is an option, I'd say don't bother.TL;DR -- Gameplay sux, v. dated, bad port but great story, voice acting & visual design.

												Gameplay: The gameplay is just horrible and clunky. There is no mouse-support whatsoever and even if you play with a gamepad, you can still only go strict left, strict right, strict forward or strict back... No diagonal movements allowed. I also experience a bug where my character just continues to run in the direction it was last going (even though I'm not touching my gamepad at all). I've tested my gamepad and it's not broken. It is in fact the only game where this happens.The bad commands make even the easiest tasks incredibly hard sometimes.Score: 3/10Scenario: The story is just superb and well thought. You really get sucked into this universe from the first few minutes you start playing this game. It is as complex as it is entertaining. You'll have some pleasant surprises along your road, and some less pleasant surprises but I won't spoil ANYTHING! :)Score: 9/10Video/Audio: Soul Reaver is such an old game that it becomes hard to judge such things. Some textures have been polished, which is nice, but on the other hand, the sound seems worse than in 1999 on the PSX version of the game.Score: 6.5/10Overall: The game itself is really great and fun to play. You'll have about 10-20hrs of pure pleasure (depending on how good a gamer you are). I would certainly recommend this game if you don't mind playing with both hands on the keyboard all the time since there is no mouse support and game controller support is really bad.Score: 6/10 I would give the PSX version a 9/10, the points lost are due to the controls and the bad audio.

												DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM! There are too many bugs and no one to fix them. Random red spikes pop out of the ground, everything's squished, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamepad support, everyone stutters (TRIGGER WARNING ableism) and the looping layered audio bug makes it so it sounds like Sunn 0))) did the score, and I can't stand Sunn 0))). Get it on GOG, PSN, or burn a Dreamcast disc. If you don't have a Dreamcast, ♥♥♥♥ you, get a Dreamcast. Honestly, I heard the game wasn't even that good, maybe you should just play Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 instead.BONUS REVIEW: Rollercoaster Tycoon 2This game is really good. It's got all these great sim elements like adjusting the prices of concessions and merchandise, which means you can do some really sheisty business decisions like jacking up the price of umbrellas when it starts raining or making drinks free and charging to use the restroom. You can build a bunch of roller coasters and make them crash into each other and you can even run a few actual Six Flags amusement parks! Pretty sweet deal.			"

												I love Raziel. I finished Soul Reaver 2 three or four times before playing other games of this franchise. Soul Reaver 1 is badly done, however. The world of Nosgoth, plot and voice acting are great, but that's it. Camera work is terrible, game doesn't support a pad (you must use 3rd party program to make it work) and keyboard controls sucks and swallows. Sound often is delayed, some textures do not load from time to time and game crashes in last location (and not only for me) so you can't complete it (I watched youtube walkthrough instead). You can spend a lot of time exploring, which is nice, but rewards for doing so (except for satisfaction itself) are useless because fighting is too easy. About half of your time you will spend standing in place or running pointlessly around wondering ""what the actual ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to do THIS TIME?"".Play it if you:-like Raziel-You want to discover all the plot twists in games featuring Nosgothor-You live in 1999.

												As much as it pains me to say it, I can't recommend this. Countless bugs and hitches plague this port, and with no mouse support, you'll have to get creative with the camera panning controls.At times, the sound will completely wreck itself, with almost no sound playing at the right time, or even playing at all. It quickly becomes a muddled mess of extreme latency, and doesn't change unless you restart the game.This is only the tip of the iceberg, of course, as other issues such as the music not changing, some remaining compatibility issues, and a lack of updated graphics (like the Dreamcast version) end up tarnishing the game.If you want to try this fantastic game, get the Playstation version. It's a hell of an experience. Don't let this shoddy port job ruin it.			"

												The joystick / controller support is fairly bad.  Aside from that the combat is very basic, quite repeitive and dull.   It seems like the game is mostly just running though a long tube with no real choice as to where to go.  I also think the FoV must be quite small because after a while I started feeling a little nauseous.I know in the distant past that friends of mine raved about this game. I think back in the day the games were very simple.  After playing far more complex games, I do not think I can get much, if any enjoyment from the older, simpler games.Its kind of like, you played with match-box cars as a kid, and then one day started playing with RC cars.   Its kind of hard to go back to matchbox cars.			"

												This game has NOT aged well. The tutorial explains approximately 1/100th of what you actually need to know in order to progress with the game, and that's if you even make it that far past the game's tendency to completely fail to load. This game was clearly designed with a controller in mind (as it's a PlayStation game), and trying to play with a keyboard is a horrendous exercise. Considering that, you'd think they might have patched in modern controller support? Nope, another part of the port that's broken. This game is not worth the $1.74 I bought it for.			"

Note: this is a recommendation, not a review, and was written before recommendations were converted into reviews.LoK is my favorite game series, ever, and I own them all for PS1/2. Of the five games, I'd rate Soul Reaver as the best overall, with the original Blood Omen trailing slightly behind it. Soul Reaver 2 isn't bad, and Defiance is cool, but you're not missing much of anything if you skip Blood Omen 2. Regardless, Soul Reaver and Blood Omen (if you can find it) hold up very well as individual games, with excellent storytelling, good gameplay, and fitting music. Vae Victis!			"

												I first played this game about 2 years ago and despite its age i thought it was brilliant. I haven't played Blood Omen, and you don't need to in order to enjoy this game. It's a good idea to read up on a bit of the backstory as it will help you understand things to do with the world and the main antagonist, Kain. You play as Raziel, Kains lieutenant, who was sentenced to death by Kain. Thrown into an burning hot abyss Raziel is killed but is brought back in a more demonic form by the Elder God. In return for this 'gift', Raziel must become the Elder Gods 'Soul Reaver', and feed the Elder God by absorbing the souls of his vampire bretherin during his vengeful hunt for Kain.The game is an action adventure puzzle solver, very much in the same field as Tomb Raider, but more demonic (obviously). Of the 3 Soul Reaver games (that's including Defiance) this is definitely the most dark and chilling. There isn't as much story in this one as there is in the other 2 games and the story progression is pretty straight forward. You must find your vampire bretherin to help lead you to Kain in order to get your revenge. Along the way there are a few plot twists that make you think there's more to the current events than meets the eye, and the ending proves this even more so.The gameplay itself doesn't drive the game nearly as much as the story, and you'll probably find that with all the games. Combat is pretty basic, and the majority of the puzzles involve pushing blocks around. Some may find the game becomes stale, but it really all depends how attached you become to Raziels cause. As the story progresses and secrets unfold you'll find yourself driven purely by the need to know what it all means.The voice acting in this game is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the environments are fantastic and the soundtrack is phenominal. Everything in the game pulls you in and makes you really care about what has happened to the world, and makes you want to know why (i won't go deeper as i don't want to spoil anything). This is easily my favourite game in the series and i highly recommened anyone to give it a try.			"

												This game is really fantastic. It combines puzzles with a pretty nice fighting system and one hell of a cool story to top it all off. If any of you have played the original release on PS1 you already know this game hasn't been named one of the best games on PS1 without a reason.However this port is quite unsatisfactionary to say the least. It plays just like on PS1, it looks good and I had no problem with setting up my controler to work with it (be sure to not only change the configuration of the controler in game but also to select it to be the prefered method of playing from the pause menu in order to make it work) but there is one huge problem. It crashes randomly. I have tried multiple different resolution settings but either way it crashes every now and then.I have managed to get only about 4 crashes throughout the whole game but at the very end of the game, there are a lot of cutscenes and I had to replay all of them at least 5 times to get past them. It would always crash. Finally, I decided to check for integrity of the game cache (which is an option that can be found when you right click the game in your library and then go to properities) and it found 2 corrupted files. Guees what? One of them was my save file and it got deleted. Right before the last boss fight. All in all, I have managed to find a save file at this exact point on the internet and I have finished the game but I am still quite dissapointed that Crystal Dynamics have done nothing about this problem.To sum it all up - If you like adventure games with good combat system, original story, puzzles and a big world to explore (with a lot of secrets to find, optionally) then this game is definitely for you. Even after over a decade this game still feels right and puts a lot of newer titles to shame. If you don't want to deal with multiple crashes though, you're probably better off buying the original PS1 version and playing it on some sort of emulator.Oh and if you're wondering about gameplay time, it takes about 16-17 hours to complete if you decide to find most of the glyphs and some of the health upgrades but it should take even up to 30 hours (or more?) if you decide to find every upgrade and all of the glyphs. It might also vary a lot depending on how well you solve puzzles. It sometimes takes long time to figure out what to do. I used a guide only twice but I suppose it was much more rewarding to not use it more.			"

												Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is one of those games you truly have to play for yourself to appreciate. This game is quite dated, having originally been released in 1999. Despite its age, and the poor graphics by today's standards that comes with such age, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and truly the entire Legacy of Kain series in general, still remains my very favorite video game of all time. The game's story is marvelously  well written, leaving you wanting to know at all times what happens next, what's around that corner, and what kind of environments you will discover. This game hits it out of the park with not only its well-written story, but its phenomenal audio work too. The soundtrack is absolutely superb, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. The voice acting is amazing, featuring some big name voice actors, including Tony Jay - famous for Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Simon Templeman, my personal favorite voice actor - famous for many roles, including Gabriel Roman in the Uncharted Series - and many more. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was developed by Crystal Dynamics (famous for the Gex series and Tomb Raider series) and published by Eidos Interactive. The lead director for the game was Amy Hennig, who later went on to co-direct the Uncharted Series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is filled to the absolute brim with secrets and hidden rewards, and I highly encourage those of you who purchase this masterpiece of a game to explore them all.Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and the entire series in general, is a true masterpiece of gaming. Its graphics may be rather dated by today's standards, but they're rather good for the standards of when it was released in 1999. The true art of this game is not in the graphics, but rather the storyline itself as you follow the fallen Vampire lieutenant Raziel avenge himself and uncover the dark truths of the hypocracy he sought to destroy. With twists and turns around nearly every corner of this exquisite work, you will be highly entertained and likely will want the other games to complete the story. I do warn you however that the storyline can get very complex, but I feel as if that merely adds to some of its charm and beauty.When all is said and done, I cannot recommend this game enough. I grew up with this game as a kid with the original PSOne version. I now own the PSOne disc for this game, the PS3 download of the PSOne classic from the PlayStation Store, and the PC version from Steam. Even as I own three copies of the game, I cannot help but feel as if the game deserves to cost more. At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.			"

												I first played Soul Reaver during the old Sega Dreamcast days. Being one of the few games that I owned, I had a natural fondness of the game, in spite of all its difficulties. Camera problems can make the game tedious at times. The graphics are decent for their time. The voice-acting is above average. All in all, this is a nostalgic experience. I rate the game a 6/10.			"

												Great game, but a lousy port. I'm okay with keyboard control - back in the day, we didn't have these modern analogue sticks - but the intermittent sound bugs (where a sample will stutter and loop rather than ending, drowning out everything else) and, worse, the fatal bugs (I have yet to defeat the spider-boss without the game crashing) make the game unplayable. I'm still hoping that someone will come up with a fix at some point, otherwise, I'd be discussing returns with customer service...			"

												Ahh the legacy of kain series. I played soul reaver like crazy back on the dreamcast, never really got tired of it. It's truly a fantastic game, although compared to modern games some people may have difficulty with in game direction, it's easy to get lost or forget what you are doing. The controls are confusing to get accustomed to, i reccomend using a controler and mapping whatever layout you feel best, or look up a classic layout from this games playstation or dreamcast version. Go into this game with patience, and you will be rewarded with an imersive and compelling story paired with intuitive gameplay and a rich story. You will not be disapointed.			"

												Played this on the playstation 1 when it first came out, amazing game.No spoilers: it has a good interesting storyline, decent platforming mechanics with plenty of puzzles and a pretty good combat system, and plenty of secrets/ collectible upgrades to search for. My only criticism is the controls for the PC version... It doesn't have the best controller support, which is something you might want, since the keyboard setup isn't anything to boast about. Still, that's something you can find a work-around for, and it's still a top notch game.I'd recommend this for anyone who's looking for a good classic to play through.			"

												Great game, loved it back in the day, this port is a little lacking though :/. It doesnt have support for most newer controllers, so unless you have Xpadder, youre using a keyboard. Using a keyboard for a game like this makes it virtually unplayable. Luckily i have Xpadder so its no big deal. Fantastic game, and series, i wish they had the first blood omen though.			"

												Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is one of those games you truly have to play for yourself to appreciate. This game is quite dated, having originally been released in 1999. Despite its age, and the poor graphics by today's standards that comes with such age, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and truly the entire Legacy of Kain series in general, still remains my very favorite video game of all time. The game's story is marvelously  well written, leaving you wanting to know at all times what happens next, what's around that corner, and what kind of environments you will discover. This game hits it out of the park with not only its well-written story, but its phenomenal audio work too. The soundtrack is absolutely superb, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. The voice acting is amazing, featuring some big name voice actors, including Tony Jay - famous for Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Simon Templeman, my personal favorite voice actor - famous for many roles, including Gabriel Roman in the Uncharted Series - and many more. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was developed by Crystal Dynamics (famous for the Gex series and Tomb Raider series) and published by Eidos Interactive. The lead director for the game was Amy Hennig, who later went on to co-direct the Uncharted Series. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is filled to the absolute brim with secrets and hidden rewards, and I highly encourage those of you who purchase this masterpiece of a game to explore them all.Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and the entire series in general, is a true masterpiece of gaming. Its graphics may be rather dated by today's standards, but they're rather good for the standards of when it was released in 1999. The true art of this game is not in the graphics, but rather the storyline itself as you follow the fallen Vampire lieutenant Raziel avenge himself and uncover the dark truths of the hypocracy he sought to destroy. With twists and turns around nearly every corner of this exquisite work, you will be highly entertained and likely will want the other games to complete the story. I do warn you however that the storyline can get very complex, but I feel as if that merely adds to some of its charm and beauty.When all is said and done, I cannot recommend this game enough. I grew up with this game as a kid with the original PSOne version. I now own the PSOne disc for this game, the PS3 download of the PSOne classic from the PlayStation Store, and the PC version from Steam. Even as I own three copies of the game, I cannot help but feel as if the game deserves to cost more. At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.			"

												Don't let that low playtime deceive you; I've spent more time in Soul Reaver on the console than I'd care to mention.This game has an absolutely riveting, Gothic story narrated by some of the BEST voice actors to ever grace the field (RIP Tony Jay), solid gameplay, decent block puzzles, and more secret content than you can shake a stick at.Speaking of the secret content... Dear GOD is there a lot of it! It is possible to complete the game, start to finish, and only experience about 40% of the entire game! There are so many glyphs, eldritch energy pickups, and life coil extension pickups that you can get lost in just collecting the miscellanious crap!Combat can be hit-or-miss (moreso on the PC than the console because of the movement controls), but overall it feels visceral and satisfying; there is something disturbingly cathartic about beating a vampire about the head and neck area before tossing him bodily onto the nearest pointy bit of architecture.However, I WILL admit that this game has not aged well graphically. At all. The opening movie aside (which shames current-gen consoles TO THIS DAY I might add), everything is hilariously blocky, even by late-90's standards, and it was one of those games where no one had a moving mouth texture.... Origami graphics aside, the game is a source of nostalgic eyecandy from the Dreamcast/PSX-era gamers on here; you can thank Soul Reaver for pioneering continuous-streaming, open-world games like GTAV.TL;DRPros+engaging, well-delivered story+Visceral, satisfying combat+Mind-bendingly horrific boss battles that lend a sense of power to their participants+Epic traversal and mobility mechanics+A large, fairly-open world full of rich, well-written lore+Tony Jay, Michael Bell, Simon Templeman and Anna Gunn all in the same gameCons-This game has NOT aged well-You can tell a lot was cut out of the game before release-PC controls handle like a technologically-advanced turd-Low replay value except for story-Major audio glitch (rare as it is) can wreck enjoyment quickly			"

												Oh how i love old school games.I was never a fan of kain but love the adventures of raziel, the cool swarve angel of death. Playing the old ps1 game on a PC just brought back the warmth and enjoyment i once had back in the day as though nothing had changed.Sure its being dated is an under statement but the game play remained every bit as enjoyable as raziel morphs from one plain to the next seeking out revenge where ever he can find it. You wont find a dark souls element of difficulty but what you will find is a great story that puts you on an adventure well worth the trip.If after reading this and the other posts you fancy a blast then may i recommend the legacy of kain collection in a steam sale, that way you get soul reaver 1 and 2, blood omen 2 and defiance.

												I loved this game for the PS.  It was hands down one of my favorites the storyline is like a good book or movie, that being said I am totally not loving the control interface and the movement is extremely clunky with a keyboard.  this game was made for a gamepad.  The camera is manual aim and you have to constantly move it so it is looking in the right direction and the controls you press will change direction as the camera moves (extremely frustrating) there is no strafing movement either.  i remember this being alot more fluid.  Story is still the same so it is entertaining but i think that some time could have been spent updating the graphics and motion issues plus there should be a controllable zoom for 3rd person view it is a little close to raziel and this only compounds the camera issues.  In the case of the hardcore fan I think could overlook most of this but the general gaming public would get fed up with this game really quick			"

												The second game in the Legacy of Kain series, Soul Reaver follows the bad ending of Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, where Kain, a former nobleman turned into a vampire to take revenge on his murderers, took part in the events that involved restoring the world's balance. Stepping aside from its vampiric roots, Soul Reaver ventures into a demonic area, telling the story of Raziel, one of Kain's ""first-born"" vampire leutenants who was thrown into the Abyss for daring to evolve prior to his own master, only to be awaken centuries later by The Elder God in a spectral realm.On his quest to avenge his death Raziel must solve a lot of environmental puzzles that involve switching between material and spectral realms in real time. Enemy encounters are quite rare, but the fights look stylish thanks to many various ways you can finish your opponents using either weapons or the environment.Controls are somewhat awkward and require some time to get used to. Being released in 1999, the game looks amazing even today. The world of Nosgoth is huge and seamless, you will never see a single loading screen here. Voice actors do an impressive job reading through beautifully written dialogues, which makes the complete lack of subtitles even more disappointing.Soul Reaver is simply one of the best action-adventure games of its time. If you missed it during the PSOne era now is a good chance to join Raziel in his atmospheric journey through life and death.			"

												According to Steam, I played this for twenty-one hours. I could say that isn't really the case. A lot of that time was spent trying to get it to work. The game would work perfectly one day, then would just stop working on another. There are even times where it crashes taking a few steps after the game lets you play. Not to mention the amount of times I had to reinstall this game.Although I'm totally fine with the game only being 30FPS, I tried SRHook to play it at 60. Doing so will make the game skip all the cinematics. I asked on the Game's Discussion page if there was a way to still get the cinematics to play while using SRhook, and was told that there isn't anything that can be done. So, I just decided to remove SRHook when I got to parts that had cinematic cutscenes.I used a Dualshock 4 and Inputmapper to map the controller buttons to be keyboard inputs since just using an xinput controller won't make it work properly.It's really a shame that this game suffers from these problems as it's still pretty solid during the times when it actually worked. It felt like it did when I first played it on the Playstation, I never finished it then, which is why I got it here on Steam. Besides the problems stated above, I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs or glitches. Just make sure that when using SRHook, cap the framerate at 60 as it'll mess the game up a bit when played higher than that, specifically with some puzzles that need the constrict ability. But that's not the game's fault. The gameplay still holds up, each boss isn't just a straight up fight, and are themselves puzzles (except for two). The story is a big part of the whole Legacy of Kain saga, and is still in my opinion one of the best in gaming to this day.If you can put up with the crashing, and are lucky enough to not have the game stop working at all, it'll be a good experience. If you have very little patience with these things, you may want to pass on this version and play it on the PS3 or if you still have your PS1.			"

												If you're not familiar with The Legacy Of Kain franchise, you've missed out on one of the most intriguing, dark, thought provoking and fantastically written stories in the video game history.Soul Reaver is gameplay-wise a very enjoyable game to play. It may take a little getting used to, as it was 1999 when the game was released in terms of its gameplay mechanics, but once you get used moving in the full 3D world that Crystal Dynamics created for you, you will master Raziel's combat techniques in no time.Btw, the main character's called Raziel.The sound in Soul Reaver is superb, and really compliments the storytelling of the game, with big dramatic scores and creepy, brutal sound effects. In general the soundtrack is excellent and really drives this whole experience home, also Soul Reaver has been praised for it's top notch voice acting and i agree. It's some of the best that gaming industry has to offer.This game also happens to have my favourite video game song of all time, which is the intro; ""Ozar Midrashim"" by Information SocietyOh, and trust me, the story in Soul Reaver is amazing! But it's only fraction of the lore that the developers created for us and to fully appreciate it for what it is, one needs to complete the whole Legacy Of Kain series.Amazing game, hands down the only series I will happily say I am a fanboy of. Amazing voice acting and a deep, well written story will keep you playing and wanting for more.This masterpiece absolutely demands a modern day ressurection, as well as the whole series needs to be brought back!

												Excellent game that the publisher saw fit to release on Steam in 2012, but not to update to work with the hardware a player should be expected to be using in 2012 (e.g., Xbox controller). The game does not understand analog controls, and the character is in a constant state of running in circles as long as a contemporary controller is enabled. Resolution options go no higher than 800 pixels and do not stretch to fit during gameplay. In all, the game is broken unless you happen to be using hardware from the time of the title's original release in 1999.			"

												Fantastic game, story line is immersive and you just can't help but love how perfect it is, for a game that is 16 years old.Sure, the game doesn't look too well with high resolution screens or that it is a bit chopsy to play with it's own controller support option.  It isn't the best port for a game but it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it for the gameplay.Other reviews on here are ridiculous.  People with 0.2 hours on record saying it looks too bad and that Valve have 'stolen' their money for not refunding them?    - What, you guys expect the graphical standards of Witcher 3?  Along with that, Valves no refund policy is the same on pretty much all of their store, so you're giving the game a bad review for that?If most of the negative reviews had a little more than 0.2 Hours on record, they'd be able to provide a more credible opinion.For storyline, it's my favourite game.  I love all 5 parts of it...some (this and defience) more than others and the voice acting in the series is unreal.  If you can enjoy a game for it's story and not for how pretty it looks, then you'll love this good old gem.  Just keep in mind that this game was released 16 years ago on the PS1 and dreamcast.Oh, and if anyone want's to use an Xbox 360 controller with the game, I use Xpadder, just contact me if you want to use my profile, I've also shared it on the discussion page.  :)			"

												This game has the best story in a platforming game ever. The voice acting is perfect and all of the characters are interesting. I've won this game, Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance a long time ago, and when I saw that this was on sale in the Eidos pack, I just had to buy it. The music is also great, but there is one thing that annoyes me and that is that the sound sometimes buggs out and replays the same sound over and over again. Also if you want to use a controller for this game, it's hard to setup. But I like to play with a keyboard in this game anyways. Use the wasd keys to move around, Q to devour souls, E to grab and throw, space to jump, Lctrl to crouch, 4 and 6 to move the camera and 8 for the action button. This series is a must play for all gamers who likes story-rich games!I rate to story of Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver, SR2 and Defiance 10/10Controls: 6.5/10Voice acting: 10/10Soundtracks:8/10Sound effects: 6/10			"

												This game is still amazing today.The graphics are very dated. It doesn't matter how buff your system is, the models and textures look blurry and old. They are old.This game is HARD, you are not going to sail thru it like a lot of the games that come out today. Some of the puzzles in this game are so devious that you can get stuck for hours...... The combat is lame at the start, but by the time you are done it's pretty good. The devs really use the environmental hazards well.The story in this game is so good that I can't think of a word to describe it. This game is slow to start, but a few hours into it and I think any gamer would be hooked..........I had ALL KINDS of strupid issues trying to get this to run on windows 10, and even more issues trying to get it to function with an Xone controller.......... but I did get everything working, and I am glad. The environments and story in this game draw me in pretty deeply. No matter what gen gamer you are, this game is a timeless classic.Hints for Windows 10 users: Make sure you select a resolution that is x32 instead of x 16. The x32 resolutions are at the top of the list rather than the bottom where one would normally find them. Don't even mess with the graphics settings in game, use your Graphics card to set up effects and aa values. The only thing you need the launcher or in game settings for is to set the resolution.No matter what kind of hardware you have, chjoose the rendering option that mentions direct x.If you wanna use a 360 or Xone controller you will have to set the control option to KEYBOARD and then press the buttons on the controller in keyboard settings. Analog controls simply do not work with this game unless you are using Pinnacle Game Profiler or something else that is able to read analog input as mopuse coordinates.Expect to spend some time getting the game to work on W10............

At a marvelous price for the quality you get, this game and its entire series are both a must-buy and must-play, and Legacy of Kain remains to this day a true example of what video games should be: An interactive story, and an art form, not just a mindless shoot-em-up. If you've still read to this far in my review, please, do yourself a favor and get this game. If you are not pleased, I will be extremely surprised.			"

												WARNING: I don not hate this game in any way in fact i love it dearly, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥why is this version so bad? The pc edition of this game is horrible and non functonal almost. I have almost no complaints to say so far when it came to the controls (apart from the gamepad being buggy and not being able to even use it) and the overall port in general. But halfway through my playthrough of the game i was met with utter disgust and rage to see my pc telling me ""KAIN.EXE HAS STOPPED WORKING"" and now i warn you LOK and EIDOS fans alike, DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL ♥♥♥♥ING EXUSE FOR A PORT. buy the PS1 or Sega Dreamcast version but by ♥♥♥♥ do not buy this port. Heck! I' gonna get a LOKSR PS1 rom now to fill my horrible feeling of being ripped off, anyone who has had these problems deserves their money back.			"

												to make a story short, this is probably one of the best story that came out for the psx, and for those who knows the series it bring nostalgia for sure. I still dont understand why Nosgoth turned into what is turned right now, but like they say everything comes to an end. Dont buy this if you expect xbox controller support, as the game came out much more before the Xbox360 was an idea. Nothing more nothing less to say, except this is a must buy when Square put the bundle for the whole series in special!			"

												The human world of Nosgoth has fallen, thanks to the selfish actions of Kain.Now the vampires rule supreme and Kain had over the course of many years assembled a trustworthy group of vampires, one of them being Raziel.However, Kain was shocked to one day see Raziel walk into his throne room with a pair of wings on his back, he had evolved wings before Kain and he saw this as a threat against himself and he tore Raziel's wings apart and then had him cast into an abyss where he burned for many many years.But Raziel is given life once more by a mysterious being called the Elder God who has given him a chance to get revenge at Kain for his actions.Raziel has also been given the ability to switch between the real world and the more ominous spectral realms where not only evil spirits lurk, but also solutions and other paths through the various locations he will be exploring.A must have for those who enjoy third person action and exploration games where puzzles are just waiting to be solved.

												Not sure why people are not recommending this game!  Yes, the port in its standing is terrible, but once configured using an alternative gamepad program like JoyToKey; the game is exactly like the PS1 or Dreamcast, only better grapics!  I have only 40 minutes on this game (for PC, I have countless hours on PS1) and I already have it all set up the way I want it.  No audio or grapical glitches that I have encountered yet (aside from it being, you know, 16 years old and very polygonal.)  I highly recommend this game, and this port.  I do think Steam and Square needs to fix the version a bit to include better gamepad functionality and maybe update the graphics even more.  It is possible to play this with the correct key configuration on a keyboard, it just takes some time to get used to.  I still highly recommend this game, for old and new comers to the land of Nosgoth!			"

												I have been a fan of Legacy of Kain series but never did play this game when I was a child because the game was too simply too dark for me but the whole lore of the series has intrigued me in the longest time (my dad played this game and was immediately hooked as am I).I played this game after playing Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain for the PC(Why didn't they have this on Steam?) and like Blood Omen, the story is clearly superior to other games of its time, having a superior voice acting talent in this game with a proper direction of the story to boot. The characters in this game are pretty likable in telling the story of the game, the character you play, Raziel, often tells you, time to time, his views of the current world he is in, in a pretty elaborate and amusing way during his journey. I have to say the character development regarding him is well done once you are done with the game. This game's story takes you far into the future, centuries after Blood Omen. There are few references from Blood Omen that are mentioned in the game, I'd say it's not that important to play Blood Omen, but it's clearly recommended for future references in the other games.The gameplay seems fresh for a PSOne/PC(1999) title, 3D Platforming is a notable element of the game, jumping around the place feels very organic in a way that it paved way for future 3D action/adventure to takes notes on basic things such as climbing using the ledge to reach another platform. Gliding feels pretty organic too because of the big and high places you will venture to, it proved useful in Raziel's journey. This game also has puzzles for you to uncover while most of them are cube puzzle where you have position the cube like objects to its correct positions, although it feels pretty ridiculous as God of War's Kratos doing the same thing(and Thank golly, it was this game that started this element of gameplay), it felt pretty fun and I had the feeling I have to finish it right away, but I can't help that I'm thinking that Raziel would be better off as a ""Plumber"" of sorts, he certainly has a great talent for it, *snicker*.The fighting system feels that it contributed a lot to upcoming games such as Devil May Cry, Dark Souls and other action/adventure games that have a feature for you to lock on the enemy in close combat while holding a button. While holding the ""autoface"" button, you automatically focus on your current adversary and anticipate his move. While in this state you anticipate his upcoming attack and dodge with the proper directional button and the jump button. This would lead the enemy to be in the open, off-guarded. It's a simple mechanic that does its job well in the starting stages but as you progress, you uncover more skills you can abuse to your enemies such as things from side quests.Side Quests in the game does make the game a little easier but it is no easy task to uncover them blindly though. The side quests contain powerups that would increase your health, your magic and your arsenal such as glyph spells. The game would be little more of a challenge if you play without the powerups, but just a little because of one little thing.This game setting has you going into different realms time to time in real time. I'd say it's an impressive feature back in the day, because the 3d setting changes/transforms IN REAL TIME as you change from one realm to another and it is needed for you to do in order to progress more into the story.The enemy designs are pretty grotesque and scary, it is what repelled me from playing it as a kid. I think third boss and its minions takes the cake that will keep preventing me from getting a sleep for a day, two or three if I was dealing with this game back then. Dealing with the bosses require you to analyze the environment and take it as an advantage to defeat you adversary, it will take time figuring it out but you will accomplish it nonetheless. The sounds are fit the setting but the ambience of the setting puts me on edge especially when the game decide to bugs regarding the sound such as sound loops and what not, you know I just have to reset and load the game from where I was. Voice acting is top notch, it is dramatic but it does its job pretty well for a video game of its age.This game has certain bugs/glitches such as game crashing suddenly during lengthy play times in a sitting, enemies going T-Stance on you all of the sudden, sound loops that are pretty scary and nerve wrecking. They are pretty minor and not necessarily would break the game render unplayable.  Just save consistently, you can save anywhere. I MEAN IT.I played this game using a twin PSone/PS2 controlller usb converter and the game responds well to my controller. I don't know about 360 wired controllers though. Playing this game in this day and age is pretty refreshing from the modern games we have now and I have to say this game did age well in its own. I would rate the game 9/10 if not 10/10. A truly underappreciated game.			"

												Don't let that low playtime deceive you; I've spent more time in Soul Reaver on the console than I'd care to mention.This game has an absolutely riveting, Gothic story narrated by some of the BEST voice actors to ever grace the field (RIP Tony Jay), solid gameplay, decent block puzzles, and more secret content than you can shake a stick at.Speaking of the secret content... Dear GOD is there a lot of it! It is possible to complete the game, start to finish, and only experience about 40% of the entire game! There are so many glyphs, eldritch energy pickups, and life coil extension pickups that you can get lost in just collecting the miscellanious crap!Combat can be hit-or-miss (moreso on the PC than the console because of the movement controls), but overall it feels visceral and satisfying; there is something disturbingly cathartic about beating a vampire about the head and neck area before tossing him bodily onto the nearest pointy bit of architecture.However, I WILL admit that this game has not aged well graphically. At all. The opening movie aside (which shames current-gen consoles TO THIS DAY I might add), everything is hilariously blocky, even by late-90's standards, and it was one of those games where no one had a moving mouth texture.... Origami graphics aside, the game is a source of nostalgic eyecandy from the Dreamcast/PSX-era gamers on here; you can thank Soul Reaver for pioneering continuous-streaming, open-world games like GTAV.TL;DRPros+engaging, well-delivered story+Visceral, satisfying combat+Mind-bendingly horrific boss battles that lend a sense of power to their participants+Epic traversal and mobility mechanics+A large, fairly-open world full of rich, well-written lore+Tony Jay, Michael Bell, Simon Templeman and Anna Gunn all in the same gameCons-This game has NOT aged well-You can tell a lot was cut out of the game before release-PC controls handle like a technologically-advanced turd-Low replay value except for story-Major audio glitch (rare as it is) can wreck enjoyment quickly			"

												Nonexistent optimization for modern hardware notwithstanding, this is still a very good game with excellent atmosphere as well as interesting and bleak visual design. For such an old game, it doesn't control nearly as bad as one might expect it to, even if a few platforming segments may be frustrating. Puzzles are simple but enjoyable and bosses cannot be defeated through direct combat, meaning you have to look for other means to beat them.The voicework is top-notch, as is the dialogue but you really have to play the other games because this one offers no conclusion of its own, in terms of story.  P.S. - Always make a backup of your save(s); look for it where the game executable is (savegame.her). I lost nearly two hours of progress on account of the game crashing and forcing me to validate some files, erasing the save.			"

												Played this game on the PlayStation when i was younger and just got completley captivated by the whole gothic, vampire theme.There really isn't anything like the Legacy of Kain series in the way it portrays vampires. There is so much lore and history to discover in these games. SoulReaver is technically the second game if you put the games in release order with BloodOmen being the first, but it's set far in the future of all the other games. This may be a little confusing with some of the characters dialogs because they often refer to events which the player would not have witnessed (yet). This for me is what has kept me curious of the whole history of Nosgoth and wanting to play more. In this game you'll experience a unique concept, puzzles and gameplay. Exploration is rewarding and the story will make you want to uncover the truth behind Kains evenful actions. If you love vampires, a dark gothic atmoshpere and a gripping plot you'll love these games!!!!			"

												This was a classic from my childhood. I remember playing in on the Playstation for hours! The story is great, the voice acting is amazing (especially for the time) and the game mechanics are engaging and smooth. There's nothing quite so fun as clawing a vampire into submission, picking him up, and tossing him into a bonfire. The puzzles are a nice touch as well, although they tend to rely very heavily on the ""move a block strategically"" idea. The only criticism I have is that the PC port has somewhat dicey control at times. I couldn't get my gamepad to work with it, so I had to use the keyboard, which isn't the easiest way to play this otherwise timeless classic.			"

												A game over 10 years old still plays better than most of the dreck produced by AAA publishers today. What is this I don't evenStory's fantastic. Audio (and especially the VAs) are great. Dialogue is really really well written (dat Raziel snark, so good hnng).  The puzzles and platforming hold up well given their age. Graphics are obviously dated (again, over 10 years old) but they hold up surprisingly well too. I think this is due to the in-game world and the art style. I don't want to say that the dated graphics ""add"" anything to the spirit realm but they are entirely fitting with the spooky, surreal atmosphere there.TL;DR Soul Reaver series is awesome, Nature Abhors A Paradox/10 would ♥♥♥♥ with the time stream again			"

												The best game in all of the Legacy of Kain saga ... Raziel is one badass character, the game play is as expected from a game this old, but still, it is a great addition to all the old school fans like myself! As expected from a LoK game, there are plenty of puzzles and with every boss kill you gain a new skill which helps you move forward in the game, and the story is great! Overall, pretty awesome!			"

												I remember this game, when it was released and hit the PS1 with big impact. I can't count the hours on PS1, how long I played this (and how many times I finished it). I loved the game... And then, when I entered world of Steam, this was 1st game I got here and played. Oh, the nostalgia! Yes, graphic is horrible, considering modern standarts, but hey, this gem is old! PC controlls are a not OK, I strongly recommend controller, mostly because you will fight with camera, which is fully controllable and that means more work for you. Even though it's not something major. Story, atmosphere, shifting between worlds and intense combat makes this game real good. Story - to fully understand it, I'd recommend to play Blood Omen (I & II). SR: LoK happens after. World itself is wrecked with cataclysm, humans are at the bring of extinction thanks to vampyric menace. Dark fantasy post apocalyptic action adventure, this describes the game. Story itself begins with lust for vengeance and that drives you trough game. But, as you uncover the story, you'll get the feeling that you are only a pawn. But who pulls the strings? Bossfights are clever, brute force will not help you. And you know what? You can't die...What needs to be admired, is leveldesign. Gothic architecture with landscape, filled with fog and ruins of once blooming civilization. And when you shift into spectral realm (underworld, if you want), whole world twists and new path for progress emerges. What can be little anoying for some players, is that you need to travel to already explored locations, because you get new ability, which enables you to get to new locations. And it's really worth it, because you can get to health/magic powerups, spells aka glyphs and fire enchant for your symbiotic sword, Soul Reaver.Game itself is huge, but once you know locations, you can make speedrun without problems. To travelling between locations are used warp portals, and you will like them, because when you save, after restart or death you'll begin at the very first location. It's part of the story, so don't consider it a bug.Overall, the game itself is 85% from 100%. In time, when it was released, it was compared to Tomb Rider III and was considered almost equally good. And the best part is, that it's only a beginning of the story, which is almost like written from Shakespear. Followed by SR II and SR Defiance, great story unfolds before your eyes and you'll soon understand, why it's hidden gem.			"

The year is 1999. The series was a reasonably established and when we found out there was going to be a new one, everyone was excited to see Kain's progression as a vampire and his expertly written narration of an exciting new story.And then the trailers were released. We are suddenly told that Kain is the antagonist of the game and that was truely puzzeling. It wasn't often that you saw the protagonist of the earlier games be the bad guy. But enough about /back in the day/ stories. Let's talk about the game.THE STORY. Is it any good?The Legacy of Kain series has always had delicious, delicious narration throughout every game and this one is no different. It's a great way of giving exposition. Though sometimes they take control of your caracter for an unreasonable amount of time to vomit exposition down your throat, but at least it's all very well written.THE GAMEPLAY. Does it hold up?This game was well made and rarely bugged out and had great mechanics and decent camera control. (In egoraptor's voice: for the time...) The thing is about third person games, they didn't have a clear idea of how to most efficiently program the controls, like most games at the time. And even so the camera sometimes get distracted with a wall or some♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't matter, it didn't really bother all that much for the most part because fighting had a lock on system and the geometry was mostly simple. The only problem I encountered was in the plataforming segments. This game has a lot of that. and sometimes there were stupid time constraints (because of the many puzzles) on top of plataforming and my 8 y.o. self got extremely frustrated at times.Fighting is pretty basic... And dying is virtually impossible because when you die in the material world you go back to the spiritual world where only goofy dobby looking monsters are present most of the time and they're not really much of a threat. And regaining health is just a matter of holding one button and sucking every cotton candy ball floating around all over the place (AKA Souls). But given how the game is mostly plataforming and puzzles, that's not really an issue.-------CONCLUSION-------In conclusion I'd give this game a sexy voice naration/10. The controls are decent for 1999 and vampires are pretty coolsers.This game was a big inspiration for the guys who made Darksiders 2, I'm pretty sure. Both games are narated, puzzle driven stories with the bad guy being the protagonist of the earlier game, so if you like Darksiders you should really try Soul Reaver, or any Legacy of Kain game. Also I'd like to point out that Square Enix are remaking this game so I'm looking foward to that.Kain Dies.Not really. "

												Legacy of Kain is one of my favorite series of games.  Soul Reaver, being the first one I played, drew me into the world of Nosgoth. At the time though, I had no idea what I'd gotten into, given that I was just a kid whose strategy to games was mash all the buttons until I won. Years later, after I had already played the other ones and finished them, I find this on steam (After an attempt to buy the game from amazon to find that it was damaged beyond repair. Never again.). -Gameplay   Pretty good for its time.   Takes time to get used to with keyboard and mouse. Constantly had problems with camera angles. Would have been better with controller support.   The game is full of puzzles, so it's more than just fighting endlessly (not that I have a problem with that).-Graphics   Nice gothic design.   There were a few glitchy moments when the textures would bug out.-Sound   Sound...It takes a little bit of messing around with patches to get the audio right. At first, the sound would just keep looping forever, getting worse whenever I paused the game.   Aside from that, the soundtrack was great.   The dialogue was also great, given that most of the games of its time had little dialogue. I will never forget Tony Jay as the Elder God.Overall 8/10. Would have preferred it on console, but I can settle for this.Still waiting for more LOK games			"

												Everything in Soul Reaver just fits so perfectly into the game that it is hard to not recommend. Nothing in Soul Reaver feels like it's there just to be ""there"". The only thing that is noticeable is that it seems as if Soul Reaver was cut a little short with it's abrupt ending and it's pacing does seem to get a little off towards the end, with a large amount of confusing puzzles thrown at you in the last hours of the game. Otherwise, it is a very remarkable game that is highly recommended to people who still don't mind playing old games.			"

												This game hasn't aged nicely. I can't say the same thing for it's story though (when I count the SR2 and Defiance in too, since these three come in a nice cheap package). The graphics were pretty good for PS1 game, however today... Polygons are not as numerous as one might like. And yet the story (Blood Omen, Soul Reaver 1 & 2 and Defiance, Blood Omen 2 being a non-canon spin-off) is what keeps you playing. BO1 ended with you choosing to doom the world and rule it (the other ending is not canon), SR1 & 2 end with cliffhangers after they set up so much and Defiance wraps it up with a nice ending that I certainly wouldn't consider cliché. Too bad we never got the last game that wraps the entire story up, but these three deliver a mature story on their own. It is nice to see vampires portrayed as something different than what we are used to.Definitely try them out, just be prepared for some headache-inducing puzzles.			"

												Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was the game that made me a gamer.  It's a hidden gem that deserves more credit that it has gotten.  It goes beyond just a simple game about vampires.  It adds a very complicated but intriguing story that makes the game more interesting as you play.  The more you play, the more you want to know what happens.  Although not as good as today's standards, the graphics were stand out in it's day.  The gameplay is simple and easy to understand.  The voice acting counts among some of the best in gaming history (in my opinion).  I encourage everyone to give this game a try at least once.  You won't regret it.			"

												The second game in the Legacy of Kain series, Soul Reaver follows the bad ending of Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, where Kain, a former nobleman turned into a vampire to take revenge on his murderers, took part in the events that involved restoring the world's balance. Stepping aside from its vampiric roots, Soul Reaver ventures into a demonic area, telling the story of Raziel, one of Kain's ""first-born"" vampire leutenants who was thrown into the Abyss for daring to evolve prior to his own master, only to be awaken centuries later by The Elder God in a spectral realm.On his quest to avenge his death Raziel must solve a lot of environmental puzzles that involve switching between material and spectral realms in real time. Enemy encounters are quite rare, but the fights look stylish thanks to many various ways you can finish your opponents using either weapons or the environment.Controls are somewhat awkward and require some time to get used to. Being released in 1999, the game looks amazing even today. The world of Nosgoth is huge and seamless, you will never see a single loading screen here. Voice actors do an impressive job reading through beautifully written dialogues, which makes the complete lack of subtitles even more disappointing.Soul Reaver is simply one of the best action-adventure games of its time. If you missed it during the PSOne era now is a good chance to join Raziel in his atmospheric journey through life and death.			"

												This game is still amazing today.The graphics are very dated. It doesn't matter how buff your system is, the models and textures look blurry and old. They are old.This game is HARD, you are not going to sail thru it like a lot of the games that come out today. Some of the puzzles in this game are so devious that you can get stuck for hours...... The combat is lame at the start, but by the time you are done it's pretty good. The devs really use the environmental hazards well.The story in this game is so good that I can't think of a word to describe it. This game is slow to start, but a few hours into it and I think any gamer would be hooked..........I had ALL KINDS of strupid issues trying to get this to run on windows 10, and even more issues trying to get it to function with an Xone controller.......... but I did get everything working, and I am glad. The environments and story in this game draw me in pretty deeply. No matter what gen gamer you are, this game is a timeless classic.Hints for Windows 10 users: Make sure you select a resolution that is x32 instead of x 16. The x32 resolutions are at the top of the list rather than the bottom where one would normally find them. Don't even mess with the graphics settings in game, use your Graphics card to set up effects and aa values. The only thing you need the launcher or in game settings for is to set the resolution.No matter what kind of hardware you have, chjoose the rendering option that mentions direct x.If you wanna use a 360 or Xone controller you will have to set the control option to KEYBOARD and then press the buttons on the controller in keyboard settings. Analog controls simply do not work with this game unless you are using Pinnacle Game Profiler or something else that is able to read analog input as mopuse coordinates.Expect to spend some time getting the game to work on W10............

												Excellent game that the publisher saw fit to release on Steam in 2012, but not to update to work with the hardware a player should be expected to be using in 2012 (e.g., Xbox controller). The game does not understand analog controls, and the character is in a constant state of running in circles as long as a contemporary controller is enabled. Resolution options go no higher than 800 pixels and do not stretch to fit during gameplay. In all, the game is broken unless you happen to be using hardware from the time of the title's original release in 1999.			"

I've won this game, Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance a long time ago, and when I saw that this was on sale in the Eidos pack, I just had to buy it. The music is also great, but there is one thing that annoyes me and that is that the sound sometimes buggs out and replays the same sound over and over again. Also if you want to use a controller for this game, it's hard to setup. But I like to play with a keyboard in this game anyways. Use the wasd keys to move around, Q to devour souls, E to grab and throw, space to jump, Lctrl to crouch, 4 and 6 to move the camera and 8 for the action button. This series is a must play for all gamers who likes story-rich games!I rate to story of Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver, SR2 and Defiance 10/10Controls: 6.5/10Voice acting: 10/10Soundtracks:8/10Sound effects: 6/10			"

												If you're not familiar with The Legacy Of Kain franchise, you've missed out on one of the most intriguing, dark, thought provoking and fantastically written stories in the video game history.Soul Reaver is gameplay-wise a very enjoyable game to play. It may take a little getting used to, as it was 1999 when the game was released in terms of its gameplay mechanics, but once you get used moving in the full 3D world that Crystal Dynamics created for you, you will master Raziel's combat techniques in no time.Btw, the main character's called Raziel.The sound in Soul Reaver is superb, and really compliments the storytelling of the game, with big dramatic scores and creepy, brutal sound effects. In general the soundtrack is excellent and really drives this whole experience home, also Soul Reaver has been praised for it's top notch voice acting and i agree. It's some of the best that gaming industry has to offer.This game also happens to have my favourite video game song of all time, which is the intro; ""Ozar Midrashim"" by Information SocietyOh, and trust me, the story in Soul Reaver is amazing! But it's only fraction of the lore that the developers created for us and to fully appreciate it for what it is, one needs to complete the whole Legacy Of Kain series.Amazing game, hands down the only series I will happily say I am a fanboy of. Amazing voice acting and a deep, well written story will keep you playing and wanting for more.This masterpiece absolutely demands a modern day ressurection, as well as the whole series needs to be brought back!

												The ""Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver"" is a Playstation classic.  It is challengine to play, has amazing characters, and ""Tomb Raider"" style puzzles.  The puzzles aren't as difficult as ""Tomb Raider"" puzzles, but has its own unique style.  Its a darker game, about vampires, and doesn't follow suit with the stereotypical vampires.  The ambient music is dark, and it fits with the game, plus it doesn't overpower the gameplay.  It is a platformer that really makes you think.The downsides to this game are minor.  It can be too confusing or difficult at times.  The graphics aren't new, so this game may look to be poor quality, but was pretty good for its time.  A few glitches that can hinder gameplay (not many at all) are around.  Weapons don't respawn since they stay where you left them.For those who enjoy a challenging puzzle, platforms, and a unique style of gameplay, this game could be for you.  The story for this game is one to remember.  The only downside to the story is it continues on to the second game, so no second game, no complete story.			"

												This is the classic Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver that you, like me most likely, played on the original Playstation! It's still the same, and still rather good, though there are two major problems with this port that you should know:FIRST: This is a direct port of the Playstation version, not the Dreamcast. This won't trouble many people, but.....SECOND: The sound issues with this port are deplorable. Music won't work correctly and will reset when the game is paused, sound will cut out or altogether be delayed and sound static-like, and, the worst sin, there are songs missing from the game. From my own play through, these are the missing tracks: all of the spectral music, boss music, various combat loops, and the puzzle OSTs.I'd actually recommend getting an emulator and playing the Playstation or Dreamcast version over this.

												Well, it appears I changed my mind on this title in retroperspect. My initial points still stand - the game's camera system often is nothing short of awful, and the Steam version is a very lackluster port that is wildly inferior to the original PS/Dreamcast versions.That being said, the game has plenty of good sides - there's an entire set of spells that sort of act as a side-quest in that you will never run into them if you just follow the main mission. The platforming generally is solid (so long as the camera doesn't get in your way), and although the combat system has its issue (with enemies thrown onto the stabby bits necessary to pernanetly kill them often magically landing next to them rather than on them), its still rewarding in its own way - the fact that you usually fight no more than 2-3 enemies at a time shows that you're fighting against powerful vampires, not jut plain old mortals.All things considered, Soul Reaver is a neat specimen of classical jump'n'run adventures, but suffers from the camera and collision issues games of its time often had to deal with. If you can tolerate the latter, it is nonetheless an enjoyable experience.			"

												Before I begin, I cannot stress enough the important of not getting this on PC. Soul Reaver is way too old to be compatible with modern day computers. Now then . . . This is a game mirroring an era where getting lost was part of the experience and the gameplay and voice acting were stellar. While newcomers to the Legacy Of Kain series might be lost a bit, Raziel provides a clean slate for players. Someone to identify with and someone who grows more mature along with us as we play. And the voice actors, oh dear Nosgoth, the voice actors. Intimidating when they should, imposing when they need to be and identifiable every step of the way. Vampires were never before cast under this kind of light and Soul Reaver gives more lore for us to swim into the tragedy of what it means to be part of a machine that could as well be a metaphore for today's game industry or any industry for that matter.Just be prepared to get lost a bit.

												I remember this game, when it was released and hit the PS1 with big impact. I can't count the hours on PS1, how long I played this (and how many times I finished it). I loved the game... And then, when I entered world of Steam, this was 1st game I got here and played. Oh, the nostalgia! Yes, graphic is horrible, considering modern standarts, but hey, this gem is old! PC controlls are a not OK, I strongly recommend controller, mostly because you will fight with camera, which is fully controllable and that means more work for you. Even though it's not something major. Story, atmosphere, shifting between worlds and intense combat makes this game real good. Story - to fully understand it, I'd recommend to play Blood Omen (I & II). SR: LoK happens after. World itself is wrecked with cataclysm, humans are at the bring of extinction thanks to vampyric menace. Dark fantasy post apocalyptic action adventure, this describes the game. Story itself begins with lust for vengeance and that drives you trough game. But, as you uncover the story, you'll get the feeling that you are only a pawn. But who pulls the strings? Bossfights are clever, brute force will not help you. And you know what? You can't die...What needs to be admired, is leveldesign. Gothic architecture with landscape, filled with fog and ruins of once blooming civilization. And when you shift into spectral realm (underworld, if you want), whole world twists and new path for progress emerges. What can be little anoying for some players, is that you need to travel to already explored locations, because you get new ability, which enables you to get to new locations. And it's really worth it, because you can get to health/magic powerups, spells aka glyphs and fire enchant for your symbiotic sword, Soul Reaver.Game itself is huge, but once you know locations, you can make speedrun without problems. To travelling between locations are used warp portals, and you will like them, because when you save, after restart or death you'll begin at the very first location. It's part of the story, so don't consider it a bug.Overall, the game itself is 85% from 100%. In time, when it was released, it was compared to Tomb Rider III and was considered almost equally good. And the best part is, that it's only a beginning of the story, which is almost like written from Shakespear. Followed by SR II and SR Defiance, great story unfolds before your eyes and you'll soon understand, why it's hidden gem.			"

												Everything in Soul Reaver just fits so perfectly into the game that it is hard to not recommend. Nothing in Soul Reaver feels like it's there just to be ""there"". The only thing that is noticeable is that it seems as if Soul Reaver was cut a little short with it's abrupt ending and it's pacing does seem to get a little off towards the end, with a large amount of confusing puzzles thrown at you in the last hours of the game. Otherwise, it is a very remarkable game that is highly recommended to people who still don't mind playing old games.			"

												Legacy of Kain is one of my favorite series of games.  Soul Reaver, being the first one I played, drew me into the world of Nosgoth. At the time though, I had no idea what I'd gotten into, given that I was just a kid whose strategy to games was mash all the buttons until I won. Years later, after I had already played the other ones and finished them, I find this on steam (After an attempt to buy the game from amazon to find that it was damaged beyond repair. Never again.). -Gameplay   Pretty good for its time.   Takes time to get used to with keyboard and mouse. Constantly had problems with camera angles. Would have been better with controller support.   The game is full of puzzles, so it's more than just fighting endlessly (not that I have a problem with that).-Graphics   Nice gothic design.   There were a few glitchy moments when the textures would bug out.-Sound   Sound...It takes a little bit of messing around with patches to get the audio right. At first, the sound would just keep looping forever, getting worse whenever I paused the game.   Aside from that, the soundtrack was great.   The dialogue was also great, given that most of the games of its time had little dialogue. I will never forget Tony Jay as the Elder God.Overall 8/10. Would have preferred it on console, but I can settle for this.Still waiting for more LOK games			"

												I remember wanting this game as a kid, so I jumped at the chance to get it. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a great game. The agency, while it takes some time to become competent with due to poor but doable controls, feels really good. As you play you become better at playing, almost as if mirroring Razael's revival and strengthening. The game has a steady drip of interesting lore and a plot that leaves you wondering what the next part is. The puzzles often have you stumped until you remember that you can change the world by changing planes, which adds a layer of depth to them. The combat feels pretty decent but simple and can take a bit to become good as different enemies actually have slightly different approaches. The boss fights though are almost all amazing in that they are not blunt fighting but more puzzles. When you die you simply shift to the spectral plane, giving you a chance to come up with a new plan. The platforming, much like the typical combat, is simple. Unlike the combat though, gets more depth as you unlock more abilities.Obviously the game has its flaws: dated graphics, occasional crashes with no catalyst, poor controls, and the such. But those really do come with older games and are outweighed by the better aspects of this game. This game isn't long, but it certainly isn't short. If this game has caught your eye at all, I'd definitely recommend it.			"

												It's a platforming classic. Can't go wrong with this game if you can handle it bit a little more than dated. Great puzzles, pretty good level design, amazing writing, fantastic atmosphere, and some of the best voice acting to ever show up in gaming. The ending is totally unsatisfying, but if you have the second game it should be all good.			"

												I Love the legacy of kain series and I have tried a multitude of methods to try and get this to work but sadly I have the same result as everyone else.Right now, as of this moment, I don't recommend the game. But I would love to see the day that it gets fixed.Also I got this during the steam winter sale and the entire series was going for about 1 dollar each. So if you want to try and see if your pc will work with this, then try and get it during a sale.			"

												I played the ps1 version of this game since I was 11 so let take off nostalgia glasses and try to rate this if I was going into the first time. the game has an almost shakespear writeing style to it, yet it contains brevity in each line of dioluge nothing is filler. but it still leaves some questions as to a certain characters, so it can leave you wanting more or just saying meh I didn't really get it. the games mechanics are really simple metroidvainia in how they implent them but done really lazy in how they just dump the most possible power ups near the end when the finish line is in reach.all in all5$ < = yes5$ > = wait for a dealas for the fans, the port isn't really that bad. the game only crashed on me once and they took the sound from dreamcast so that final speech at the end is extended. really a B- job no fan patch necssary.
