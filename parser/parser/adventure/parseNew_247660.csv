												I wish there was a one thumb up, one thumb down rating; or a shoulder shrug or something for somewhere in-between a ""Yes"" or ""No"" Recommendation for these Steam-game Ratings.RECOMMENDED - for the actual game experience: fantastic.NOT RECOMMENDED - for the awful PC technical port: horrible.Before I actually even get into what an outstanding actual gem of a game itself, let's start right up front with this:*****WARNING!************ *****BUYER BEWARE!*****While Deadly Premonition is a unique + outstanding game, it is such a crime that this game is riddled with technical disaster after technical disaster here on the PC. In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern. Also, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.While I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's sart-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere. ****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***Now, onto the actual game itself...What do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, odded, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has ""cult classic"" written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.The story + plot goes like this: Francis ""York"" Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.And boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead ""York"" talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named ""Zach""; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occassions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here. The story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to ""catch the serial killer theme,"" it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaynig the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.The controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own ""Nightmare"" version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).Players, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.The game certianly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.Deadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the absymal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.Game Experience = APC Port = F.FINAL Overall Grade = C.			"

												I had originally played Deadly Premonition on the 360 during May of 2010. I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.The next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.The rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.Heavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.Deadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed.  And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.But it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.Deadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.Deadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience. And it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits). The PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.But it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.Deadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.

												Deadly Premonition is like the old cadillac you found in your grandpa's barn after he passed away. Getting it to work will give you all sorts of headaches, and more often than not, you just want to lock the barn and forget all about the damn thing. But if you actually manage to put up with all the crap it throws at you and manage to make it work, you're rewarded with a ride that's both, unique and unforgettable. Easily one of the best and worst games I've ever played.			"

												This is the type of game that will only excite people who get into the characters and story. In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.It's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.The combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear ""noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!"" about over 9000 times.Though Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.I love whistling this theme!

												✔ One of my all time favorite games✔ Delightfully bizarre, quirky and David Lynch vibes✔ Highly memorable, lingering in your mind even months and years after finishing it✔ Dialogues, story and characters are colorful, philosophical and funny✔ Lengthy and lots of sidequests that you can go back to at any time✔ A lot of various in-game unlockables, 60 Achievements✔ Superb soundtrack▼ Dated visuals and animation (Looks are definitely not everything as proven here)▼ PC port issues (I've been spared fairly well though)▼ Twisted Metal 2 driving mechanics/physics (Yes, really)▼ Very deserving of one or two more patches (See mods/fixes below though) * DPFix 0.9.5 is a must in my opinion: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix* Or this 11mb pack which includes the above DPFix and other improvements: Such as InfiniteNine's HD font/HUD/icon pack and Shlomo's improved textures for the in-game menu. https://www.dropbox.com/s/qgs8rwzn0vjrsco/DP_Fixes.zip?dl=1 * And I prefer this color correction: https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/1115/ 'nuff said.

												One of the oddest videogames I've ever played. Despite having virtually no production-value and the lack of polished gameplay, it manages to stand on the strength of its gripping murder-mystery story, its weird and wonderful freakshow of characters and how aware of its own campiness it is. It's an experience like no other that I can recommend solely for that reason.Only true downside is the PC port. It’s awful. Downloading fan-made fixes and messing with .exe properties isn't much fun. A patch that Rising Star Games promises is on the way may fix this, but for now, just take note.Overall, even with the shoddy PC job, its one of the most memorable games in recent memory. Highly recommended if you're into games that are a little out-there.			"

Deadly Premonition - Poor PC Porting PerfectionThis game.  This.  RUDDY.  GAME.  Should you play it?  Yes, absolutely.Can you play it?  Possibly not.  Let me explain, (briefly, I promise) this was originally a console game, following the adventures of FBI Investigator and friendly neighbourhood schizophrenic Francis York Morgan who is a walking mix of cliche and man as he attempts to solve a savage murder in a small town in America.  It has some driving and fighting elements but is mostly investigating and talking until you get to do these bits.  It has great atmosphere, is immensely cheesy and there was apparently a court case against it from Twin Peaks for plagiarism.  It feels like Twin Peaks' and Swery65 had an illicit trist and Deadly Premonition was the inbred offspring - perfectly normal until closer inspection.  As soon as the console game, which was a lot of fun if you like a disturbed American comedy murder, was brought to PC, things went wrong.And oh so wrong.  The graphic quality was hampered to allow it to play on lower settings but the settings were not made accessible to the player so we can't ramp them back up.  The glitches  like walking and falling through walls and floors and tipping over vehicles are just the tip of the iceberg.  Crashes are horribly frequent with some players reporting a crash every hour of play, like clockwork, others getting crashes at certain points like when the camera is on a female characters legs and then again randomly in car parks.  And other points when it simply switches off for no apparent reason but doesn't allow itself to be switched back on without a full restart.  Two full patches later and these problems are still occuring - there are also external patches that can fix the graphics issue.  It's pretty much unplayable but the game itself is FANTASTIC.  It's fun and strange and shocking in places and I recommend the game itself.But can I recommend getting it on STEAM?  Probably not.  I've been playing for about 33 hours now and I still haven't completed the second episode, purely because crashes and bugs have made me restart 5 times.  If you can get it on a console, do so, though it's expensive.Alternatively, here's some quick tips to help make it a little easier:Run the game in Admin mode (right click the game icon and click ""Run as administrator"")Run in compatibility mode in Windows 98 if you have Windows 7 (WindowsXP Sv1 if you have Windows 8) that should fix the problem with aiming up and downSearch for DPfix.ini in Google - it's a graphical fix patch, follow the creators instructions (not necessary and only useful if you have a really good PC)Use a controller - it will make your life easier, especially forthe driving sections, which are hilariously bad "

												If I ever wrote a book with a video game topic the title would be ""1 Video Game You Must Play Before You Die"" and Deadly Premonition would be the subject. In it you would find countless of analysis of the many citizens of Greenvale, a complete study of the main characters quirks and flaws, how to make your own Sinner's Sandwich and why you always should keep your suit pressed and clean.Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn't content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition. There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it's utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.Deadly Premonition is all that. It's impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game. Most people will only shake their heads and it's like trying to describe a miracle to people who never witnessed one.			"

												Great game, TERRIBLE port.Started out at about 5 FPS (unplayable/slideshow) on a computer that can handle Skyrim and the Arkham games just fine. With all the tricks and fixes you can find on the internet I eventually got it up to around 15 FPS, at which point the game was just barely playable. (First time I ever needed to use target lock with a mouse, though.)Then the first boss showed up. The QTEs were impossible at that low framerate.Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews: almost all of them are from people who played this game on the XBox, where it actually ran properly. The PC version is a broken mess, and it's almost certainly never going to be fixed. I got it for $6 as part of a Humble Bundle deal, and I feel ripped off.			"

												Basically Twin Peaks but made into a gamePros-So many side missions-Soundtrack (actually pretty good)-Subtitles (Big and Easy to read)-Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 (Probably the Graphics, Specific save points, over the shoulder gameplay and the BIG Subtitles)-York is so quirky-Characters are all so unique in some way (E.g. Gay Assistant, Thomas)-Humor-Quite lengthyCons-Its a port-Minor Hiccups-Driving sectionsOverall, some might say that this game is bad because of its outdated PS2 graphics and other it being a port and all but honestly, those people don't see the the good points, what good points you may ask? The over-the-top humor, a range of memorable characters & Nostalgic gameplay (RE4). I would say this game is worth a buy but you'll probably only during a sale since the game is kinda old and at $25 you can get other better games and besides its like $2.49 during a sale.Score: Get during SaleFinal Verdict: 8/10			"

												Well, if you are one those people who can enjoy this masterpiece probably you already own this game, I was waiting for this for a long time I have no consoles so I couldn't play it before, I pretty excited when they announced it for steam, I preordered it without much thought, and when game was released it was pretty much unplayable for me, I can say it was worst port I have ever played, well I don't really care about resolution but when console port has no controller support that's just terrible, not to mention it crashed every 5 minutes or so, so I decided to wait, not long after Durante of NeoGAF famous for his dark souls fix has released resolution fix for this game  and after that some dedicated users made custom icons for controller and somewhat support of for pads via third party softs. Then there was word that devs were planning to release patch to fix all this mess, and they really did after some time. So it's been a month already after the games release till I could play this game but it was really worth the wait, I was already hyped for this game for a long time but it turned out to exceed my expectations like 10 times, and after this patches game was fully playable with no crashes, controller support and thanks to durante with desirable custom resolutions. I played many games this generation but there were only two games that brought me that sense of excitement and joy of gaming that I had only as a child, first game was Dark Souls, and I thought I wouldn't enjoy anything else like that until second DS game was released, well now as I write this I have completed this game 100% and can safely say that it's definitely is in my top 10 games of all time if not in top 5, it just makes me sad that this masterpiece in not  very successful saleswise compared to mainstream 5-7 hour meaningless soulless shooters, but I do hope that as gaming attracts more and more mature audience and is slowly becoming as mainstream as movies, there will be time that developres can take the risks and make games such this one without any fear of failing.

												This is a really tough game to review.Imagine a really bad restaurant. It has terrible service, terrible decor, smells bad, looks bad and is just generally unpleasant. It shows no promise at all. And yet.......They serve about the best main course money can buy.Deadly Premonition's main dish is it's completely captivating story, which is brought to life by some excellent voice acting. The main characters are a really well written bunch and I found them quirky, utterly charming, charismatic and lovable. I wanted to know everything about them.If you have seen Twin Peaks, you will not fail to notice this game has derived A LOT of inspiration from that show. Luckily it does so in a really cool and often suprising way and so it never feels like a bland ripoff. Beyond the Twin Peaks influence, it's pretty obvious the game designer, Swery, likes David Lynch's wider canon of work too, to the point that the game could be mistaken as a collaboration. Being a Lynch fan, that's not a bad thing in my book; I think other Lynch fans will love this too. So what's not so good? I'm afraid there are quite a lot of niggles that takes the shine off the Deadly Premonition experience.Here we go: - My experience was massively hurt by technical problems. The game crashed constantly unless put into ME/98 compatibility+admin mode. Alas, this had the side of effect of gradually bringing frame rates down from 60fps to 10fps within 15 minutes of continued play. Repeated reboots were required to maintain a playable frame rate. - in compatibility mode, a slew of minor bugs arose, such as gun-aiming glitches, which made the game annoying.- A unofficial hack (called DPfix) to unlock the 60fps is required.- Pretty poor graphics with a washed out palette, rough textures, and some very ropey 3D models at times.- Driving is really tedious. It takes too long to get anywhere.- The core 3rd person survival horror game is not very enjoyable. - The RPG mechanics (health, hunger, tiredness, inventory management) are completely superflous- Time lapse mechanic is frustrating. You have to wait around for certain events to happen. Time can be sped up, but the mechanic means that you can end up passing TOO much time and missing your appointment. - The game is littered with tedious mandatory mini-games, such as waggling the thumbstick to run away from danger, or hiding from an enemy to escape danger. - boss battles are a chore- not scary in the slightest. (even the bits I think were meant to be scary)- Dull fetch side quests.- The game is not challenging in the slightest.- Production values  are not great. Very rough around the edges. Wonky transitions between scenes and parts of the musical score. - Story got so ridiculous it was immersion-breaking. (A mad story isn't necessarily a problem, but there needs to be some sort of underlying internal logic to make the suprises and twists truly matter) - no steamcloudIn short, the core game is just not very good. I played this to enjoy the story  and get to know the town and townsfolk of Greensvale, not for the sake of the game. That's enough criticism. I don't want to put anyone off from giving this a go, because DAMN, the story and characters and atmosphere are SO SO good....Good enough that I can forgive that massive list of faults.But would I recommend it to you?Now, that is a tough question. I have to give a somewhat nuanced answer here. I'd have to ask:- How tolerant are you of bad ports? This is one of the worst I have experienced.- Do you like brilliant stories so much you can put up with a subpar game which is very rough around the edges? - Do you appreciate great voice acting, atmosphere, superb characters, and perhaps David Lynch's work too? If you are pretty tolerant, likes stories, love Lynch and can put up with a game that is a quite poorly designed, go for it. You won't regret it. If you veer the other way....stay WELL clear. I few things to add: the game is supported by a deliciously quirky soundtrack, and features one of the most charismatic protaganists I have yet encountered in a video game: Francis York Morgan (who is up their with Garrus from Mass Effect for me) I LOVE this game, despite its numerous faults, and I can't think of a game so in need of a modern remaster that polishes the rough edges, gives it a nice, glossy coat of paint, and improves the core game so it can be experienced by a wider audience. It's not a whole hearted recommedation, but if you can stomach it's faults you are in for an unforgettable experience.			"

												A superb game for people who enjoy Twin Peaks, murder mysteries and unique game design, not to mention charm, ambition, complexity and creativity that most modern games simply lack. The PC port has some issues, but generally runs well for me and the issues it does have can be fixed with a few forum/google searches.It's a unique game, one that any player who enjoys great games should experience.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: RPG; Adventure; Story Rich; Sandbox; Open World; Horror My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 25-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWAs you most likely see in the other reviews for this game:  Deadly Premonition itself is quite enjoyable, but bugs and crashes can quickly sour the taste of the experience.  I, however, mostly enjoyed the game so I wanted to give it a ""Thumbs Up.""  If you approach the game the right way then you can really minimalize the impact of the crashes.The game is a moderately open-word survival horror game.  The controls are a little clunky, especially the driving, but I suppose it fits the genre.  The music is whimsical and the dialogue is funny, if not at times very corny... but again the corny lines fit with the genre and the ""bad horror movie from the 80s"" type vibe the game gives off.  The story is enjoyable and intriguing.  A fun little aspect is that the game does it best to make the small town of Greenvale feel lived in.  That is to say:  each NPC moves around the town depending on the time of day, and the weather—so you may have to search for them accordingly.  The graphics are not very good, but they aren't that bad.  There is a user-created mod that can improve the visuals.  As mentioned, the bad side of the game really boils down to bugs and crashing.  Now as for bugs, I didn't really experience any ""bugs"" when I played, I did experience crashing, however.  But really, it wasn't that bad.  Here is some advice:  check out the “stickied” thread about troubleshooting.  Make sure to repair PhysX.  I personally did not install DPfix (which is a user-created, unofficial mod) because it only fixes visuals (which don’t bother me) and it may actually cause more problems than it fixes.  Lastly, be sure to save often.  Like: even if you just saved 5 minutes ago, if you reach another save point, save again.  This way if and when you get a crash, you don't have to replay a ton of gameplay.  This will help make the crashes a minor annoyance rather than a game-destroying problem.There are also 50 side-quests in the game which actually offer rewards that are valuable in the main campaign—so you may find yourself wanting to do them even if you don’t care about achievements or “completionism.”  Many guides and such will recommend you do the side-quests during chapter-replays... I however, recommend you try to do as many as you can during initial playthroughs of a chapter.  This is because during a chapter-replay you can't save until you finish the replay, which may cause you to lose some progress if you encounter one of the aforementioned crashes.  If you try to do as many side-quests as you can during initial playthroughs, you will be free to save often preventing progress loss.  Some side-quests will require replays to do, simply because of the mechanics… for those I recommend chapter 7, because you can quickly end the chapter-replay, save, and then start it up again to do more side-questing.  Then just rinse and repeat until you’ve done everything… that’s how I did the side-quests and the occasional crashes were endurable.In summary, the game is good, and worth the experience... in my opinion.  This is especially so if you enjoy the genre, or enjoy heavily story-driven games.  It will require some troubleshooting and some tolerance for bugs/crashing.  If you decide to follow my advice, and do a little planning and save often, the crashes that you will encounter won't set you back that badly, and you will probably enjoy the overall experience of the game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Every generation of video games has a set of titles that completely flies under most gamers’ radar. Games such as Killer 7 and Snatcher are among those that fall into the elusive, Cult Classic category. See, a Cult Classic game is one that hasn’t really been met with commercial success but has garnered a dedicated fanbase despite that fact. Now, as a lowly gamer I can’t do much about these games and I wish more people actually played them, but I’ll be damned if I don’t do my part to at least spread awareness about games that I think deserve much more attention than they are currently getting. One of these games is Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut. Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut is an HD remake of the same game released in 2010 on Xbox 360 and PS3(Japan Only). The new game sports updated visuals, move support and some new DLC, scenarios and an extended ending. It would be hard to categorize this game into one specific genre; if I had to try I would say that Deadly Premonition is an open world third–person murder-mystery survival horror adventure game.To play Deadly Premonition, you need to approach it with an open mind. This is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. No, instead this game has some of the worst visuals and controls you’ll ever encounter, not to mention the new HD remake has some framerate issues as well. But do not let this deter you from the game as absolutely none of that matters when you’re playing it. Deadly Premonition follows Agent Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman in the quaint little town called Greenvale. York (As he likes to be called) takes the case due to the mysterious and intriguing M.O of the killer – red seeds are always found near the body of the victims. York has to work together with the denizens of Greenvale to help bring in the bad guy and restore order to the once peaceful town. Sounds like your average detective plot right? Well, it couldn’t be further from that. Without getting into too many spoilers, the plot takes numerous twists and turns that send you on a journey of self-discovery and has you second guessing what the truth is.The real hook of Deadly Premonition comes from the charm its characters and environments exude. Everything and everyone is bursting with personality. Agent York for example has a special friend named Zach; what makes Zach so special is that no one else can see him or knows about him besides York, even if he talks to Zach in front of another character. York constantly talks to him in his head throughout the game, and you’re always wondering if Zach is real or just some imaginary friend. York also seems to be very knowledgeable about movies. When driving around in your car York will often talk about various movies with Zach such as the classics Tremors and Goonies. Another example would be the Deputy Sheriff, Emily Wyatt, who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Naomi Watts, for no apparent reason. The town of Greenvale feels very homey and you often feel like you’re in an episode of Everwood. I think Access Games really nailed the look and feel of Greenvale.As mentioned before, Deadly Premonition is an open world game of sorts. The game has a timer for each day and main objectives have to be completed within a certain time frame. The main objectives push the story forward and this is usually where the survival horror aspect comes into play. These sections have you exploring linear levels gunning down hordes of creepy enemies in classic Resident Evil 4 over the shoulder style. While these sections do little to scare you, they are entertaining enough to keep things moving forward. York can use a multitude of weapons ranging from his handgun to breakable melee weapons such as a pipe or spade.You can partake in numerous activities and interact with various NPCs in the game. You could, for example, spy on one of the officers while they’re having supper in their apartment. I kid you not, you can literally look into their window and stalk them and watch them do completely mundane things like eat or sit on a couch. But that is where the real beauty of Deadly Premonition comes in. It is then up to you to explore and find these gaming gems, and trust me some of them will have you in stitches from laughing so much. There are also numerous side missions that are given to you by certain NPCs; they are not easy to find as some NPCs are only active during certain times of the day – you have to be sure to talk to them at that time or you might miss out. The fact that those NPCs go about their daily lives independent of you, the player, really makes the game feel alive.The game has some catchy tunes and the voice acting is particularly good at capturing each character’s unique personality. The same can’t be said about the sound effects, though. The graphics are really bad. This game looks like it was made in the PS 2 era, even with the updated graphics, but the bad graphics give the game a certain extra charm. If you are open-minded enough I promise you will have a one-of-a-kind experience that you will not soon forget. The PC release though, has its fair share of problems, including poor performance, and a resolution locked at 720p. It’s a bit of a bad console port, to be honest – though one wonders if this adds to the charm. Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, it’s good. Overall 7/10.			"

												A game that understands the player, and uses its entire design to promote both its understanding of player experience and atmosphere. Contests with The Stanley Parable in making player choice contextualized in a way that matters and acknowledges the player's motivation without compromising it, unlike many Triple-A titles that garner more praise. A truly amazing game, and one worth playing at any cost. If more games were like Deadly Premonition, the world would be a better place.Unlike almost any game before it (with the exceptions of The Stanley Parable and Demon's Souls), Deadly Premonition understands the unique and powerful triad of Player, Character, and Narrator. At no point in the game is any of these functions invalidated.Many users comment on how ""weird"" the game is, or how the graphics are outdated or the controls clunky, and this is important. The game's major aesthetic is that exact cognitive function: It means to play like a PS2 game, look like a PS2 game, and even ape PS2 games. Secretly, though It does all of these things the best way possible: By actually constructing and improving upon the foundation it attempts to make fun of. Deadly Premonition is the unique and rare game that actually constructs on, as opposed to strictly deconstructs, what came before. You may hate the controls, and you may think the graphics are outdated, but if any of these things were changed its own aesthetic would clash with itself. These choices were deliberate, intelligent mirrors for the game's internal design and direction.Deadly Premonition is surprisingly one of the most intelligent games I've ever played. No matter how strange, unexpected, or uncomfortable it might be it is a game that understands what games can do. It fully utilizes the medium, and for that, it deserves a perfect score.10/10			"

												I love this game.Completed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the ps3 version and although it had is drawbacks it was narrativley stunning.The PC port is poorly done.> Locked 720p resolution and unstable framerate, can't even surpass 30fps most of the time.There is a fix you can get by a very talented individual by the name Durante, which unlocks various options for the game such as resolution, anisotropic filtering, SSAO etc and it makes a huuuge difference.this is an essential fix if you decide to buy :    http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=373Many people have reported this fix working perfectly and others claim it does improve gfx and lets you set custom resolution but the framerate is still unstable.My experience was the latter, i have major unstable framerate for the game and my rig can more than handle this game.I can't recommend the pc version of this game since it requires you to work on it to get it running smoothly, you really shouldn't have to do it after paying money for the game. Though it pains me to give it the thumbs down i would recommend you play it on the ps3 for a better experience because it really is a great game.			"

												I'd love to reccomend this game but honestly, It's not very stable, thankfully thanks to mods and unofficial patches it's a little more playable, but honestly, this is a very bad port right out of the gate of a game that was already pretty buggy and had a terrible framerate on the consoles, I guess i'm glad I bought it because I liked it on the consoles and it's a very weird but great game, but I can't reccomend it for people looking for a stable experience out of the gate.

												I wish I could give this a positive review, because the game itself it great. But the PC version is nearly unplayable. If you want to play Deadly Premonition (which you should, it's a great game) I'd recommend playing the xbox 360 version if it's available to you. I've tinkered with this game for hours and it still won't work, and it seems the developers have no intention of fixing this version of the game as it's been unplayable for years. I actually bought this when it first came out and gave up in frustration, and now, years later, it's still broken. I have to give this a thumbs down. Sorry.			"

												This game is so buggy that even with DPfix you will run into trouble. Long load times, autosave doesn't work, crash when you enter a building (since autosave doesn't work if you did any side missions tough luck you have to do them again). The game crashed when I was gonna enter a critical mission building and I did some side missions before. The developers even acknoledged DPfix and said to install it rather than actually putting a patch themselves. And now they are on the front cause of Recently updated but they didn't update the game it's just on sale. Don't let these companies get away with lazy ports.			"

												When people decide to make a game on a really low budget, but are aware of it and stick with it in their entire game design, then you could either say, it's a bad game with a really low budget, or a masterpiece in its own right. Personally, I say the latter.This is probably the worst low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, but it is the only low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, which makes it the very best game of it's entire category of all time.And I mean that absolutely seriously. This is the worst game I had the greatest fun with in a long while. I had more fun with Deadly Premonition than with many triple A titles. It is awkward, it is really painfully badly executed, but even after I saw the ever appearing ""flicking the lighter to light a cigarette"" animation during a cutscene for the 200th time, I still thought it was hilarious.Deadly premonition is the prime example that a bad game doesn't necessitate a game to be less fun. That and the fact that the story is a ginormous clusterf***.You'll either love it, or you'll hate it. I loved every single second.			"

												The actual game itself gets a wholehearted recommendation. Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a ""so bad it's good"" game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the ""shooting bits"" were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.If you can.The lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.So in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the ""wall-crawler"" enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means. Some people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not. Maybe in a year (or more), the game will be patched up and as nice as the Dark Souls port. Until then, I consider this game an Xbox 360 exclusive (the Playstation 3 Director's Cut port is even worse than the PC version, don't touch it please!).Buy this port if you like a gamble, Zach.			"

												On a technical standpoint this game is one of the worst ports of all time. You will need a lot of patience to get the game running and to actually play it. Through the steam discussion thread that the dev posted I managed to get the game as stable as it could ever be. It would still occasionally crash after long sessions but it could be solved by saving often and restarting the game every now and then. If you cant be bothered fixing the game, buy it on the console or watch a playthrough on youtube. Skipping this game entirely would be a real shame since it has a cast of interesting and weird characters with some cheesy B-movie moments. One of the best scenes is the opening scene that shows agent Morgan smoking, on the phone talking about tom and jerry's S&M relationship, reviewing the evidence on his laptop and even holding a bag of evidence in front of his face all while driving through a curvy forest road on a rainy night. The absurdity of that moment was one of the things that hooked me.Without going too much into the story, you play a FBI agent investigating a murder case in a small town. This is the best part of the game since you get to interrogate the weird and interesting townsfolk and the identity of the killer is something that will keep you guessing throughout the game.The gameplay is nothing special, car controls are bad and so is the map but by the middle of the game I found myself knowing the full town layout. Shooting has been improved for the director's cut giving the gun infinite ammo and having a button that centers on the enemy. Yeah it removes some of the horror survival aspect of the game but makes the game way easier and less frustrating since shooting was a weaker part of the game. You will need to manage a hunger meter and keep your clothes clean, its pretty trivial and would only become a pain when you try to skip to to do side quests.In conclusion and a TL:DR for some people: This game is a gem, very raw and unpolished and I hope you wont skip it just because of the bad reviews.

												Ohh my fahcking GAWD, I did it, I actually did it, I FINISHED THE GAME. Somehow someway after NUMEROUS crashes, freezes, and playing 99.99% of the game with what I didn't know was bugged out aiming, I fahcking did it! I think this game is mesmerizing but first a few questions to determine if Deadly Premonition is right for you!Do you enjoy quirky games?Do you like the TV show ""Twin Peaks""?Do you enjoy games that are rough around the edges?I'd say, if you answered yes to 2 of those questions you should definitely find a way to play this game. It has a great storyline, funny albeit intriguing dialouge, decent gameplay and an absolutely fantastic OST. However be warned this game can be a FAHCKING nuisance due to the terrible programing/coding that was implemented especially for the PC version. Keep in mind that this game has a BOATLOAD of problems but it is also a better experience than most ""AAA"" or ""Indie"" games out there!****TIPS FOR RUNNING DEADLY PREMONITION****I am using Windows 8 btw.If the game crashes at start up---->look for redist folder and find the PhysX_Syssoftware installer and run Repair on itIf the game constantly crashes WHILE playing----> Try rebooting your system after exiting or disabling Steam overlay for the game or Run in Windows 98 Compatibility modeIf the aiming is extremely limited (ie. Only can aim within a small rectangle on the screen like i did for 99.99% of the game, lol)---> Run in windows 98 compatibility modeALSO sometimes deleting the game and reinstalling helps but it is not as reliable as just running in Windows 98 mode. Hope these tips help and happy gaming !			"

For a normal person, a causal player:This game is awful. PC port is so bad that it barely runs. Sometimes frame rate drops to♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you restart your computer. The control is very awkward. Graphics are bad. Story is interesting, but not worth dealing with all the problems.2/10 IT SUCKS *IGNFor a video game artist, an overthinker:The coffee said, ""Tomorrow you will arrive in a place that will change your fate.""I would say, ""Today you will play a game that will change your view on video games.""This is ""the most controversial survival horror game"", and is seen as a primary example of games as art. *wikipedia[en.wikipedia.org]It is a genius game with low budget. It is a great game that didn't sell well. It makes you think what is wrong with today's video game industry. Today's video games are all designed to make money. High budget, high profit. People only buy games that give players exactly what they wanted. That is a sad fact of this industry: good games don't sell.That is the nature of art. This game is only appreciated by the minorities who are capable of understanding video game art. There are not many games like this, because they don't sell.Yes the combat sucks, but the early version of the game had no combat; it was added later at the request of a publisher who told them it would not sell in the Western market if there weren't guns. *polygon[www.polygon.com]It's an experience you won't forget.Thank you Swery.10/10 MASTERPIECE *destructoid "

												I recommend Deadly Premonition to everyone who likes kind of weird characters, good storytelling (that takes it's time) with multiple perspectives from different points on the timeline. You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.Since the beginning I like the habit of the main character ""York"" to talk to ""Zack"". It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.Some insights of my journey with the game:I was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix.  I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad.In chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements.After you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :)I used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.I like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun!I am happy that the reviews I read convinced me to play this (indie?) gem.			"

My Personal Score: 0.5/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: One of the worst ports of all time. Visit the PCGW page before you click that purchase button.Deadly Premonition is one of the worst games ever, but it's also one of the best. Try typing ""most polarizing video game of all time"" on Google and look at the top results and related searches. Yep.If you ever get this PoS to work within the 2-hour refund period, you'll be greeted by toga-wearing twins spouting gibberish, crime-related references to The Tom and Jerry show, and squirrels purposefully given the sound bytes of a startled chimpanzee. After a fatal car crash and one unhurt protagonist crawling out of a burning car, full of swagger on his back, you get to play the top contender for worst Dreamcast game ever. Outdated control scheme, horrendous graphics, and gameplay mechanics that borrowed from the worst inspirations ever; it's like this game was stuck in development for over a decade. Oh wait, it was.[www.polygon.com]But even with all the trash found in the game, I still admired it. After playing it through to the end, I respected it. I'll even admit that I became teary-eyed once the game showed its final scenes. It was the story, with all its surreal moments and weird but charming cast that kept me playing and invested in the game. Deadly Premonition is a homage to Twin Peaks, a show that inspired video games like Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Silent Hill. A show that ended too soon, yet the concept found new life in video games. It's how game writer and director Hidetaka Suehiro molded the Lynchian framework into something more akin to his style, while still respecting the inspiration, that made the game shine. This is art, plain and simple. And no word has ever been more fitting for the most polarizing video game of all time.And there you have it.			"

How I Made Deadly Premonition Work With Windows 10EDIT 7/18/16:I have completed a guide which is a streamlined version of this review and includes the final technical tweaks that I used to make it all the way through the game. Best of luck!


How To Easily Minimize Crashes in Deadly Premonition 
A Guide for Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut
By: ƝƖƓӇƬƁƦЄЄƊ

			The purpose of this guide is to inform you of how to avoid crashes and easily work around any that you encounter.		


EDIT 7/9/16:I noticed that running the game in any type of Compatibilty Mode would cause the frame-rate to steadily drop until the point of being unplayable. To get past the latest crashes, I re-launched in Windowed mode, with no Compatibilty Mode and was able to get past each crash the next launch, while windowed.♥♥♥♥ that though. I did the following steps, and the game ran at a steady 60 fps and didn't crash within a 5+ hour session, which wasn't possible before:1. Took DP.exe out of any kind of Compatibility Mode. Ran it normally (Windows 10 being the OS I run).2. Set DPLauncher.exe to ""Run as Administrator"".3. Ran DPLauncher.exe, and using Task Manager, set the Affinity of the process to use only Cores 0-3. With a quad-core, hyperthreading processor, this will mimic a dual-core, which is the game's recommended requirement.4. While in Task Manager, I also set the DPLauncher.exe process to ""High"" priority.5. I started the game via the Launcher and verified that the settings I applied to DPLauncher.exe were passed along to DP.exe (they were).6. I proceeded to play crash-free at 60 fps for over 5 hours straight, which as I said, was a night and day difference to my experience prior to these changes.Now, the bad news is that if you opt for this route, you have to do steps 3 and 4 each time you launch the game. The good news is it's very quick and easy. I should add too that the first 3 steps below (from my original review), specifically unintalling the LAV filters, were still needed for me to initially get past the intro video. The above steps ^^ wouldn't have gotten me past the crash at the very beginning.If you're installing fresh, here are my final recommendations: Uninstall LAV Filters and VLC Player (if applicable). Make Windows Media Player default. Install the game normally then apply DPfix and SweetFX, if for nothing else than graphical enhancements. Nevermind about Compatibility Mode and simply perform the 6 steps I just mentioned. Then, while in game save often, purely based on principal. I really believe though, with the processor tweaks applied, that the game will run much more stably...dare I say, rock-solid?			"

I have a decent computer so i don't see that my pc is causing the horrible frame rate issues ( i have a i5 4670 and a r9 290). Can't even get past firs part of the game since the QTE are related to your frame rate, so even if i try to be as fast as i can i get killed.Alot of dissapointment, really wanted to play this game.

												I would love to recommend this game, really I would. It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.The truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass (""smoking"" in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.If you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the ""savedata"" folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.Barring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.However, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.The minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.The more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.The game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.Sidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.To wrap this review up and summarize the main points:[CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.[CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.[CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities[PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.[PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too[PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game[PRO] Decent sidequests and minigamesAll in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.			"

												Got it when it was dirt cheap, and I do nót regret it.The whole story kind of has a twin peaks crazy vibe. That's what makes it so wonderful.Somehow it's a bit of a mix of fighting off zombies and investigating.It's really a great game, if you can ignore the awfully terrible port and the bugs. Would've been worth the full price if it worked a lot better. Right now it's kind of bad, no proper resolutions, sound is all over the place, and had to use compatability mode to prevent the game from crashing at startup. So there's a risk you might not get the game to work properly.There are a few mods and fixes around on the net tho.			"

												While I enjoy the story of this game I cannot overlook the constant crashes and bugs that abound in this poorly ported title, especially given the $25 USD price tag. My game freezes about 5-10% of the time when checking side quests.Random freezing during loading screens.Performance issues on a beefy rig when running windowed.Unable to interact with required doors/objects during certian missions. Issues while driving that cause my tires to sink into the road bringing my car to a sudden stop. Also, this game is locked to 720p which can be fixed with the dpfix mod but installing that brought about an issue where the game freezes when I tab out. If my friend did not want to watch me stream this game I would have already deleted it within the first hour of gameplay. TL;DR : Great story, amusing characters in this Twin Peaks inspired game but bugs and crashes make the game nearly unplayable. Not worth the price. 3/10			"

												You know what I love about this game?Everything.I show this game off all the time and most people think I'm joking.I first played this back in 2012.This is genuinely my favorite game of all time.The story is like if you took Twin Peaks, translated it into Japanese, had a dude translate it back into English and then had another guy try to read back the lines in Japanese having only seen a couple of English sitcoms.Basically what I'm saying is it's amazing, it has so many twists and major plot points that left me stunned.One of the most satisfying boss fights of all time against a gay cross dressing man.Characters that were likeable and kooky in their own way and made me wish some of their fates turned out different.Some of the most memorable and funny lines in the world ""FK in the coffee"" and ""The answer is [onion]""The graphics while lackluster contribute to the off-kilter world of Greenvale.The only downside is this version crashes all the time and the PS3/Xbox version is slow as hell.This game is pretty swell.

												One of the best stories ever to grace a video game.  The game has a few technical issues, and the graphics leave alot to be desired but if you manage to get past these issues you'll find a tremendous story, in my opinion one of the best stories to ever grace a video game.I'll be honest and say the controls are bad, the graphics aren't really up to par with modern games and you'll more than likely encounter a few technical issues getting the game to run.Ignore those issues (except not getting it to run, try to find the fix for that) and you'll fall in love with the story.  Just keep in mind the game starts off slow, and you'll very likely want to quit if you get caught up in doing side quest in chapter 2.  Just push forward, trust me, it's worth it.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Rising Star Games Publishers: Rising Star Games Initial release: Oct 2013Genre: Action, Horror, Humor #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationNow, I do recommend this game. Just.. not this version. It's a terrible terrible awful port that put me through the whole rigamarole of legit 'fixes' all the way through to superstition (caused by low probabilities and the very human desire to control the situation) I've downloaded and implemented DPfix for resolutions and frame rate issues. As well as for controller support. Though I believe that was a real update. The real issue is with random and frequent crashing. I've done everything from running it in compatibility mode with Win98 to using a program called Large Address Aware, allowing for the use of more than 2GB's of RAM. Changing audio to only stereo. It still crashes. I've even broken into superstition pressing L-ALT whilst in windowed mode which I'm sure is accomplishing nothing if not negligible results. The characters are so dumb, the animations canned and inappropriate. Awkward pauses between nonsense dialogue and its fantastic.  Plus the main character has a voice in his head that breaks the fourth wall (even more so for me as my name is Zach.. spoopy)I really tried to finish this game, but this port is so unstable and I've replayed missions and rewatched cutscenes for the last time.Follow my curation for more "

												This is a tough thing for me to do, given that Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but I can't honestly recommend playing this version of the game. I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).Even if this version wasn't completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the ""Director's Cut"", the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.There are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.While general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.This is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own.The only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?It hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.The game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.To sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files. While it didn't happen to me, thankfully, I have read about instances where other players' save data was corrupted, forcing them to start over. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.			"

												The game is absolutely amazing! The plot is fantastic, while the gameplay is quite obvious and buggy, but the latter doesn't change the emotions you get following the investigation. I recommend the game for all who are interested in creepy detective stories. If you want to enjoy the game truly, please don't pay attention on bugs and some annoying things like following the suspect for about five real minutes - the game is not about that.I am thankful for all those who were involved into the Deadly Premonition's process.

												Man, I wish that I could simultaneously 'Thumbs up' and 'Thumbs down' this game. As it is I can't recommend this game but I can't recommend it enough either.The game is badly developed on the PC. It basically won't run without using Durante's dpfix[blog.metaclassofnil.com] and even then, with the latest version of that, it has issues like HDR style bloom occasionally flickering and blowing out the screen, an aimbox that doesn't let you aim outside of a tiny fraction of the screen, a screeching sound loop when you're in a car and crashes ever 25 minutes on the dot. Still, it's a really, really great story with really solid gameplay. On the one hand, if you have a 360 or PS3 then just pick it up used for one of those systems but, as of the time of this writing, it's on sale on Steam for $2.99 with the soundtrack and the OST alone is worth that money (listening to it right now). The game's not unplayably broken (with dpfix and compatibility mode for XP SP3/98 set) but it does have enough issues to make it a conditional recommendation even on sale.Gameplay wise it's an open-world game set in a small town that feels realish. There are two major ""centers"" to the town (downtown and a smaller business/residential area) and a bunch of places off in various parts of the countryside all connected with roads that feel planned rather than designed for sandboxing/gameplay. In many ways Greenvale feels more like a town than any other open-world location that I've played because of that. A day-night cycle is present, as you'd expect, but unlike most open-world games it's not just a perfunctory addition that has no gameplay impact. Rather, NPCs have a routine and are available at certain places at certain times and not at all at others. This impacts when you can start sidequests and when missions can be taken. On top of that NPCs actually drive around Greenvale to get to their various locations. The first time I saw this in action I was standing outside a particular main character's house waiting to be able to start a side mission and I saw her drive up, get out of her car, walk into the house via the garage door (and then the mission still wasn't available so I ""peeked"" inside the window and she was in there puttering around).The story is one of the best told murder mysteries that I've played through. It's got elements of cosmic horror as well as ""good"" old-fashioned depravity. As you progress through the missions you're going to be picking up clues that allow you to ""Profile"" what occurred (basically a cutscene that starts out unclear but clears up as you gather clues) that will eventually lead you to the killer and uncover what the craziness that goes on in the dark, dark hours of the night is all about. The shooty gameplay isn't particularly good but, thankfully, it's also not particularly necessary. A standard wrench (that you can get with infinite durability from an early sidequest) will do you well for most of the enemies through most of the game. Shooty wise it harkens back to the Resident Evil style aim and stand mechanics but you'll only hit an enemy if your sight actually crosses them and turns into a reticle. It's not great but it gets the job done and, aside from the three bosses in the late game, it's not really required. Just make sure you do the quests to get a .34 with unlimited ammo before you get to them.All in all the game is flawed, critically so on the PC, but it's still such a satisfying game with an excellent story and a soundtrack that is silly, cheerful, haunting, beautiful and sad all at the same time. Definitely give it a shot in some fashion. Whether that be on one of the last-gen consoles, a PC with dealing with the issues that crop up or even a no commentary ""Let's Play"" "

												Do I recommend Deadly Premonition? Absolutely.Do I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.Deadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.Basically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.But even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.Which brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.

												Never in my entire life would I ever imagine giving Deadly Premonition a negative review. This is a FANTASTIC game, but the PC version is butchered beyond belief. It REALLY is as bad as people say. Heed everybody's warning.I bought it cheap for about 2 dollars before really realizing what I was getting in to. Simply seeing ""this is a bad port,"" wasn't enough to deter me. I've seen these comments elsewhere for games I really enjoyed playing the PC port of and thought, ""It can't be THAT bad."" But when your game immediately crashes on start up, you know you're going to have a bad time. This port is so butchered that somebody (independant from the company) made a patch to try and fix most of the issues that the game has. With the patch installed, I was able to get past the start-up screen. But, it still crashed. After much trial and error, I got this♥♥♥♥♥♥load of ♥♥♥♥ to run in Windowed Mode in Windows 98 compatibiity (fullscreen makes the game crash even harder). Even then, the MAX amount of gameplay I would get at a time without it crashing was about 45 minutes. With that being said, I'm one of the lucky ones who actually got to play it with crashes that I could overcome. And I don't even know if I'd call that luck. The crashing isn't even consistant. Sometimes it's during a load screen, other times, it's when you're going to use an item out of the inventory. Sometimes, it's simply right in the middle of walking.. or when you're mid combat. The crashing also seems to intensify during rainy weather. It really ruins the game experience for me when I have to just hope and pray that the game doesn't crash on the next load screen. When I have to constantly say to myself, ""Dear god, I hope there's a phone coming up soon."" Your only hope is to save constantly. But the problem is that you can only save at phones, and if you are doing a Chapter Replay, you cannot save AT ALL. This is a huge problem if you're a completionist, or you want to just go back and do sidequests that are more useful (like the one for the radio). I lost so many man hours because the game would crash during a Chapter Replay, and all of my progress that I just made was gone. The game looks okay (graphically), but the frame rate is crappy. Sometimes York will have that ""stutter"" run because the game just can't keep up. In combat, I wasn't able to use the Grecotch (OP weapon that carries you through most of the game) because I just couldn't land a hit. Even while standing RIGHT in front of an enemy, hitting it from different angles, etc. Hits just weren't connecting, or it was delayed... I really don't know what the problem is. But in any case, every aspect of this game is ruined simply because it functions like garbage. I would have asked for my Steam refund, but it was already past the date in which I could return it, and I had poured so many ""play"" time in to it just trying to get the thing to work.. disappointing. The actual Director's Cut for the Playstation 3 is absolutely the best version hands down. If you really want to play this game, ignore the PC and Xbox versions entirely.			"

												Deadly Premonition is one of the most unusual and strangest games I've played for a long time. That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character.While I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.For a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well. For starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible (""Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!"").Deadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.Usually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.Additionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back.Before playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.Gameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables. At some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the ""Profiling"" feature expanded.Profiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all.Turning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters.So I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant ""gameover, try again!"" (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues.Deadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.Story/characters/music:The thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather ""foreground"" music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too.Setting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting.However from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks.The main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then?Again I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.Tl;dr in comment section			"

												The PC port is a nightmare. I've tried just about everything - and I mean  everything  - to get this game running. Probably the most hilarious fix I've found has you going on a mini purge of all third party video software, uninstalling LAV filters and setting Windows Media Player as the default app for video files (because y'know, apprarently that works sometimes!?). Unfortunately, like every other fix, it had no effect on my system. Nobody should be jumping through this many hoops just to get their game running. When the desperation is so bad that the only option is to start deleting other programs from your system,  something is seriously wrong.  "

												Right I just want to say I LOVE this game (trust me I'll need to say that before I get into the parts I don't like). I think the story is amazing. It's a very well-written game with interesting and well developed characters. Yorke is wonderfully entertaining especially when you're just driving around and he's talking to his alter ego Zach about 80s movies. A lot of the mini stories are fun and the action is very tense and can be really scary at times. I'm serious this game can be pretty horrifying. I enjoyed every part that didn't involve...well uh... ok...The controls. I've read some other reviews and apparently the console versions controls were a lot smoother but the PC controls leave much to be desired. Yorke kinda controls like a tank (which would be fine in a point and click game) but this is a horror shooter so it's a little clunky and awkward.The real time events are uh... a little difficult. Now I'm slightly biased as real time events are the bane of my existence but Deadly Premonitions are something very special indeed. In most games the real time event keeps the same pattern so that you can kinda power through it after several tries. This game changes the pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. So it's a little difficult. Though I feel someone with good reflexes could get through it no sweat, I'm just slow af. When you drive you feel like you're driving on black ice though I will admit it's very fun when you drive really, really fast and crash into stuff. Also if you're playing on PC be aware this game might crash, several times. It did for me a lot. You can have several days without crashing and it could play smoothly until one day it's like NOPE and crashes on you during a scary part, and oh boy you forgot to save so time to go back into the scary tunnel again with those wall crawlers that take a dozen hits with a shotgun again! And yet... after all this... I still love it. It's like Taco Bell, even though it hurts and might even be morally wrong you just keep coming back for more. I really do think it's the characters, story, atmosphere, Twin Peaks-vibe, challenging puzzles and fun shooting segments that keep me coming back. I'd recommend it to people who have a lot of patience and want a game primarily for story. Still amazing though.			"

												If you can get it on sale or cheap, this might be ok. However, charging 30 Euro for this is overpriced.Technical problems:- Crashes and bugs here and there- Clunky controls- A fixed 720p 16:9 resolution; there is a mod that changes that, but that will give you more chrashesWhile I am accustomed to clunky controls for console ports, the fixed resolution and the crashes are not acceptable.This game tries to be so much at once, it ends up being not good at anything particular:- It tries to tell a story, but that story is weird and has too many turnarounds and arbitrary events. Even after the story is finished, you could still turn it around again and no one would mind.- It tries to be a detective game, but it fails, most detective work is embedded into the story and there is not that much you can do wrong. Lots of suspects, but you don't choose the trail you want to follow, the main mission just guards you through- It tries to be open world GTA driving around, but fails due to extremely clunky driving, unusable map, and chrashes if you go somewhere where the game didn't expect you to go.- It tries to simulate real world needs: You have to eat and to sleep and to shave from time to time. But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc.- It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events- It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable- It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city. - On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.The store page tells ""Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)"". Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.To sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: ""Zach, this is a waste of time!"". Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.

												Deadly Premonition is my favorite game of the entire generation.It's plot, characters and setting are just that engaging every time you come back you still have a great time.The story may sound familiar if you have watched twin peaks in that a girl is murdered in a small town out in the boondocks of america and its up to FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to solve the crime (Call him york by the way, everyone does) but as he arrives in the small town of Greenvale things are not what they seem with strange phenomenon involving red seeds and a legend of a killer in a red raincoat that only appears on rainy nights.The game bursts and ozzs with personality and charm from the music that plays in the opening menu to the way that York interacts with Zach (his special friend) about b-movies.The directors cut that was originally released on PS3 boasts a new scenes that expand the games ending and also tell the story in a different way.The PC version however brings very little to the table by only offering halloween themed suits for York, Emily, The Raincoat Killer and a car skin and even though the game now runs past 30FPS it just doesn't feel right at that speed as it feels to fast...Another issue is that since the directors cut features reworked movement it feels clunky on the pc without a controller while if it used the original versions tank style controls (which I actually liked) then maybe it wouldn't feel so wierd on PC.The last issue that I have that wasn't addressed in the directors cut is the timing of certain music I will give you an example You're examing a dead body and this forboding unerving music is playing then suddenly it changes to light hearted jazz I will admit I got a laugh out of it the first time around and this is the only time I can really remember this happening.All complaints asideDeadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is a game that you have to ownEverything about it feels right and it was the game to renew my faith that games can exceed the bar in many aspects without needing multiplayer, graphics with volumetric lighting (otherwise known as WANK)You are a fool to dismiss such a fine game and even more of a fool to insult itOne of the generations top games100000000000/10 "

												Excellent story and characters, though not without its flaws. Most people think this game's main appeal is that it's ""so bad it's good,"" but honestly it's the fact that its really easy to get emotionally invested in the weird cast of characters. That's not to say that hilariously bad elements are completely absent, but they're absolutely not the reason people like this game.			"

												Un juego que no deja indiferente a nadie; o lo aborreces por esa jugabilidad tan mala o lo amas por esa historia tan profunda y esos personajes únicos.En mi caso, pasó lo segundo y tengo que decir que es una de las historias mejores contadas dentro del mundo del videojuego, es original y sobre todo te mantiene intrigado hasta el final sacando tus propias conclusiones incluso con solo observar la rutina que llevan día a día los personajes.Respecto a la jugabilidad, es mala, así de simple,  el personaje se mueve muy extraño, recuerda un poco a esos juegos de PSX o N64 en sus primeras incursiones al 3D, si mueves la cámara al mismo tiempo que al personaje parece que pierde desenfoque, el carro se maneja muy mal aunque conforme avanzas en el juego tienes la posibilidad de conseguir vehiculos mejores, graficamente es bastante discutible, muchos diran que parece de la generación de PS2 (cómo si eso fuese malo) pero los modelados e interiores a mi me parecen bastante competentes, cosa aparte ya son los exteriores cómo los árboles o lo coches pero cómo no suelo fijarme en el aspecto gráfico para evaluar un videojuego pues tampoco presté mucha atención en este aspecto.Algo que me encanta de este juego es su originalidad, a pesar de lo que se pueda ver en las imágenes, no es un sandbox al uso ni mucho menos un shooter, y el hecho de que de inicio ya cuentes con una pistola con munición ilimitada ya dice mucho de lo que pretende el juego. Puedes andar a tu bola por el pueblo y tienes repartidas por todas partes un monton de misiones secundarias (la gran mayoria de ellas solo aparecen bajo condiciones especiales cómo por ejemplo de ciertos horarios o solo en días lluviosos) , la gran parte de ellas tienen que ver poco o mucho con la investigación de la trama principal y cómo he dicho antes, puedes incluso resolver el misterio de la trama en base a pistas que arrojan las misiones secundarias y las actitudes que tienen las personas del pueblillo. Esto creo que es algo que muuuuy pocas veces se ha visto en otro juegos.El inicio es ESPANTOSO, no puede haber una peor primera impresión, te muestra precisamente las peores caras del juego que son la faceta shooter, el sonido muy pobre (incluyendo los efectos sonoros de unas ardillas que ya lo vereis por vuestra cuenta), los efectos de impacto tan poco creibles y esos arboles tan feos de los que antes he hablado. Si eres capaz de resistir esa primera media hora de juego, os aseguro que el juego os atrapará con todo lo que viene.Otro aspecto muy curioso y que desata polémica es la banda sonora, es otra de esas cosas que hace única al juego, la mayoría de pistas se repiten cómo el ajo y en muchas ocasiones te quedas con cara de wtf? cuando de la nada aparece una melodía que poco o nada tiene que ver con el momtno que se vive en el juego. Esto ya es muy subjetivo pero tengo que decir que la banda sonora me fascina, sobre todo el tema The Goddess y el del silbidito que tan famoso es.En resumen, es un buen juego, un grandioso juegos que suple de lleno algunas carencias con mushisimas bondades, si eres amante de las buenas historias, de las historias originales y de las tramas bien contadas, este definitivamente es tu juego.

												I was going to say something bad about this game since the PC version of Deadly Premonition has one of the worse ports I have ever encountered (It's really bad on the PC & the devs won't even bother fixing the PC version so Durante had to do their work for them) but I played the Xbox version of Deadly Premonition so I have something different to say (I know the xbox version doesn't include the Director's Cut but I had to play this game to see why it was in the cult section of videogames).Deadly Premonition Review:I usually have an average experience on most modern horror games like Outlast for example (I'm a very picky person on what I think is a good horror game) but this game gave me the best experience in the psychological, mystery horror genre & I'm going to try to explain why.Well for starters this game has one of the most interesting main characters in the world of horror. His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) & he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his ""Profiling"" skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) & the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).One of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is ""Bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy"" (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) & I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) & I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the ♥♥♥♥ off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories & the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend & my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer & we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) & the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.Overall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown & to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review & I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).

												What I was able to play of this game was very interesting.  It borrows heavily from Twin Peaks, but turns the weird up to 11 pretty fast.  I was really interested to see what would happen next, and the story might be really great!  Unfortunately, I wouldn't know.  After fixing a few crashes early on I ran into a repeating crash to desktop that I spent more time trying to fix than I did playing the game, and in the end was still unable to get past.  It's a shame since despite the unpolished visuals, I was completely into the game (until I was staring at an error message on my desktop).  One of the worst ports I've ever played.			"

												Deadly premonition tries to mix elements of an open world action game with a survival horror game and it achieves this goal to an extent. It is a poor pc port (although this is somehow mitigated by DPfix) and the production values are subpar but for those who are willing to dig deeper there is a valuable treasure to be found. The direction of the script is exceptional, the characters are well fleshed out and memorable (at least, most of them)  and the overall mood is a perfect blend of comedy relief moments and serious thriller sequences. Also, the soundtrack is among the finest I've heard in any game the last 6-7 years.So, give it a try and see for yourself if you can appreciate a one-of-a- kind flawed gem			"

												It pains me to not recommend this game but you can't look past the technical issues. Even if you get Durante's excellent DPFix mod it's hit and miss whether the game will actually run decently for you, if at all. After much trial and error I managed to get it running but after 30-40 mins of playtime the FPS grinds to a halt and needs a game restart to get it smooth again.What a shame, the game deserves better.

												Deadly Premonition is a game you need to play,For Director's Cut on PC, though, you should not pay.So says Mr. Stewart.Deadly Premonition is one of my absolute favorite games. The Director's Cut, however, and especially the PC version are something to avoid.Deadly Premonition was a flawed, but amazing game full of charming personality with every of it's lots of characters. What it needed is some additional polish, some rebalancing, some QTE removal. Ideally an engine port to make the world feel even more complete by removing the loading screens or at least making them less frequent. It needed something that will make the original strange beauty preserved for generations to come.Instead it got The Director's Cut. A version that is worse in pretty much every regard. With slightly better visuals in some parts, worse in all others. With all the game breaking and lighter glitches, typos, mistranslations and other issues intact. With next to no changes to actual issues. With one non-issue made better (the controls). With pointless DLCs. With horribly voiced and animated new cutscenes that break the flow of the story, spoil things and add nothing of value. And, especially on PC, with countless crashes. Crashes that you cannot avoid no matter what you do, just make them slightly less frequent.If you can, find the original for 360, play that instead. If you absolutely must play Director's Cut, do it on consoles. But this version? This version is the one to avoid at all cost. It will ruin the game for you. And the game is very much worth it.P.S.

												Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut is a strange beast. This horror game plays like resident evil or silent hill, but feels like Twin Peaks. The game is absurd, terrible, weird, stunning and basically the closest thing to art video games will ever be. The story involves an FBI detective who talks to himself and is rewarded with cash for each card of medal he collects as well as any headshots he performs. He loves headshots. You talk to people, like these weird kids and you collect items to use on things, like this fuse box. Lollipops and donuts can recover your health. The game takes on a wider open world feeling later on and between missions you return to this home base of sorts, to get more incomprehensible chunks of plot thrown at you. This game is weird to say the least, but I dig the vibe of it all. You certainly don’t know what it will throw out next. Make sure to grab DPfix, from the maker of the Dark Souls resolution fix, it lets you play the game beyond the 720P default.Watch the video review on youtube in Steam Shots EP125			"

												This game taught me all I need to know about fixing broken game ports!Ignoring the fact that this is one atrocious port that constantly crashes and is very unstable at the best of times, and has wild fps rates, Deadly Premonition is an amazing experience. Inspired by the series Twin Peaks, it bases itself around a small town where a bunch of murders have happened. You play as Agent York, solving the crimes and uncovering secrets as you go. -The game has comedic value; some intentional and others not so much (character idle poses are so stupid they are funny) which gives it some charm and somewhat detracts from the pain of getting it to run. -QTEs are a nightmare sometimes, so prepare to die! -Car controls are very clunky and steering is on a whole different level. -Similar to Silent Hill, there are sections which are nightmarish and a seperate reality from the current part of the game. You find enemies here which you have to fight (or run past if you really wanted to). Combat controls very much like an old Resident Evil title and work well.-The soundtrack is very unique and fits the game brilliantlyBottom line: If you're prepared to spend hours spoon-feeding this game into working, it is worth it.

												I have a lot of games in my Steam library, many of which may never be played, and a lot of them I don't bother playing because the AAA industry tends to make amazing graphics, but dull games.This game didn't just have bad graphics, the controls were incredibly bad, the soundeffects and voice acting horrifying and the bugs... oh the bugs....But let me tell you: after finishing I felt this was one of the best games I've played in a while. Grab it with a discount but give it a chance! It definitely worked out for me. It has something you just don't see too often anymore, namely a heart which lies beyond all the crap on the surface.Do not refrain from purchasing this game, even if it seems dull, ugly and plain.- so says Mr. Stewart.

Pros:- From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there.- Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D- Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player ""go there!...is funny isn't it!?"" for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time!- The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP).- The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it.- OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a ""pro"" but is not a ""con""). - The OST is amazing! Point mother ♥♥♥♥ing period!- The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now).- Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding.- If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details. - ""DP Fix"" exist! (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438) As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;)Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.Cons:- Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT.- You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!Notes:- You can find ""Pillow Stains"", the song from the former form of DP called ""Rainny Woods"" check the trailer on YouTube:

 - Don't waste your first playthrough without doing side-quest.- DP Fix recommendations:1) Desactivare the DEP for the .exe2) Create a shortcut of the .exe to achieve the borderless mode.3) Run the .exe with W98 compatibility and admin rights.4) If you have some .dll problems just follow the Steam discussions. Every OS is different.5) You can now use Sweet FX to bring the Xbox 360 grading. 6) There's a horrible Memory Leak problem within the fullscreen mode. Use borderless as mentioned before to solve this on many cases. This also will solve the issue of the Alt+Tab freeze and the steam overlay.Many other issues and workarounds can be found here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director's_Cut- I would add many things but they could be spoilers. I would recommend you to visit my friend Whitney's Page ""Welcome to Greenvale"" www.facebook.com/welcometogreenvale and her YouTube: www.youtube.com/user/shhistoricalsociety- Another recommendation from YouTube after beating the game:

												This is the hardest review I've ever had to write.Having played through maybe half the game, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE it. It does so many things right and the way it continues to surprise me at every turn is something I've never experienced before.However, like when your awesome, kind, with-a-heart-of-gold-sweet-and-nice, but drunken uncle - who's usually the very best to hang out with, has the best stories, and showers you with genuine life wisdom at every opportunity - one day feeds your face a blank stare while he feels you up, it hurts like a m0ther£ucker.It feels so disgusting and wrong that you feel your bones ache, no matter his ""good"" intentions. And you know without a doubt, and with an indescribable sadness, that if it hadn't been for that specific unmentionable perk of his, he would have been THE greatest person ever, in all of history.If Deadly Premonition would have gotten a decent PC-port IT would have been the greatest game ever. Instead, like your uncle's dark, ugly advances at you, it makes you suffer CTDs every hour or so, if you want to continue reaping the amazing benefits you get by playing.And God help me, there's a REASON why I can't put it away despite that suffering; there's a reason I'm prostituting myself by still playing it. And I can't fathom or even remember any other title I would have done this for, thus my having to save at the towns phone booths every chance I get.Because:Just like your drunk uncle - who feels you up every now and then, which feels so god damn wrong and unpleasant - the same guy has also recently provided the cure for every known sickness on earth, has the solution for world peace at hand, and is in the process of providing every common man with space travel to the new planets (yes, plural) he's discovered.Just like that, it is a fact that the pesky, murky river of epic coding failure in Deadly Premonition also contains, not gold nuggets, but straight up gold BARS, of proportions previously unheard of.And if you had that knowledge, could you, or not, look beyond your uncle Deadly Premonition's one recurring fault? Could you grind your teeth and hold on, just until the unpleasantness went away, just a couple of minutes with restarts every now and then, so he could deliver - to you and the world, yet another great moment? A moment you're not even sure what would entail this time around, but you knew it would blow you and the rest of the world away, and contribute to the ascension of man, soon rivaling the almighty himself?I'll let you think about that for a minute while I leave you with this:This game has some of the best parts of Twin Peaks in it, combined with certain awesome moments taken straight out of the Seven movie, and lots and lots of the greatest kind of quirkiness - which always feels entertaining and amusing rather than annoying.Even with the horribly easy and janky combat present; if they would only have done a decent port of this game, I would have given it top credit, just because of the big balls they had to make something so extraordinary.In the land of generic FPSs, a dime a dozen Early Access $h1t3, and copied to boredom 4x games, Deadly Premonition is the undisputed king, emperor, and penultimate ruler when it comes to creativity and fun storytelling. As of now, it is unfortunately a title you will have to suffer quite a bit of CTDs to play through, but to me that suffering have paid off in abundance.I am really not sure I can put it away, and I'm considering just taking small breaks every CTD and just naturally continue playing from my latest save point. There is no other great title, big bag of money, or warm and tight hole that would have me spinning 'round its little finger like this.I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm probably letting uncle Deadly Premonition get away with it. Maybe you should too.			"

												This game was fun. Enemies are pointless though. Toward the end they start just attaching plot pieces together for no reason, it wouldn't make any difference in the story if they didn't in my opinion. It was buggy though I had to use DPfix atfirst. Then I had to remove it because I got an Aiming glitch that only works by alt-tabbing out of fullscreen mode. Which with DPfix makes you crash. Instead I downloaded sweetfx and kept the game in 720p. For the crashing I used the CFF_Explorer fix, if it was a really bad crash that happened consistently I used compatibility mode windows98/ME. Problem with that is that It makes your frames drop to the single digits. This game is playable if you download various fixes. If you got this game for 2-3$ it might be worth it. However I can't recommend it if you buy it at full price.SweetFX fix - http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director's_Cut#Improved_texturesCFF_Explorer fix (use dp.exe instead of sims3 in the guide) - http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Large_Address_Aware/CFF_Explorer "

 Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut  I can not recommend this to any person. The game has a very ugly graphics, nightmarish control vehicles and map interface is very weak but in my opinion the game makes up with a great story. About the game itself I must say that I played very nicely. The game takes on the character of the young FBI agent who comes to a small town in America to explain the mysterious murders. The game offers us an open world but it is boring and the tour it is very tiring. The advantage may be some side missions. Some of them are interesting and usually after finish it we get cards or quite useful stuff, weapons, suits or new cars. Soundtrack is good but sometimes goes weird music and i mean (using a Emilys car). The game has a very interesting but sometimes strange characters but for me another big advantage. Interface in the game you can get used to but this map is total fail. I personally love this game for amazing story and great characters and that joined to my favorit list. Yeah i know taht this game have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphic and truly speaking to everyone most of the stuff in this game is poorly done and it have a lot of bugs. "

												Twin Peaks: The Game on sale for $2.50? Did you hear that, Zach?While the port is bad, the music is played at the most innapropriate times, and has the SAME EXACT STORYLINE as Twin Peaks, the game is amazing. You can call certain scenes funny but it sweetens the pot if you take them as surreal. I'm not sure if I'm playing a horror game or a paranormal sitcom, but that just makes it all the better. The driving AI for the NPCs is wacky and I like to watch them drive in circles or clip through the forest. I'd say wait til it goes on sale again before buying. What do you think, Zach?P.S. If you want it to not crash on start-up, don't play in Full-Screen mode.			"

												Normally I find trying to get a game running a bit of a hobby, something fun. I want to really enjoy this game, it looks like it could be great to play, but unfortunately that's where it ends for me right now.EDIT, I've got it working. I'm keeping it ""Not Recommended"" for the faint of heart. What worked:Set compatibiltiy mode to ""Windows XP SP2"", run as administratorDelete LAV ExtensionsReinstall PhysxLaunch from the DP application and not the launcherUsing these setting will launch in windowed mode, if you want to run fullscreen create a shortcut of the DP.exe and then in properties type in ""-fullscreen"" within the target field.So far it's reliable, but don't have a lot of hours in it at all yet. I like it A LOT so far. I recommend the game to those who don't have issues doing a little bit of work to get a game going. If you can't handle that, you really need to stay away from the title even though it really wasn't that bad to get started.			"

												I wrote a short ""review"" a few years ago and i feel i like didn't do this game enough justice it deserves.What exactly is this game? That is a really good question. If you really want a better review just  read  this. This is supposed to be a survival horror game, is it though? It's a murder mystery, you play as York (everyone calls him that) an fbi agent that investigate a serial killer leading to a small town. Once you start this game, you'll know that this game is bad. The story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is horrible, the cutscenes are attrocious, the gameplay are horrendous, the control is the worst. But it is also a wonderful experience that you'll never forget. You'll dread the shooting so much with all the bullet sponge enemies, You'll accidentally press the a button and see the 'get out of car' animation a million times. You will also ask questions, a lot of questions. Why is the raincoat killer stopped chasing me after i evade one time? Why is there an old dude on a wheelchair wearing a gas mask? Why is there a jazz playing while i examined a body? Who is whistling that mario theme?!?  please get it out of my head.  And also  Who is zach? Not all of that question will be answered. At the end of the game, the character will grow on you, you'll no longer ask the unecessary question, because it's deadly premonition. But if it's all so bad, what makes it a good game, you ask. Deadly premonition knows that it is a bad B-movie and made it their strength. Sure you will be frustated, but that frustation is wiped by the laugh that you'll get. You'll laugh at it, thinking that it's bad, but that's also what makes it so good. It's also possible that you will hate it with passion, that is also fine. Because you gotta have a truly twisted mind to enjoy it. It's a genius of swery.How exactly are we supposed to enjoy this game, ironically? Unironically? That is a question that will never be answered.Perhaps the saddest part of this game is this will probably be the one and only that ever comes out.			"

												This game is one of the worst I've ever played, and I love every single second of it.  From the begining, it is clear that a lot of love went into it, if only that love and care were equaled by skill and budget.   The port is perhaps one of the worst ever made, lacking any graphical options whatsoever and being unplayable without a controller, to get any kind of control at all you need to install a fanmade patch or two.  This isn't even getting into  the myriad of glitches, poor audio mixing, and graphics that would make a dreamcast look down in shame, but there is way more too this game than all the technical problems.You see, here is where the love comes in.   From the begining, every character in the game is memorable, each has there own personality, traits, and even a unique schedule.  The plot is fantastic and engaging, and at times even heartfelt and moving.  It has a fantastic sense of offbeat humour that will remind enlightened players of Twin Peaks.  Actually, the entire game will remind people of Twin Peaks, because from the setting to the characters to the music this game is a love letter to all things David Lynch.  It should be no surprise that its flaws are just part of the charm, and together they make the game seem more complete for it.Seriously, buy this game if you haven't already, you won't regret it.

												WOW! the Story is absolutely amazing! I have probably NEVER seen a storyline compared to it. (probably not even half as good) The gameplay however..... something between bad and really good, like the dreaded world map that rotates to where the player is facing (the one in the main menu - never saw that..... luckily) while on the other hand doing side quests is actually rewarding! Whether the Rewards are worth it or not is a matter of taste. The whole World feels so alive as well as the characters. Even the side Characters are memorable!But what of the negatives? Well there are a MASSIVE amount of issues here, which is a huge shame, since this game could be sooooo freaking amazing! here are my biggest parts, starting off easy:as already said, the map rotation is a heavy pain in the a$$.Driving mechanics.... OMG..... think your a cool kid for doing a 360 degree spin? thats a joke compared to what you can expect here! if you do 2x complete spins + half a flip by simply driving straight ahead on a flat road and VERY SLIGHTLY move your steering wheel..... yeah great mechanics....Awful pc port that needs patching (around 30 min) with the game still beeing unstable. (playing in windowed mode via DPfix (mod) drastically reduced crashes at the cost of a grey bar at the bottom - i gladly sacrifice a tiny bit of view for much better stability.) on a side note: i could play 12H straight without crashing, but thats different for everyoneBUT the true Horror i had during gameplay are those FU**ING Quick time events! there are way too much in the game. that crap really ruins the whole fun and in fact is like the only way of dying in this game.I would totally recommend this masterpiece at 50€ if the said issues weren't present, but as it stands out..... try your luck when it's discounted. or if you don't want a crashy game WATCH A LETS PLAY! it's really a great story!My score as is: 6/10+1 for better port+3 without those freaking QTE'sIMPORTANT!!!! SEAMS TO REQUIRE THE WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER SET AS DEFAULT VIDEO PLAYER!!!! couldn't get it further than the main menu (seriously) and that's where i watched an entire let's play of the game (also for the first time a complete let's play) just to actually play the game half a year later. :P			"

												Picked this up for £2 during a sale, didn't expect much. Had to patch it and apply several weird fixes before it would run, and it kept crashing randomly. Even with a controller, the movement was a bit clunky, and the graphics are straight from 2005.Despite all of that, Deadly Premonition is probably my favourite game of 2016. After sticking with it for a bit, the story becomes incredibly immersive, the characters you meet are funny and eccentric, and you can't help but fall in love with the game. The story is genuinely intriguing, and all the weird quirks (getting paid to peep into people's houses, stuffing your face with an endless supply of lollipops, main character's oddball rants) make the game even better. Protips:- Only pick this up if you care about story in games. It's Deadly Premonition's strongest suit ... but also pretty much the only one. If you like story-rich RPGs, you will love this.- Don't take this game too seriously at the beginning. - Play with a controller, it makes everything much more manageable.- Patch the game before you start!

												One of, if not the most divisive video games ever created, there's good and bad with this game. To be fair, yes the game suffers from stiff controls, very outdated graphics and animations (even when it first released as I understand it was to be a ps2 game originally), but for me, this gamewas like falling out of an airplane midflight, only to land safely in a hot tub at the Playboy Mansionon trampoline night.To be sure, there's a definite influence from the tv show Twin Peaks (I've only seen the first episodeof the show and can safely make this claim), but the supernatural story, the memorable weird and unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, the twists, open world to explore, humor,atmosphere, and adventure that bleeds its own distinct charm, this is one I'll always remember. Highly recommended despite its shortcomings, I would tell everyone to at least give this a try. Or at the very least, watch a lets play.The monkey screaming Squirrels in the opening cutscene should let you know exactly the sort of experience you're in for.			"

It just will end in frustration.At first, you have to use some ""trick"" to get it started at all. Then you will have crashes every now and then, which have nothing to do with the hardware (my PC fulfills all requirements by far).My personal ""I won't play this anymore""-moment is that some crash just destroyed a save game. So I played 12 hours only to recognize, that I can start all over again and I have no guarantee, that the game won't destroy another save game on my second try to finish this game.			"

												I love this game so much and I yearn for it to fall into my tender loving arms so I can cradle it like a little baby and give it my total loving care. But it is not to be...And you know why that is?Because of the absolutely preposterous port which makes the game practically unplayable - yes I know, you've heard it all before. I started playing this game a few months back, and couldn't get past a particular cut scene (I'm sure some of the less fortuitous people such as myself know what I'm talking about); and 7 months later - after waiting for a patch of some description - it's still broken. Yes, I do use DP.Fix, but to no avail.This is an example of how a game should NOT be on a computer, which is darn shame because I really love Deadly Premonition, and on any other system I'd give it an instant thumbs up. Consoles, I'm afraid you win this point.[If I manage to fix my game-breaking bug then I'll be sure to update the review - doubt it'd change my recommendation though]			"

												This game is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time. I can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable. Provided that it works...[Rating: 65/100]			"

												I had a very hard time thinking of how to review this game. There is no 'yes' or 'no' for this game. Hell even if steam had it there isn't even a 'neutral' or 'maybe'. There is simply an 'I don't know'. So this game has what I think is an interesting story line but it is done very poorly. It has bad graphics, glitches, and it crashed a lot for me and others at points in the game (though I think someone MAY have made a mod to fix this, I never checked.) to the point where I couldn't see the epilogue because it crashed every time I tried but there is still something appealing about this game I can't explain well. The core story is very interesting. The only problem is that this game could have been much better if they took out the bad combat system and spent the money on other parts. Not being able to change the resolution and the 'DP.exe has stopped working' though are the big part for me.That being said I will still re-play it some day because I still like the story. As for anyone who wants to buy this game, You have to be aware that it doesn't feel good and have to go in with low expectations to enjoy it's random storyline. I guess that's the best way to put it. I would give it a...uhh...to be realistic 5.5/10 but I'm still not 100% sure how to rate it. You'll just have to buy the game when it's on sale as long as you can live with what the problems I stated to understand why this game is so good-bad. Though this game is a port and doesn't seem to crash or have most these problems on console so it may be worth buying it on an xbox than on steam.			"

												A great game in a bad port. The bad port comes in the form of horrible graphics settings and crashes. Fortunately I was able to find workarounds for these issues making the game less of a “bad” port, and more of a “decent” port. The first thing you will want to do is download the DPfix mod which will clean up some of the graphics for you. This does not solve the issue with crashing however. My experience with crashing was that the game would always crash at specific parts of the game, usually at the start of a cut scene. By this, I mean that the crashes were not random. The game would crash, I would reload the game, and it would crash at the exact same spot again. I found a workaround, which involved running the game in compatibility mode until you pass the part that crashes then disable compatibility mode after you save past the crash. By doing this I was able to enjoy the game and complete it with only a few technical issues.Now for the game itself. The game in my opinion has a great story and cast. The characters have developed back stories, and the game keeps you guessing as to who is guilty of murder. The main character is particularly interesting in his mannerism. All in all, this is a case of a great game that didn’t have enough money for that extra polish. I would recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for a good 3D adventure game with an interesting cast and story. "

												I adore this game. I really do. It has all the mystery and strangeness that Twin Peaks does. However, the real mystery is how to get the game to actually run. I've made it past serveral game breaking bugs by setting it to win98 compatablility, downloading custom .ini files, disabling steam overlay, Yet I still cannot get past the dump to desk top bug on act 2 chapter 12. This is one of the more challenging games I've ever played because it does not want to be played.Edit: I gave it another chance and I made it thought the whole ordeal. I've changed my review to positive because I love the story and characters so much. The key to getting the game to run Zach, is restarting your computer for every hour of game play. The game with tell you when the memory leak gets too bad, you'll be able to tell. My steam game play time says 37 hour or so. The in game time, which I believe is a bit more accurate, clocks me in at around 17 hours. Play it at your own risk. It is completable, but it sure puts up a fight.			"

												Debatedly one of the Worst-Best games I've ever played. By that I mean that this game astounded me from start to finish, both in good ways, and in bad ways. For example, the characters, story and development of everything in the game are among the best I've ever seen. BUT the game can't really run at a stable 60/30 fps, tends to dip randomly after long periods of play and has occasional crashes.I was lucky to only have the above problems, sound problems, constant crashes, extreme fps issues, things just not working in general among many, many other issues plague this port, and probably most of the original game as well. If somehow, somewhere this game were to be fixed/re-ported I would not doubt this game to be a GOTY contender at all. Even if its kind of culty. And Awesome.Because the port and everything else are so bad I can't recommend this game. If you want to give it a shot you'll be able to tell in the first 2 hours if your pc can run it relatively well. If so, enjoy this diamond. If not, sorry but its just more dirt to tread on (and return)I can only say a game is awesome and♥♥♥♥♥♥so many times before it loses its meaning. T~T			"

												This game from what I have played so far, is really really good. The story and investigation is interesting and really makes you want to think about what could be right. The port of this is as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but DPFix tool can easily fix a lot of problems and restarting your computer once you have installed it fixes even more. Crashes are pretty rare, but they give a lot of save points so its been fine so far.Driving in this game is like GTA but even worse control and every surface is made of ice. The talks you have in the car passes the time by pretty well. The game is suprisingly humours while still able to keep a very good feel to the horror parts. The level designs are extremely atmospheric and the music in this game is great. The developers reference reality and themselves throughout the game and its pretty nice to catch on to them when they do make them.The game feels like a PS2 game should, its not something I feel on most games now adays and its really good feeling to go back in time. I strongly suggest this game even with the crashing problems from the port, most problems can be fixed with enough research and the DPfix Tool			"

												Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.Technical addition:If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version.

												I mean, the game is objectively bad in many ways. I'm not going to tell you differently. But the ways in which it are bad are honestly what make it so amazing.The absolute silliness of the plot, yet still manages to be surprising at points. The characters in the town itself whch give you ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥quests that make no sense. The ridiculously realistic driving simulator that makes the drive between missions actually be like 5 minutes of driving with no other action. It's so good and yet... well.it's one of those games you have to play through at least once, probably twice, to really appreciate. It's just uhh... play it.

												What’s that, Zach – you’re at your wit’s end?Honestly, I don’t know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game it’s not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadn’t discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this I’m glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So what’s good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and it’s easy to see why it’s gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. There’s no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. There’s a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.			"

												After 7 hours of play, I can say that this is one of the best games of which I had the pleasure of playing and I want to still play for much longer. This is an open world horror (which to me is splendid), which gives you various situations and things to do and explore. The city is fairly large and strongly recommend not to risk walking out because there are several places spread very far corners of the map, and so there are police cars to take you, and no, you are not a ride in this game you must control the car and it is possible both at first and in the third person. Something that caught my attention is the amount of commands to do so, beyond the standards, give arrow and have control over the lights at any time, as well as using the windshield when it is raining because the game there day transition and changes in time. For this reason the various possible locations may not always be available because everything has its time due to happen. There markets, gas station, houses and other various places to explore, and you can fish in certain places, of course with proper equipment to do so.All of these sites available no atoa, your character beyond the life bar and stamina, there is also the sleep bars and hunger. For this there is a hotel and some houses you have access to sleep in almost any location truth, if not all, it has a bed can rest. About hunger not always have time to go on the market and that is why there are machines where you can buy some food. This also applies to sleep, do not always have a bed available and the way is turn taking cafes stored in inventory. There is gun shop, but perhaps the most interesting is to get the weapons infinite ammunition obtained in side quests.The game has a police series style several years ago, full of stereotypical characters and cliched situations, the beginning of the keep itself has fragments of what happened in the chapter you are both in photos and with excerpts of speeches. Your character is an FBI agent and called Francis York Morgan, but he always says that it is to call him York, and I've got a ""special"" name if I present myself this way and the other ignores it tends to say this for some reason did not like me. That's what happens when you present to the sheriff of the town of Greenvale, George Woodman calling York ""mrs. Morgan "". This ends up just causing a bad impression. You come to this city because the murder happened it resembles the other which has investigated, and so he joins the local police: the sheriff with his closed way of being, the beautiful Emily Wyatt and sweet Thomas MacLaine (Interpret ""sweet"" as you prefer).In several game moments you can chat with Zach something or someone who is close to our protagonist, but that would be really someone or is it just a hallucination (a second personality perhaps?). In these conversations with Zach, they talk about various things such as films giving various details about the same as the actors, scenes, who is the director and so follows ... but it is more often when we are in the car, it is You can hear a real dialogue, at other times only York speech, apparently alone and this comes to interrupt others and occasionally other people wonder about such conversations with passengers also take place and it will you should tighten the button to start. Deadly Premonition despite being a horror game, occasionally happens comic scenes, however not all actually have felt in those moments stereotypes given much emphasis. Like when York eating a cookie at the police station and say you need to know where it was purchased because it is delicious at this time Thomas gets all embarrassed and bashful and says it was he who made ... (something that usually happens when the girl gets a compliment someone who finds beautiful or who she likes).Time failed typically receive punishments already expected to come face to face with the place closed or even end up getting a ""earful"" lack of commitment to the case, as it is possible that the passage of operating time you are invited to remove and this will force you to ""spend time"" in some way, perhaps one of the best ways is smoking (consumable item).The gameplay takes place in three situations (places) different: the real world, the spiritual world and dreams. In fact, the real world to the spiritual is something reminiscent of ""Silent Hill"", this transition usually occurs when the character you want to do something alone.On the game mode, it is quite simple, but the sight itself is very difficult to have control, but nevertheless it is possible to ""turn around"" with what he has. The other commands usually respond well.Something I saw people complaining are the car's controls are terrible and you end up stuck in places, well I never had many problems, perhaps the fact that I always played first-person account for this. The car has also status, nothing else, just the physical condition and the amount of gasoline. However if you are in the middle of nowhere and end up having to leave the car do not worry, use the signal that exists in inventory and it will bring a new car for you (100% / 100%).The game also has moments of multiple choices and quick time events.Things that caught my attention in particular:- The menu in the game which is very interactive}- Soundtracks that are great and together with the sound effects give a greater strain on the player.- There are secondary missions of various types: how to make a stretch in less time or find something and give it to someone.- In certain game moments are informative situations, such as in the car with Zach and they talking about movies or even a part of the beginning with Thomas where you need to find a key with a kind of ""squirrel"" (if I'm not mistaken) of something specific and every key handed it says it is not right that speaks the characteristics of each species.- There are cards collectibles in the game.I do not know really say what happened to me, but this was perhaps the only game of this style that I felt committed to continue to play and I just loved it from its beginning until now (but I believe it will continue until its end) . Afraid I was very deceived with the game I was behind other analysis and had a completely different view from mine, I finally found one that was negative, talked about the graphics and gameplay treating them as bad, also spoke to this was a game considered a cult, but that could be seen as a masterpiece depending on the person.título: Deadly Premonition: obra prima ou pseudo cult?

I can't even get past the first area because the game decides I want to delete my melee weapon and can't break down a fence now. This port is utter garbage and a total scam that the publishers offload unto steam. As they are publishers they do not have any QA or vetting process restrictions and can drop whatever scum they want directly unto steam and clog up the store with shovelware. I have given this game a few tries just to get it to even run and now I can't get the control pad to actually do anything when I play. Total rip off.			"

												This game took me a while to get into, honestly. The PC port is not fantastic, and it would crash on me frequently, until I found a fix that would make it crash every few hours instead of every hour. So, y'know, still frequent crashes. Also, the gameplay isn't great, with the driving being especially terrible and the combat kind of feeling superfluous. However, the story itself is pretty great, with twists and turns that you don't quite expect. It's campy and great. I can't heartily actually recommend everyone play it, but if it sounds cool to you, give it a shot.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game that I would not recommend to anyone. Many comparisons can be made about Deadly Premonition - I myself found the combat to play like RE4, the overworld to faintly remind me of Psychonauts, the time-based mission structure to resemble Dead Rising's own (although major difference being in Deadly Premonition you can just ignore the time restraints and be none the worse) and even the mechanically-driven story setpieces to remind me of Metal Gear Solid's storytelling methods. The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too. It's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.The point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that ""it's so bad it's good"". This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.But I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.It took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.For the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on. Watch a playthrough on Youtube because it really is worth experiencing, even if second-hand.			"

												Due to Steam's character limit, the full review is available over at Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com]3/10 A good game, sadly a terrible portFor quite some time now, serial killers across the United States of America have been putting red tree seeds into the mouths of young women & displaying their dead bodies in the shape of the Algiz rune (ᛉ), sometimes referred to as the “life rune”. The most recent case in the (fictional) town of Greenvale, Washington is no different. Anna Graham, an 18-year-old teenager dreaming of making it big in the city, was brutally murdered, her tongue bitten out, her carcass disemboweled, & then hung up on a tree. This calls FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to the scene. Though an expert in homicide cases, this eccentric investigator, who only confides in his imaginary partner Zach, proceeds to turn the entire town upside down with his outspoken nature & unconventional methods.

A Screenshot of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut
By: Gao Li




About the GameDeadly Premonition is a game with an outright cult following, but also, sadly, a rather problematic PC port. Its initial development started in 2004, but had to be halted in 2007. Eventually, production continued & it was released in 2010. By that time, several of its assets looked outdated, which surprisingly works in the title’s favor. The uncanny visuals, stellar framing, awkward animations, & at times strange voiceover all contribute to a slightly eerie atmosphere, whereas the funny dialogs & outright hilarious sound effects alleviate the mood just enough to not take the game too seriously.The whole production was also so strongly influenced by David Lynch’s & Mark Frost’s Twin Peaks that it can feel like playing a video game adaptation. The series, like Deadly Premonition, takes place in a small, seemingly idyllic U.S. town where an FBI agent investigates a homicide case of a young girl &, in doing so, unravels a deep & dark secret surrounding the inhabitants while also engaging with ominous entities. In so far, Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro, feels like an homage to Lynch’s series, albeit with some prominent Japanese characteristics & tropes.

The PC PortSadly, the PC port of this cut suffers greatly under several issues, which buyers should know about beforehand. First of all, getting the game to work can be quite a chore & it won’t run on many a machine. I played this on a 32-bit, Windows Vista Home Premium, Intel Core 2 CPU, Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT, 3070 MB RAM, DX 11 & I know that it runs on a Lenovo G50-80E5 laptop with Windows 10. Despite that, Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut only has a 1280×720 p resolution with washed out colors. During sunny days in Greenvale, everything looks almost sepia. Apart from that, it occasionally struggles to keep a steady 30 fps. The situation became worrisome when, after fishing out some documents in Ep 3, Ch 17 & heading out to Harry’s mansion, Deadly Premonition started to suffer greatly with the frame rate dropping down & staying around 9 fps with my peer’s Lenovo laptop heating up from a temperature of 41°C (105,8°F) to 105°C (221°F). Verifying the integrity of the game cache, rebooting the game, or turning the machine off & on did not help, & the situation stayed this way up until entering the Galaxy of Terror pub in Ep 3, Ch 20. The only way the story could be continued at that time was to hurry to some objective, save, shut down the game, wait, start playing again, save, & so on.Other bugs included one where the game had to be restarted, because a key item disappeared from the inventory, one where weapons could not be selected, York walking through a door heading towards Polly’s room in the Great Deer Yard Hotel & falling through the floor, the character of Quint driving be- instead of inside his car & glitching in & out of Richard’s trailer, the game crashing whenever trying to leave the A&G Diner in Ep 1, Ch 9, Nick Cormack’s car not moving during Ep 2, Ch 12, & frequent crashes throughout. One method to reduce the likability of the last one is, of course, to play the game in compatibility mode, but that increases loading times to almost a minute & it does not help against the memory leak, which will inadvertently cause a crash. The game also comes with previous DLC included, but they will often not be activated in-game. Lastly, the PC port is also supposed to have controller support, but has issues recognizing these.

ConclusionOverall, apart from the driving, the crashes, the bugs, & the overheating, I enjoyed most of Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut. I believe that, provided readers have a platform where the game immediately works as intended, they will have a good time with this game. The characters are fun, the story overall intriguing (apart from the ending), & the premonitions truly work in the game’s favor. Nevertheless, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend a PC port that is this problematic & that might fry one’s computer. Even though I like it per se, I adviseto stay away from the PC port.			"

												In Deadly premonition you play the role of FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, but you can call him York, everybody calls him that, sent to a town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While the premise sounds generic and cliche, Deadly Premonition is anything but that and is by far one of the most unique games I've ever played. Deadly Premonition features dated visuals, mediocre gameplay and more bugs than in your backyard yet it's still an extremely memorable and unique experience that shines most brightly on it's plot and narrative. While I'm first and for most gameplay over everything when it comes to gaming, Deadly Premonition is one of the only, if not the only game I'd recommend based on it's setting, plot and characters. The game is a mixture  of Thriller, Horror and Dark Comedy blended together in a extremely unique manner.While you may be put off by the dated, crude presentation and bugs this game possesses, it's still an experience that I couldn't recommend enough if you can overlook it's faults. It's so bad that it's a masterpiece, think of the film Troll 2 which is widely regarded as the 'best worst film' of all time and is an absolutely hilarious masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay itself is somewhat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 but has some awkward controls, thankfully this does little to affect the game as the focus is on it's incredibly strong writing.The story is absolutely brilliant thanks to the writers eccentric and quirky style, there really is nothing out there like this. Again I do recommend caution when buying this game, you'll need to tweak a few things in order to even get the game to run and there are a few mods which enhance the visuals and allow the game to be played 1080p but that aside this is an experience that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of crime stories and unique writing.

												I was gonna wait till i finished the game to write a review but i couldnt wait anymore. SERIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE PLAYED.I see that people are having trouble with the game crashing. It happened to me too so you have to be patient though. Just save the game regularly.Since you can read what the story is aboutm I'll leave that part. Let me tell you what you can do in this game.- You can explore the whole town!! It's actually a nice place with many restaurants and bars- Unique characters (japanese devs always make the most interesting characters)- Hunger and sleep meter which you'll have to take care of. (lunch at your hotel? or at some diner in town)- So many side quests to do though it'll help if you use a guide. (Cause navigating in this game is kinda hard)- In game time which you'll have to keep track of to do some certain quests. (idk why but this game reminds me of harvest moon. The town people walks all over the town. You will even pass by their car sometimes. They have their own daily routine so it helps if you know them too haha)- Fishing spots- Filling gas at a gas station- Weather system (don't forget to turn your wiper on while driving in the rain!)- The otherworld (This is where most of your main missons take place. Be warned. Ghosts! hold your breath so that they can't see you!)- Quick time events (kinda hard though)- Shave or grow a beard- Change your clothes regularly or you'll attract fliesCons:- Enemies are too annoying. They will start spawning everywhere in the otherworld missions. (You had to shoot a lot of them in the prologue before you reach the town)- Map is hard to navigate. But i guess that makes the game more realistic?- crashing- The otherworld missions are too long T_T One cannot stay inside a world where there are full of ghosts for too long.I guess that's about it. Thank you for making such a great game <3 I really love it. I can't believe i got this game for under $3 !			"

												One of the most memorable video games you'll ever play. The gameplay won't blow you away, but it has a great story, a ton of characters, and quite a lot of fun side missions and stuff to do.You might be better off getting the PS3 or 360 version of the game, since the PC port is notorious, but there's a guide: http://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut that can help with the most common issues.

												This review is for any one having trouble with the game, and my honest opinion.Firstly to get the game to work what i did was, go into steam/steamapps/common/deadlypremonition/redist. then scroll down until you find PhysX_SystemSoftware. Double click then click repair then start the game and it should work perfectly. The game itself I have played multiple times on both xbox and playstation and is one of my favourite games, of all time. This port is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and its takes a certain patience. But the overall game kinda makes up for it. plus you can get get a bug fix online http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix. kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ service from the people who ported it but eh what you gonna do complaining won't do anything. Get the bug fix do the repair and have fun with the game. You need to play this game, isn't that right zach!			"

												I can see why Deadly Premonitions has such a cult following. The game certainly has a peculiar, low-budget charm to it. The combination of Twin Peaks weirdness, Silent Hill otherworldliness, and cheesy TV sitcom-inspired humor is ridiculous...but it works. At least, it works when it's not crashing.And boy, does it crash! Crashes occur so frequently that I'm often unable to reach another save point between CTDs. I've lost progress so many times now that I really just can't force myself to give it another shot. After 18 hours, I can truthfully say that I made a serious effort to enjoy this game, but I'm done.Look, I have a fairly high tolerance for the shortcomings of low-budget games; I can generally shrug off outdated graphics, minor bugs, bad voiceovers, clunky controls, etc. But 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay between crashes? Not even I'm willing to put up with that.I wish I could recommend Deadly Premonitions...I just can't. The story and characters are often highly amusing, but the crashes are not. For what it's worth, if a stability patch ever comes out for this game then I'll happily give it another go and revise my rating. "

												I've bought Deadly Premonition three times in various formats, and I'll buy it again. I've been playing video games for twenty-four years and this is my favourite one of all time. I bought it originally cause I heard it was a jokey cult game and didn't think it would be good. It took over my life. Have you seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Zach? Cause that's me now. I go around indoctrinating more friends into playing this game, because I want everyone to see it. This game and I have a more intimate connection than the one I share with my fiance. I have written more words on Deadly Premonition than the total length of War and Peace (I word counted it). It takes a little while to get into. I didn't fall in love with it at first, cause the start of the game is skewed towards some of its weaker features. And you do need the dpfix.exe to stop it from crashing (it takes a minute to install). You may want to get the xbox or PS3 version instead.... but, my friends, it must be confessed, Deadly Premonition is simply the best.			"

This game is truly one-of-a-kind and one of the few games I would encourage everyone to play.I will get this out of the way first - this game is a horrible PC port. It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The director’s cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)It's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.You play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.It is full of weird, cliché (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.The game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular problem with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.It is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.A very unique game - one with plenty of flaws but also so much to love. I would recommend all people with an interest in story-driven games to try it out.			"

												I was interested in this game because it has many fans and was supposedly good. What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.			"

												N.B. There are some computers that the game just will not display properly on. It's fine on my AMD PC, but my Nvidia laptop can't display any text without severe distortion (both run 64-bit Windows 7, and have the same issue with Amnesia the Dark Descent). I don't know why, but if you can get a demo from somewhere to test whether it works, or check the forums, it might help. Also, this game is available on Xbox 360 and PS3, if you find the PC version isn't for you, although the PS3 version is the same as the Steam version (The Director's Cut).This is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.Did you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.Mr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.Please, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present. If you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it. Even a year after playing it, the 36 hours I spent in this world are still etched in my mind. Thumbs up all the way.			"

												""Mr. Francis York Morgan, you are the protagonist of the generation. So says Mr. Stewart""To summarize Deadly Premonition, the graphics suck balls. The driving sucks balls. The combat sucks balls. The animations suck balls. In fact the entire control scheme sucks monkey balls. But underneath all this ball sucking lies an absolute gem of a game. The plot is great and the script is actually extremely well-written. I dare say these two factors were probably the only driving force behind my decision to see this game to the end. A higher budget and better production values might've done wonders with the game.This game is one huge package of silliness. A lot of the time it will make you laugh but mostly you will be laughing at the game itself. Deadly Premonition is a game where you see your fortune in the morning cup of coffee. And there's an hour-long level where you're running after a dog. Did I mention that dog had its own rap theme song? And just when you think this game couldn't get any stranger, the final two chapters take ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness to a whole new level. Lovely!Deadly Premonition is not a game you recommend to anybody. But it most definitely is a game that should be played at least once.			"

												Okay here's the deal with this game.You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling. It's almost like this game has no right to be any good, but it has so much soul, and leaves you with such heartfelt goodbye, that you won't be able to anything but recommend it. Plus, it deals with some really heavy themes like child abuse,♥♥♥♥♥♥ transsexualism, and it can get very rough and creative when it comes to violence, down to straight up shocking. It goes beyond what most games try.The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.			"

												To get it out of the way first, the PC port is pretty damn bad, even with DPFix. Unlike the Dark Souls port which was good (no new bugs, old bugs fixed, solid FPS, it runs, etc.), this port is falling apart at the seams. There's old bugs, new bugs, plenty of crashes, and what have you.However, the core of the game's story, ie: the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. There's just something to the overall charm of these things that makes it easy to overlook the issues. In fact, some of the issues feel like they add to the game. The janky animations, the poorly balanced voice clips, the comically bad car handling, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game.Even with all it's issues, this is a great game!

												This is a terrible game. The controls are wonky, the actual gameplay is repetitive and it's full of QTEs. The PC port is a total disaster that barely works, crashing every 30 minutes and lacking basic 16:10 monitor resolution support, meaning I played the game with everyone being rather more skinny then they should be.This is also one of my favourite games of all time. In every other way it's indescribably magical. Playing this game is like a religious experience.			"

												Let's just get something out of the way here: this port is one of the worst ports I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even after following a lengthy list of instructions and applying the DPFIx, DP: Directors' Cut features a butchered, shoddy port that is prone to frequent crashing, weird speed ups and slow downs, bizarre physics mishaps, corrupted saves, and a really, really weird issue where playing for more than two hours in one sitting can result in some... interesting... consequences for the engine.And even if the game wasn't completely broken, it still suffers from a myriad of problems. The combat is abysmal. Not only does it feel tacked on, it literally is tacked on, as confirmed by Swery65, who explained that his publisher forced the decision in an effort to garner more sales. The combat is tedious, featuring only two distinct enemies: ones that die quickly with no effort and ones that take up five minutes of your time in pure tedium ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If the combat is supposed to provoke a challenge, it is easily negated by how easily you can cheese the gameplay by acquiring infinite ammo and durability weapons early in the game, but not even instakill weapons can save you from a never ending supply of quicktime events.Disregarding the gameplay, the graphics are incredibly poor. I'm not one to turn my nose at dated graphics, as some of my favorite games are before Steam was even a thing, yet Deadly Premonition released in 2010, the same year as Red Dead Redemption, Halo Reach, and Mass Effect 2. Going up against these games graphically is a bit ridiculous when the game looks like it came out in... 2006, but whatever.At this point, you may be wondering why there's a postive thumbs up next to my review, since I've done nothing but trash Deadly Premonition. Well, the truth is that this game is the best worst game I've ever played. Like I've pointed out, there's just so much wrong with DP: DC, and yet, it's an incredible experience. All of the characters are well written and lovable, and all form a cohesive, believable community and setting. Dialogue is as bizarre as it is hilarious, and trust me, there is plenty of writing to enjoy. Weird quirks dominate the scene, such as having every single character follow a routine and schedule based on a variety of factors, and allowing sidequests only when the time is right, and pulling those sidequests away from you if you're too slow to grab them. Additionally, Deadly Premonition has care in weird areas that I've not seen in other games before, like letting you use your turn signal in a vehicle, or having your character be able to grow a beard and shave it regularly, or most unique of all, having your character sleep under the ♥♥♥♥ing blankets.Name me one game that lets you sleep under the covers besides Deadly Premonition.... *Ahem*All in all, Deadly Premonition is a bizarre, flawed, hilarious, witty, diamond in the rough. It has a ton of bad, but if you're willing to put up with the bad and push through, you'll discover a truly unique experience that no other game will ever deliver quite the same.			"

1. The Port,Let's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons.The game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad.There's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.During my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.It was worth it.2. The Gameplay.Deadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee).During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights.The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.3. The Story.FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game.The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.4. The Characters.This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms.The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.5. The Summary.Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned (and those that I did not) - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.Objectively 9.5/10.

												Really good game.A lot of the negative reviews it gets are about the PC port being buggy - I hate to be that ""works on my machine"" guy but I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, there were a few glitches but honestly I found them pretty funny (like people floating outside their cars), and they didn't impede my progress at all. Admittedly it did crash once (and kept doing so at that point), but for some reason putting it in windowed mode fixed it (and I switched back after).That aside, the actual game is great. Great music, setting, story and characters. Gameplay is a bit wonky but you get used to it. There's also a lot of side missions to let you know more about the side characters and the town, and lots of cool (and useful) things you can find/buy. The only gripes I have are that some sections could drag on for a bit too long, and were quite tedious, like following someone who's driving painstakingly slowly for ages. Also the driving controls are terrible, let's not dance around that. Early cars barely turn at all, and later cars go way too fast and turn too sharply, making them flip over and spin wildly out of control. Lastly, there are extended QTE sequences that are also pretty tedious, and you usually die immediately if you mess up, having to go back and start the entire sequence again.However, even with all that, this game is one of the few these days that made me actually want to come back and keep playing, and see the story through to the end. The characters felt realistic and had depth instead of being generic flat characters like in most other games.I don't even know what genre this game would be. It isn't really a horror game, and it's not really a murder mystery either, it sort of combines elements from lots of different genres, and has a wacky humorous theme mixed in with darker elements. It's sort of like a weirder Japanese version of Twin Peaks.tl;dr I had a lot of fun playing this. It was a great game from start to finish, even with some iffy patches along the way. Contrary to what most of the negative reviews say, it's not ""unplayable"". It runs pretty well on my mid-tier PC, and has setting adjustment options.Just try it out if it looks like something you'd enjoy, and don't worry about all the horror stories about the PC port. They're mainly gross exaggeration.			"

												Like many people, I played the tutorial section of Deadly Premonition on the 360 and dismissed it as a cheap, ugly, unwieldy, cheesy afterthought.It's not. Boy, is it not.Imagine a game made by someone who watched Twin Peaks, loved Resident Evil 4 and doesn't have a cynical bone in their body. The jankiness of the PC port evaporated along with the essential widescreen patch (YMMV however) and what was left was something that was in equal parts charming, kooky and memorable. It's an action adventure that wears its influences with pride and revels in its clunkiness.I get it now. Swery intended *everything*.Can't recommend the game at full price though because although it chimed with me in a big way, there are going to be people who hate it (and I can't blame someone for having a different taste to mine).With a large reduction, everyone should at least try Deadly Premonition - Just promise me you'll play past the prologue.

												Let me start off by saying I adore Deadly Premonition. After purchasing it on xbox360 at launch I was super excited to play the game again with this Director's Cut. The story is still great, the characters still quirky and awesome, the combat still forced and terrible.However. After playing for an hour I ran into a bug that forced the game to crash again and again and again. Community fixes didn't work, I'm completely stuck, and from what I can tell on the forums I am not the only one. It's bad enough that the community had to fix the screen resolution because the game doesn't even give you options to adjust those yourself. But game breaking bugs that still haven't been fixed close to a year later? Ridiculous. TLDR: Game is great on consoles one of my favorite of all time, get it there. Pc version is a buggy mess that probably won't work for you or at the very least gives you headaches trying to fix it so it's barely playable.Update late 2016. After installing the game again on a new pc I finally got past the part it crashed at on my other system... only for it to crash righ after at the next cutscene. As much as I love the game...there is just no excuse for the way they have handled this release.			"

												It's really hard to rate Deadly Premonition. In one hand it's utterly broken, buggy and sometimes even outdated, but it's also very clever, atmospheric and unique. Basically DP is an open-world investigating taking place in a little town, just like Twin Peaks. But this description just doesn't cut it. It's also extremely bizarre, weird and often creepy. The ""side quests"" are also very  different from what you're used to, they mostly revolve around getting to know the people of Greenvale, and actually this is how I spent around 3/4 of my almost 40 hour playthrough... just getting to know this town and the people living in it. York (and Zach) the 2 in 1 detective, George the king of the town, Harry the weird millionaire who always wears a mask for some reason... and even though you get to know the characters very well, they still managed to keep the thing that are important well hidden, lurking in the background, just so they can surprise you with it later. The story and the narrative are just perfect. Same could be said for the soundtrack and the voice actors, all top-notch.All in all Deadly Premonition is a terribly broken, ugly (and despite these) amazing game, which I'd wholeheartedly recommend to all my friends :) This is probably as close as we'll ever gonna get to a Twin Peaks game folks!

												It's such a good game, unfortunatley a lazy effort on the developers part. At launch there was no controller support, however that has now been patched, but the game itself can still be borderline unplayable unless patched with DPfix (the same person who fixed the Dark Souls port). Even with that patch however the game still suffers from a range of glitches, bugs, crashes and audio/visual problems, still it's hard to not recommend this game. After all it's problems have been sorted out, this is easily one of the best games on Steam, with a good sense of humor and some nice references to certain things in pop culture (such as Twin Peaks), you might want to hold of purchasing it until ALL of the problems have been fixed.

												York is the greatest video game protagonist of all time and Deadly Premonition's story, characters, humor, atmosphere, soundtrack and sheer personality are way above what you will find in most critically acclaimed titles. It's not without its flaws, like a subpar combat system and bad graphics (even for the time), but it's totally unique and isn't afraid to experiment, something sorely lacking in other games.If you own a Xbox 360, play the regular version there instead of this one. The little improvements of the Director's Cut aren't worth it, since this port suffers from common crashing issues and some bugs.However, a bad port is still better than not playing Deadly Premonition, so if this is your only option of experiencing the game, go for it. Just be aware of the following:- Check  the PC Gaming Wiki[pcgamingwiki.com] and its tutorial on installing DP Fix, SweetFX, better textures and solutions for crashing;- Always run the game directly through DP.exe instead of Steam or other methods;- In order to get an item that will make navigating through the game much easier and more pleasant, do Side Missions No. 004 & 005 (George's sidequests) as soon as possible;- Do not read the description of the Trading Cards before finishing the game, since some of them contain spoilers.F...

You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee).During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights.The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.3. The Story.FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game.The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.4. The Characters.This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms.The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.5. The Summary.Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned (and those that I did not) - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.Objectively 9.5/10.

												Twin peaks simulator 2013If you want to bash Deadly Premonition, just go ahead. There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience.DP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy.The story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching.One of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters.The day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around.The dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while. For fans of Twin peaks and X-files, this is essential.Don't you agree Zach?

												I've heard a lot about this game. This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these ""quests"" are like ""find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM"" (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), ""find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)"", ""find sheriff's dumbbell"", ""find sheriff's assistant's keys"" and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY......the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like ""guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff"" and just push you through till the end. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ quests I didn't finish! ♥♥♥♥ exploring! Surprise, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!Another thing, last, but not least. ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!Imagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail.

I have no idea if that's still the case now, but I'd recommend checking out the pcgamingwiki page concerning this game before making the purchase. On console, that's a different matter. The game is a gem, and it's weird as hell. Definitely check it out on a stable platform. I usually champion buying the ""good"" version, but in this case, like with Dark Souls 1, this is definitely not the good version.			"

												If you are going to get it make sure you only commit an hour to troubleshooting because it will take longer and you will lose your chance to refund. But like all the rest of us you are gonna think you can make it play.I'm sure it's good but it just wont happen.When loading up the game you may aswell spin a wheel to whether it crashes or not. Once loaded you can then enjoy the next bug it decides to throw at you. I got as far as the driving section where I had to listen to the car screech constantly only to learn I had to downgrade my headphones from surround sound to stereo to get rid of that issue.Made the mistake of buying in a sale and coming back to it much later so I'm stuck with it.

												Deadly Premonition is a game that must be played, to be believed. The plot might be taken straight out of Twin Peaks, but it is a truly unique, yet bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy game. This port isn't as bad as I've seen a lot of people complain; the only issue I've really experienced the aiming (which the other ports struggled with as well). The shooting sections may be tacked on, the story and characters really make this game shine. York is absolutely insane, believing his coffee tells the future, while talking to an imaginary friend named Zach (who Zach is, is up to you. I believe Zach is the player). Me and my girlfriend sat down for 6 hours on the first sitting, and we're addicted. The cheese factor is so strong, you could open your own dairy shop.9.5/10			"

												I can't think of a harder game to score, so I am glad I stopped giving them this year. The best way I can describe this is L.A. Noire meets Silent Hill, and that is some pretty hefty praise coming from me. The action could definitely be annoying, not unlike Silent Hill, but the story and all of the little touches elevated the game well above the sum of its parts. Looking back, I wonder how many of the deadly sins the ""big bad"" committed throughout the game. I could think of a few right away once I realized his persona. My only regret is that I didn't start chasing the side quests early enough to get them all done, and I really can't recommend the experience enough.			"

												Positive: game is somehow unique in some way (like Braid, Limbo, Alan Wake and etc.). I love those ""unique"" games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this game…. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed...Negative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess I’ll write about everything what I didn’t had positive opinion…Sound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!).Ragdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little.Graphical look: this game looks like 2005 game.  Well at least it is at acceptable levels.Enemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2).Boses: during the whole game you encounter X (I won’t spoil exact number but it’s only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point. Cutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. It’s related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there aren’t a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if you’re as am I more interest in a story it won’t bother you a lot).Dungeons: once you’ll play your 4th or 5th dungeon you’ll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These “dungeons” are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards).Loading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads “Press Start button” (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game won’t crash) I’ll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) I’ll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hell… I can even compare this games loading to  Windows 7 booting time… AGAIN 10-20 seconds…).Optimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasion’s game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenes… It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: “Do you want to save?” I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). So… In summary it crashes whenever it likes… Don’t forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even can’t replay some chapters (I couldn’t replay chapter 7 even after 20th try…).  Not sure… Maybe crashes related to AMD card I have…For those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes:Increase game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this “increase” method works only on 64-bit systemsUse DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Souls… Devs couldn’t add support for high resolutions).SET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark “Run as an Admin”.Shutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion list…).And yeah… Never do anything to stress your computer during this games’ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature).For those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..So if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestions… That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).And yeah although it annoyed me a lot I still liked game mainly due to it's story and gameplay :)			"

												In the game, Deadly Premonition, the main character is recommended a sandwich consisting of turkey, strawberry jam and cereal stuffed between two pieces of bread. A few moments later, he declares it's the best. sandwich. ever.That describes DP. It's a janky, open world game with poor controls, PS2-era graphics, the worst driving in any any game, and shooting controls that make you want to cry. The voice acting is painful (except York, the main character; I love that guy), and the character animation is so bad, I was shocked that they actually used motion capture for it.  It's plot is a convoluted mess, liberally rips off Alan Wake, Twin Peaks, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and with a touch of Cthulu mythos.... and yet....And yet it's been one of my favorite gaming experience of the year. It's a game so bad that it flips back to good, to bad again, and edges back to good again.  All the pieces are so bad, yet the whole was so satisfying in a crazy sort of way.Now excuse me, I'm going to try that turkey sandwich. Maybe it will surprise me too. "

												One of the worst ports ever. However the game is just a fantastic mess and if you can pull through the terrible performance then you are gonna love it. Keep your standards low for this one though.If you have a Xbox 360 or PS3 I would recommend getting it on one of those instead. I just cannot get this game to perform properly even with fixes. The PS3 version is most likely the best one to get because the controls aren't a broken Resident Evil 4 rip off like the Xbox version, and the PS3 version has graphical and gameplay fixes too; along with an extra ending. However then you might have some framerate issues. In that case, if anything, the more broken the better. You're then getting the true Deadly Premonition experience. I recommend the game, NOT this awful port.			"

												Go to where Steam is installed -> SteamApps -> common -> Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut -> redist. Scroll all the way down until you find ""PhysX_SystemSoftware"" right click it -> Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch!______Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit.  At least that's what I saw in my coffee..			"

												I played the GoG version of this game first. (So, don't be fooled by the time Steam is displaying :D)tl;dr at the bottomLet me say that this is one of the best games I ever played.It is hard to compare this game to any other title... it has some sort of open world, a bit of RPG, a whole lot of an adventure.... It starts very strange and you don't have any clue what awaits you.But if you aren't afraid of that, you'll find yourself in a great adventure-thriller-detective-horror.... thingy.... o.OIt's really hard to describe, what this game actually is. The game has all sorts of moments. It is sometimes very creepy, sometimes ridiculus, exciting, surprising....I really enjoied it and played the whole game within some days.tl;drPros thrilling story great humor great characters sometimes very creepy York coffeeCons controls needs getting used to QTEs are mean (but rare)11/10 Would see my future in the coffee again °u°d			"

												Great game. Terrible port. It hurts having to not recommend this game, because this is one of the best games I've ever played, but this port is unacceptable. It crashes randomly and it's riddled with game breaking bugs like AI NPCs not doing what they're supposed to making certain sections unbeatable (Nick's car not moving when you have to tail him and the final boss bugging out making it impossible to beat). It's not worth it. Play it on PS3 or XBox. I paid next to nothing for this game and still wasted my money. "

			Odd music for an odd game. But I guess if there's anything to be learned from DP, is that there's nothing wrong with being weird. Oh and yeah, sorry.		

Atmosphere is easily the strongest point in the game, but atmosphere is a bit of a dumb word to use, since it doesn't really mean anything tangible. The game does poorly in some aspects of the game, such as graphics and the incredibly stiff controls, but the result is something that's much, much more than the sum of its parts.			"

												Nominated for the ""Game within a game"" Award.(Review updated 11/23/2016)I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half. I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters. This is a wonderful game with a deep story.  VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues.  Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it. There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that)It is called DPfix 0.9.5 ( http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up. Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

			We delve into a strange, funny, cheesy, crappy and cool game called Deadly Premonition. The director's cut! This game's reviews are very polarised, some hating it, some loving it.		

I nominated it for  the ""Game within a game"" Award because this game has so many things to do in it.  You can fish, drive around and a few other silly things that makes the game a little less spooky without taking away from the gem that it is. If you ever liked Twin Peaks.. you might like this game!If you tried the game and hated it... Give it another chance. Go in excepting nothing. you might be surprised how much you like it. If you loved the game, Go check out Twin Peaks. F.K. in the coffee. Clear as a crisp spring morning!			"

												Let me preface this review by saying the following: THIS GAME IS BAD! Yet I do recommend everyone to play the game at least once. This game must be experienced!Here are just some examples as to why the game is so bad-1. It's glitchy, it crashes a lot, and has lengthy loading screens2. Animations are silly3. Action is bad4. Voice acting is meh5. Gameplay is wonky6. Too many useless, lengthy driving sections (Driving was a horrible forray!)7. The map was frustrating to use for any sort of direction8. The ending after the climax and when everything was said and done really dragged on.Throughout the game there were multiple annoying, odd, or awkardly hilarious things. For example -1. I know the game is supposed to be ""open world"" but the world was downright boring.2. You have frequent conversations with your apparent imaginary friend which range from  hilarious to downright ridiculous.3. The soundtrack is always oh so appropriate. Especially the whistling song: that one's my favorite. (Sense the sarcasm)4. There are random big♥♥♥♥♥flies everywhere!5. If you use the siren in a police car for too long you get fatigued according to that indicator bar and you cant use the siren again until the bar goes back down. Also, if you leave the car after the bar has been maxed out, you yourself will be fatigued causing you to limp until the bar goes all the way down. I didn't realize it took so much effort to have a siren running in a police car.6. The dialogue! Examples of the aforementioned dialogue. And these are just a few of MANY -1. ""My coffee warned me about it""2. ""Who is that one Hollywood writer? Oh yeah, Joel.""3. Quote from the fat guy in the game, ""Chickening out now would be like leaving after appetizers.""So much to love here! Now go buy the game and load it up. Here are some tips for when you do -1. Always run through doors. It takes less time2. Running the game in compatability mode for windows 98 made the game crash less and it seemed to load faster in-game. Some of the cutscenes became laggy, although.3. About halfway through the game there's a mission where you follow a suspect in your car. It's super frustrating because driving is horrible. On top of that, the guy you're pursuing fluctuates between going 15-25 mph aka the slowest driver of all time. There is no good way to regulate your speed so you end up in ""stop-and-go"" traffic without any traffic. And here comes the tip... Don't accidentally bump the siren. You'll immediately have to start the mission over after what feels like 20 minutes of following the stupid ♥♥♥♥! GAH!In a nutshell: This game is so bad it's good.Overall the story interested me: it kept me playing and wondering who done it... that and all the beautifully horrendous presentation! Truth be told, the game did wrap up nicely and there were a few unexpected things that made it at least sort of satisfying to complete. I recommend people to at least attempt a playthrough and one playthrough should be enough. I probably will never play this game again but, it sure did leave me with some fond memories! (And really great screenshots.)			"

												Overall: 8/10  Story: 10/10   Gameplay: 7/10   Graphics and Sound: 6/10 (held back without modification)   Content:  7/10 Replayability: Low but possible[Game was purchased on sale] A very different game which is strange is a good way. The gameplay is very quirky and sometimes glitchy but somehow it fits the style of the game. Overall it benifits from its unique blend of comedy and ""horror"". The story and its progression are well done and keep you engaged and coming back despite the other technical issues with the game (crashs and corrupt saves). I would recommend backing up saves every chance you get. In all, I really enjoyed the experience and it has come to be a game that I will never forget. I purchased the game on sale for about $2.79CDN but I would have been happy with paying a little more.			"

												This is my first ever Steam review and unfortunately it’s going to be more of a fix suggestion than a review (my review was very long initially but Steam wouldn’t allow me to submit it so I had to chop it considerably). I was able to fix this game (so that it ran) fairly quickly. Here's how I did it:1. Go to where the game is installed on your PC. For me it's at C > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut2. Open the redist file and double-click the application called PhysX_SystemSoftware (.msi)3. Select the Repair option and let it run through completely. 4. When that's finished, launch the game again. NOTE: I should point out that I AM running the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3). For me, this fix worked immediately. I DID NOT download the 4GB patch that's been suggested! I hope this helps some of the people who were having trouble. Do I recommend this game? Yes! I can't recommend it enough. In fact, it's one of my favorite games of all-time (I played the 360 version previously).  However, if you are expecting not to have to caress this game softly in order to make it purr – it is probably not for you!If you are willing to put in a little effort though - I think you will be pleasantly surprised at everything you get out of this game.

It has so many ideas in it that feel like they shouldn't work, but somehow they do. The story is so ""out there"" that it's hard to explain.

												Overall: 8/10  Story: 10/10   Gameplay: 7/10   Graphics and Sound: 6/10 (held back without modification)   Content:  7/10 Replayability: Low but possible[Game was purchased on sale] A very different game which is strange is a good way. The gameplay is very quirky and sometimes glitchy but somehow it fits the style of the game. Overall it benifits from its unique blend of comedy and ""horror"". The story and its progression are well done and keep you engaged and coming back despite the other technical issues with the game (crashs and corrupt saves). I would recommend backing up saves every chance you get. In all, I really enjoyed the experience and it has come to be a game that I will never forget. I purchased the game on sale for about $2.79CDN but I would have been happy with paying a little more.			"

												Nominated for the ""Game within a game"" Award.(Review updated 11/23/2016)I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half. I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters. This is a wonderful game with a deep story.  VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues.  Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it. There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that)It is called DPfix 0.9.5 ( http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up. Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Deadly Premonition (part 1 - MY EYES!! [blind]) 

			Views: 11,572		

			We delve into a strange, funny, cheesy, crappy and cool game called Deadly Premonition. The director's cut! This game's reviews are very polarised, some hating it, some loving it.		

I nominated it for  the ""Game within a game"" Award because this game has so many things to do in it.  You can fish, drive around and a few other silly things that makes the game a little less spooky without taking away from the gem that it is. If you ever liked Twin Peaks.. you might like this game!If you tried the game and hated it... Give it another chance. Go in excepting nothing. you might be surprised how much you like it. If you loved the game, Go check out Twin Peaks. F.K. in the coffee. Clear as a crisp spring morning!			"

												Let me preface this review by saying the following: THIS GAME IS BAD! Yet I do recommend everyone to play the game at least once. This game must be experienced!Here are just some examples as to why the game is so bad-1. It's glitchy, it crashes a lot, and has lengthy loading screens2. Animations are silly3. Action is bad4. Voice acting is meh5. Gameplay is wonky6. Too many useless, lengthy driving sections (Driving was a horrible forray!)7. The map was frustrating to use for any sort of direction8. The ending after the climax and when everything was said and done really dragged on.Throughout the game there were multiple annoying, odd, or awkardly hilarious things. For example -1. I know the game is supposed to be ""open world"" but the world was downright boring.2. You have frequent conversations with your apparent imaginary friend which range from  hilarious to downright ridiculous.3. The soundtrack is always oh so appropriate. Especially the whistling song: that one's my favorite. (Sense the sarcasm)4. There are random big♥♥♥♥♥flies everywhere!5. If you use the siren in a police car for too long you get fatigued according to that indicator bar and you cant use the siren again until the bar goes back down. Also, if you leave the car after the bar has been maxed out, you yourself will be fatigued causing you to limp until the bar goes all the way down. I didn't realize it took so much effort to have a siren running in a police car.6. The dialogue! Examples of the aforementioned dialogue. And these are just a few of MANY -1. ""My coffee warned me about it""2. ""Who is that one Hollywood writer? Oh yeah, Joel.""3. Quote from the fat guy in the game, ""Chickening out now would be like leaving after appetizers.""So much to love here! Now go buy the game and load it up. Here are some tips for when you do -1. Always run through doors. It takes less time2. Running the game in compatability mode for windows 98 made the game crash less and it seemed to load faster in-game. Some of the cutscenes became laggy, although.3. About halfway through the game there's a mission where you follow a suspect in your car. It's super frustrating because driving is horrible. On top of that, the guy you're pursuing fluctuates between going 15-25 mph aka the slowest driver of all time. There is no good way to regulate your speed so you end up in ""stop-and-go"" traffic without any traffic. And here comes the tip... Don't accidentally bump the siren. You'll immediately have to start the mission over after what feels like 20 minutes of following the stupid ♥♥♥♥! GAH!In a nutshell: This game is so bad it's good.Overall the story interested me: it kept me playing and wondering who done it... that and all the beautifully horrendous presentation! Truth be told, the game did wrap up nicely and there were a few unexpected things that made it at least sort of satisfying to complete. I recommend people to at least attempt a playthrough and one playthrough should be enough. I probably will never play this game again but, it sure did leave me with some fond memories! (And really great screenshots.)			"

												The definition of so bad it's good. What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists. The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.Isn't that right Zach?(This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)			"

The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.

												This game man. This is one of the only games that I can't really explain to people at all. You either ""get it"" or you don't. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, don't get me wrong. However, behind all the cornyness, jankyness, bad voiceacting, bugs, terrible gameplay, terrible driving, etc. There is something so god damn geniuine about it, something with all of it's elements mixed together creates something beautiful and emotional if you are the type of person that can connect with it. Perhaps similar in a way to all the b-movies York seems to love so much.It feels like all the very odd, surreal, quirky, sad, and happy aspects of life enhanced by the even more odd, and quirky low-budget japanese game design. And you take that, and you put Swery's special b-movie twist on everything. What comes out is a true, very long, adventure with some of the most memorable characters and stories in gaming today. If you are the kind of person that can really connect with it. I don't want to sound insulting, but I don't think most people will ""get it"" without having a certain type of taste and perspective on things.			"

												Do you like weird games? Let me rephrase that. Do you like Resident Evil, Shenmue, Persona and Silent Hill? Do you want to play them at all once?Deadly premonitions looks bad, controls bad and would overall be a bad game if it were not for the brilliant absudity it offers. Moments of tension and mystery are intersped between hilariously bad writing and super cheesy dilogue. Deadly Premonitions is the rare example of a horror-comedy in video games and is an absoloute must play for anyone. The PC port offers a better control scheme than the PS3 version, but it also comes with it's own limitations. Rising Star gave us one of the worst ports of all time. For some reason the game is locked into 720p and though it touts controller compatability it is entire incompatable with XInput controllers, meaning your 360 or logitech controllers will not work without third party programs. There are a coouple fixes from a clever modder to fix the display issues, but otherwise get the PS3 version instead.			"

												For all its flaws, most of them coming from its engine, Deadly Premonition does a lot of things right. There is an extreme care for details (at the expense of others) that makes for an unique experience.An impressive amount of work has been put into each of the characters. They have their routines, and what they have to tell you will change based on where and when you encounter them. Additionally, each of the game's side quests is an occasion to know more about those who live in Greenvale.As a result, the world feels alive and inhabited, more than the vast majority of the open worlds I played, and I played a lot of them.

												I'd recommend the Xbox 360 version of this game, as I do feel that The Director's Cut unnecessarily changes the narrative flow for the worse. Still, Deadly Premonition is a fun, quirky game that should be experienced by anyone who feels that modern games lack charm. I also highly recommend this game to fans of Shenmue. Just bear in mind that the PC and PlayStation 3 versions of this game have a lot of problems. Not that the Xbox 360 version doesn't have problems, but it doesn't have as many. Either way, don't let other people tell you how to play the game. It's best experienced when you play it blindly for the first time.			"

												    I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.    The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an♥♥♥♥♥losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, ""Are you there, Zach?""			"

												This game is awesome, I pre-ordered it for the 360 after hearing how bad it was and received a copy of the game which wasn't even spelt correctly on the game sleeve. After finishing the game I found myself unable to control the massive ejaculations that occured throughout my playthrough and now suffer from ED from how fugging awesome this game was.It's the story of an FBI agent who was chosen ""Most likely to go to Jail"", ""Most likely to Kill"", ""Most likely to be institutionalised"" and ""Coolest scar"" by his high school classmates. He is sent to a town in Washington to investigate a murder involving some red seeds and ends up talking to himself alot, drinking copious amounts of coffee, talking to himself in public to which only one character seems to find weird, and staring at the female deputies big bazookas.Mid game was kinda bad though, if this game was a woman it'd be Beyonce's backdoor, Rosario Dawson's bazongas and Rosie O'Donnel's stomach.Also has a QTE for waking up and lets you stalk the townspeople and watch them through their windows. And a dumbell signed by Arnold Schwarzennegger.I rate this game 4.5/5 haggis. Loses half a haggis for bad graphics, controls, driving, combat, investigation, gameplay, bad QTE's, everything that isn't a cutscene, being an actually pretty bad game.			"

												This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.			"

												Deadly Preminition is a bizzare game.  On paper, it's not that impressive. Dated graphics, awkward gameplay, stiff animations, lack of creature design, various audio and visual bugs to boot. But still there's some charm reminiscent of the David Lynch series Twin Peaks, including a protaganist that feels very influenced by the series itself. I can't really say much more without spoiling some of wackyness and weirdness that goes on within the game itself however. The Japanese historically haven't had a good time with PC ports (As consoles are the dominant market in Japan) and this game is no different. With repeated reports of not opening (Simple fix, go into your DP files and delete the one for PhysX) and audio and visuals not matching up, but Durante has released some fixes for the game. Which help it a lot with visual resolutions and some of the massively gamebreaking bugs.It has tons of charm, a great soundtrack and a few moments of ""What the ♥♥♥♥"" Worth playing for curiosity alone but I'd wait for a sale on it.

Genre: Horror/Third-person shooterAfter finishing Deadly Premonition I must say that this was a very unique and very interesting experience. Game has a very good atmosphere, and somewhat creepy. I felt kinda odd at the beginning. Characters are very interesting too, and the voice acting is great. As for story, well it's a very interesting and a good story about some detective who comes to a small town to investigate the recent murder. Can't remember the last time when I played the game with such an interesting story. There is a supernatural stuff to the story too, in my opinion kinda more supernatural stuff than it was actually needed, but still good story overall. As for gameplay, well gameplay is pretty bad and repetitive, but still I found it fun at first. Good enough for this game anyway. While playing with keyboard, you can't aim with the mouse. With default controls you need to press space to go into the aim mode. Driving cars was actually fun and driving controls were fine. There are also a bunch of side missions that you can do in that town. You can fast travel too, however only if you complete some side mission and since I didn't know about that I went everywhere with a car.Now for the quality of the port. This truly is a bad port. You need dpfix to be able to play the game without most issues. You can get dpfix here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix You just need to extract this to your game directory, and you can edit dpfix after that if you want. Without it, you won't be able to have resolution above 1280x720 I think. Also problems with crashes etc. I still did have crashes, but only in two episodes. So I just used save files that I found somehwere on the forum to be able to progress, since my game was constantly crashing at the same moments during these episodes. As for performances, I had a few minor issues.Verdict: Amazing atmosphere, somewhat creepy, very interesting and a good story with some good characters and the voice acting. Pretty bad port, but most issues can be fixed by using dpfix. I definitely recommend playing this game though, since it's a very unique experience and quite the good one.Personal rating: 7.5/10 "

												Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made. That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever. The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder. So pretty much it is Twin Peeks. Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue. Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver. He is Smug and a♥♥♥♥♥♥to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as ""Zach"" But I will not spoil how that ends.York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear. Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it. The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless. You probably will learn your way around the town. Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving. While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the ♥♥♥♥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant. In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! ""The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary."" The enemy’s you fight ""all 1 of them"" are called Mysterious Shadows. They look like zombies with clown make up on. And they make stupid noises when they die. The shooting works but it won’t blow your mind or anything but it works.Melee weapons work decently. The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief. It's baffling when it happens. The game in general is ""unintentionally"" funny. The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant. There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk. He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is. Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!			"

Yea it's not a major triple A game, and honestly, graphics, animations, gameplay while it's not super duper amazing, its amazing in it's own way. This is the definition of a niche title, and this has a great story and a enjoyable experience overall and I highly reccomend it. Sure it may be a lazy port but there is a mod online to fix it, I like the way it is however and it controls fine without a controller so I didn't bother with it. All in all this is an amazing game, right Zach?			"

												7/10 - This game - much like our main protagonist - is split into two halves. On one side, it's a mechanical mess. Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).But on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.It is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of ""Weirdest game I've ever played"", ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show. If you can get past its technical faults, its definately one to experience. ""Isn't that right, Zach?""			"

												I'd recommend the Xbox 360 version of this game, as I do feel that The Director's Cut unnecessarily changes the narrative flow for the worse. Still, Deadly Premonition is a fun, quirky game that should be experienced by anyone who feels that modern games lack charm. I also highly recommend this game to fans of Shenmue. Just bear in mind that the PC and PlayStation 3 versions of this game have a lot of problems. Not that the Xbox 360 version doesn't have problems, but it doesn't have as many. Either way, don't let other people tell you how to play the game. It's best experienced when you play it blindly for the first time.			"

I learned about it when I saw an article about Durante (The guy who fixed Dark Souls on the PC), so when I learned that he was working to fix things, I bought the game right out.After 20 + hours in game, I can say this is one of the best games I ever played. Sure it has problems, but the excellent script and crazy story, overcome those limitations.You can make it better in the graphics departement by installing DPfix and SweetFX. It finally comes down to taste. You will either love this game or hate it. I just love it. :)			"

Posted: August 23, 2015
												So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic ""who dun it"", story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story. The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests, bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness. I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed.  In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. "

												I would have given this quirky game at least an 8/10, but due to hardware silliness, and a bad port...I just don't know. I want to LOVE this game. I really do. The console version is waaay better. I'll base my review on what the game truly is without hardware/software difficulties and bad porting. If you are familiar with Twin Peaks or any absurd David-Lynch works, you'll understand this game completely. If you're not...just go with it. Yes. It's ♥♥♥♥ing weird. Yes, York (the main character) is a dweeb. Yes, this town has no basis at all in reality. Just go with it. Gameplay-wise...meh. It's really about the weird characters and story. Sidequests everywhere!Ultimately, I cannot recommend the PC version if you're running any machine newer than like...2007-2009.If you can get your hands on the xbox360 version. Great. "

												Getting pass a few bugs here and there with the game sometimes crashing after a ""cutscene"", the game runs fine. Graphics aren't the greatest but the story line is where this game really shines. Did not expect the game to last over 10 hours as I did do a few sidequests. The gameplay is pretty generic with a bit of quick time action buttons and inventory management of sorts resident evil style.For achievement hunters, most of the achievements will be from doing the side quests or looking for items scattered around the map so expect to spend over 30 or more hours if you plan on getting 100% in the game. There will be a lot of driving around and there is no GPS guidance other than a huge arrow pointing main quest location, so you will need to use the map occassionally to find yourself around to the next point. Got the game for free during a bundle promotion, but I would say the game is worth it at a discounted price of atleast 50%. Rating the game 7.1/10 mainly due to the story line being so good, but driving to each point is a hassel.			"

												Yeah, this game has its share of problems. The PC port of the game is terrible, and I am glad I got to experience it on a console. It was only recently I decided to revisit the game on PC, and the amount of times it just crashes for no reason at all is just silly.If you are a person that require decent graphics (you know, the visuals), then this game is not for you. In fact, the graphics are so poor for its time in this game that it looks more like it was released during the PS2 era, when it was in fact released during the PS3 era (I am using the PlayStation as a reference because it was on a PS3 I played this game the first time). They aren't particularly good, but if you can overlook this, then you're in for the next challenge.The controls. Geezus. Who sat down with the driving part of this game and thought ""Yeah, yeah this is perfectly acceptable.""? Regardless of what platform you are playing this game on, the driving itself is way to challenging for its own good. Sure, it makes you laugh a bit the first time your car is suddenly on two wheels and spinning out of the road and into a ditch, or a house, or another car. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentyeth? Not so funny anymore.And the combat. Ugh. It can't require that much more polishing to actually get the combat controls improved, can it? Because the most challenging part about combat are the controls, rather than the enemies. And that's not the reason you want your game to be a challenge.But, this aside, I still enjoy this game, and I still recommend this game. Why? Because of the story and the atmosphere. It is so rare to see a game where each and every character you meet feels well thought out and unique. Where the story of the game may not be super original, yet still manages to suck you in and surprise you with its many plot twists. It was my second playthrough recently (though it had been a few years), and I was still surprised by a few of the plot twists. And that's something special. This game is special. And if you like a good story, then this is something you cannot afford to miss.Edit November 2016: Just nominated this game for The “Test of Time” Award. It truly is a gem that should be experienced.			"

												I don't think that anyone can contest that the core gameplay and graphics are quite lackluster (usually a death sentence for a game), but I found the central mystery as well as learning about the various quirky characters through sidequests really compelling. Enough so that I was happily pushing through.Unfortunately, this port is really prone to crashing which just got worse as I went on, and what with it being a crappy ugly game, that was just too much. Ah well...I got this at -90% though, so no loss. I feel sorry for people who pay the full $25.			"

												I love this game. I've waited a long time to play, and had my prejudices, but I was quickly drawn into the story, it kept me interested all the way to the end. The graphics are sub-par, but that can be partially amended with a tool called dpfix. Acting and writing are hilarious at some points, I have to admit this game isn't really scary - but it delivers a few scares in the combat sections. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, I played the game with a walkthrough as I didn't want to miss useful items (or get them too late in the game). Maybe due to that the game hasn't been too difficult, but I don't see that as an issue - it was a very pleasant ride. Side quests are optional, and they do add a bit of game time, but, as mentioned, some yield quite useful items.			"

												This game is a confusing one. Through its many flaws, terrible vehicle controls, Bad Port, awful and stagnant level design and PS2 graphics, I really love this game. Its dark humor fantastic and sometimes hilarious soundtrack and its over the top ridiculousness make it amazingly addictive. I had no trouble in playing this for 2-3 hours straight, Except for the Driving control,it's making me crazy,just a little turn and the vehicle twist around lol but i'll get used to it. It has its moments of absolute brilliance for instance the opening sequence will astound you in how well it is put together.  The dialogue is incredibly silly but it adds to the overall experience. Imagine every silly and funny line in every video game ever and condense it down into one pot, That's what deadly premonition is. It will leave you thinking 'was this all a joke or were they serious when they made this?' If it was a joke they are geniuses, if they are serious they are geniuses. To sum up, one of the most special video-gaming experiences of the year.  I got carried away by the story of this game.Don't forget to drink a coffee to see the today fortune...			"

												Deadly Premonition is a one of a kind game. I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.It's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the ""feel"" of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.What's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world ""detective"" game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...Deadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it. Why? Because it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" kind of games. I don't even know why I loved it, but when it crashed on me, I always just restarted it and kept playing.			"

												An outstanding cult classic of a game, but the worst port of any video game I have ever played. This absolutely puts Dark Souls PC to ♥♥♥♥ing shame.On top of the anecdotal reports of freezing, I can personally attest to crashes on inital startup, poor keyboard support (a broken item storage mechanic because of it), and HORRENDOUS sub-15 FPS areas on my 2015 gaming rig.This will not be patched - the community efforts are valliant, but futile. Unconditionally avoid. Watch a let's play instead.			"

												Heyyo,""Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it."" Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :PI want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, ""But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me."" Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think that’s the biggest strength in this game. It’s interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, it’s quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and don’t flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5.The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as you’d expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1’s and those budget games you’d find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.So yeah… vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In  the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I don’t know the development cycle and I don’t know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didn’t focus in… but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :POh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you don’t save… so it’s up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_modsHope this helps… so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)			"

YouTube™ Video: Deadly Premonition (REVIEW) 

			Views: 28		

			A look into the cult classic horror game Deadly Premoniton. Is it worth your time? Should you pass on it? The only way to know is to watch.		

This game is a mess. The PC port is absolute garbage, it crashes so much to the point I couldnt finish the story. The graphics and gameplay are painful as well. On the other hand, the characters and story are so bizarre and interesting that I wanted to see more from this game.			"

												Ok I'm done. I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.If you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.Even after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence (""HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!""). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system. I'm going to spend the rest of my ""time"" on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.			"

												I want you to play this game, just not on the PC. Do you have a PS3? If so, turn it on and download this classic. It really is one of a kind at the moment with no other game to compare it to. Sadly the PC port is a right pain in the a$$! I had to fight with it for way too long, starting my game over because of saves that corrupted. By the time I was done trying to get the game to work, I was afraid to mess with any of the add on content and played it in windowed mode in fear of it crashing. With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans. If I could I would tell you it was worth it since the game is amazing when it is working, if you overlook the low budget that is. Yet, you might not at the moment have any other choice but to play it on PC. If you choose to endure that path, get ready to fight for your right to play the game without problems. Now with the port aside, the game is far from perfect at times even seeming to be broken in places. The vibe it sets and the story it tells is just so cool that you learn to live with the many flaws and ugly graphics. Also it does have one of the most annoying boss battles I can remember right at the end, but this game is still great and different. If you loved the TV show Twin Peaks, this is a must have and for any surreal fans, you would just be better off getting it on PS3 or finding a copy of the original on 360.			"

												You play as FBI agent Fancis York Morgan, a delusional man that gets crime clues from his coffee, and talks to his ""imaginary"" friend Zach, more than he talks to real people, in front of real people. He's sent to Twin Peaks (can't remember the name of the town, and its twin peaks anyways) to investigate a murder case that seems relate to a killer he's been investigating for some time.The game is a collision of genres and elements that tries to be so many things at the same times, but really doesnt have the budget or technical prowess to truly be the game it could be...That being said, I enjoyed this game a lot, from its strange characters, that by the end make York look like a normal guy, to the sandbox exploration elements in a nearly lifeless massive town that brings to the table, for no good reason, like everything else in this game, and still works. This game is a...Sandbox Survival Horror Simulator Adventure Third Person Shooter Fishing Exploration Game with day and night cycles where all characters have their daily routine...What the hell did I just say? And the game totally half asses most of those genres.A technical disaster that manages to be one of the most unique, funny, weird and all around insane games, Isn't that right, Zach?I Love it			"

												Deadly Premonition is a game that David Lynch would have created had he been a Japanese game developer. It is strikingly similar to the television show Twin Peaks and one of the characters even bares an uncanny resemblance to an actress who played in 'Mulholland Drive', Naomi Watts. It's obvious the game's developers drew heavy inspiration from the show and Lynch's other works. If you ever wanted to play as Dale Cooper in a world so bizarre, spliced with elements of Silent Hill, then this is probably your best and only bet. Just be prepared for what is truly terrifying... a terrible PC port. Save often.			"

												A bad port of an already creaky game, the first enemy you will face in this game is the game itself.  Google DPfix - the patch made by a saintly individual who also rescued the Dark Souls port - as this is essential.  The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.But here's the thing:  I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully.  From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight.  You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening.  You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town.  This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.For all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve:  a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules.  I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.			"

												I can't believe I've put up with this torture for more than 30 hours. Probably the half of it was spent for just getting the game run properly. I've seen all kinds of glitches, e.g. crashing, freezing, broken image, stuck in a corner, etc., etc. I tried DPFix and various kinds of attempts, none of which worked definitively. I am not complaining about the story and contents by themselves, but this is arguably one of the worst implementations of a console game. It's amazing how many bugs the devs could cram into this and still managed to think the game is playable.No, I won't play this again. (I was supposedly in the last chapter.)P.S. Also, the game behavior is affected by random things like monitor resolution, which makes running this game a kind of black magic. I regret I've run out of extra sheeps to sacrifice.			"

												The Game itself (Gameplay / Story): Wonderfull if you grew up with Twin Peaks.The technical aspect of the game: Horrible.It´s a great game if it runs on your system. (Luck dependend)It´s a horrible piece of work if it doesn´t.Chances are this game won´t run on your system no matter what you do.This game maybe takes about 8 - 10 hours to playthrough. Steam sais i needed 24,3h.That´s because i had to play sections over and over again because the constant crashes und freezes.I even need to copy the save file between 3 PC´s !!! with different OS and config.With Win 8.1 don´t even get started, there you will have all the problems that are available.With Win 7 you will have most of the problems.Like i said, i finished this game on 3 Pc´s (Win 8.1, Win 7 64x, Win 7 32x) "

												A near masterpiece, yeah I said it. Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show ""Twin Peaks"" are incredibly valid in setting, characterization & situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an ""other world"" when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port.  The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has. This game truly is not for everyone but I enjoyed the heck out of it. An easy 9/10 from me.			"

												Deadly Premonition tries so hard to be Twin Peaks and a survival horror. Because of the lack of fundings, the entire game feels like a cheap Twin Peaks/Resident Evil 4 knock off but not an awful knock off. Just cheap. People tend to have mixed feelings about this game. People seems to adore it, while others just can't stand this game. I understand both statements. If you can bear the awful pc port, awful survival horror part; go ahead. If you are a Twin Peaks fan, you gotta give this game a try. Even if you don't like it, you have to agree that this game has a cult following since its release.			"

												This is an amazing game that is completely hobbled by one of the worst PC ports that I have ever seen. I've tried it on two different, fairly beefily specced systems and both of them get roughly five frames per second. Going by the forums, the developer has apparently abandoned the project entirely, so unless the community gets together and fixes the myriad of bugs still left in this terrible tragedy of a release, it will never be worth purchasing.Stay away my friends!

												Because it's like Twin Peaks but MORE mental. That said, it's a real mess of a port, and the patches still haven't fully fixed it. You have to get used to saving at every opportunity so that frequent crashes to desktop won't ruin too much progress.But even in spite of that, it's still really worth having if you have an appetite for strange.

												I honestly had my feelings about this game constantly change the moment I heard about it. I originally ignored it thinking it wasn't for me, then thinking it wasn't that great. Once the PC version was announced my interest in the game was sparked again, and I looked into it. Eventually got it as a gift on steam cause it was cheap and me and my cousin get each other games for our birthdays, and I am so glad I played it. Now, the thing about this game is the gameplay is not the best part. In fact it's a little weak, fun, but not too strong. It's obvious that they were indeed forced to include the RE4 style combat by the publisher, and I bet the game would've been better if more focus on the breath holding mechanic was your main way of dealing with enemies. Another thing some people might consider weak is the voice acting, and while it is ""bad"", a lot of people have such a charm to them that I actually like the voice acting. The games music is also wonderful, especially the classic whistle tune you hear throughout most of the game. The graphics while looking dated, don't look dated in a bad way to me. They give a cozy feeling.Now outside of things like music, graphics and gameplay, the PC version does have some notable issues. One is the lack of graphics and resolution options, which doesn't bother me but just cause I don't care doesn't mean it isn't an issue. The game also tends to crash, and for a while I had no way of continuing without using another save file ahead of me to avoid a crash, which fixed itself for me but not everyone. I'm not aware of any other issues, but if you find yourself discovering more issues before purchasing the game then look into getting the original release of the game on the Xbox 360, because while it has it's own issues the Director's Cut doesn't have, there are more game crashing, lag and other issues present in the Director's Cut versions of Deadly Premonition than there is in the original version.In the end, besides that one crash I got which fixed itself I would highly recommend this game, on any platform, just that if you have any issues or don't want to take a chance get the 360 version of the game. If you need strictly good gameplay, which is what I usually need to enjoy a game, then you might want to pass on this game. I normally prefer the gameplay of my game be good, rather than my story or anything else (but music or story being better than gameplay so long as the gameplay is still really really solid works for me as well) but Deadly Premonition is just a case where even with gameplay that's only maybe a 5/10, the rest meshes so well together in a way that I just enjoy spending my time playing this game. I would probably say this is one of my top favorite games of the previous generation. Please do yourself a favor and give this game a try or play it.			"

And It turned out to be a really enjoyable game.  For 20 dollars you can easily forgive some of its short comings like the driving system and graphics.  Other than that it is a perfect example of a cult classic, especially if you are a fan of Twin Peaks.			"

												This game runs poorly, even if you install DPFix. It doesn't look very good. It controls poorly. The combat, hiding, and evasion scenes are even poorly designed, before you get to controlling them. I've had it crash several times. I've only played a short bit on PC to see how it would run, after completiting it on Xbox 360, and I've had force-quits multiple times. I've even heard of bugs that can prevent you from completing the game, which is the entire reason to play the game.  But this game is enchanting. The story and characters, as much as you can say they are stolen from Twin Peaks, are fascinating and engaging. You will likely have numerous fits of laughter as you experience the quirky animations and dialogue. And the plot goes into perhaps even stranger and disturbing depths than Twin Peaks did. It's worth your time to stick with the game, even if the game is not to your liking, because the story is not to be missed.That said, if a game that has numerous technical issues is going to bother you, then you shouldn't play it. You can experience the story elsewhere, and get most of the enjoyment from watching it as you would playing it, without having to struggle through what most people would consider a negative experience of completing the game's often tedious ""dungeon"" segments. I would say to absolutely wait for sales, even if you really want the game, and know you will enjoy it. This game goes on sale for as much as 90% off fairly regularly, such that I've purchased extra copies for others on several different occasions in the last few years, so you won't have to wait long to get a deal. I first purchased it for $15, as the original release on the Xbox 360, and didn't regret it one bit, but not everyone will get that same enjoyment, or have the same feelings. I can't recommend it at normal price, but cannot recommend it enough for $2.50-$5.			"

												As much as it's ugly, clumsy, buggy, dated technologically and features some dull combat sequences that belong to much older PS2 games, none of its flaws are at all worth avoiding it for. Deadly Premonition features some of the best characters in gaming in the last 15 years, some fantastic and funny dialogue, a moving story, and some of the weirdest atmosphere you'll ever see. Where it fails, it somehow only enhances the experience. And where it succeeds it soars. It's completely and utterl one o fa kind and every gamer should play it on any platform they can find it on, because there's just nothing else like it. When your time comes to a close, you will so deeply miss York, Zach, Emily, Greenvale, and every looney in it.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a unique experience that every videogame enthusiast should play. The game obviously looks a bit rough around the edges and surely doesn't have the tightest controls, but once you get used to it, it will suck you in and never let go until you get to the end.Its setting is heavily inspired by David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which may be a plus (it is for me), however as the story progresses you realize that it stands on its own and it's actually pretty interesting.Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.Things I didn't like are basically related to the bad PC port: long loading times even on an SSD, crashes and some problems with getting my gamepad to work. It was worth the trouble anyway.Buy this game, you won't get to play anything like this for some time.			"

												I played this game years ago, and to this day if someone asked me to name the craziest game I've ever played, or the most annoying game, or most surprising game, OR even one of the best games E-VER - you guessed it. This one right here. I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did. I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself ""I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!"" I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.			"

												What has often been referred to as one of the ""best-worst"" games of all time. Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.The game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him"" and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?Balancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately ""wacky"" music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?Yes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.York and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious ""discussions"" about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and ""Jaws"" amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.Deadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!Edit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.			"

It makes me desperately want to finish it despite the crash that forces you to play it in windowed mode. Its town feels alive, with real inhabitants, despite their quirky animations and weirdnesses.I get lost driving with those horrible cars that veer right, and laugh to myself at the uselessly zoomed in map. And still, everything intruiges me to such a degree that I would call this a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would never want to be withouth.There is so much to do and see, that I found myself fainting outside of an ingame diner and woke up after being driven to the hospital. Surprised I realised I had let my loveable strange FBI agent go too long withouth eating.Similiarly I noticed flies started gathering around me at one point, because I had not changed clothes and sent my worn ones to get washed. I'm growing a beard as the game progresses, as I have not choosen to shave. The story is full of twists and turns. Every character IS a character, with motivations, secrets, a backstory... They all seem to have lived their lives up to the point you join them in the game. The side quests, silly as they may be, seem to fit in the world.Seldom does one come across a game that can make the gamer so immersed, it has the ability to frighten, make one laugh out loud, as well as puzzle and feel sad.Cult classic: The mystery, the music, the ugliness, the beauty, the people, the humour, the dialouge... This Japanese tribute to Twin Peaks and movie trivia is beyond words. With all it's flaws, it's simply genius.			"

												This game aint for everyone, the shooting is clunky and easy, the camera can be annoying at times, the game crashes (and needs to be played as Admin, if you want to get past the part) and the graphics look worse then an early Xbox 360/PS3 game. That all said, the game is amazing. The story, the characters and the dialog make the game what it is. Its a special kinda game that cant really be said why its so great, you have to play it yourself. 10/10 we need more games like this.			"

												Deadly premonition's port to PC  is A real hot mess, even with the DPfix for 1080p and controller support is not enough. You still experience massive fps drops do to compatibility  issues that can only be resolved by uninstalling most of your media players or changing the codex! Well... Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale.Truly a flawed gem...			"

												A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC!  Play it on console!I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue.  Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied ""Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize"" .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice...So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 -  get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...			"

												I really enjoyed this game, in spite of it's seemingly endless PC compatibility issues. I was finally able to find the right combination of compaitibilty modes and patches to make it work on my machine. It is a truly unique game and has a lot of replay value. The story is very original and it is very quirky, which will keep you scratching your head at times. It's easy to see why this game is so polarizing, but I think it's worth a shot. I don't know that the current $25 price tag is a good value though. I was lucky enough to get it in a bundle, otherwise I would have been livid about all the technical issues.			"

												It is the most unusual game I have ever played. It is just weird in a good sense. I would describe it as a mixture of detective horror story, open world and police officer simulator.The best thing about this game is the story. It is long (the main story took me more than 20 hours, and there are tons of side quests), full of interesting characters and unexpected twists. You as a detective York investigate the murder of a girl, and the further you go the better story gets. But not everyone will like this game because sometimes it gets weird - one moment you are terrified due to some horrible things happening and then a few seconds later characters make stupid jokes and laugh. So not everyone will like this mixture.I can't recommend it to everyone due to some other issue - stability. The port is not very good. Some people can't launch it at all, some others complain because game crashes every few minutes. I had a few problems, but luckily managed to complete it without any serious problems.Don't buy it for the full price. Wait for a discount and give it a shot. It is worth it.			"

												Remember the cult 90's show Twin Peaks? Fantastic series, and this game holds up well as ""companion media"" to the show. You are put in the role of Francis York Morgan, an FBI Special Agent who is dispatched to the small country town of Greenvale to work on a homicide case. As the game progresses York becomes involved in the town's sinister affairs and realises that things are not as they seem.The game plays a lot like an actual investigation. You will go to gather evidence, interrogate suspects and follow leads. The game world is open to you with no time limit, so there's nothing stopping you from enjoying what Greenvale has to offer!The game's story is its true strength. The characters, locations and subplots adds to everything that makes the game ""so bad it's good"". A terrific game to play if you're interested in Twin Peaks or The X-Files.			"

												Deadly premonition derives from those loveable 60's B-movie tropes. While not great at a technical standard, Deadly Premonition has some of the most memorable moments in gaming history. A great story, an open sandbox world, interesting characters and a huge variety of other in game tasks to complete besides the main story.One of the most interesting things about DP (not deep pen) is the atmosphere. Tasked with trying to bring a killer to justice, you and a motley crew of under staffed local law enforces team up to tackle the rain coat killer. A mysterious individual who is going around town killing innocent women. The setting in the game is just amazing. As I said before, it's not a great technical achievement, but it doesn't have to be. Gameplay over graphics is always a motto I have said and stuck by. Set in an idyllic town set in the mountains you generally feel alone and constantly fighting to find out where to take your mystery solving crew next. One scene has you hiding from the rain coat kliller as he chops down the door with an axe. Do you run? Do you hide? It's frantic and engaging and people will love the humour in this game. It's a light touch that is needed at certain points throughout the game.This game is an utter joy to play and you will easily get 40+ hours form it. "

												Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to ♥♥♥♥ing Hideo Kojima of all people.  Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird.  It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice.  I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer.  Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with.  It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.			"

												*15/10, fun for the whole family.* This cultural phenomenon, which will come to define this generation for the next several decades, was most assuredly not inspired by the hit TV show ""Twin Peaks"" and definitely does not blatantly rip off said show in a hilarious and heartwarming manner. Swery is a tortured genius, and his artistic soul -- tender and tormented -- is laid bare, raw and awesome. It would be a folly comparable to the fall of man to not partake in the seductive madness and ensnaring purity that is Deadly Premonition. If you do just one thing with your life that you can look back on with pride and say, ""I did it perfectly"" when on your deathbed, let buying and playing this game be that one thing.			"

												Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain weirdness of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.			"

												From the very start of the game (albeit after fixing the crash issues) I was hooked.  A survival horror game with elements of comedy, with an open world environment and a charismatic protagonist makes it a cult favorite.  The games story (for a brief summary you are an Special FBI Agent investigation an interesting murder case) gives you a lot of clues and expansive knowledge for the player to deduce and question who did it with so many suspects you'll be sure to doubt your prime suspects, but do not fret as the pieces will fall in place nicely and pave a wonderful intense and dramatic story.  This game deserves a 10/10, however due to the pc port issues, bugs, and numerous crashes it recieves a 8/10.			"

												As much as it's ugly, clumsy, buggy, dated technologically and features some dull combat sequences that belong to much older PS2 games, none of its flaws are at all worth avoiding it for. Deadly Premonition features some of the best characters in gaming in the last 15 years, some fantastic and funny dialogue, a moving story, and some of the weirdest atmosphere you'll ever see. Where it fails, it somehow only enhances the experience. And where it succeeds it soars. It's completely and utterl one o fa kind and every gamer should play it on any platform they can find it on, because there's just nothing else like it. When your time comes to a close, you will so deeply miss York, Zach, Emily, Greenvale, and every looney in it.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a unique experience that every videogame enthusiast should play. The game obviously looks a bit rough around the edges and surely doesn't have the tightest controls, but once you get used to it, it will suck you in and never let go until you get to the end.Its setting is heavily inspired by David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which may be a plus (it is for me), however as the story progresses you realize that it stands on its own and it's actually pretty interesting.Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.Things I didn't like are basically related to the bad PC port: long loading times even on an SSD, crashes and some problems with getting my gamepad to work. It was worth the trouble anyway.Buy this game, you won't get to play anything like this for some time.			"

												I played this game years ago, and to this day if someone asked me to name the craziest game I've ever played, or the most annoying game, or most surprising game, OR even one of the best games E-VER - you guessed it. This one right here. I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did. I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself ""I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!"" I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.			"

												What has often been referred to as one of the ""best-worst"" games of all time. Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.The game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him"" and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?Balancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately ""wacky"" music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?Yes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.York and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious ""discussions"" about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and ""Jaws"" amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.Deadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!Edit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.			"

												The PC port is pretty damn bad, even with DPFix or other fixes. However, the core of the game's story, the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. For some reason, you go back and play this game, it is its overall  ''charm'' of this gem that makes you forget about all the technical issues.  The janky animations, the voice clips, the terrible and unaccurate controls, the comically bad car handling, the chilling but also vivid music, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game. Recommended 100% if you are into horror games. If you are a graphic core, do not judge this game for its poor graphics, otherwise you will miss one of the weirdest and unique games of gaming history. P.D Some tips to avoid techincal issues:1.- Always save your progress!2.- Execute the games as windows 98 compatibility mode and run it as administrator.3.- To avoid black screens when you quit the game manually, minimize the window game and close it with right click.4- When you start playing the game ok, then it starts dropping the framerates and keep 20fps, minimize the gaame and close the window. Enter the game and load your progress and game will run fine smooth again. Do this every 1h of gameplay. It seems the engine overload when playing for +1h so the game will lag, loading screens will take forever and get black screens.			"

												This game aint for everyone, the shooting is clunky and easy, the camera can be annoying at times, the game crashes (and needs to be played as Admin, if you want to get past the part) and the graphics look worse then an early Xbox 360/PS3 game. That all said, the game is amazing. The story, the characters and the dialog make the game what it is. Its a special kinda game that cant really be said why its so great, you have to play it yourself. 10/10 we need more games like this.			"

												A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC!  Play it on console!I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue.  Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied ""Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize"" .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice...So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 -  get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...			"

												The game is nothing short of amazing. The game was heavily inspired by the ill-fated Twin Peaks TV series and draws heavily from it. SWERY65 is not David Lynch but he captures the mysterious atmosphered of a backwater US town perfectly. Don't let the PS2 grade graphics and animations fool you - the game is atmospheric with beautiful soundtrack, interesting characters and plot that makes you sit for hours for no end. The only problems I have with the game are the QTE controls making you look over the whole keyboard for a key to press. That can of course be easily solved by playing with a mouse.Do this game deserve a playthrough? Yes. You will either love it or hate it, but definetly it's one of the most unique games out there.

												I just wanted to give a heads up about the current situation of the game. In other reviews I read about problems with the game that I did not encounter when playing the game over the last weeks. It might have been patched or maybe there is new information on how to get the game running.It should be clear that this is by no means a perfect port, but I was able to complete it with only running into some minor problems.Over the near 20hours of playing I experienced a total of 4 crashes, 2 of which where that DP.exe stopped working and 2 frozen screens that had me restart the PC. No framerate drop or other things that stopped me from playing.When I first started the game it would always tell me that DP.exe did not work. The fix for that was to go into the Games folder: Steam/SteamApps/Common/Deadly Premonition The director's cut/redistThere you find the file: PhysX_SystemSoftware.msiRight click Repair stopped the DP.exe from crashing and let me play the game. The error might occur again after some time when trying to start the game, so you might have to do this from time to time again when starting the game.Apart from 2 times the error did not occur while actually playing the game.I played the game under Windows 8.If you bought the game a while ago and where unable to play it, maybe now is the time that it finally works.Apart from these difficulties I really enjoyed the game. The negative sites are the boring and repeatitive combat and some very annoying quick-time-events (especially when playing on keyboard).For me the story, atmosphere and gerneral experience where worth getting through this. Therefore I recommend this game.			"

												On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this ""Director's Cut"" had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.			"

												This port is absolutely miserable, and frankly I could have lived without ever getting to experience Deadly Premonition if it also meant never having to experience a port this bad.I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?Rising Star ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to make it to retail, and they should be even more ashamed that they have still yet to make any effort to fix it. Absolutely shameful.			"

Yes the graphics are bad and the game controls pretty poorly, but if you can make it past those things, you have an unforgettable cast of characters and amazing plot to keep you playing into the wee hours of the night.  I recommend that everyone try this game for at least two hours.  If the graphics are too bad for you, grab the dpfix which is listed in the forums.  I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.			"

												This is going to sound cliche but this is just a video game re-make of Twin Peaks. Thats not a bad thing since Im a huge fan of the series and its great to play as an Agent Dale Cooper-like hero. The game has the perfect balance between horror and action to recreate one of the best TV shows without aknowlding that it was its insperation. However the controle set up and driving really needed some work, but overall this is a good horror game.			"

												This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice.That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.			"

												This port is absolutely miserable, and frankly I could have lived without ever getting to experience Deadly Premonition if it also meant never having to experience a port this bad.I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?Rising Star ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to make it to retail, and they should be even more ashamed that they have still yet to make any effort to fix it. Absolutely shameful.			"

												I just wanted to give a heads up about the current situation of the game. In other reviews I read about problems with the game that I did not encounter when playing the game over the last weeks. It might have been patched or maybe there is new information on how to get the game running.It should be clear that this is by no means a perfect port, but I was able to complete it with only running into some minor problems.Over the near 20hours of playing I experienced a total of 4 crashes, 2 of which where that DP.exe stopped working and 2 frozen screens that had me restart the PC. No framerate drop or other things that stopped me from playing.When I first started the game it would always tell me that DP.exe did not work. The fix for that was to go into the Games folder: Steam/SteamApps/Common/Deadly Premonition The director's cut/redistThere you find the file: PhysX_SystemSoftware.msiRight click Repair stopped the DP.exe from crashing and let me play the game. The error might occur again after some time when trying to start the game, so you might have to do this from time to time again when starting the game.Apart from 2 times the error did not occur while actually playing the game.I played the game under Windows 8.If you bought the game a while ago and where unable to play it, maybe now is the time that it finally works.Apart from these difficulties I really enjoyed the game. The negative sites are the boring and repeatitive combat and some very annoying quick-time-events (especially when playing on keyboard).For me the story, atmosphere and gerneral experience where worth getting through this. Therefore I recommend this game.			"

												Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldn’t miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and it’s up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the town’s biggest case yet.Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where “an ingenious law school student♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over 800 victims” to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think you’ve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, it’s also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however it’s worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.When you’re not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, you’ll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesn’t get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While you’re shooting enemies you may encounter the “Raincoat Killer” who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesn’t find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.I think I should also mention the graphics; they won’t impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole “so bad it’s good” tactic perfectly.It’s nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, it’s like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.However I think it’s now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you don’t have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.If you’re curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: “Deadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. It’s perverse, it’s wrong, and yet it’s so ♥♥♥♥ing funny.”There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.The game is not only so bad it’s good; it’s so bad its borderline perfection!

												Legendary game. Twin Peaks, if interpreted by an unrestricted Japanese developer.It’s a mystery-adventure game, not exactly a horror title. I'd say it shares more with Shenmue than Silent Hill. The cast of the game and their interactions provide for some of the most memorable game moments. Unfortunately gameplay, in terms of combat, lacks polish and will be considered abysmal by some. If you want something different, a game that provides something far from Ubisoft's triple-a game dispenser products, give this one a shot. (The definitive version is the Xbox 360 version)My favorite game of all time. My comfy game.			"

												Warning! This game is nearly unplayable on PC. There are random crashes, freezez, framerate slowdowns over time due to memory leak, locked resolution and a lot of bugs. Even with the DPfix the game performs poorly and is a chore to get running. That being said the game itself is a wonderful detective story with well built characters. The script, voice acting and direction of the game is so well done and at the same time so strange and out of this world you'll simply love it.Other than that the gameplay is sub par, the quick time events tedious and the graphics look really bad especially considering that this game came out in 2013. Music can get a bit boring as there are just a handful of tracks you'll keep hearing over and over again and the audio effects aren't very special.Personally I think they should just remake this game on another more powerful engine so that it can shine. It is well worth the pain of constantly restarting the game and running with various compatibility options and admin priviledges to go thru the story but I wish I didn't have to.  "

The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much.You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.			"

												This is my 2nd favorite game. My first game is Zombies Ate My Neighbors for thr SNES. Im hard to impress with any game past the early 2000's so that says something. Yea, I'm basically a retro hipster♥♥♥♥♥or whatever they're called.Edit: I do recommend this game and I ask that people please upvote this so others can see what issues there are. I don't care about uprates on steam or whatever it's called. I don't even understand why people say +rep. I just don't want someone to buy this and then have the same issues I'm having as well as the rest of the players who own this. You can see all the issues just by visiting the community hub and seeing all of the people who have this and other issues. Also the issue I'm about to explain has never happened to me until a week or so ago and I've owned the game since October of 2014 I believe. Seriously view the community hub or read whats below this long boring explanation so you can see what you'll be getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game.P.S. I bought it on sale for $4.99 so I don't feel like an idiot for buying a game that's buggy as fk compared to paying $24.99 for it which it isn't worth IMO because of all the issues.I cannot get this game to run whatsoever anymore. Whenever I click play it immediately says ""dp.exe has stopped working"" and 1 second or less after that is switches from trying to find the solution to ""close/cancel"". I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified the integrity of the game cache, I have even watched several youtube videos watching people fix it by clicking on properties - local files - browse local files and then only to see that for some reason no matter how many times I reinstall the game I am missing 3 files inside the local files where you can find the .exe to launch the game aka the binaries folder basically. I ended up downloading dpfix 0.9.5 but that didn't help at all. After downloading the dpfix 0.9.5 I have all the files and tried to start the game. Crashed same as before. I followed the video showing me what to do with the files that I now have. Crashed again the same as before. I've been told that downgrading my nvidia drivers or graphics or whatever it is by 5 updates or so might help but I haven't tried that yet because I just don't feel like doing that atm. I've done several other things but they've slipped my mind atm. If I remember them I will come back and add them.Link to one of the youtube videos I watched -

More deserving of the title 'Game of the Year' than any single game ever. Better than Ocarina of Time. Better than Fallout. Better than Grand Theft Auto. The true Famitsu would've given this game 280 out of 40.Let me explain my scores up there some more. The graphics look like they belong to a game from the middle of the PS2 era, the controls are horrific. The music is amazing, but most of what makes it amazing is the timing of it. Sitting down around a table somber just after someone died? Bring on the whistling! But what truly makes this game shine, is the story and the characters. Every single character is interesting and lovable, though not always to the same person - for example I hate Raging Bull Jack, but I'm quite sure someone out there thinks Jack is hilarious.For $24.99, this is one game you should not miss out on. So buy it, and get hype for the greatest game ever.OK, Zach?			"

												Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus. So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.			"

												One of the most enjoyable games i've every played. A little clunkly, but the whole thing is written with a lot of heart which is something you don't see enough of.  Technically a horror game i guess, but overall has a really nice laid-back atmosphere which isn't something you might expect from this sorta game. Comparisons to Twin Peaks and Resident Evil are inevitable, but it has a real unique flavor of its own which is where the game really shines.(plus this game seems to go on sale often for just a few dollars so it's a great cheap buy if want to wait)			"

												Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game ""good"" or ""bad."" It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.			"

												I spent hours trying to get this game running on my pc.  I got pretty desperate, going so far as to actually attempt coding the GOG version I bought after failing with the Steam version.  Yes...I AM an idiot.  I see some people have claimed to get the game running albeit with glitches and crashes.  More power to them.  It's not like this port ISN'T notorious afterall.  But I can't in good conscience say anybody should risk buying this game on the gamble it MIGHT work or not.  I've been called a ""whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" for stating that Rising Star games should be ashamed of themselves for knowingly releasing the game in this broken state and dumbly expecting to patch it up later, only to come back with the pathetic excuse that since the game didn't sell well enough, the developers weren't going to patch it anymore.  A very brittle excuse.  One particular person went so far as to defend the practice saying ""HOW THE HELL CAN THEY PATCH IT IF THE GAME DOESN'T SELL?""  First of all, that's not my problem.  It's not the consumer's job to help fund the repair of faulty products.  Secondly, it probably didn't sell well due to the rampant complaints of glitches, crashing, and overall poor work on the port.  Finally, (and this probably should have been continued from my first point, oh well) are video games sales not a business?  Is there not supposed to be an inherent trust between company and consumer?  If I buy a new car, and it immediately breaks down the very day I take it home; is it acceptable for the dealership to say ""Sorry we haven't made enough profits in car sales this year, we're not going to fix or replace that brand new car we just sold you.""?  If somebody goes to a burger joint and order the Triple Colostomizer with extra Victim Sauce, but are then served an Unhappy Meal with a cold burger that has a bite taken out of it with some floor sweeping compound (MST3K REFERENCE!); does one simply allow the manager to say ""We haven't sold enough burgers this year, you're not getting a refund.""  The answer to all those examples SHOULD (hopefully) be NO.  Bottomline:  Other industries don't get away with selling defective merchandise, why should the video game industry be any different?Anyway, there's my angry rant on the topic.  This game really put me in a ♥♥♥♥♥y mood.  So...yeah...just don't buy it.  Just stay away from it.  It's a bad value.			"

												I played through this game on the Xbox 360 years ago, the play time listed for this version doesn't reflect that.  Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.When Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls.  Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.For everything this game seems to get passable or ""middling"", there's something that makes you smile.  Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it.  You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.Fans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players.  I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks.  There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series.  The protagonist loves his coffee.  The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.  This was one of my favorite games of 2010.  If it's on sale I strongly recommend giving it a try. "

												Game is very very... well  it is INSANELY buggy. You will spend a lot of time fixing it. BUT intro will pay you off. Soundtrack is marvelous. Read sticked thread in community hub to find fixes and mods improving resolution and framerate. Now I got 60fps all time.It is worth to buy it even only for this soundtrack.About plot:You are working for FBI and they pay you salary. And they also pay you extra for eating, shaving etc.They paid me 14 $ extra for shaving my face. I spend most time drinking in bar, flirting with cute Sheriff deputy, talking with my imaginary friend drinking coffee in hotel, sleeping, driving car like maniac (I already crashed my Ford Mustang) and smoking 20 cigarettes per hour.Ah I almost forgot, there is some serial killer in town and some zombies.

												Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus. So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.			"

												Imho you shouldn´t buy it. Why? not because the game, i really like it and i think is different from everything else but because the ""devs"" and publisher. They released a lazy port with 0 effort and they dont care about it anymore, they needed 2 months to release a patch that fixed just one bug, added support for gamepads (still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to play with) and added an unskippeable video every time you start the game. There´s a ton of bugs in the game and they just dont give a ♥♥♥♥. Besides they already said there´s no further support for the game so we are on our own.Game crashes every 2 hours with durante´s fix, car physics are horrible, some videos are impossible to watch, visual bugs, etc... I'm tired of lazy ports by a team expecting modders to fix their stuff for free, with 0 effort by the port team. If that´s the case, i would gladly pay 20 bucks to durante and 0 to the publisher, because they did nothing but take my money for a game i would have played using an emulator.I have to say it, this is by far the worst port i´ve ever seen. Even MG2 with that awful keyboard only controls or Dark Souls without durante´s fix are better than this.			"

												I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't.This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually ""works"" there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is ""improved"" version. Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this...Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw.Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)!My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best.This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5€ when it was on sale!			"

												This product should not be sold on Steam.   Granted, there are some people who successfully installed and ran and even played it, BUT there are many many  others, myself included, who have tried and failed multiple times to play it.Generally, I usually chuckle at people who have problems installing a game but this time the joke is on me.   I tried three different PCs, nothing funky in the hardware and OS of any of them (all Win 7 64bit).  Long story short, I did manage to run the game.   My gameplay (after actually entering the game) consisted of one interaction before the game crashed.   Repeated attempts came to the same conclusion:  it seemed that any interaction caused the game to crash.There are a number of so-called fixes, none of which worked.  An amusing one requires you to run the PhysX driver over again, first to uninstall and then to reinstall.  This actually works, sorta.    It allowed me to get behind an instant crash and get the game running.  But as noted above, the game would crash soon thereafter.   If you get DP as part of a cheap bundle, go for it and roll the dice, but don't pay even a Steam holiday sale price for this product.			"

												Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks.  Sounds freaking AWESOME, don't it?  But let's take a closer look...   Your character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head.  This would be a fascinating enough idea...except that he does it RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, and no one flinches an inch.  He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom...in fact, one of the main, recurring ""side-quests"" of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee.  And when he finds a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded ""The Pickles"" on the label, not bizarrely at all I'm sure you'll agree), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay.  WEIRD, maybe...there is weirdness aplenty...but the spookiness is a little more on the sparing side.  At least as far in as I have played this game.  Maybe I'll try and play it again some other time, but for now I need a break 'cause, quite frankly, MY ♥♥♥♥ING HEAD HURTS.  Sincerely.   Here's some of the other madness you'll encounter, should you be brave enough.  There's wooden crates, in various public places.  You can ""push"" them.  But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, like in, say, the early Resident Evil games, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash.  Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel where no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish.  To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to try this theory out).  There's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror.  Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring thematic of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself/his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever).  I mean, c'mon...I love The Deadly Spawn from 1983 as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm supposed to be driving to a police station to find out some information about a murder victim.  Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your ""tiredness"" meter, of course...there's a hunger one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and, er, lollypops and crap like that as well).  Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - ""come back tomorrow"" - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms  and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and find some pistol ammo in it.  As you do.  Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, and if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that ""This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation"".  I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare murder case...   What...you're STILL reading this review?  Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function?  Ah, look...seriously...I'm done.  I don't even want to think about this any more.  Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE.  I wanted this game to be good.  It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...   Oh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.  And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me.  I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night.  I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS.  I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep.  I can't take it any more.  I'm sorry.  I just can't...I just can't...Verdict: 4/10.			"

												Recipe:3 Parts mediocre Twin Peaks rip off (that's high praise for a Twin Peaks rip off, most don't even qualify as mediocre)1 Part Silent HillA pinch of Resident Evil 4 (NO, NO, YOU GRABBED CHRIS' SECTION FROM RE6 YOU FOOL!!!!!!!)Enough bugs and glitches to make the game almost need to be called Deadly Premonition UnityAnd just a touch of Red Dead Redemption near the endHonestly, I enjoyed 90% of this game, but no game made in 2013 should need to be run in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode if you want to beat the final boss (who, by the way, is so completely out of place from the rest of this game that it's half the reason I'm not recommending it).  I had to spend most of the time in XP Compatibility, but that still crashed occasionally and prevents you from aiming up and down properly which is needed rarely, but when it's needed it's needed.  When it was crashing or aiming was required I switched to 98 which had enough load times that my hair turned grey.  Occassional... dungeons?... are full of QTE which is thankfully only in those specific chase sequemces.  The driving of any car faster than the free cop car involves spinning 360 degrees if you hit a pebble as 90% of vehicles handle like turbo charged bath tubs.  On the other handle, I liked the story and characters.  Once I finished with the atrocious final boss I went back and finished all the side quests to learn more about the citizens of Greenvale (hence my 56+ hours of play).  Of course, a bug involving quest items and replaying missions caused me to have to restart the entire game to get the second last achievement and the last one won't unlock despite patch notes saying the issue was fixed.  If you've got the patience and the weird mind this game aims for, by all means play it.  I just can't recommend it with a clear conscience without warning you first.			"

												After living through the best 42 minutes of my fledging adult life I've come to the realization that I've ecountered the best single experience one can dream of.Within this nearly 3/4 of an hour of bliss I've witnessed grotesque horrors beyond my mind's capabilities, dialogue AND monologue worthy competing of Shakespeare's best soliloquys. The life like animation engaged me on not only an emotional level but that of a spiritual one as well. The picturesque enviroment had me on the verge of tears in terms of sheer beauty; the amount of love the developers put into making every drop of water in the lakes and every leaf on the trees shows their commitment to the art that is VIDEO GAMES. The subtle yet numerous pop culture references to movies and films also shows how up to date and hip this studio is. The sound quality and level of fidelity to it is in of itself amazing, the character's voice actors really engage each other with passion for the roles they play. In short this game is the Citizen Kane of Schindler's Lists' and is truly deserving of being called art. if it was any more perfect I'd need to check myself for testicular cancer. I can't enjoy anything else now, this was the top and it'll be downhill from here on out.9/11 it was an inside job worth making.			"

												The game works fine for me following these instructions from the forums:1 - Go to your DP game directory: right click on the game in your Steam Library - properties - Local Files - Browse local files2 - Launch the ""PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi"" file in the ""redist"" directory and execute the Uninstall process3 - Re-launch the ""PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi"" to install it.4 - Now launch the ""PDLauncher.exe"" as Administrator.As for the game itself, the gameplay seems smooth though not entirely intuitive.  I tried playing with both the controller and the keyboard/mouse, and definitely recommend the keyboard/mouse.  The story seems fleshed out so far, but I will review all this later after I get more hours into the game.  I just wanted to put the game fix into a review fairly quickly since the game is available for a sizeable discount right now:  $2.49			"

												This game seems so promising. I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.These Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously  flawed in the PC market.Even the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize.The old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.Most of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market. You adapt, or fall behind.			"

												This game is likely one of my favorites that I have played within the last couple of years. There are many flaws in the game engine which vary from person to person, but the game was good enough for me to want to push past them. Once I got into the game a bit, terrible things like frame-rate drops stopped happening, and the main bugs were just the physics engine.As a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.Onto the game elements...+ Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.+ The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.+ The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).- The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting ""monsters"" was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.I still think that the game altogether was great, just getting past the glitches took a while. If you are looking for an off-the-wall, but really interesting, action/drama game, just look into this one.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a very mixed bag. If you enjoy a good narrative, like I do, this game certainly delivers. The story is very reminiscent of Twin Peaks, but not so much that it seems unoriginal. The narrative is engaging, and the voice acting is good, but the graphics do sometimes create unwanted comedy. The graphics are strong PS2 quality, so they are perfectly acceptable. The real problems with this game arise from the mechanics. While the mechanics on foot are similar to the mechanics used in Resident Evil, and Silent Hill games, the driving mechanics can make the game a chore to play. While there are some nice immersive elements in the cars, like wipers, the driving can get very irritating due to the floaty controls. The cars feel like they have no mass, and fly across the road very easily, with the exception of the police cruiser which has the best controls out of all the vehicles I have tested, and in case of collision the cars stop with no momentum.           Deadly premonition delivers a great story with good voice acting, and it clocked in at 16 hours on my first playthrough on the ps3. If you can deal with the shortcomings of the mechanics, I heartily recommend this game for all fans of mystery and horror.			"

												If you take the characters, setting, and 90% of the story of Twin Peaks and mix it with Silent Hill-style controls and gameplay, this would be the result. I had a friend who described it as ""Japan trying to make an American game"", and he is absolutely right. The voice acting is wonderfully bad and rarely matches the animation (which is a trip in itself), the story is very convoluted, messy, and each NPC seems to have an entire detailed backstory (not necessarily a bad thing), the color pallet flips from blood-and-rust to pastel-everything, controls are clunky and tasks like shooting or driving become a chore, and this game holds the record for the most inappropriate use of ""Amazing Grace"" in history.If so much is wrong with it, why do I love this game so much? Deadly Premonition is an EXPERIENCE. Its shortcomings make it all the more charming. The poorly-timed voice acting results in random one-liners that should not be funny. The story, while almost too big for one game, is rather enjoyable and the character's timelines intersect in interesting ways. Plus, nothing beats charging headfirst through hospital hallway doors because it's quicker than opening them normally.As much as I can try, Deadly Premonition is too much to describe in one review. You're either going to love it or hate it. There is no in-between.			"

The only problem is that the port is terrible but if you ok to deal with it. You will not regret it at all... the story will make you play all the way to the end.			"

												Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.

												I was excited to dive straight into what I've heard is a cult-classic with a strange, but entertaining storyline and fantastic characters. But unfortunately for me, I could not get the game to run without incredible lag, like many others have experienced. After tinkering around for a fix, it now just crashes at startup. Your chances of getting this game to work for you on PC seem to be 50/50. You'll have to decide whether it's worth the gamble.I am hoping the devs eventually get back to this with some bug fixes, but it's not looking good. As it stands, I can't recommend what looks like an otherwise great game.			"

												Deadly premonition is a game that emphasizes in the narrative.  It has a quirky but nice story, moving quickly from serious moments to joking ones in seconds.  It relies in a lot of cut scenes giving a feeling of playing a series like Twin peaks or anything related to that. It uses supernatural events in the story telling, not trying to be 100% real.Gameplay:The game is mostly a sandbox where you can do side missions and follow people in their normal lives.  You may drive cars, eat and sleep.Establishments and people work at determined hours.  Trying to get at a bar at the morning will be of no use neither going to the store at midnight.  All the missions are for research purposes and they are linear.  When in a mission at a place there are usually spirits/ghosts that roam around.  It somewhat reminded me of Silent Hill. The villain usually haunts those places too and there are sequences hiding, running and QTE.Shooting is inspired in resident evil, where you stay in the same place shooting but this one is strange to handle with K+M. Melee items will break according to use but for combat they serve almost no purpose.  If you are looking for a shooter/combat game this is not the place.Item management is very bad; you cannot change items from the box to the inventory.  Dropping items will simply disappear. You cannot sell items, only buy.  Almost any action you do grants you money such as shaving, saving, driving long distances.Time to finish: 24 hoursAround 15 in game playtimeTechnical aspect:The game has a lot of bugs. A really bad port.  You will need to use guides in order to fix the bug but I will simply mention the ones I faced. For a general guide visit http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_CutFirst, the game failed to run. I needed the game to be Run as Administrator, add some files to the directories for mods and SweetFX in order to fix contrast.  Driving a lot of time in the open (20 minutes I think) causes the game to crash, this is before the next bug; in a mission it failed and the game crashed, finding a guide led me to use CFF explorer and incremented the memory.  Now it does not crash.Support for controllers any than xbox 360 is nonexistent.  Using x360ce is somewhat tricky but I could not get it to work so I simply used K+M.Graphics are kinda bad (this game is from 2010 originally) and it was a budget game ($20 dlls on release).  They look like the first games for the 7th generation (xbox 360, ps3) or late 6th generation (GCN, ps2), whatever you prefer.  expressions for the characters are rendered manually and no motion capture was used.  Veredict:3.6/5Play t if you are willing to play for the story mor than the combat sequences,			"

												I'm not going to totally recommend this game, but here is what I can say.The game is an open world game set in a city in campain. You are an FBI agent sent there to solve a murder mistery who happened in that city.The game has a vey nice story, a murder mistery with some fantastic element, since you will mostly fight zombies like enemies born from the mind of the main character.I can assure you that you will surely play this just for the sake of knowing who the culprit is, but here is some flaw in the gameplayThe game is too easy.Enemies are always the same slow walking ""zombies"" who takes one or two hits to the head to kill. There is really no challenge at all and the only way to really game over is by either failing some quick-time event or by getting killed by getting hit on purpose. Same thing for the bosses, whose almost every attack can be avoided by quicktime events. Moreover, your weapons are all over powered, from the basic pistol whith infinite ammos to the magnum whose hits can really one shot enemies. why does this game even has melee weapons, don't ask me.All of this makes the game really boring and doing the secondary missions, which are a lot, becomes something one does just for the achievements.As if that is not enough the game has some technical flaws with the startup but, at least for me, where not that much of a problem since there are guides on steam who can help with these kind of problems and some random crashes.On the positive side we have the story, I really enjoyed following it all always wanting to know more about it and every murder so particular. But what wins the oscar for me is the main character, who suffers from double personality, with a know-it-all behaviour, we really see him change during the game, and the voice act really fits him.In conclusion I recommend this game only if you like good plots like I do. If you hope for something more FPS like, forget this. If this was a visual novel or a Telltale like game it would have probably been a better purchase. Definetly not to buy at full price and If I should give an objective rate, I would give a 6.5 / 10, although I still enjoyed playing this			"

												Now before I say that this game is fantastic here's a fair warning and a bit of advice. This game is filled with a ton of issues similar to Dark Souls, it may not have GFWL but instead you must run it on Windows 98 if you don't want it crashing on you all the time. There is a Dark Souls patch as well from the same guy for this game. Now even with all of its issues this is the definitive version to play due to the poor framerates the PS3 version of Director's Cut receives.Imagine that old David Lynch classic Twin Peaks was made in to a game, sure there's Alan Wake with all of its homages but what if it was a full blown video game. This is exactly what that game would be, it may be from a Japanese perspective but it's all there. The mysteries, the drama, the characters, the large open world in a small countryside town. What it lacks in graphics and gameplay it makes up for with charm. All the characters have their quirks and the world feels alive. You can spend plenty of time in the world without participating in the crime. This is a game made for fans of Twin Peaks. It's still possible to enjoy without watching the show but you might not be able to fully appreciate this beauty and it may be very difficult to get in to. I would recommend this to any fan who just want to relax in this fantastic simulator.			"

That's a far as I could stomach the cons above before quitting and uninstalling.* Game only cost $0.05 in my humble bundle purchase (all other funds went to other games in bundle).			"

												Filled with a patent strangeness not unlike that of Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition provides an incredibly memorable cast of characters and an excellent story that will keep you guessing until the end. The game is thrilling, suspenseful, intense, cheesy, and ridiculous, with the right balance of each. It has relatively low production values, but it's almost endearing, feeling akin to cult B movies. This game has solidified itself as one of my favourites. I have no doubt I will come back and play this game again many times in the years to come, reliving the story and getting to know the citizens of Greenvale all over again. Right, Zach?A quick disclaimer: This game is a relatively poorly done console port, so at the time of writing, there are some technical issues. I found the experience was greatly enhanced by using DPFix and JoyToKey to play with a controller with better looking visuals. Crashes were rare for me, and I was able to play the game without too many problems, but some others have had trouble running the game. The developers have expressed intent to fix these issues, though, so we will hopefully see an improvement soon.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a game unlike any other that has came out in recent years. The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”. These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.Continued...			"

												Let's get the negative critique out of the way: The PC-port is horrendous. The game is stuck on 720p quality, crashes randomly, save files get corrupted and characters and objects clip out. The open world environment enables you to drive freely in a somewhat vast environment, but the driving mechanism is so stiff and unrewarding you don't feel like going exploring just for the fun of it (Run out of gas in the middle of nowhere? Tough luck!).Though most negative feelings I have towards the game can be blamed on the bad PC-port, some are simply due to bad game design. The map system is hard to navigate, as you can't zoom further back on the full world map that you have in your pause menu. Some sidemissions give no clue as to what you're supposed to do. Shooting/melee action is hard to coordinate right and at times feels very repetetive, but the action sequences do manage to bring a lot of good tension to the otherwise puzzle-heavy gameplay.Though PC edition Deadly Premonition is a somewhat painful experience due to the recurring random crashes and bugs, it's also one the most captivating games I've ever played. Somehow, unexplainably, the game manages to turn many of it's cons into atmospheric pros.  Bad dubs and badly written over-the-top characters somehow add to the odd atmosphere. The characters feel fake and fairytale like, but in a good way. It seems the game's soundtrack has about three songs that play over and over again, sometimes at very inappropriate times. The monotonous soundtrack does however bring a certain Pavlov-element to the game. When you hear the ""evil is lurking"" music you learn to be on your guard - even if visible evil is not present.The game owes a lot to the TV-series Twin Peaks; Eccentric FBI agent and the unexplained person he talks his mind to, murder of a young but troubled prom queen in a small, secretive town, ½ of which is owned by the owner of a lumbermill... The similarities don't end there. Though similar to the tv show, the game's story still stands well on it's on. It's weird and first sort of alienating, but as you progress in the game you find yourself restarting the game crash after crash, just so you could get on with the story. The terribly dubbed and stiffly animated characters that don't really make any sense pull you surprisingly deep in to Greenvale - and that's why I return to the game time after time.I would recommend Deadly Premonition to anyone with a  lot of patience and a taste for strange story telling and quirky humor.

Yet, combine quirky characters, super natual elements, funny dialogue, coffee and there's an immensely enjoyable experience to be found. The games weakest areas have been revamped. Pot coherence, controls, better graphics and more suits are all key steps up from the 360 original cult classic. Smell the steam rising from your suspiscious coffee on this welcoming PC port.			"

												Chuncky controls, bad voice acting, robotic animation, and poor graphics that makes this game less enjoyable.The worse part of the game is the weird background music that destroys the immersion of the game. Just imagine that a happy and joyful music that makes you feels like you're playing arcade games with the scary moments in the game, which makes the scares of the game feels nothing.The game suffers from poor optimization with makes the game running at 40+fps with i7 processor,  GTX 960M mobile Nvidia GPU with 12GB of RAM. Sometimes it even drop to 20 fps.I didn't even know who's Zach is. The male protagonist in this game makes me feel that he's some kind psychopath "

												Great game bad port. so as things are at the moment ( where i can't even play the port ) i wouldn't recommend anyone to have a try with it. But hopefully it will get the fixes it needs. and when it does, this game is clearly worth the price.			"

												There's a fine line between genius and madness, isn't that right Zach?This is one of the most bizarre games I've played, if you're tired of predictable plot twists and flat characters this game will certainly prove refreshing. Part murder mystery and part survival horror, there's rarely a dull moment and some unusual enemy design and stealth mechanics make the combat sections feel distinct from other 3rd person shooters. The game however, is not without its faults.I played this title with a keyboard and mouse and the controls feel muddy at best, the sensitivity settings at the lower end make no apparent difference and the controls feel unwieldy. I'm unsure whether it's caused by aim assist or some form of mouse acceleration, but the shooting sections often feel more like a game of wrangle the cursor rather than precision gunplay and whilst this does create some tense moments, it is at best frustrating and at worst infuriating. If this was a conscious design decision it is in my opinion a misplaced one and together with a downright abuse of quick time events a certain degree of patience is required.If this is puts you off the title, that's a pity because the story is more than compelling enough to keep you playing and the town of Greenvale and it's residence are well realised. If you are willing to put up with its flaws deadly premonition has a lot to offer and is wholly deserving of the praise it's received. It's a title that lacks polish but certainly not character, and is well worth considering.  "

												I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is.  No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually.  Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues.  The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch.  This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently.  If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play.  I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene.  This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again.  Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying.  I think the story is very intriguing.  The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm.  I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand.  I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.			"

												This game seemed like a lot of fun and from what I was able to play, it was fun. But you simply cannot play the PC version of this game at all because of just how broken it is. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC, even if its on sale for $0.99! Get the console version and play it that way.The problem isn't that the game is not fun, its that its so broken you cannot play it unless you somehow got lucky and avoided the bugs. You have to go out and find a ton of fixes to get it to run, jumping through many hoops and reading a ton of instructions and forum posts in the hopes that your specific issue can be resolved. Normally, ports to the PC can have those problems, but in this case its so bad that even after all the fixes, the game still manages to be broken. Freezes, black screens, CTD, all of these things can occur at any time even after the fixes. Not to mention, this port does not support higher screen resolutions and has a ton of framerate issues. Good luck playing this game. The worst part is that I can't even rate this game for its game play or visuals due to how broken it really is.Again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC! If you want to play the game, simply buy it on PS3/XBOX360 or get an emulator and play it that way as that is literally the only way this game will ever be played. Rising Star Games should take responsibility and fix their PC port for this game so that we don't have all these problems that require a ton of community fixes just to play part of the game and it still doesn't work. However, that is highly unlikely since Rising Star Games has refused to do anything to address the issues with their game since it was released on Steam and will most likely not fix it. This is a bad port, stay away and do not give them money for not doing their due diligence on porting a game.			"

												This is probably my favourite game ever. This is also the worst port I have ever played. For a few hours, I thought I was safe from the horrors of the port. I followed recommended fixes, ran it in compatability mode and the like, but it randomly - in full screen mode - being windowed with the rest of the screen black. Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen. I paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it. It really is unplayable. Treat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.Anyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever. Having ran through the game the first playthrough, I'm doing all of the sidequests this time. It is a wonderful, quirky, interesting, strange game. Get it on console and enjoy.			"

												Definitely recommend this game! Its a remnant of the golden era of games IMO from 1997-early 00's. The setting and atmosphere is beautiful and the musical score is pretty good as well! I've played a few hours and I am already hooked. Its a true gem, must have game. I have not experienced any glitches or bugs as posted in earlier posts maybe they already have been fixed. At first I could not get the game  to start until I read in a post here on steam to go into the game folder and into the ""redist"" folder from there look for ""PhysX_SystemSoftware"" file, double click on it and pick the ""repair"" option. This will make it playable. The graphics are superb for its age and the music is amazing, combined with the detailed setting, set the mood just right for the interesting storyline.			"

There's a major issue with the game that prevents it from even launching 90% of the time and the game is stuck in a windowed view with no way to change it. There aren't even any graphical settings that you can change.That aside, the game is still enjoyable. It's one of those gems that's so bad it's good.Also, here's a link to a mod that lets you change the graphical settings, window view bs, and fix most if not all launch failure issues: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 "

												Deadly Premonition Director's Cut is one of the best gaming experience I had in the last few years. It's a fantastic and a horrible game at the same time. It's horrible, because it has maybe the worst game designs here and there, ugly graphics, budget animations, and very bad physics and controls. But it's fantastic at the very same time, because the brilliant story, the memorable characters and everything else is able to make you forget all these problems anytime. And presumably this is the reason why it became a cult classic and a game of the year in 2010. The main character, F.B.I. Agent Francis York Morgan (And of course, Zach) is easily the most memorable game character ever was made, so as the Naomi Watts look-a-like, Sheriff Deputy Emily ""I love to cook, but I can't"" Wyatt, and all the other characters, be it secondary or even tertiary characters. It is a highly recommended game.			"

												I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer. I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.			"

												I'm a weird individual and this is a weird game. So the two of us got on like a house on fire. Due to the low budget, the gameplay mechanics, graphic and sound aren't all that refined. Despite all that this game has charm and a lot of it. Its twin peak setting is pretty unique and there is lots to do in this open world survival horror. In fact this is the first true open world survival horror game I can think of (Silent Hill doesn't count). Despite the simple gameplay mechanics it does play like resident evil 4  with its over the shoulder gunplay. While the controls really need sorting out, the game is still fun to play. However while the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have a few glitches, this PC port has lots. There is nothing game breaking but you will find a lot of missing textures, frame rate problem and sometimes mechanical problems like the controller not being responsive. This is best played with mouse and keyboard because the controller controls are clunky and are pretty much broken for the most part. Despite all its flaws I had a hell of a time playing this. There is a reason why I have bought this on every platform and that reason is because of its originality. Swery65 is basically suda 51 and Hideo kojima as one. He has a vision that only Suda 51 can understand and he has the ambition of Hideo Kojima. He is pretty much the perfect developer and D4 looks like it will kick the walking dead's♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hope the will be a sequel or a prequel so that I can witness this experience again.			"

												Probably the best game i have ever played in my life, or TOP 3 material. This game is something superb, i fell tottaly in love with it. It did have great music, story, characters...WOW. On the other hand, the technical aspect of the game is really TERRIBLE, and i am not talking about minor problems, it is really badly done, really. I was lauhing at it first, but my friend really pushed me to play it, and now, after finishing it, i can say, that that was one of the best things i ever played, if not the best. (and i played Fallout, Planescape torment and almost all legends made). This game just was really special.			"

												Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece. Supports Window Mode.Has controller compatibility.Changeable Graphic resolution.			"

												Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.			"

												This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XDThe graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.The controls are not that great.And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)			"

This game is more campy then scary.  For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.A few hardware issues:#Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 & 7.1 surround is a no-no)#Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is       resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all.  This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.)#Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky.  The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing.  There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.			"

This is a pretty poor port. In the 2 hours or so I put into it, I encountered serious framerate issues and game crashes. While I'd love to finish the game, having to sit through the unskippable intro logos isn't worth it when I'm seeing them so often due to the game crashing.

The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10			"

												I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer. I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.			"

												Pure B-Movie in game form. It is amazing.If you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.As a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means  you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.			"

												This is a game where the villains definitely need a hug Zach.OK, now I've played through the whole game and it's the first game I've 100% completed.I love this game, I didn't want it to end. It's a good game and that comes despite it's inherent jankiness. Lets face it, the graphics are terrible, the combat is repetitive and boring and it crashes far too often. But those aren't what's important in this game. What's important and what makes this a good game is the story, the setting and the characters. York is one of the most interesting game characters I've played. He's a pleasure to get to know as the game peels back layers of his personality and you come to genuinely care for him.The town, Greenvale, feels more alive than many game towns. It's full of personalities that while they may be one note quirks, are interesting and often have a reason or a story behind their quirk. I recommend you do the side quests which uncover these stories. The game makes you care about it's characters and that makes the story have impact. I won't spoil the story because you need to play it yourself.Play this game, there is no other like it and that's the best good thing about it.			"

Strangely, by the end it became a just good game. York is a magnificently engaging character, and all the supporting cast is various levels of endearing. It's wonderful.Be sure to do all the side missions! Just doing the quest is okay but there's a lot of payoff by helping the towns people.			"

												I loved the game, however it keeps crashing after hospital level no matter what I do.I tried various fixes from all around the net, no use.If you can get this game on a console OR you are confident it will work, you should definetly buy it, because it's a hidden gem.HOWEVER, if you are unsure whether to buy it or not, don't risk.

Save everytime you can, dont even think about skipping the booth, just save the game!!!story and characters are very interesting. mixing open world and corridor exploration, this game its rich characters will keep you wanting to play it crash after crash.also you will learn to hate the cars in here.

												At first i was sceptical about getting this game, because of crashes reports and mixed reviews from people, but i gave it a try. After few easy steps i described in guide (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=334500782) i was able to start a game. So don't worry, it runs fine after some easy tweaks!Interesting story, place, characters, and this game made me laugh so many times, not many games can do this! This game is made with love to details, it has it's soul.Absolutely recommended, you'll forget about old graphics in 5 minutes of in-game!10/10			"

												This is probably my favourite game ever. This is also the worst port I have ever played. For a few hours, I thought I was safe from the horrors of the port. I followed recommended fixes, ran it in compatability mode and the like, but it randomly - in full screen mode - being windowed with the rest of the screen black. Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen. I paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it. It really is unplayable. Treat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.Anyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever. Having ran through the game the first playthrough, I'm doing all of the sidequests this time. It is a wonderful, quirky, interesting, strange game. Get it on console and enjoy.			"

For me, with my brand new gaming computer, this game crashes every seven muinets at the most, Making this game unplayable, as many of the save points can be as far as fifteen muinets apart.Buy the 360 or PS3 version.

												Do you want to play a game that feels, plays and tells a story like David Lynch's Twin Peaks? This is it.But like Lynch's cinematography this game will leave you alone confused after it crashes (which it will - several times), so replay that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part again and listen to York's babbling - again.So in simple words: this game is poorly made gameplay or mechanics wise, as well as graphics, sound mixing, just everything. The thing is: it tells you a story with rich but utterly strange characters like in Twin Peaks (or in videogames like Alan Wake's Latern Lady), which keeps you interested and motivates you to get through this nightmare of game. Whatever it throws at you, you will still appreciate this game and its charme. For me it's an classic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arthouse-trash game. I love it. Isn't that right, Zach?			"

The humor is awesome, the characters are original and really know how to make you love them, specially the main character...Ahhh York! <3The soundtrack altough repetitive is pretty cool sometimes, specially the whistling one, i whistled along everytime!In general, if you ignore the sometimes annoying random crashes and the bugs, and you love a good mistery/horror/open world game, this game is perfect for you! 8.5/10 so far! :)			"

												I wanted to like this game, and it has its moments. It is buggy, often crashing to desktop or bluescreening. The gameplay itself is mostly a string of tiresome exercises that lead from one plot point to another. And for a while that was enough. It is kind of fun to see York unravel the mysteries of this town. But after a while, I don't know if its charm just faded, or some of the twists just broke suspension of disbelief or what. By the end, I was just going through on stubbornness.On the bright side, it made me all nostalgic for Twin Peaks, and I picked up the boxed set. "

												This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XDThe graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.The controls are not that great.And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)			"

												I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine. Here's a list as to why it sucks:Crashes oftenPlot is barely explainedPlot holesGraphics are terribleControls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme]Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently)Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?)Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often)Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use)AI is weirdSlow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...)Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways)There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are. Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me! "

This game is more campy then scary.  For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.A few hardware issues:#Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 & 7.1 surround is a no-no)#Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is       resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all.  This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.)#Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky.  The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing.  There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.			"

												It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played.  It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past ""so-bad-it's-good"" into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.

												Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece. Supports Window Mode.Has controller compatibility.Changeable Graphic resolution.			"

												Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.			"

												This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XDThe graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.The controls are not that great.And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)			"

												I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine. Here's a list as to why it sucks:Crashes oftenPlot is barely explainedPlot holesGraphics are terribleControls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme]Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently)Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?)Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often)Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use)AI is weirdSlow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...)Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways)There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are. Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me! "

This game is more campy then scary.  For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.A few hardware issues:#Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 & 7.1 surround is a no-no)#Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is       resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all.  This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.)#Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky.  The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing.  There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.			"

												Deadly Premonition can be best described with the old adage, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". At first glance it’s a clunky RE4 clone with bland combat  that looks more at home in 1999 on the Dreamcast than a modern console or PC. But if you play past the first area you’d start to see what makes the game truly great and why its become such a beloved cult classic, its writing. DP’s cast is a gaggle of lovable goofballs with all their own weird quirks, most prominent of all being the protagonist, York, who loves spending time shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥with his imaginary friend named Zach about John Hughes movies and The Ramones, divining the future through  the morning coffee, or going around town staring into people‘s windows.  It’s no secret that DP is practically Twin Peaks: The Game and it wears it love for that show and all kind of 80‘s pop culture on  its sleeve. The plot is actually rather good too considering and it actually gets pretty damn dark but it somehow all works because the game’s characters are likable enough for you to care. DP is just a game full of enthusiastic charm and it has a creativity that most AAA games lack. If you can look past the dated graphics and  sloggy combat you’ll find an endearing game in all its honest B-movie cheese.Be warned though that this port isn’t all that great, but the same dude that patched Dark Souls is on the case and it looks like with his help this will be the definitive version of the game. So if you’re a bit on the fence wait until that comes out before buying it which shouldn’t be too long.			"

												Twin Peaks gone Silent Hill, as realized by a Japanese dev team on LSD. There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious hodgepodge of a game. The writing is occasionally quite clever and humorous, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story, while full of plot holes, is still interesting enough that it kept me going. And while it's usually easy to guess what happens next in the grand scheme of things, the details are usually completely unexpected. Especially when it comes to dialogue.It's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least bearable and often genuinely decent. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying. Combat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.The freeroam stuff, while novel, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective. Unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors, that is. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing, and you will not enjoy it.Thankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend. These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the player character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.The music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have incredibly ill fitting tunes. Some of it is probably intentional humor, but it's impossible to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely very good. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.Basically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you. Or not. The divisive reputation is certainly well deserved as even though I've spent quite a number of hours in it, it's still hard to recommend the game to anyone that isn't me.			"

												May not work right out the box kind of game. DPFix was a pretty big help when it first came out on steam and continues to fix things so I would recommend getting that. The game itself finally comes with controller support and patched a few bugs which really hindered the game. Interestingly enough this game was tested with windows 98 and if you have serious problems you may want to put it in compatibility for win 98. Probably the weirdest game I have played in a long time. It is a budget game and has its moments of being cheesy and surprisingly good. Mixed on the gameplay aiming is like resident evil 4, hilariously bad driving and annoying qtes. Nothing challenging about the game except maybe getting it work especially when it first came to PC. I enjoyed the game enough where I would probably play it again.			"

												This game is a lot of fun! One day, I will buy it on a console and complete it.There is currently no chance that I will play this all the way through on the PC.All it does is crash.There are numerous help documents to help in making this game more playable for the PC, but I don't think they ever stop. I think we become immune to them at some point, but I have given up reloading this game again, it takes at least a minute to do that on its own.You just have to look at the guide section of this game on Steam to realise that there are some serious issues with this game.My thought is that a game can become immortalised by being released on PC. Thus being playable for years to come. In the case of Deadly Premonition, it is going to need a serious makeover.Maybe it will or does work for you, but you are most likely one in a few who have had success with the PC version of this game.

												It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played.  It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past ""so-bad-it's-good"" into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.

												Here's what I recommend: 1. Buy the game; support the developer2. Don't play it3. Watch all the cutscenes on YoutubeWhile there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next. Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).This gentleman/woman took the time to piece together everything.Youtube link:

												What a port. Theres a german saying ""Verschlimmbessert"" which unfortunately cant be translated. Disimprove?Gave this another try since i finally got me an xbox controller for my pc (keyboard+mouse controls like♥♥♥♥♥ and they switched the controls around and actually made em worse. Great.Then the ""HD"" treatment. Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent. Additionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.The Thumbs up is for Deadly Premonition and that people who never ever plan on buying a Xbox360 ever ever (its cheap now and theres alot of other pretty good games...) have a chance of experiencing it - even in the warped form of this suboptimal port.

												This is a great game, but how can anyone write a positive review of this? This game is a mess. It's terribly ported, but at least that can be fixed with a fan patch. This game crashes all the time, whenever it wants. I was able to play for a hour without crashes. Now it's crashing every 10 minutes. It's unplayable. There is no telling when it's gonna crash, you just gotta get lucky.There is no auto-save or anything and you can only save at select places so unless you want to save every 5 minutes enjoy losing your progress over and over. I'd say this game is worth playing, but on PC? No way.			"

TERRIBLY AWFUL, SURPRISINGLY GOODFirst impression of Deadly Premonition? Awful graphics, weird physics and models and confusing story. After getting past the prologue, however, it all makes sense. Getting into this weird game thinking it's going to be an amazing investigation title with interesting horror elements can get you very disappointed, but if you understand it's actually a parody and can enjoy it for that, then don't hesitate to dive into this bizarre adventure! And I don't really think there's much else to be said, only that if you keep an open mind you're in for a good time.Pros High comic value Interesting characters Plot can get curious after you understand it's not all serious Gameplay can be a little odd at first, but it's really easy to get used to it Plays nicely with a controller Possible to invert both X and Y axes of the camera Despite port issues, it runs smoothly on a medium rig and enhanced with CCCCons Terrible port: Locked at 720p No graphic options Outdated graphics and physics Menus might be confusing at first No real explanation to the hunger and fatigue systems Jokes might not be for everyone / not everyone might understand themA note on the graphics and DPFix: The game would not open with DPFix installed. I don't know if that's because the original (and only copy of the fix I could find on Durante's blog) release of it has also a fix for the controller support (and the current version on Steam has native controller support) or what, but it would simply not work at all. Maybe Durante has to fix this, maybe it's a problem with the current version of the game, but either way making the fix work won't be so easy as others released by Durante.			"

												At first I was really skeptic on the approach of the game, the music didn't seem to fit in some places, the characters were weird, the voice acting was ""eh"" and the combat was easy as hell due to the fact that you have unlimited ammo on your main pistol. Until you get to the point where you start playing other characters then the story changes completely, it was a major twist and interestingly well thought out. The only issue I had for this was that on certain points of the game, it crashes a lot and you need to do a lot of tweaks on compatibility and settings but what kept me playing was knowing the true history about the Raincoat killer.Overall it was weird, quirky, buggy but good.

												I really tried to like this, but simply couldn't.Not long after I finished binge watching Twin Peaks, I felt like the need to revisit the experience and Deadly Premonition seemed like it would be just that. A weird detective game set in a mysterious mountain town filled with quirky characters. Heck, even the female lead looked like Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr?). There were countless reviews stating how terrible the game was, but no amount of bad reviews could've stopped me from buying this game. Man, oh, man were they right. The game's simply unplayable. And not simply because it's a bad port. It's a small game overextended to a massive open world with terrible writing and the worst soundtrack of all time. I played it for less than 2 hours and had heard the whistling theme song at least 10 times, so I tried playing it with the sound muted. Didn't help.I really tried to like this game, but it's not just so weird it's good. It's so weird it's bad and not in a Twin Peaks way.If you're looking for a twin peaks-esque game, try Fahrenheit (also abysmally terrible writing, but atleast I managed to finish it).Sadly, not recommended. Not until I get myself to finish the game.			"

												It's a shame, I wanted to like this game as I enjoyed the limited time I spent with it on the PS3, but it was so laggy I found it unplayable after an hour. I was hoping the PC version would give me a better time because the game looks legitimately fun and unique. The result was even worse the the PS3 version. Sure framerate was more bearable but the 2002-grade graphics should not take me down to 20FPS on a rig that can run much more demanding games such as New Vegas without many issues. Other than framerate I fould an unbearable amount of stuttering, (I don't mean that the game froze, the character was acting like when you get rubberbanded in Battlefield on a bad server). Going to get a refund. This is a great game ruined by the atrocious performance.			"

												The game itself is fun doesn't take itself seriously and offers quite a lengthy campaign, this game has the best main character i have seen for many years in a video game and made me laugh several times, the game is rather strange to describe but i will try if you had silent hill, a cheesy cop show from the 70s and an old gta game then combined them together you would get deadly premonition, The graphics are bad the textures are awful and the controls are clunky but this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game in any way i think this game works because of how bad some of the mechanics are. If you are mad about graphics and smooth mechanics do not buy this game. If you want to play a quirky game with some good humour and a very unique style of gameplay then this is for you. As for the pc port because it is so half baked and doesn't work for me i will say wait for another patch or just skip it on pc you could probably buy the console version for very cheap now which actually works			"

												I have played this game before steam using GOG. Back then I really thought I should try it since everyone was talking about how its one of the best mystery game out there and how funny and cheesy it is. So I downloaded the game  . When I went to start it, it would not start so I modded it and it worked out great with no glitches and no frame drops, but why the hell did I go through the trouble of doing all that? the game it self looks absolutely terrible for a 2010 game, and the shooting and melee mechanics look like butchered resident evil 4 mechanics that should have been fixed  11 YEARS AGO (when re4/biohazard 4 came out). The game trys to be  a fresh new start and try a whole new  genre of mystery and detective work with resident evil mechanics. but the game turned out aweful looking, broken, boring and dull.  Not even minding the bugs, the story itself is decent but not even worth the trouble of fixing the game to play, and the interesting characters are the only thing that basically make the game. People say its good because of the many random encounters that dont make sense and the fresh ideas put into the game but the random encounters are not even funny and makes the game look like crap. If you're gonna play the game stick to console and also if you're looking for a game that focuses on mystery using the atmosphere and the enivronment then do not get this game, its looks like it was put together in a month. People say its one of those game that its so bad its good but I just do not see it. I personally would give the game a 4.5/10 for the characters but for everything else the devs made it look like they didnt even try. TL;DRBuyers beware. Do not even accept this game for free and put your time trying to fix the bugs to play it, its not even worth it. If you want to play it,  play it on Xbox 360 ( I heard the ps3 version is also broken.)			"

												Thumbs down mainly because horrendous port.As a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like.♥♥♥♥♥♥ It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.As a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.The Gold:Really quirky castsWTF is wrong with this music?!The amazing attention to detailsYork's amazing knowledge of old moviesI can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is the dog, but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that fur coat. (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered.  So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so.  Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome.  In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where.  You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business.  If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games.  You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about.  I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.The Unnecessary:Your piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientationClunky combat and driving controlsEnd game railroadingDBZ boss battles and worse dialogueTime for the really♥♥♥♥♥♥parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem...  Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.This is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. ""Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!"" You kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. "":cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111"" ♥♥♥♥. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game. Any boss battle with more than 2 forms is considered obnoxious. Your boss dialogue is contrived, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simply moustache twirling level evil. Where's that button for taunting or ♥♥♥♥♥ slapping my opponent!? Have you dealt with the final boss in Ace Attorney Investigator? Yeah, that really dragged on didn't it? Remember: time crunch, memory leak, game explode? Ugh. I've actually had to skip quite a few vital plot scenes before the boss battles for fear of the game crashing. (and I couldn’t stomach the big bad’s writing anymore) It turned out to be a smart move, because it DID drag on. Why why WHY? You had such a great start...Actual plot spoiler tag, do not click unless you know what you are doing.You know that bit where you become the Raincoat Killer? Looking back, I probably would've enjoyed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that if I wasn't in such a hurry to get to the next save point before the game crash. "

												So somehow this game magically decided to work after hours of trying to get it run, it still crashes here and there but at least I can actually play now.Amazing, amazing game but save yourself the trouble and get it on console, if you can't then go ahead knowing you may not be able to actually play it properly with dozens and problems, bugs and crashes. It ruins the experience of this amazing game. I still think this game shouldnt be allowed on Steam with how broken it is and should be looked at again. Overall, it's not worth going through the trouble of getting this game to work during the early stages of the game, despite how amazing the story and characters are.			"

												Great game, bad port. The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the ""So bad it's good"" type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain. Everything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.The gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.The game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.The game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.The game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this 


YouTube™ Video: Deadly Premonition: Possibly the funniest cutscene in the game 

			Views: 462,621		

			Deadly Premonition is a game full of hilariously awkward moments. This short clip is the perfect example of the type of humor that defines the cutscenes.		

The game isn't for everyone, hell, IGN (US) gave the game 2/10 then the UK side gave it a 7.5. Give it a quick look and see if it grabs your interest. It's a great break from the usual stuff.			"

												Oh man where to start.... What a mess of a game.Its riddled with gamebreaking bugs, youll have to download other stuff to make it work, controls are clunky all around, graphics are dull, the music is attrocious (whistling song) youll get 3/4 skit songs that will play the whole game, so annoying and the monsters are far from scary. The only reason i got this is because it was like 99 cents and everyone praised the story. After trying to play this, i just ended up saying ''♥♥♥♥ this'', but i still wanted to know the follow up to the story. So i went on youtube as other reviewers suggested and watched the whole 5h borefest it was. The more the story advances the more WTF moments pop up, until the end..... oh my what an end.....the kind of end that makes you want to cry because you realize what a waste of time it all was.Save yourself money (even if its 99 cents, its not worth it) Save yourself time (the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways)Enjoy an other game, there is trully nothing here but a borefest filled with a non sensical ♥♥♥♥ up of a story.Not recommended.

												I'm sorry that I recommended this game about a year ago when it was on sale on the humble bundle store for about $1. I thought they had put more effort into the port than they did. But as it turns out it's just yet another bad port. Bad in a way that only japanese studios that regret their decision to take console exclusive deals can do.Got it running by breaking physx for other games on my system that link to it. Only to see that the resolution is hardcoded to 1280x720. I was aware of dpfix. But even though it evidently loads the symbols just fine (as indicated by not segfaulting) it just sits forever eating my cycles. Likely caused by a recent update.There are people on the forums trying to defend these incompetent developers.  They shouldn't. They're only further ruining Steam. Having a quirky game that likes to have a bit of fun despite itself is one thing (and is why I came to want it in the first place) but having a buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥maintained by incompetent developers is another, and believe me they are incompetent.The fact that libs that override d3d9 symbols exist in the first place is evidence of that. As the complexity of the problem goes up so does the complexity of the override libs. But ones like these -though written by undoubtedly competent people- merely provide basic features that the game should have in the first place. Like adding a second step that adjusts resolution based on values given in a config file.Edit: I was able to fix the issue causing the game to just sit there eating cycles and have it running in my native resolution. I'm sure the game will be as fun as I figured it would be but my review above still applies. The short of it is: Don't bother if you're not comfortable having a game that isn't playable right after download from steam. It's going to take a bit to both get it to actually run without segfaulting and get it aesthetically reasonable (meaning native resolution of your monitor and properly saturated environments).Had I known this port was as bad as it was I wouldn't have encouraged developers who do crap like this by giving them money. I suggest you don't make the same mistake.			"

												There isn't anything I could say that hasn't been said. The game is an unabashed throwback to 80's b-movies crossed with anime. Is that not enough? There's enough open world wandering on an indie budget to make Phillip ""fishfingers"" mustachio cry, and enough side questing cityscaping to make Rockstar envious, but all done with a tonge-in-cheek half assedness (yet serious) enthusiasm that drives you up a wall. Why do the squirrels squeal like monkeys? Is agent York insane? One of the boss fights is against a crossdresser in a clock tower, and another is against an obese man who swings from the rafters. Then Amazing Grace plays as background music. You can't create this in a factory, it surely must be curated at some level? And the story wasn't bad! I wouldn't want every game I play to be like this, but once in a while, well heck, this is pretty fun. It is a great game to play with friends, watching and commenting like MST3K. The steam broadcasting feature was really nice.			"

												I really wanted to play this game, after having watched a full LP of it. It really seems like a unique experience, despite its many many many apparent flaws. However, after an hour or two of launching, tweaking, relaunching, browsing numerous forum threads, and generally throwing everythign I can think of at this thing, I CANNOT get it to function properly, be it running with a decent framerate or even properly recognizing my controller's analog sticks and d-pad (standard 360 pad). Even after trying every downloadable fix, and recommendation, I have not been able to play any of this game, so I obviously can only recommend you stay far far away from this particular version. If you want to check it out, get it on PS3 or 360. The devs deserve none of your money for this non-functional port.			"

												I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.			"

												Let's get the biggest negatives out of the way.Buggy.Gameplay reminiscent of old resident evil games - may be good or bad depending on your perspective.Locked resolution (there's a mod), dated graphics (dem textures).If you don't enjoy hours of exploration, you will essentially need a guide to help you locate sidequests.Sidequests are repetitive.The story is great and I personally think the main character in particular is excellent. There are a handful of sidequests that provide genuinely useful items for the effort you put in (wrench, radio, weather doll) and the rest are forgettable.Combat is decent. Aiming with the mouse is stiff, but aiming compensation makes it very easy to achieve headshots.Over all, for the price I bought it at ($10 I think) I would recommend it, provided quite an entertaining experience.For $25, there are better things to spend money on.

												I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.			"

												This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game. Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.			"

												garbage port.  I've logged a good amount of hours into the game, and it's still unplayable.  It crashes frequently because of memory leaks, and you have to enable the game to take up 4GB of memory if you want to avoid the frequent crashes - so if you're running a 32-bit system, you're screwed.  Even then, the game still crashes occasionally after cutscenes and reasons I can't identify.Some events don't ""trigger"" properly, so some side quests can't be completedThere is an asinine aiming bug which literally prevents you from aiming higher than your head on your screen and lower than your torso.  Shooting certain side quest items is actually impossible as a result.The whole thing is just unbelievably sloppy, which is a shame because the game is pretty entertaining.			"

												Broken from the start. After downloading the game it would not launch at all. To fix that you have to run dplauncher as administrator. Then i calibrated my wireless 360 controller and launched the game after that and set my control config to joystick in the launcher. Buttons worked fine and the game is advertised with ""Full Controller Support"". RIght when i gained control of the character i could not move but the buttons worked. I downloaded and installed the dpfix and it didnt do anything. I really wanted to play this but i only paid $2.49 and i wouldnt recommend buying it at that price. I guess i'll just buy the ps3 version.			"

												I have no idea if this plays well or not. It runs at least, contrary to what others have reported. However, it does not recognise XBOX controller at all, there is no way to remap the keys, it has poorly dubbed voiceovers akin to a film originally produced in another language, the graphics are clearly directly ported from something like a ps2 with no way to increase resolution, and (one of my all time pet hates) there is no way to turn off subtitles. For some not being able to use a controller OR remap keys might not be a deal breaker but since I am left handed the whole awsd extended map is a complete btfk for me. Even at 90% off I would advise you not to bother.			"

												The curious case of Deadly Premonition.Rare are the instances when a game comes along that is so horrible, yet so intriguing that you simply can not help but love it.First, a word of warning. This port is, to be frank, atrocious. I experienced a dozen crashes or more, three during the end credits alone. Furthermore, you need to use fixes to change the in-game resolution. The graphics lie somewhere between badly aged and horrible. And finally, the game mechanics are often stiff, walking on the border between being boring or laughable. Using a gamepad is recommended.But with that said, what is offered if you fight past these issues is in my opinion nothing short of amazing. A quirky, twin peaks-esque world full of strange characters, weird happenings and charming dialogue, and a story that more often than not is wonderfully over the top.This is not a game you should play for the gameplay or the visuals - its all about the experience of visiting the small town of Greenvale and its residents. Seeing this story through is nothing I regretDespite it being in perhaps the worst port yetTo Greenvale I think you should travelSo that this mystery, you can attempt to unravelSo says Mr. Stewart..

This game wasn't worth the dollar I paid for it. And it seems EVERYONE is having the same problems. How they can call this game released as a ""director's cut"" where they fix things, but its actually more unplayable than the original. Also, its been out over 2 years and nothing has been done to fix it by the devs. There are workarounds but I shouldn't have to start installing and deleting files on my brand new high end comp to run this turd. And what all for? The animations are stiff and terrible, graphics suck, the pace is super slow, the characters are weird and unrealistic, the story is mildly interesting but 2/3 of it doesn't make sense. The combat, controls, and UI are terrible. Limited controller support. Map sucks. Long boring forced driving sections with terrible controls. Positives are waiting the 20 hours for the story to finally finish, which who cares. Avoid it and thank me later.			"

												The game is fun, but very buggy!  I was able to finish it by restarting my PC every time it crashed and it would crash probably once an hour or so.  There are a variety of crash bugs.  Sometimes the textures get all wonky on the map view and it crashes.  Sometimes it crashes when loading.  Sometimes it crashes when it tries to play a movie.  So the moral is only play if you are willing to restart your PC a lot and save your game as much as possible.  I would recommend checking out the DPFix unofficial patch to make the port a bit smoother, but unfortunately it won't solve the crashing bugs.			"

												Don't get me wrong, the game itself is remarkably good but the PC port is just insanely terrible and utterly garbage! It's truly one of the worst PC ports in history, imagine a mix of Resident Evil 4 & Dark Souls PTD ports and make it a hundred times worse. It's terrible in every single aspect you could imagine and so broken that it's LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE:Performance:Extremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run. You probably have to use MODs just to be able to launch!And that's not all, Loading times are infuriating, especially the invisible loadings between each cutscene which could last up to 8 minutes! You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading! There are countless super-long invisible loading times!And that's not all! There's one more bonus for you: Game constantly crashes every once in a while for no reason!You're better off playing it on the console rather than buying this terrible and utterly unplayable piece of crap on PC.

												I'm loving this game, having a lot of fun, the weird kind of humor, the tense atmosphere, but still I don't recommend this game. It crashes frequently, and since the game doesn't have a auto-save system, I lost about 2-3 hours of gameplay. I hope they start fixing this crashes, because the game itself (storyline, gameplay) is great, but the crashes can be disappointing.			"

												Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free ""Pros & Cons"" section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.Pros:+ Lovable characters in a charming setting+ Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing+ Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot+ Tons of side quests and post-game content to exploreCons:- Frequent crashes (both random & reproducable)- Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs- Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX- An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food & sleep were almost never needed)- Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable- Terribly timed and overused QTEs- Tons of muddy, low-rez textures- Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes- A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the gameOverall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.Spoilers below, you have been warned!I went into Deadly Premonition expecting ""Resident Evil with FBI Agents"" and instead received ""Shenmu with Zombies"". While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce ""supernatural"" elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 & 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with ""Previously during the investigation..."" segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.			"

												This game actually looked a lot better before I played it. The game has a fairly ""fear-like"" storyline. The storyline is somewhat nice and fits it's theme, but the game itself is boring. The combat of the game is very complicated having to hold around 3 on your keyboard just to aim down when shooting. The game itself is fairly weak and could be improved greatly.			"

												This is officially the worst game I've ever played. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.It's easy to imagine that the early design discussions went something like this:""I have an idea for a game! And by idea, I mean let's copy something. How about we turn that weird 90s TV show by David Lynch into a game!""""You mean Twin Peaks?""""Yeah!""""Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show.""""Zombies.""""Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?""""No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse.""""So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?""""Yeah. Head zombies.""""Got it. So how does the player get around?""""It's open world.""""Like GTA? You can drive?""""Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town.""""And you can go anywhere?""""Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere.""""Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?""""Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest.""""Why obscure?""""Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing dynamic weather.""""Oooooooooo.""""Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather.""""That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?""""Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!""""I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies.""""Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!""""So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?""""Exactly!""""This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it.""""Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it art.""On a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.At one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.How I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.The story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.This isn't groundbreaking. It's not art. It's just bad.			"

												Unfortunately Zach, I just can't recommend this game. Sure, it has some of the goofiest writing I've ever seen, and the music seems to become inappropriately cheery in scenes where a murder has just taken place, but this port is awful. It crashed at least 15 times in my playthrough, sometimes well after my last save point, causing me to lose a lot of progress. The DPfix mod helps make the game look decent, but the game itself is just way too unstable. Get the XBOX 360 version if you just have to see what all the fuss is about.			"

												I thought that Resident Evil Revelations was a horribly generic version of Resident Evil but this game takes the cake. Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.The shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like “man this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?” “well actually I um... I baked them myself”. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.I would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate “real game” from “adventure” because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.I realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.Painfully generic, 5/10			"

The shooting is resident evil 4-esc. The story features your typical japanese wackyness that you find in a suda 51 or early Dead rising game. Is it worth 25 dollars? No.			"

												This damn game... this god**** game. You ever thought the biggest enemy in a game would be a boss right? Or perhaps a really cryptic level that has no online solution? Well, with this little gem of a game the biggest foe you'll have to face is the actual game itself.Deadly Premonition was made by SWERY 65, a man whose name must be inspired at least in part by the legendary Suda51 (F***ing rip-off... I think). In this game you play as Agent Francis York Morgan who's been assigned by the FBI to assist in a murder that has occurred in the quiet, quaint, and mysterious town of Greenvale. Along the way, you meet demons, zany town residents, and the most random usable in-game items ever. Really, Morgan? You're going to take some salmon from a demonic locker and eat it to restore your hunger? You disgust me.The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition is that it really wants to suck the c*** of Twin Peaks more than any other game I've ever played. Francis York Morgan acts in a very similar manner to Agent Dale Cooper, there's tons of supernatual dream imagery represented in red, and personalities in the police officers that mirrors the behavior of the police department of Twin Peaks. And... that's fine, I suppose, but between Deadly Premoniton and Twin Peaks, Twin Peaks is clearly the superior form of entertainment for several reasons.The story in Deadly Premoniton isn't particularly written that well. The over-the-top characters are so ridiculous and unbelievable that it's hard to take anything within the game seriously. There's seriously a guy who rolls around in a wheelchair and his assistant speaks in rhymes after listening to his boss whisper in his ear... every... single... time.. he talks!The game's presentation also doesn't help it much. The game was made for PS3 and that's what it looks like it was made for... very EARLY PS3 at least. Textures on characters and backgrounds are very basic. And characters animate and gesticulate so robotically and their voice actors put so little effort in that every cutscene is either a blast to watch or  more draining than the sewer great I poured my victim's blood into.Wait... what?The game handles... alright. The driving is very jerky and uncontrollable at times, and the cover shooting is nonsensical. You can walk freely but to aim at enemies or reload your gun you have to hold the Space bar- which locks you immediately in one space, leaving you unable to move- and you aim with your mouse. It's very clunky and confusing as to why the designers had such an outdated third-person shooter mechanic in the game. But other than that, the game is pretty responsive. But the driving and shooting take up so much that it really is a drawback for the experience.Now, of all the things that irritate me in this game, I'd say the biggest offender would be the bugs and crashed. My God, I haven't played anything this bad since... Well, actually Fallout: New Vegas. But that game would still run just find after I'd reboot it. There are several parts of the game that most people on threads complain about equally for crashing. Hell, even one of my favorite let's-players had his game freeze up on him mid-session. If this is such a big problem, why haven't the developers ever released a new patch for the PC port? I got to a point in my game where Iliterally could not progress no matter what advice I took, so I decided to look up the rest of the story online and call it quits.But despite my qualms with Deadly Premonition... I was still charmed by it (oddly enough). Despite all the awkwardness and irritating crashes, I enjoyed the over-the-top cheesey quirkiness of the game, because it seemed to have a self-awareness to it at least. Does it save it from a thumbs down? Of course not! But I thought it was worth mentioning.Deadly Premonition is a game with a lot of effort put into it, but executed very horribly. I will warn any potential buyers now, this game WILL crash on you. You will have to fight it constantly to get it to work, and even when it does you'll remain nervous about when it could possible crash again. I think that makes this game not worth recommending. You want some good horror and 3rd person cover shooting? Play Spec Ops: The Line. As for Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut (some cut), I'm giving it a 3/10.			"

I'm not about to let 3rd person view ruin my aim.Besides, this is a small screen what can not be enlarged to full screen. The bones of decaying humanoids apparently are stronger then a steel pipe. Wasting bulets on extremely slow monsters? Just a plain stupid game.			"

												Where do I even start with this? Ah, how about from the moment I double click on the icon to start the game:1. The launcher says at the bottom D-pad: Select Option and A: Confirm even with no controller plugged in.2. Check box in the settings menu of the launcher is already checked for Full Screen mode3. Press Play and the game starts in a bordered 720p window on my 1440p monitor.4. Get to main menu, can't use my mouse. In fact there isn't even a cursor. Have to use keyboard arrow keys to navigate5. Go to options and see there aren't any graphics settings whatsoever.6. Quit the game. Cry.At the time I wrote this review it's on sale for $2.49 which is 90% off it's regular asking price of $25.$25 for this? Even at $2.49 it's a massive rip off. Avoid at all cost or risk a heart attack trying to play whatever the hell this is.			"

												ive never been so annoyed by a game.terrible port that makes you feel like playing a PS1 game with a raddled controller and broken fingers.flickering textures, low quality graphics and sounds, slow moving mouse, weird keyboard settings...but thats not enough! you also get monotonous dialogues and a narcotic story.the gameplay is so weird and slow, i have no idea why this appears in the ""ACTION"" category.worst about this game is the music. pitch and melody forced me to turn it off completely.the composer must have been some suicidal crackhead in a self doubt delirium.( i bet that the same guy also created the story layout for this game...)honestly, i expected not much, but even this low expectations got disappointed by this game. dont buy it, i beseech you!

												My opinion of this game is very Low. Its slow moving pace With countless time driving to areas on a complicated map when all you wanted to do was get to the core of the game and see some action. I just didnt get very far with it because it drew on at a monautiness pace. And I have games too many that are far better which I havent played yet. I think if a person plays a game a quarter of the way through and finds nothing drawing him in to play further to see more and do more I think at that time the story has rolled over and died. There might be some who loved this game but I have to have a richer plot a deeper story than what Deadly Premonition was able to deal out to keep my interest going. And then there were the endless replays they kept wanting you to do I guess maybe they thought they needed to repeat key happenings to keep the story alive I just though it was boring. I would not recommend this game to anybody not even on sale.			"

												Steam told me to recommend this game to my friends.But I won't. You shouldn't play it. Not on steam, not on any other platform, because devs hate you. They'd r*pe your dog and houseplants if they had a chance. Yes, they are that incompetent, ignorant and they are okay with that. This port is A LOT worse than Dark Souls port. It's can challenge the worst ports like DMC3 or original RE4 release and effin' win hands down. I'm not kidding. And you know, xbox and ps3 versions weren't really more of a better game.No, I'm not talking about story writer - the story is actually interesting, the Twin Peaks atmosphere mixed with Silent Hill in open-world detective horror with a whole lot of WTF moments. But you'll get r*ped with a baseball bat for it. Go on, you've been warned.			"

												This game is by most accounts broken. I had to run it in windows xp compatibility mode. It would crash every other hour. I could only aim in a 30 degree arc that made one of the final battles practically impossible.And it was worth every minute. This is a game that not only makes an impression but it inspires. It makes you feel a range of emotions and feelings that you didn't think were even possible from a game. It makes you appreciate other games more. It's more than a so bad it's good experience. By the end of I loved it unironically. It's a trail to get to that point though. Not for everyone, but I recommend it (though if can get the console version do that instead and save a lot of frusturation).			"

												Pros: Amazing game filled with comedic moments, fun driving mechanics, huge plot and a great mystery covering the entire game. Cons: Controls are kinda clunky, no gamepad support (despite being a console game before ported), and resolution is locked at 720p. Graphical options are minimal if anything, and there appear to be a few more loading texture problems than in the PS3/XBOX360 version of this game.All in all, despite the numerous technically problems, this game is well worth buying to enjoy the characters, story, and all around funny dialogue. Playing Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut on the PS3 or XBOX360 is a better option, though. The only benefit of playing on PC is the return of Francis York Morgan's kill quotes, which were sadly missing from the console versions of Director's Cut.9/10			"

Ce jeu est très inspiré scénaristiquement parlant de la série Twin Peaks de Lynch une  série mythique qui se caractérisait par toute un palette de personnage haut en couleur, et bien Deadly Premonitions est pour les grand fan de twin peaks un petit bijoux de décalage et d'humour tout en gardant un scénario à la fois intrigant et torturé.On aime, on deteste, chacun choisi moi dans tous les cas je suis séduit.

												For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning: The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.

												Deadly Premonition is a flawed masterpiece. If you are not computer savvy and comfortable with troubleshooting, installing mods and tweaking files, this game is not for you. No matter what hardware configuration you have, you will run into technical issues. These can usually be overcome, but it will require extra effort on your part.Still with me? Well, on top of the technical issues, the game gives off a pretty bad first impression. The controls feel awkward, the graphics are unimpressive and the early part of the game seems like a lackluster knock-off of Resident Evil or Silent Hill. So, is it really worth all of the trouble? Absolutely!If you can push past the shortcomings, the game opens up and becomes a delight. The characters in Deadly Premonition are fully developed and the deeper you dig, the more you'll find out about them. The town feels alive and has a quirky charm about it. The people and places all have a schedule they follow, so you can uncover interesting situations and events depending on when and where you encounter them.The story is offbeat and absorbing. This is the kind of memorable game experience that will stick with you long after you've finished playing. I can't recommend it highly enough, but only if you think that you can deal with the technical issues and rough start.			"

												Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut brings you to a place where bizzarre and weird things happened in somewhat seems like you are in a dream...either way the story line is quite interesting where the more you play the more it will make you go deeper into what seems to be a mystery all along...I really recommend this game who loves to watch movies like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""...(^_^)			"

												I really would like to finish playing this game but it keeps crashing on one of the loading screens in chapter 3.I have tried a lot of the suggested solutions like: uncheck full screen, run in compatibility mode, run as administrator ...- Like it should never be this hard to get a game to work.What a pity.

												This game is... Well, it's certainly something.Ignorant of the infamy of DP's PC port, I happily bought up a game that seemed like it'd take some time to complete, and for like $2.50 no less!I love it. Simply put, I love this game. York is a humourous and fun character and the way he reacts with the Greenvale citizens is also great. That said this game crashes like CRAZY, even after installing a few mods to fix it. Deadly Premonition is a labour of love, and while I haven't finished it yet it's been worth it so far. I've never played anything like it.			"

												tl;dr Don't buy the PC version under penalty of water boarding.I'm sure this game is great.  From what I've played of it, it seems brilliant.Not that I have much to go on, because after a week of working like it should, if randomly decided that I am indeed *not* allowed to use my gamepad.  That leaves me with either using they're half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥keyboard and mouse controls, which would be torturous enough without the added complication of the fact that I'm on a laptop that this game will overheat when set up in a way that allows for comfortable keyboard and mouse controls.  The other option is third party software to map the keyboard controls to a gamepad, but good luck with that; I thought they were working until I made the ill advised decision of entering a car.  If there exists an arcane enchantment that makes a fine-tuned JoyToKey mapping harmonize perfectly with their crappy launcher's controls that makes the already horrendous cars even slightly drivable, I'm all ears.But as it stands, I've essentially wasted three hours of my life trying to make someone else's game work.  I'm too dusgusted by the deplorable lack of any sort of quality control here to really care about any workarounds.  Getting the game to even start was already a workaround.  I've already put more time and effort into writing this stupid review than any ""developer"" put into making sure their controller support doesn't just decide to vanish.  I was lucky enough to get this game for free, so I can only give my deepest sympathies to anyone who was suckered into buy it.Even if you have no way of playing any other version, all this so-called  port will do is give you a taste of what is in all likelyhood a great game, before throwing some inconvenience, crash, or game-break at you.

												How much to like this game is determined by one question: How much do you like Twin Peaks?Because if you love David Lynch's show, then you will love everything about Deadly Premontion: Memorable and abstract characters, set in a small town in Washington with gameplay that feels like it was conceived in the Resident Evil 4 era. If you like a good weird experience, you will find it with York and Zach.  HOWEVER...!Be warned that this is HORRIBLE PC port of an already pretty technically flawed game and it tends to crash. A lot. Your experience might be even worse than mine because I almost completed the main game, but got stuck when the last patch made it pretty much unplayable for me.			"

												Let me tell you something about Deadly Premonition.  The controls are clunky, and driving, being maybe half of the game, is a nightmare. The character animations are awkward and at times terrifying. The squirrels make public-domain monkey noises and the fast travel mechanic (if you get it) is punctuated with a cartoon car crash sound. The voice acting ranges from actually enjoyable to god-awful. Half of the time, the game crashes or won't let me load my saves, and I had to download a patch just to get the game to run at over 720p. This might be one of the best games I've ever played.'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity.This isn't a game for everyone, but if you do like it, it's like this game was made for you. In short: This game is awful. I love every awful moment of it.			"

												I'll start with the cons:- Bugs and crashes galore, be prepared to deal with issues, more so if you're going to use Durante's Dp Fix mod (which is essential).  A great place to start is the pinned ""Techinical Support Topic"" in the forums if you decide to start playing this game (which is worth it, despite how this critique starts).  This is an issue that I wouldn't blame people for being really upset about but if you have the patience it'll work out fine.  - No in-game graphic settings, no AA, no resolution settings (defaults to 1280x720)... zip, nadda, nothing.  Unless you use the afore mentionned Dp fix where Durante the modder added the ability to tune various settings in the mods .ini file. - Graphics are hit or miss, some areas in the game will leave you scratching your head wondering if the textures were vomited into the game as oppossed to programed. Sort of in the middle:- Some Controls/gameplay:  There is controller support (I use an Xbox 360 wired controller without issue, thankfully...), haven't tried the keyboard and mouse controls.  Control is serviceable, I can vouch that the default settings are actually better than the xbox 360 version of the game, you can react a little faster and aim better with this control scheme. - Driving! Oh my...  Picture driving a giant heavy brick with wheels that are smaller bricks.  It's almost hilarious, it's a universe where turning down the street can only be done in small calculated increments. Miss a turn in one the games side races and then marvel at the excrutiatingly slow reverse function complete with the back up sounds of a forklift and the engine power of a small lawn mower. Finally the pros!- The story is fascinating, the characters are eccentric and a joy to interact with. The main character is absolutely fantastic!!  He's funny, smart and a bit smarmy, it's a lot of fun to watch him rattle the towns folk.  The voice acting is pretty good as far as I'm concerned and each character exudes uniqueness, personality or eccentricity.  There are some pretty laugh out loud moments too!  Also helps that I'm a Twin Peaks fan as the game makes no bones about taking direct influence from that material.   - Albeit the graphics are a bit dated, there are areas that have really good art style: like the interiours; the diner looks really cool and each house you can enter has  distinct personality and depth. - It's an open world, you are given plenty of time between points in the main story line to explore the town.  Nice details peppered all over the place and collectables to grab.  Lots of side quests that aren't too taxing and also some that add some extra context to the main mystery at hand.   Every interactable character seems to have differenct routines, so you won't always find characters in the same place.  For example: you can observe from the windows on the outside of some homes that have characters in them, one time I observed Emily the police officer, it was about 10pm game time, wearing a blue dress (which I've never seen her wear) and casually enjoying her living room or the time I peeked in on the Ingrams around dinner time, the whole family was there.  The twins appeared to be interacting with themselves while watching tv.  Mrs. Ingram was making dinner in the kitchen and then Keith walked in through the front door (I was there because I decided to follow him from the milk barn, not creeping, observing!!!), he went to the fridge grabbed a beer and sat next to the twins (how's the peeping Tommy... how's the peeping). I thought it was kind of neat because there was effort to make the world feel like it was living around you.  - Some really tense moments in the game, especially the moments where it turns into screen on screen, your characters perspective and the killers perspective.  Those parts are amazing!I originally played and finished the game on the xbox 360 and now  i've been compelled to play it again, this time the  directors cut on the p.c.  It's a budget game but get past some of the foibles and  you have a very unique and memorable game!			"

Dont buy it!!!This is an update in my review.After some time I managed to solve the crash on start problem.The game is useful, just a pretentious game, with graphics from ps2. Is not a survival horror game in any way. You have infinities bullets, the enemies are really easy to kill, and not scary at all. The story is a little interesting but just for a couple of minutes, before it's pretentiousness kill all the mood. Above all it has a quick time event mechanics in the encounters with the main monster. Do not buy it!!			"

												I love this game, but this is a ridiculously horrible port for PC.  Crashes render the game unplayable and there are no simple, or heck, even hard fixes that deal with the issues.  Unskippable Intros and Cutscenes make crashes even further infuriating.  I could not use a controller due to the buttons defaulting to unusual key bindings and not all of the buttons can be altered.  The start button was on the Right Trigger.  I doubt we'll see patches that deal with these problems as well.  I recommend buying it on a console, or watching someone on the internet play it for you, and save yourself the annoyance.			"

												This game was a pain to finish due to a huge number of bugs and game crashing for no apparent reason every now and then but man am i glad i finished it!Let me make it clear right now, you probably wont be able to enojoy this game to its fullest without extra work on your behalf, so unless you are ok with fixing something that you paid for i strongly recommend you to stay away from this one, however, if you dont mind fixing a couple of things in order to play and make it as stable as possible, grab it and you wont be disappointed.Ok, so for the actually review, i have to say that i really loved the game. Its very unique as a game since it features some gameplay aspects that i never saw together in one game. For example in Deadly Premonition you have a open world factor, you are free to explore the town of Greenwale as you please. You can do this on foot or in your car, kinda like in GTA, but you will have to make a good use of your time since you are an FBI agent who has a case to solve afterall so, while you can go out and explore the town as you please, you will also have to show up for work in a certain place at a certain time, and that brings me to second gameplay factor in this game, time.This game has active time system and dynamic day and night cycles. You cant go to police station at 3am and demand that everyone is present there so you can start the next part of yout ""main quest"" just because you are the main character, no, you have to show up at the appropriate time when the station is working and when everyone needed for the quest are present. You can just sleep it off untill the time is right or you can try to locate and complete some of many side quests that this game has. Yeah, its a horror game withopen world and side quests, pretty crazy, right. Oh and did i mention hunger and tiredness? Yes, you actually have to sleep and eat regularly so you dont suffer a penalty or eventually die. Miss a good night sleep and you will be tired, it will reflect on your stamina, you will get fatigued super fast and you wont be able to aim your weapon properly or, ignore your hunger and eventually your health starts draining. Speaking of health loss, there is ofcourse the action part of the game where you will have to beat or gun down creepy enemies before they take you down. Now, this part of the game is, in my honest oppinion, not so good since you have a gun with infinite ammo and as far as i remember, it never takes more than 2 headshots for the enemy to drop dead(frustratingly slow). Action parts lack any form of challenge and you will probably finish the game without dying a single time even if you are bad at shooters, It could be just my oppinion but i think that no one will enjoy these shooting sequences the way they shoul be enjoyed.Now, even with the games action sequences as bad they are, this game is still amazing because, to play this for the sake of action and challenge is to miss the point of theis game entirely. It shines when it comes to storytelling and character developement. It held me nailed in front of my PC, wanting to get to the bottom of the whole thing and solve the case. It was thrilling from the start and it left me wanting for more when it ended. Characters are deep and alive, you can see and feel their personalities in  everything they do, from their motion when walking and talking, their responses to events and their attitude towards each other. Tho none shines brighter than York himself when it comes to this with his frequent dialogues(well, monologues technically since we never hear a reply) with Zach, his imaginary friend and pretty much everything he does, from the way he introduces himself to people, lights his cigarettes, starts a profiling, etc, etc... Excellent personality 10/10If you havent played it before and have no idea what it is but are still willing to give it a go even with all the bugs and problems exclusive for the PC port, i say go for it, it surprised me and its probably gonna surprise you too. Its definitely one of the better games that i ever played and i have been a gamer for a while now :)			"

												You know that game, it came out on the PC in 2013.  It was a console port, and a pretty bad one at that.  But there was something about it, despite the stiff writing, the bad graphics, the awkward combat... we still felt compelled to complete it, didn't we Zach?  That sleepy country town was so memorable and all of those characters had just the right amount of charm to reel us in.  I suppose part of the draw was the fact that it was such a unique title, even if it wasn't the best, it stood out and was unashamed to do what it wanted to do.  It was such an amazing ride, wasn't it Zach?			"

												Project Monarch the video game. It's actually pretty deep and if you walk away from this game with no impression other than that it was a charmingly inept Twin Peaks rip-off, you were probly playing it wrong.You'll spend as much time troubleshooting and restarting from crashes as you will actually playing the game, and the controller support doesn't seem to work, but I say it's worth it. The princess bride style cutscenes of the old man telling the story to the little girl that the directors cut added in are dumb and totally arbitrary though, and distract from the experience a lot!

												Deadly Premonition is a flawed masterpiece. If you are not computer savvy and comfortable with troubleshooting, installing mods and tweaking files, this game is not for you. No matter what hardware configuration you have, you will run into technical issues. These can usually be overcome, but it will require extra effort on your part.Still with me? Well, on top of the technical issues, the game gives off a pretty bad first impression. The controls feel awkward, the graphics are unimpressive and the early part of the game seems like a lackluster knock-off of Resident Evil or Silent Hill. So, is it really worth all of the trouble? Absolutely!If you can push past the shortcomings, the game opens up and becomes a delight. The characters in Deadly Premonition are fully developed and the deeper you dig, the more you'll find out about them. The town feels alive and has a quirky charm about it. The people and places all have a schedule they follow, so you can uncover interesting situations and events depending on when and where you encounter them.The story is offbeat and absorbing. This is the kind of memorable game experience that will stick with you long after you've finished playing. I can't recommend it highly enough, but only if you think that you can deal with the technical issues and rough start.			"

""Dp.exe has encountered a problem"" and then crash to desktop.This happens with DPfix AND without DPfix.You may have better luck than me, but just to be safe, don't buy this game on Steam unless it's incredibly discounted in a sale. That way you won't lose much if it doesn't end up working.It's a shame I wasn't able to get this working because it looks like a neat game otherwise. Just can't recommend such a sloppy port.			"

												This game is amazing! It's almost like they took Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, and cast him individually as an FBI agent investigating a small town murder with a Silent Hill twist.Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the game working, and god forbid you have 5.1 surround sound!Unfortunately, going through the process of fixing the game, the game is still incredibly bugged, and is borderline unplayable. If this game functioned, I would give it a 9/10 (some gameplay elements are laughable). However, the sad reality is that you may end up wasting your money buying this game, especially if you are not persistent and willing to play through the many crashes that truly break the game's immersion.

												This is the worst PC-port that I have ever seen. It constantly crashes and sometimes it won't start at all, without rebooting windows. There are some fixes and fanmade patches, but even these don't help that much. The game mechanics are rather bad, driving feels like from some bad 90's game and it's hard to believe that this was PS3 title, not PS2.But even with all the crashing and very poor game design I still highly recommend this title. It's like Twin Peaks meets Resident Evil. It's kind of open world game, but actually there aren't much activities you can do, only some boring side quests that doesn't connect with the main story. The characters are lovable and interesting, you get attached to them just like watching Twin Peaks. Be ready for story twists and for very strange storyline, it keeps you playing to the very end, because you need to know what happens next.			"

Could be during a loading screen, or just while you're wandering around.You might lose a few minutes on a crash, or be set way back. As neat and interesting as it is, a game you can't play just isn't worth it.			"

It has one of the most interesting stories in a video game I have ever played. It has aliens, the main character talks to a person that is in his head(his other persona), romance, and betrayal. Not to mention silly some of the times with it's own (I find hilarious) sense of humor.  The graphics aren't the best, but they don't need to be, because it's simply fun and thought provoking. Good job whoever brought this game to pc and on steam!  Hip hip hurrrrrrrray10cups of coffee out of 10!  "

												If you can handle doing stuff over and over and over again because a cutscene always crashes, and figure out how to get it not to crash ""press enter, skip the cutscene"" Then yes I do recommend this game.

												This is a one B-movie of a game.Imagine a Japanese Fred Olen Ray shooting a Twin Peaks rip-off with a twist of Silent Hill and a bit of GTA. The result is a campy and cliched mess that for some unexplainable reason fits really well into late-night TV program. You hate the game for being stupid and ugly and buggy, but can't stop playing it because it's obviously a labour of love.Too bad the publisher doesn't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about compatibility. Many complain about technical issues to the point that the PC port being totally unplayable.So it would probably be a better idea to get a PS3 version - which has it's own problems as well, but at least is more stable.

												This is the japanese indie love child of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. A pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lovechild, but still somewhat awesome and adorable none-the-less, provided that you can patch it up enough to get it to even run in the first place.THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a ""bad port"". No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!HOW TO GET IT TO RUNIn order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to ""repair"" its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to ""Ultra"" in that file, the graphics will crash.)Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes.First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.			"

												I have rated this game as positive as it has a very different style and is atmospheric. Realistically what is needed is an intermediate option. Design wise this game reminds me of something that belongs on a PS1/PS2. Most importantly this game is designed for a console not pc. The cut scenes, music and feel of the game is similar to Japanese titles. The game play and menu layout hasn't been adapted for PC it almost doesn't take into account that you would be using a mouse. Perhaps a 360 controller or one of the upcomming steam products would be useful here. The most frustrating aspect of this would be the ""autoaim/aim assist"" system. Partitioning the target to legs, body or head. When playing I didn't use the lock-on system and just aimed for a headshot.If you are looking for something a little different yes, otherwise don't bother and if buying this can be picked up for less than a couple of quid from third party sites.

												This game has wierd amusing moments, intriging story, some puzzles I ran into were kind of interesting and  there were alot of strange side activites that I found. I understand why this game was a cult hit. HOWEVER, the pc port of this game is terrible. Locked resolution that cant be changed unless you get the fix developed by someone outside the company that made this game (Which by the way, may or may not work for some people.... which it didnt work for me unless I used windowed mode LAME). Without the fix this game looks like garbage and what I would expect from a playstation 1 game. Awful controls, hit or miss voice acting (which wasnt that big a deal for me), terrible combat system, AND GAME CRASHES are also present in the game. If the developer actually took the time to fix some of these things in the directors cut and properly ported it to the pc, this may have been a fun experince. But since the game controls bad and crashes often, not to metion the resolution debacle, I would recommend you get the console version of this game or watch lets play on youtube or whatever			"

The gameplay isnt really that good but the story and music are interesting and are just enough to justify buying it on sale. I can understand the almost seemlingly visual manifestation of something like Macintosh Plus (music) mixed in with heavy influences of Twin Peaks. The music is strange and it makes the whole experience and vibe strange, in a good way.  Unless you like bizarre experimental type games that does not take it self seriously and/or a big fan of Twin Peaks or anything like that then I would skip this unless you can get it for $5 or less.

												Likes: Story, the general feeling, the characters, the way it looks.Dislikes: The crashes, the vehicle handling, the lack of official patches to fix the game.This is a very strange game, it's a game I want to love, but the crashes ruin it a bit. It makes me think a bit of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines in that both games that could be held in the highest of regards if it weren't for some crashing (both improved due to fan made patches). The feel of the town and the characters will remind you of ""Twin Peaks"" a lot (at least did to me), your character is like a very strange version of Agent Cooper.I recommend this game, as long as you don't mind the crashes too much (which can be fixed to an extent with unofficial patches available online).

												Funny, spooky, serious, and buggy as ♥♥♥♥. If you can get this game for < $5, do it. Don't ask questions. Just, don't get too upset when it inevitably crashes, and if you are as unlucky as me, don't scream when you find yourself faced with restarting the entire game due to every single god damn cutscene at the beginning of a chapter crashing to desktop, even after downloading someone else's save file. I wish I could finish this game. Maybe you can.edit: months later, i tried forcing my cpu to only use 2 cores. this stopped the crashing and i finished the game from there with little trouble. it's really good.			"

												I mean, to say this is basically Twin Peaks: The Video Game would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like Twin Peaks, the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about Deadly Premonition is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics. Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should.The gameplay works sort of like L.A. Noire. The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The ""game"" operates much more like an interactive film or television show (""Previously in the investigation"" or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.			"

												This is the japanese indie love child of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. A pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lovechild, but still somewhat awesome and adorable none-the-less, provided that you can patch it up enough to get it to even run in the first place.THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a ""bad port"". No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!HOW TO GET IT TO RUNIn order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to ""repair"" its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to ""Ultra"" in that file, the graphics will crash.)Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes.First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.			"

												I really want to reccomend this game. I really, really want to. The plot, dialogue, setting, characters et cetera are all fantastic. However, even after applying various fixes such as dpfix, and compatibility mode, I still experienced numerous errors. These include stuttering framerate, unable to get out of windowed mode, unable to alter resolution, and an inability to aim up or down rendering some puzzles literally incompletable. (I know compatibility mode is supposed to fix this but didn't for me.) Couple that with my save file getting corrupted somehow (twice) I can't reccomend the PC version. If you want this game, the console version works fine. I love this game, but the number of bugs is completely unreasonable. If it gets officially patched and this is fixed, I would reccomend it. But at this point, there are too many bugs to justify that.			"

												The game itself is brilliant, a kind of murder mystery in the style of twin peaks, with wonderfully cringe worthy dialogue and amazingly juxtaposed humor and horror elements. The game itself is flawed in almost every way, the controls are weird and tanky, the graphics look like a sega dreamcast, and the audio levels are always off. But somehow, it ADDS to the charm of the game, it's lovable BECAUSE of it's flaws. What makes it so very amazing is the writing. Seriously, this game has some of the BEST character development and scripting I've ever freakin seen in a video game, or anything for that matter. I've never ever before WANTED to kill the villian so bad, and felt so invested in all the characters. Really, the game is lovable and wonderful in just about every way. EXCEPT FOR THIS PORT. I played it back on the Xbox on release and loved it, and I have to say this port makes me want to cry. If you can get it to work properly, especially with DPFix by the guy who made DSFix, you'll have a blast. Otherwise, you'll be lucky to get so far as a three hours in before crashes just cut your journey short.			"

												This game is polarizing. You either love it or you hate it. The pc version has a kind of cost at entry, where you have to root out various bugs and hindrances in order to play unaccosted. once you get set up and stabalize it however it's pretty good. This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and ""jank"" that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.Over all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from ""Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling"" or ""pffft that zombies running sideways."" Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.This games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the ""two best friends play"" of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.""The Pickles""			"

												Deadly Premonition is an odd one with a cult following. On a technical level it is not a very well made game but as for plot, characters and music it is one of the best ""games"" I've played in past couple of years. I've never seen Twin Peaks but many say if you've seen that series you'll get notice a lot of elements from it in this game.Originally I played this on the PS3 and picked up the PC version for £2 or so......It's a terrible port, probably the worst ever next to Saints Row 2. However as with Dark Souls, there is a resolution fix and fortunately for me at least there have been no further problems. In fact I'd say the PC version with the fix is better than the PS3 version due to the framerate (again for me) being 60fps as oppossed to the PS3's horrific sub 30fps in most cases.If you don't mind the technical issues, it's worth at least one playthrough just for the plot. The game itself is extremely easy anyway so you'll never really be stuck.			"

												Fantastic story and characters with great music. Gameplay is completely busted at moments.I'd suggest watching a playthrough like the one from Video Games Awesome or Giant Bomb instead of actually playing the game. It's really not worth the hassle to slog through the gameplay.I groaned everytime there was an action sequence (I counted around 6). The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny. There is a sequence where you need to fight four of those monsters in a row and I pretty much ran out of usable weapons at that time. When your health is low, you'll start limping, have fun progressing through the levels like that!			"

												If you can look past the dated graphics, this game has a very deep an interesting storyline and I found the whole locale really drew me in as I played it.  Controls are ok overall.  I couldn't get the controller to work, but keyboard functions seem to work pretty well.  The reason I can't recommend it is because I just can't get it to stop crashing.  This game seems to be very poorly optimized and even using DPfix and upgrading my video card only postponed the issue before I kept continually crashing in the same spot.  It's not worth the hassle of getting the game to work.  If this game ran smoothly without the crashing, I would have no issue recommending it.  As it stands now, I have no idea whether it has been patched, but I highly doubt it.			"

												Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game and a must play, I HIGHLY recommend it. However, the PC port is pretty much broken. You're lucky if the game even launches and when it does, it is riddled with bugs, glitches and contantly crashes. The game itself is REALLY good, but I've never seen a PC port this broken. It's exactly like the Dark Souls port but worse. A fantastic game that it ruined by a horrible port. What a shame. Stick with the console version.			"

												A very strange game that had me laughing for all the wrong reasons. The story is rediculasly slow with the actions being even slower. I gave up hope when the game had me looking for a key for a long time through different rooms, the door animation being about 30 seconds of him opening them, this was the final nail.			"

												PC Port is pretty bad, but if you tweak it a bit by going to your Deadly Premonition files located in your Steam folder, right click DP.exe, properties, change the Compaitablity to 98/ME, then go to DPLauncher.exe, and change that to Run as Admin, then launch it through the DPLauncher, it should be fully functioning, aside from the lack of options. Great game. prone to crashes and occasional graphics ♥♥♥♥ ups			"

												Good game, bad port. For me, at first it literally wouldn't start (the process just shut down after clicking start on the config screen), now it will start but crashes randomly.If you have the option, play a console version instead. They don't quite work perfectly either, but far better than this.			"

												OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch.But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the ""this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it"" games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game.I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today			"

												This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those ""gameplay is king"" people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.			"

												It is a great game, the story is great, the characters and the soundtrack are amazing.But it doesn't work properly. I spent two hours fix the dp.exe doesn't work problem. It crashes multiple times I have to repeat tedious activities like driving, the controls are complicated (press space, focus with right mouse than shoot with left) I always f**** up the quicktime events, because there too fast. no I am stuck at the diner and nobody can help me to fix my problem. if you are in the same situation like me and you have no playstation or xbox...watch a Let's play or ask a friend if you can play it on her/his console but don't buy this game, really it will spare you a lot of frustration.

												I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying ""Dp.exe has stopped responding""So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.			"

												The most of the game can be divided into three separate partsone part sandbox, with mini-games, collectibles and all the awkward conversations you will get yourself into (best part)one part slow boring zombies, (you have a pistol with infinite ammo), the phasing zombies appear after the half pointone part QTE boss encounters (not battles) with instant death failures.As for the story, it initially seemed like a typical murder mystery, but the detective had moments where he was day dreaming where the undead were after him. But by the end you are not sure what is real or how to explain it.The game also has Boss battles, but are both at the end with multiple stages, hope you are full with medkits.Besides all that, it was a great game, but it takes a while for it to get going.

												this is a fun game and the gamepad does work with the game now. ok first time downloaders if they run into this same problem i did. the DP.exe fix is. you need to go to your steam folder C:Drive/SteamLibary/Steamapps/common/Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut. go to folder redist. scroll down to the bottom and there should be two files. ones vcredist_x86. click on it and install it. next click on file called PhysX_SystemSoftware and install it. scroll up alittle bit half way and find file called DXSETUP and run that and install it. ok after that go back to folder Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut. right click on DP and click on properties. click on Compatibility tab up on top. click on box Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows 98/ Windows Me. dont need to check off run as administrator. click apply or ok. thats done. next right click on DPLauncher and click on properties again. click on Compatibility up on top. now down at the bottom where it says Privilege Level theres a box that says next to it Run this program as an administrator. click on that box, check it off. and now click apply and ok. and now boot up the game and have fun :) this may not fix every ones problems but if you freshly installed this game on a clean copy of Windows 7 ill guess 8 as well it should work with this method.

												Objectively- this game is terrible. Even on consoles. It's a disaster on so many levels.Despite that, you still need to experience this perfect train wreck. It sucks in so many ways that it literally creates its own gravitational pull that sucks you in. You won't understand why it fascinates you so. It just will. You won't understand why such an objectively bad game is so amusing. But it is. It's like the sirens of Greek mythology- you're not supposed to listen to their song. But you do anyway, and get drawn in. And then you can't get away. Because it's just that entralling.10/10 Would suffer again. So says Mr. Stewart.PS: If anyone can explain to me why I keep seeing Fk's in my coffee, that'd be great.In all seriousness, despite some of the glaring gameplay issues and clunky menus, it does create an interesting story, albeit in a cheesy B-horror/comedy style that's reminiscent of Twin Peaks. Don't approach this game with the mentality that ""This is a survival horror game"" because it's not. Once you decide not to take the game seriously, you'll probably appreciate it if you can handle said B-horror comedy Twin Peaks stuff.			"

												This is the worst PC-port that I have ever seen. It constantly crashes and sometimes it won't start at all, without rebooting windows. There are some fixes and fanmade patches, but even these don't help that much. The game mechanics are rather bad, driving feels like from some bad 90's game and it's hard to believe that this was PS3 title, not PS2.But even with all the crashing and very poor game design I still highly recommend this title. It's like Twin Peaks meets Resident Evil. It's kind of open world game, but actually there aren't much activities you can do, only some boring side quests that doesn't connect with the main story. The characters are lovable and interesting, you get attached to them just like watching Twin Peaks. Be ready for story twists and for very strange storyline, it keeps you playing to the very end, because you need to know what happens next.			"

												I really want to reccomend this game. I really, really want to. The plot, dialogue, setting, characters et cetera are all fantastic. However, even after applying various fixes such as dpfix, and compatibility mode, I still experienced numerous errors. These include stuttering framerate, unable to get out of windowed mode, unable to alter resolution, and an inability to aim up or down rendering some puzzles literally incompletable. (I know compatibility mode is supposed to fix this but didn't for me.) Couple that with my save file getting corrupted somehow (twice) I can't reccomend the PC version. If you want this game, the console version works fine. I love this game, but the number of bugs is completely unreasonable. If it gets officially patched and this is fixed, I would reccomend it. But at this point, there are too many bugs to justify that.			"

												I love this game, but this is a ridiculously horrible port for PC.  Crashes render the game unplayable and there are no simple, or heck, even hard fixes that deal with the issues.  Unskippable Intros and Cutscenes make crashes even further infuriating.  I could not use a controller due to the buttons defaulting to unusual key bindings and not all of the buttons can be altered.  The start button was on the Right Trigger.  I doubt we'll see patches that deal with these problems as well.  I recommend buying it on a console, or watching someone on the internet play it for you, and save yourself the annoyance.			"

												I'll start with the cons:- Bugs and crashes galore, be prepared to deal with issues, more so if you're going to use Durante's Dp Fix mod (which is essential).  A great place to start is the pinned ""Techinical Support Topic"" in the forums if you decide to start playing this game (which is worth it, despite how this critique starts).  This is an issue that I wouldn't blame people for being really upset about but if you have the patience it'll work out fine.  - No in-game graphic settings, no AA, no resolution settings (defaults to 1280x720)... zip, nadda, nothing.  Unless you use the afore mentionned Dp fix where Durante the modder added the ability to tune various settings in the mods .ini file. - Graphics are hit or miss, some areas in the game will leave you scratching your head wondering if the textures were vomited into the game as oppossed to programed. Sort of in the middle:- Some Controls/gameplay:  There is controller support (I use an Xbox 360 wired controller without issue, thankfully...), haven't tried the keyboard and mouse controls.  Control is serviceable, I can vouch that the default settings are actually better than the xbox 360 version of the game, you can react a little faster and aim better with this control scheme. - Driving! Oh my...  Picture driving a giant heavy brick with wheels that are smaller bricks.  It's almost hilarious, it's a universe where turning down the street can only be done in small calculated increments. Miss a turn in one the games side races and then marvel at the excrutiatingly slow reverse function complete with the back up sounds of a forklift and the engine power of a small lawn mower. Finally the pros!- The story is fascinating, the characters are eccentric and a joy to interact with. The main character is absolutely fantastic!!  He's funny, smart and a bit smarmy, it's a lot of fun to watch him rattle the towns folk.  The voice acting is pretty good as far as I'm concerned and each character exudes uniqueness, personality or eccentricity.  There are some pretty laugh out loud moments too!  Also helps that I'm a Twin Peaks fan as the game makes no bones about taking direct influence from that material.   - Albeit the graphics are a bit dated, there are areas that have really good art style: like the interiours; the diner looks really cool and each house you can enter has  distinct personality and depth. - It's an open world, you are given plenty of time between points in the main story line to explore the town.  Nice details peppered all over the place and collectables to grab.  Lots of side quests that aren't too taxing and also some that add some extra context to the main mystery at hand.   Every interactable character seems to have differenct routines, so you won't always find characters in the same place.  For example: you can observe from the windows on the outside of some homes that have characters in them, one time I observed Emily the police officer, it was about 10pm game time, wearing a blue dress (which I've never seen her wear) and casually enjoying her living room or the time I peeked in on the Ingrams around dinner time, the whole family was there.  The twins appeared to be interacting with themselves while watching tv.  Mrs. Ingram was making dinner in the kitchen and then Keith walked in through the front door (I was there because I decided to follow him from the milk barn, not creeping, observing!!!), he went to the fridge grabbed a beer and sat next to the twins (how's the peeping Tommy... how's the peeping). I thought it was kind of neat because there was effort to make the world feel like it was living around you.  - Some really tense moments in the game, especially the moments where it turns into screen on screen, your characters perspective and the killers perspective.  Those parts are amazing!I originally played and finished the game on the xbox 360 and now  i've been compelled to play it again, this time the  directors cut on the p.c.  It's a budget game but get past some of the foibles and  you have a very unique and memorable game!			"

												CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.

												I mean, to say this is basically Twin Peaks: The Video Game would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like Twin Peaks, the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about Deadly Premonition is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics. Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should.The gameplay works sort of like L.A. Noire. The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The ""game"" operates much more like an interactive film or television show (""Previously in the investigation"" or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.			"

My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called ""repair"" fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway).

It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.			"

												For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning: The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.

												It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable. So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.			"

												You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else.I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness,The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was ""I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.""The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird. The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game.This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.			"

												EDITED: Playing on a freshly rebooted system removes stuttering and lag, and the game has a really quirky and Twin Peaks-inspired feel to it. The setting is great, the gameplay (control) is a little bit weird and I have a hard time getting into the game for some reason. I do recommend this game now that it's playable, but I've kept my original complaints below. There are mods and hacks that fixes the resolution as well.----Lagging, stuttering, jittery... Literally unplayable due to low framerates. Even the company logos at startup are stuttering.The game always start in windowed mode, unless you go into the settings (which say it's set to fullscreen) and untick and retick the tick box and save the settings. Every. Single. Time.The game is locked in 1280x720 resolution, you can't make it higher or lower.I was looking forward to this game a lot, and have been wanting it since its Xbox 360 days, the plot and gameplay seem amazing, but it's unplayable.If I just knew how, I'd demand a refund! Take this game from my hands, I don't want it, and I wish I didn't pay for it!NOT Recommended!			"

												How much to like this game is determined by one question: How much do you like Twin Peaks?Because if you love David Lynch's show, then you will love everything about Deadly Premontion: Memorable and abstract characters, set in a small town in Washington with gameplay that feels like it was conceived in the Resident Evil 4 era. If you like a good weird experience, you will find it with York and Zach.  HOWEVER...!Be warned that this is HORRIBLE PC port of an already pretty technically flawed game and it tends to crash. A lot. Your experience might be even worse than mine because I almost completed the main game, but got stuck when the last patch made it pretty much unplayable for me.			"

												This game is the perfect mix of terrible and worse; it's the expired milk in the fridge you know is bad, but that you know you're gonna smell anyway .  It's polarizing because everything from the voice acting, to the mechanics, to the graphics are mediocre, if not downright terrible, YET, the absolutely addicting story and the kooky, surrealist overtones make this game well worth the money (pro tip: play this game with a controller or not at all; it was never meant to be a PC game).  I don't care how pretentious it sounds, most people just don't understand this game.  It's meant to be a joke on itself in a sense because of how silly and cartoony everything seems to be, but don't let that fool you.  This game has a story of unparalleled depth in terms of video games, If you like surrealist art, if you enjoy the Monty Python films and the Flying Circus; if you like getting wasted and listening to The Bends while watching every Wallace and Grommit movie ever made with the volume off so the claymation sheep sound like Thom Yorke, I promise you will love this game more than most members of your family.  The reason it was never commercially successful was because it is meant for a certain kind of player who's in a certain kind of mood for 8-12 hours every so often.  This game can be fun multiple times through because the combat, while admittedly pretty clumsy mixes things up enough to keep you on your toes, and the various things you can buy and the mini-games make sure the experience doesn't become too heavy.  To sum things up, don't buy this game if you're looking for a typical shooter or a typical survival horror game, or a typical anything.  This game is truly one of a kind, and if you can learn to appreciate is flaws, you will understand where I'm coming from.  I've never played a game this truly original in my whole 15-odd years as a gamer.  If it weren't for the original KOTOR, this would be my favorite game ever.  10/10.  "

												Let me tell you something about Deadly Premonition.  The controls are clunky, and driving, being maybe half of the game, is a nightmare. The character animations are awkward and at times terrifying. The squirrels make public-domain monkey noises and the fast travel mechanic (if you get it) is punctuated with a cartoon car crash sound. The voice acting ranges from actually enjoyable to god-awful. Half of the time, the game crashes or won't let me load my saves, and I had to download a patch just to get the game to run at over 720p. This might be one of the best games I've ever played.'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity.This isn't a game for everyone, but if you do like it, it's like this game was made for you. In short: This game is awful. I love every awful moment of it.			"

												It's an incredible game, it's simultaneously terrible and amazing (beyond ""so bad it's good"", you're going to have to take my word for it)making for one of the most unique, confusing, hilarious, and quotable gaming experiences ever to grace the face of the universe.So why not recommended, you might ask?The port.Japan is notorious for their terrible PC ports, but this one reaches an all time low, it really is that bad.If you pick this up prepare to be greeted with such lovely features such as:720p resolution lock (Can be fixed by DPFix)15fps, but only half the time you start the game. Also note it's still running at 60 (evident by some of the camera movement and the pause menu, but the timing is messed up for everything else).Bad controller support. This game was originally a XBox 360 game, which makes the dev's choice of DirectInput over XInput make even less sense. Editing controller binding happens in the launcher and is extremely limited & finicky (DPFix does give you a few more options through ini files).Random crashes, the game tends to crash randomly due to memory leaks or just bugs in the game code. There's some ways to lessen the effect but no way to get rid of all of them.Not so random crashes, some parts of the the game just outright crash and you have to do all sorts of stuff to try to work around them (such as running in compatibility mode for Win98, or rebooting your PC), but even that's not as bad asSave file corruption, save files can easily become corrupted, causing the game to crash soon after load, and usually in the same spots. Sometimes the only work around is to delete your save and start again. Save often and backup saves often.It's a great game but it's just not worth the money they're asking for considering the state of the port, however if it goes really cheap it might be worth the gamble if you can make the port bearable.If you are a XB360 or PS3 owner then I highly recommended you pick it up for one of those if you can find it cheap (might need to import the PS3 version however).If you just want your dose of SWERY then I suggest you go and pick up D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which is cheaper and has a good PC port (Unreal Engine 3).

Simply put, I love this game. York is a humourous and fun character and the way he reacts with the Greenvale citizens is also great. That said this game crashes like CRAZY, even after installing a few mods to fix it. Deadly Premonition is a labour of love, and while I haven't finished it yet it's been worth it so far.

												Deadly Premonition sucks. Ultimately, it fails on all levels. The setup of the story is actually pretty good. It's obviously biting off Twin Peaks. A weirdo FBI agent is sent to investigate a murder with supernatural overtones in a small town filled with wacky characters. The obvious inspirations for the game play are Silent Hill and Resident Evil. There are parts where a location transforms into a twisted nightmare version of the place and its filled with monsters and the player has to make their way through the nightmare version of the location to find clues to help the investigation. So, the combat takes place really in the protagonists mind. The combat gets really repetitive and boring really quick. There's really just one type of enemy to fight for most of the game besides bosses. Later there's another type that's even more boring and repetitive to fight. Every location ends up being the same thing. To gather the necessary clues you gotta wade through a series of narrow corridors fighting the same boring enemies over and over again. The combat is really clunky too like a Resident Evil game. There is one interesting part of this, though. At some point the legendary supernatural killer of the story, The Raincoat Killer, will track you down and the screen splits so you can also see through the killers eyes and your own point of view simultaneously. You need to hide from  him for a certain amount of time before he gives up and goes away. Usually, right after this section there will be a chase sequence that's kind of like an on-rails quick time event where you need to escape from The Raincoat Killer.  These encounters were fun the first few times, but even these interesting parts get repetitive as they are used over and over again. So, the actual combat portion of this game is a big dud. There's also a lot of driving that needs to be done in this game. It is also no fun. The cars handle terribly and they can even run out of gas. This is supposed to be an open-world exploration adventure game, but the fuel tank keeps a leash on you so its an annoying concern that made me not want to even bother with exploring the environment. Really, all there is anyway is some random collectibles to find littered around and also some side quests. So, the driving portion is also not any fun. The PC version is a really bad port too. It crashes ALL the time. I lost several hours to stupid crashes that can and will strike at any time. There was even one cut scene that would guaranteed crash the game. I had to change the compatibility mode and some other options to get past this stupid bug. The game is originally capped at 30 fps and 720p. Ridiculous! The same guy that fixed this outrage for Dark Souls did a fix for Deadly Premonition too, but like the DS one, it seems like it just plain wears off after a while and the game reverts back to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and frame rate.  I had to re-start the final boss because the game was running so horribly it wouldn't even register inputs from the controller. One thing I did find at least amusing is that if you don't have your clothes cleaned every so often, flies will start buzzing around your character because of your stinky clothes. I got a chuckle of watching cut scenes where these big fat (white?) flies were swarming around this guy. Now to the story. The setup is intriguing. There's a serial killer on the loose which brings the FBI to the small town and while there, more people get murdered. I was hooked on the setup. However, once the story starts to explain what's going on and who is behind everything the story just falls completely apart. It's just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's like a ten year old's idea of a murder mystery. It's unbelievably bad. It's so dumb! I'm shocked and baffled that this story isn't completely ripped apart by everyone that has reviewed this absurd game. This game is also not scary, AT ALL. It fails in that department too. On the technical, atmosphere, narrative, and game play levels this game fails across the board and I definitely recommend you avoid this game.			"

												Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games of all time. That being said this game really isn't for everyone. Watch some gameplay or a review and you'll pretty much know if this game is for you. Twin Peaks style, Humorous, B-movie, clunky survival horror game. If any of those points intrigue you I highly recommend you check DP out. I'm aware the PC version has glaring issues, but I highly suggest you get this masterpiece on sale and do some tweaking with DP fix. You can also tweak the colors to your liking if the blue tint of the Director's Cut doesn't fit your personal taste. The PC also comes with all the DLC that was available when the DC originally launched on PS3. All in all, when it comes down to it, you either LOVE DP or HATE it. I urge anyone to give it a try as it is a unique and wonderful experience.Perhaps look into your coffee next time and see if you find your answer?			"

												tl;dr Don't buy the PC version under penalty of water boarding.I'm sure this game is great.  From what I've played of it, it seems brilliant.Not that I have much to go on, because after a week of working like it should, if randomly decided that I am indeed *not* allowed to use my gamepad.  That leaves me with either using they're half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥keyboard and mouse controls, which would be torturous enough without the added complication of the fact that I'm on a laptop that this game will overheat when set up in a way that allows for comfortable keyboard and mouse controls.  The other option is third party software to map the keyboard controls to a gamepad, but good luck with that; I thought they were working until I made the ill advised decision of entering a car.  If there exists an arcane enchantment that makes a fine-tuned JoyToKey mapping harmonize perfectly with their crappy launcher's controls that makes the already horrendous cars even slightly drivable, I'm all ears.But as it stands, I've essentially wasted three hours of my life trying to make someone else's game work.  I'm too dusgusted by the deplorable lack of any sort of quality control here to really care about any workarounds.  Getting the game to even start was already a workaround.  I've already put more time and effort into writing this stupid review than any ""developer"" put into making sure their controller support doesn't just decide to vanish.  I was lucky enough to get this game for free, so I can only give my deepest sympathies to anyone who was suckered into buy it.Even if you have no way of playing any other version, all this so-called  port will do is give you a taste of what is in all likelyhood a great game, before throwing some inconvenience, crash, or game-break at you.

												It is difficult to discern if this game is brilliantly bizarre or bizzarely brilliant. One thing is certain is that this game is not worth full price. There are no options to adjust the graphics; and the graphics suggest that is game has been poorly ported or created. The controls are fine, but employ tank controls for shooting. That is to say, movement is not allowed whilst aiming. The game does not have the horror vibe that the tags indicate. One last thing to note is the amount of loading screens and unnecessary sequences. If you pause the game you get an unnecessary sequence of bushes moving aside. Or when you pick up an item, it presents a slowly rotating image of the item. For buyers considering the game, wait for sale.			"

												Well, I've got to say that this game has a terrific intro where grandpa goes for a walk with his two grandkids through somewhere he knows isn't safe. He's right because dp.exe has stopped working. My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called ""repair"" fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway). Nothing seemed to help. It's not as though my system is so old or incompatible (ASUS i7 notebook with 8GB RAM & GeForece 610M with 2GB RAM running Win7)			"

												You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else.I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness,The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was ""I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.""The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird. The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game.This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.			"

												It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable. So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.			"

												Deadly Premonition is an odd one with a cult following. On a technical level it is not a very well made game but as for plot, characters and music it is one of the best ""games"" I've played in past couple of years. I've never seen Twin Peaks but many say if you've seen that series you'll get notice a lot of elements from it in this game.Originally I played this on the PS3 and picked up the PC version for £2 or so......It's a terrible port, probably the worst ever next to Saints Row 2. However as with Dark Souls, there is a resolution fix and fortunately for me at least there have been no further problems. In fact I'd say the PC version with the fix is better than the PS3 version due to the framerate (again for me) being 60fps as oppossed to the PS3's horrific sub 30fps in most cases.If you don't mind the technical issues, it's worth at least one playthrough just for the plot. The game itself is extremely easy anyway so you'll never really be stuck.			"

I absolutely love it.And it's not even ""so bad it's good"", I mean yeah, the graphics and animations and voices and everything are so kooky but it's an open world psychological survival horror thriller where everyone has their own schedules, and you have to eat/shave/do laudry and there's all sorts of weird side quests, some of which can't even be done until you've beaten it a few times, and Francis York Morgan is one of the single greatest video game characters ever.

												Deadly Premonition is a difficult thing to describe. Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country. To preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.TL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.			"

												CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.

												Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.			"

												For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning: The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.

												Alright, real talk. I don't play Sandbox games, and I played this a recommendation from a friend. I had no idea what to expect, and went in with almost zero expectations. The game, in short, is a mixed bag. It's plagued with coding errors, bugs and is a rather mediocre port. I highly recommend researching into this title to see if your computer can run it and avoid most of the glitches/crashes. I also recommend resetting if you ever come across any glitches or crashes, as this, for whatever reason, fixes a majority of them.Gameplay wise? It's kind like No More Heroes overworld (with dynamic time and weather) meets closed off extremely easy Resident Evil 4 sections. Actually most of the game is very easy, and saves are sprinkled everywhere (which helps with any crashes so save often). You'll probably spend the bulk of your time in the overworld, driving around the town. You'll interact with the townsfolk (If you've played Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii, this game also has a system where the NPCs have their own schedules. It's much easier to find people however, and are infinitely more rememberable however) and try to gather information to piece together what's happening. The shooting segments are pretty straight-forward and there's not really any major puzzles or anything to solve. The enemies aren't hugely varied either, once you play a few you got the general gist of them.Setting and story wise: If you're a fan of the short lived TV series Twin Peaks, the plot's basic premise is very similar: an unothordox FBI agent is sent to investigate the death and murder of a young girl, and finds a lot more. Cast is unothrodox and strange, as they are rememberable. It's definitely a ride, highs and lows. There's some cliches, and big bad is a little too obvious, but ultimately it doesn't detract from the fun.I bought this for 2.50 and put something like 30 hours into it, so there's plenty of content and the entry fee is very reasonable. This game is definitely a mixed bag, but speaking a gameplay centric kind of player, the story engrossed me and warmed my heart. It was geniunely refreshing to play this game, headaches and all. Bottomline; give it a shot if you think you can run it.			"

												The coffee! ""Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?""This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre. Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one ""normal,"" and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter. The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness. 8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again. "

There's an FBI agent who solves crimes with the help of his imaginary friend, but you're his imaginary friend... I think? He takes advice from his coffee and the soundtrack likes to play really ♥♥♥♥ed up sax solos when you fail a QTE. It seems like it wants to go for the survival horror angle but is just so weirdly written and presented that it feels more like a parody that loops back around and becomes terrifying in a drug-addled fever dream sort of way.All I can really say is give it a shot if it can be picked up in a sale for super cheap (like $5 cheap).

												A technical mess of a game but if you just let it simply 'be' this is a game unlike most others out there. The game has a David Lynch inspired cooky story that goes in some surprising directions, the cast of characters are diverse and are fun to interact with.A great game but also a terrible one. It's like a great B-Movie in that I can't recommend it to everyone but if you think you'll enjoy it you probably will... just give it a couple hours to sink in and come to the terms with the fact that the minute to minute gameplay is nothing to write home about!8/10			"

												Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.			"

												Deadly Premonition is weird. that is true. it's also eerily close in themes and plot to Twin Peaks, a show which the creator of Deadly Premonition claims to have never heard of. The graphics are uncanny valley, the writing seems purposefully enigmatic and strange, and the plot seems right out of an episode of the X-Files while still trying to play itself straight. But these are all reasons why Deadly Premonition is one of the greatest mystery games of all time. Engross yourself in the culture of a small american town as seen through the eyes of a japanese videogame developer. Take control of Agent Francis York Morgan as he reads the future in the clouds of his coffee, and shoots plant zombies while wearing a bright orange suit. Get paid by the goverment for shaving. And most of all, embrace the weird, and you might find yourself seeing the game for the piece of art that it is.			"

												Well, this game have both very positive and very negative reviews, with the positive praising it's narrative and the negative it's gameplay. They're both right, but in the end, i think that the game falls into the negative side for a couple of reasons: bad PC port with outdated graphics, fixed resolution and no settings; poor and repetitive sounds; poor shooting mechanics; bad map design, because while it's a small town everything it's spaced out; bugs and glitches; and for me the game crashed about 5-6 times. But beside the crashes, the game is completely playable, and i can recommend it for cheap because of: gripping story; interesting NPC's; you can relax, do 50 side-quests or replay chapters; nice soundtrack; plenty of achievements, has trading cards, and full gamepad support (no cloud though). It's a really weird and low budged game, but if you can overlook it's many faults, you may enjoy it if you get it on sale.			"

												This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those ""gameplay is king"" people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.			"

												OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch.But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the ""this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it"" games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game.I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today			"

												Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.(Note: Nominated for the ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award and not just because it's the first time I've ever seen a squirrel in a video game scream like a monkey, thought that scene definitely helped)Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical  discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt. - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy ""nightmare"" levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels.You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).- Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around.(The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)- Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic. - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).- Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that. The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer. - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.			"

												If you're looking for a game with a reasonable or comprehensible story, good graphics and interesting combat system turn back right now and run away. The story of this game cannot be absolutely understood as even the creators don't know what it all actually is about.Combat system is highly boring and enemies, well ... there are three main types : zombie, zombie with a gun and zombie moving along walls, which you will fight about 10 minutes with, without any sign of challenge or fun.Still, it's one of the best game I've ever played and I can't tell why, as I think no one who ever played it can. There is something so lovely about Deadly Premonition ... As some may say, it's so bad from almost every point of view, that it's actually awesome.But for good God do not buy it for full price.			"

												Some people love it, others despise it. One thing we should all agree on though is that this is the number one game when it comes  to references about Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.			"

												Deadly Premonition is one of the most unique games I have ever played. I could leave the review at that because really, that's all it is, at the end of the day. But, there's more to it, than that. This game pits you as Special Agent Francis 'York' Morgan, an FBI agent traveling to a small town to investigate a serial killer murder mystery. In this small town exists a special and unheard-of cast of characters, 50 side missions, collectibles, and a gruesome murder mystery story that was able to keep me interested the entire ride. Greenvale has such an off-air around it, I can't imagine these characters existing and interacting anywhere else. The dialogue/interactions between York and others is very entertaining. Though it's not the part of the game you should be focusing on, the combat is standard Resident Evil 4 over-the-shoulder style with some action buttons every now and again. From the town citizen's quarrels you help solve along side an intense investigation, to the very strange and touching character and character developments of York, to the troubleshooting; this game is unique and interesting. But, there is something to be said about the troubleshooting, as it will be a very core part of your experience.The games cons come in usually right from the start; you have to be able to get this game to work before you enjoy any of it (read the Discussions and Guides sections for this game, they can usually get you on the right path to getting it running and give you a good idea of what settings you can change around to get it to work, as there is no one set solution to getting it to work for everyone). The horrendous optimisation has made for some very unique bugs, such as crashing after chapter end scenes (turning autosave on can alleviate any progress lost, as it always crashes after it autosaves, for me), graphics going to absolute garbage during one type of weather (true clear), having to choose between running the game on Windows 98 compatibility mode and having almost no crashes but dealing with the game losing framerate over time and not being able to aim up or turning off compatibility mode completely letting you aim up and no lag over time but dealing with random crashes (chapter ends, looking up in the morning, general random (by the way, you can totally beat the game without ever aiming up, does make you have to get creative with some puzzles)) There's an area on the map that makes the screen do random white flashes and it hurts your eyes but its ONLY that area (you only get this issue if you don't run on Windows 98 compat mode, another trade off between compat and no compat mode). There's a game breaking bug on Chapter 9 where if you happen to decide you want to replay a chapter while on chapter 9, you will lose a key object you need to progress the story (simple fix is to back up your game save when you get to chap 9 and not replay any chapters during it).This game has a lot of technical issues, some I didn't think I would ever encounter, as a gamer. So, with that; it's hard to casually recommend this game. But, there's only one word that describes this game; unique. And I think that cult classic vibe uniqueness alone is well worth any amount of troubleshooting you have to go through to get it running. From start to finish, from every single side mission, I enjoyed it and highly recommend anyone into niche games, mystery games, comedy games, or anyone wanting something different, pick it up. If you can't get it running, you can always return it.NOTE: DON'T READ THE ACHIEVEMENTS IF YOU DON'T WANT THE STORY SPOILED FOR YOU.			"

												This game is great. It's so bad it's good and it wears its Twin Peaks inspiration on its sleeve. The background music frequently drowns out the voiceactors and the music is often inappropriate given the tone of the scene. Despite all of its flaws, the game is made with so much sincerity and heart it's incredibly likeable and enjoyable. It is honestly one of my favourite games I've ever played.But I cannot recommend it. Do not buy this from Steam. I run 64-bit Windows 7 and this game is an unplayable trainwreck. Part of this is the shoddy port, and part of this is... something else. I'm not sure what it is because the GoG version, while still having problems, is much more manageable. Crashes abound in this game, even with durante's DPFix. I have 4 hours logged and I only managed about 2 1/2 or 3 hours of actual play time because this game won't run. At this point, even after installing the patch and doing everything I did to get my GoG version to be somewhat stable, this can't even start up. It crashes immediately upon launch.Save yourself the trouble and buy this for the 360 or the PS3 if you can. If you cannot, then at least do yourself a favour and wait for the GoG version to be on sale (I got it for $2.50). If it doesn't work for you, their tech support will do their best to help you. And if it still doesn't work, then you'll get your money back.			"

												Do you like Twin Peaks? Do you like quirky Japanese games like Way of the Samurai and Yakuza? Can you put up with pretty poor gameplay in exchange for an amazing atmosphere, and a full podunk town to drive around and chat with amazing NPCs?Get it. The gameplay is trash, but it's one of the best videogame worlds to get lost in.			"

												The game is weird and quirky and if you like that, you will endure the crashes after every hour or so, the slow vehicles the bad navigation and the other things that make this game quirk.Seriously though the game crashing will drive you mad, but if you are the sort of person to put up with all the other things I mentioned, you will probably put up with frequently restarting too.

												Superbly interesting story, decent characters and well that's about it. The gameplay is clunky at best, driving, fighting and even just basic movement is impeded and would be considered bad on Playstation 1. I really wanted to finish and play this game but after the glitches, crashes and general non-starts of this game I have to recommend against this game. Even when it is 90% off or more. To be honest this game shouldn't be on the Steam Store with the horrendous issues it has. If you really want to know what happens in the storyline of this game, your best bet would be to watch it off of youtube.			"

												Interesting game. Graphically, it's really poor with a horrible mixture of low and hi rez textures. Gameplay wise, it starts off awful, and has the worst driving phyiscs of any game I have ever played. And the crashes, god the crashes. This game crashes, crashes and then crashes some more. I have never had a peice of software ever crash so much as this.And yet... something oddly compelling about it, I would just grit my teeth, restart, and continue.Finished the game and the ending was just as odd as the beginning. Still, it was worth playing, at least once - I doubt I'll ever install and play it again though.			"

												EDIT: Stuff it I don't recommend this game. Damn quick time events and frustrating quick time events.Buyer beware: This game is buggy as all hell. It crashes randomly. There is a workaround but you need patience to play it. That said this is one hell of an interesting game the dialogue and characters are unique and strange. Like David Lynch made a Twin Peaks game. One mission has you racing a woman home before her pot cools down. Pot as in soup pot.The gameplay is pretty bad though. Enemies are more annoying than dangerous. You spend a large part of the game driving around and you get very little clue as to where and when the side quests take place.Do I recommend it... I don't know. If you have a high **** threshold and enjoy surreal dialogue and obscure plot lines then go for it. If you want your games to look good and runs well the hell no.			"

												I remember picking up that game for 30€ on Xbox360, close to its release, not really knowing what it was all about, discovering the aliasing, the horrible textures, the stiff animations and the myriad of incomprehensible game-design choices. Like, why the hell does the map rotate in the map-menu? It's confusing as hell, you can't find anything because of that. Oh and why do I have to look at it so closely? Why is the game using the music so strangely? It sometimes feels like there are four tracks and it's using some of them in the weirdest moments. Why are does survival/shooting session so boring and tedious, and why aren't they integrated better in the rest of the game? Why is the car so slow and why is the steering angle so narrow?Why...?You would think that ""what the f*ck?"" would be a better question to go along the strange nature of the game. But at first, you'll be far too busy questionning every decision made during the development process, to really, thoroughly pay attention to how much the game is up there in its head. You are probably going to hate it for a while. But you are going to stick with it, wanting to come back.At first, the main character makes you stay. He talks to himself, to you maybe. And you'll want to hear what he has to say when you'll first him talk to you about ""Jaws"". Then you are going to stay for the plot, ripping off Twin Peaks so amazingly well and with its very own quirks, with a whole new level of bizarre, that you won't even be able to say that it is plagiarism, when it obviously is plagiarism. Then you are going to understand the crappy controls, deal with it, and actually explore the map, talk to every character and learn about there great and diverse personalities, even with the poor navigation help that the game gives you (it's hard to find anything with the game this ugly). And hopefully, you are going to be touched, creeped out and amused (a lot) by the story, amazed by the twists and turns, the gameplay even, not in it's execution, but in its structure and ideas that wan and will works (sometimes not, let's be honest). And hopefully, you are going to LOVE IT.That's what happened to me. That's what happened to all my friends who enjoyed it. Give it six hours. Give it the time to lead you to the big reunion in the community center. At that point, you'll be far too concern about the plot to let the amazingly low production value steer you away from the game. Hell, you'll probably even enjoy the game despite AND because of that poor production value that, somehow, adds to the game's personality.I do realize that I shouldn't recommand that PC version because it is really unstable. I only played 11 hours so far and already had a three or four crashes. But hear me out; DPfix for the resolution and windowed without border mode + controller patch from the devs, and you can do this. Save often! If you can't play it on Xbox 360 (the best version) or on PS3 (same but with new cutscenes and a framerate from hell), go for this one. It's not great, but it's just passable enough not to ruin the game (IF YOU SAVE OFTEN).TL;DRThe cult following doesn't come out nowhere. This one is a giver and a taker. You'll need patience, sure. But once you are in, the game won't let you go and there is a big chance it will become one of your favorites. Unfortunatley, it is a really (really) poor port on PC, but of the greatest diamond in the rough I have ever played. I recommend the game wholeheartedly. And if you can't have it another way, I recommend the PC version...reluctantly.			"

												I really wanted to like the game. It's got  interesting story likable characters and great atmosphere of a mystery in a small town(which kinda reminded me of Pathologic one of my favourie games of all time) but IT CRASHES SO OFTEN I can't play this! Like CRASH CRASH CRASH each twenty minutes or so in chapter 6. And from what I read I'm lucky to get that far. Won't even launch for many people. After the last crash I ragedeleted it and just decided to read the plot. And maybe watch walkthrough on youtube or whatever.Even though I tried we just can't be together. Not under these conditions.			"
