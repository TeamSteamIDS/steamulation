Early Access Review
								MouseCraft is a puzzle game that should appeal to casual gamers and hardcore puzzle enthusiasts alike. Finding one solution to pass a level is usually trivial, but if you aim to collect every anima shard and get all three mice to the cheese, you might be in for a challenge.The first stage is relatively simple and does a good job of introducing you to the gameplay mechanics. By the end of stage two though, I found myself genuinely stumped at some of the puzzles. I probably spent a good ten minutes or more figuring out some of those last challenges.The game also has a cutesy story in between stages that I found charming in a quirky way. If you've played these kinds of puzzle games before, you probably know what to expect in terms of exposition. It's never going to win a video game award for best story, but it serves its purpose in providing some small reward for progression.Overall, the 80 levels should take 6-10 hours to complete, depending on your skills with puzzle solving, and there's enough variation to keep you entertained throughout the game. There is also a very good and intuitive level editor that should provide additional content through Steam Workshop when support for it is added. In the meantime, it's possible to share and download player created levels via a Dropbox account the developer has set up.It's a game I don't hesitate to recommend and it is among my absolute favourites in the puzzle genre.

												~=Updated to reflect the official release=~Quick rundown: * Straightfoward gameplay;* Appealing to all ages;* Well polished;* Colorful graphics;* Good soundtrack;* Easy cheevos for achievement hunters;* Enough content to justify the price (the level editor is awesome!).---------------Mousecraft is a delightful casual experience. The puzzles are straighforward, but propose a nice, non-frustrating challenge should you decide to get a ""Perfect"" rating.I think the game finds a nice balance in its audience as it can appeal to both the young and the ""old."" From personal experience, teenagers and overall competitive people will not enjoy the game very much as it is not fast paced and does not rely on skill, but rather your ability to analyze a situation and consider all the elements that are part of it. It does have leaderboards, but the scoring system is a bit obscure, making competition somewhat pointless.To me, it is a perfect game to play after a stressful day to unwind. It is colorful, cute, and the cat scientist on the background, Schrödinger, always makes me smile with his reactions to the things you do. So, even if you fail a puzzle, it is still fun to watch him react to it -- you don't feel like you're losing, but that you should try better next time.I'd also recommend this game to achievement hunters: it is very easy to get all the achievements; the second quickest I ever played. So even if you're not into puzzles, it should be simple to get it to 100% (especially with all the guides already available) and crank up your achievement percentage up a bit. Plus you'll be supporting a really cool indie developer -- they're awesome, hard-working people that have a lot of creativity and good ideas to share.I've followed this project for quite a long time while it was in development, and I must say they did quite a good job, especially for being their first game. The quality is impressive, and the amount of polish shows they're really enjoying what they are doing. That alone makes them deserve our support. Crunching Koalas is an innovative indie game developer that brings that much-needed breath of fresh air to our gaming community, and I am looking forward to many other great games they might create.

Nice and smart iteration of Blocks That Matter (BTM) and Tetrobot & Co. (T&Co) ideas.It’s about: helping mice get their deserved piece of cheese by setting up blocks of widely-known shapes and using level's enviroment; deliver all mice to extraction point safely for higher score; collecting special crystals to unlock next levels; collecting bombs and exploding some of the blocks to clear the way or ""create"" a way; avoiding deadly raptoids - mechanized rats who're trying to hunt your mice down; sophisticated ways to execute raptoids: drown them in acid, give an electric shock, explode with special ""TNT""-blocks or just drop one of your default blocks on its head;  finding out the reason why this scientist-cat invented all that (my personal applause for the ending).Why you should play this: you played BTM or T&Co., liked it and looking for something very similar; indirect control brings fresh air to the puzzle - you need to predict consequences, not ""do then think how to deal with consequences""; it certainly develops your imagination; mice facing the obstacle not just stop and stand still - they turn around and moving in opposite direction: sometimes it's the core to beat another level; enviroment and kind of blocks are changing - you unlock new features by completing levels;  ""Undo"" and ""Pause"" buttons help to keep your hair on.Why you may not like it: some of the levels look overloaded with blocks and details - they usually can be solved just with enumeration of possibilities; as any puzzle game after some time it can feel boring; 100 levels would be better and look more round number than 80.15 hours of brainstorm for 10 seconds of laugh in the end. And, that's worth it! "

												Its good looking puzzle game. Its just too easy. For 80 levels i had to think a little bit harder about maybe 4 or 5 of them.+ simple game mechanics have great potential to create something amazing (maze + tetris like pieces with different functions),+ you can to do it yourself in built in level creator (huge plus for implementing this),- to unveil its true value this game should have Steam Workshop!!! I would love to see what puzzles were created by other people!!!I had some fun with this little game, but if you are looking for something challenging - it is not the game you are looking for.			"

'MouseCraft' is a combination of Tetris and Lemmings as puzzle game with mice.Desc:Your goal is to guide every 3 mice in each level to the exit (cheese). Each level gives you certain amount of blocks which can be rotated and placed everywhere. You have to collect in some levels blue crystals to unlock the next level.Within the first level you only have ""normal"" blocks like the Z, L or I of Tetris but over the time you unlock new blocks like a jelly block which prevents a mouse to die when it fall down more than 3 blocks. There are altogether 80 levels.Pros:+ low raising difficulty level+ beatable game+ cute animations+ built in level creator(+ achievements [all are fair])Cons:- too easy (only 5 or 6 levels are a bit harder)--- no Steam Workshop (game concept is crying out for! and it still has a built in level creator how silly)- only story mode (means 80 levels)Recommended!, only if it's on sale, because it's not really challenging.7/10 "

												I got this in a bundle and I must say the trailers left me skeptikal: I thought the game would be very basic with little variety and creativity. But thankfully, Mousecraft is much better than I first thought.You must help mice reach each level's destination and collect crystals along the way. The mice go mindlesly forward and your only way to help them is by using Tetris-like blocks to make them a viable path. It sound basic, but Mousecraft regularly introduces new kinds of blocks (explosive, bouncy, fragile, recyclable...) and hazards. Coupled with some clever level design, it keeps things fresh until the end. I found the general difficulty level perfectly suited to my tastes: it often requires careful thinking and planning, while remaining solvable for non-superhuman beings (I'm looking at you, Spacechem!)All is not rosy though. There are some issues, none of them game-breaking, but slightly annoying:- Mild bugs- While I enjoyed the general difficulty level, the difficulty curve was somewhat random with some levels in the middle much more difficult than those in the end.- The visuals and music lack variety. It makes Mousecraft look more like a mobile game than a fully-fledged PC title.But overall, it's well worth the time and money for puzzle enthusiast who appreaciate a reasonable challenge.			"

												Mousecraft is very similar to tetris puzzles, using the same style blocks only with a twist. You get a set amount of differant blocks to use and you must place them in a way so the mice can get to the cheese with out killing them. You also must try and collect the crystals as well. As you progress through the puzzles you earn more blocks, being differant type's, jelly blocks for                                                                        the softer landings and bomb blocks to blow stuff up and many more.There is also Steam Acheviements to be earned as well. The game has just been updated and finished so this is very good news. I have enjoyed playing Mousecraft and the little mice are very cute, so if you like puzzle type games then I'm sure you'll like this little gem. :)			"

								MouseCraft is Tetris mixed with Lemmings, but instead of lemmings there are mice. It's original and works very well. I don't really know what more to say about it, because I think most of us will be able to visualize what it will play like now. If you like the sound of it, just buy it already.[Rating: 73/100]			"

												Mousecraft is a solid little puzzle game worth getting at half price or below. I don't think it has enough hours of gameplay to get at full price, though.In the game you place tetrominos (combinations of four blocks for those not familiar with that term) on the platform in order to help your mice get to the cheese. The 80 levels increase steadily in difficulty, adding different obstacles and kinds of blocks to make things different. It's a good puzzle game, and enough of a challenge to keep you playing all the levels, without getting too difficult.As usual my kind of complaint with puzzle games like this is that there are just not enough levels, but at least this one comes with a level editor so there's always more in the workshop.Also a good game for 100% achievement hunters. It only took me 7 hours to fully finish the game, and if some of the puzzles are a little too tricky for you, I'm sure there are guides out there to help you.			"

												One great thing about this game is you get to a level which looks fiendishly difficult, you just place a few blocks and start it up and then you're on your way. Then you can start to rack your brain on how to get all the crystals (shards). NICE FAMILIAR TETRIS BLOCKS BUT TETRIS SKILLS ARE NOT REQUIRED HERE ! Excellent game all round, highly recommended.			"

												Bought this a while back when it was early access because it looked so amazing and I finally got around to playing it. I have to say, it's highly amusing and entertaining. Of course the first levels are simple, as with any game you have to understand the basics. This actually reminds me of the gifted program IQ testing, being able to predict an outcome many steps ahead (except with much less mouse death).  I find some levels incredibly easy and others I rage at and have to walk away from for a few minutes. At one point I was yelling and calling the developers of the game some choice names... all in good fun. I wouldn't exactly compare it to tetris, its about using your pieces wisely, not fitting them together neatly. If you are actually trying to complete all of the goals (all three mice, all the shards) it can be challenging... and I feel for the first mouse, who I have dubbed ""bomb squad mouse,"" for good reason.Summary:PROS-Adorable graphics-Yes, it is actually challeging if you seek perfection-No crashes, well made-I'd call it a brain game, exercising logic, prediction and cause/effect-Mice. And Schrödinger.-Is nothing like a phone game in my opinion. And may it never become one.CONS-May cause shouting at inanimate objects-Really that's it, except a minor bug. After level 30 or so my game stopped showing ""perfect score"" at the end of a level, the little TV says 0/3 etc, though the Stats accurately show scores so it's hardly a big deal. If anyone else has encountered this problem and fixed it let me know.BUY THE GAME.			"

												Pros:-Fun fusion of puzzle styles.-Cute graphics.-Great music.-Easy to pick up.-Satisfying solutions to puzzles.Cons:-May be too easy for some, lacking in many real head scratchers until late in the game.-Simplistic in places.During the winter of 2012/2013, I went to war with the mouse expeditionary force that had invaded my flat. Taking advantage of the crumbling foundations of the old terrace building I live in, they attempted to take over. Eventually I managed to fight back the mice incursion and block off their access into my territory. I tell you this as I think it’s important to be transparent with the fact that the mice and I have history. So hopefully you can trust that when I say the mice in Mousecraft are adorable and I really wanted to keep them safe, I really mean it.Mousecraft is the new game from the wonderfully named Crunching Koalas. The idea is simple, guide mice through a level to the cheese. Because science. The gameplay is a curious mix of Tetris and Lemmings and I have been utterly charmed by this game. It’s bright and colourful, the music toe tappingly jolly and the fusion of puzzle classics works intuitively and offers some fun mazes to take on.Right off the bat, the game made me smile by featuring a cat scientist named Schrödinger. Poor old Shrödy has a problem, he desperately wants to continue his animal experiments but he doesn’t have enough dosh to fund them and build his mouse powered pipe dream. Fortunately for him, and indeed the scientific process in general, a mysterious benefactor steps in to offer to fund the experiments in exchange for crystals the mice collect. Each level gives you a set of obstacles to get across and a few “Tetrominos” blocks to form a path for the mice. Once let out of their mouse wheel, the mice won’t stop until they have the cheese at the end. And who could blame them? While things start very simplistic and a little too obvious with the solutions to each level, the game adds features regularly enough to keep interest up. It’s not long until you are faced with obstacles such as robot rats, exploding blocks, perilous falls or acid baths.This leads to some unfortunately ethical quandaries. Just why is this mad scientist cat doing these experiments in the first place? What possible reason could he have had to construct mice hating robot rats, and then to put them together in the same maze? Why does he need mouse activated high explosives as part of his mouse based experimentation. In short, I’m dubious as to whether Dr Schrödinger’s experiments meet the regulations required by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.Luckily, our mysterious benefactor doesn’t appear to care about such things and is happy to allow all sorts of out of control science to go ahead. So the game is free to chuck in more tools for aiding the mice, such as a jelly block to break their fall (mice can only free fall three tiles), block busting bombs to clear the path or crumbling blocks to separate the trio of mice and put them on different paths. It all feels well balanced and thought through, creating fun puzzles that are satisfying to pass but don’t frustrate. It may lack complexity and experienced puzzle gamers may not be too challenged on most levels, but the whole experience is satisfying and presented in such an amusing way that it doesn’t detract from the enjoyment of the game. Some levels can feel too similar to the last and there isn't much variety in the sound effects, but it introduces new elements regularly enough that any hints of repetition are dealt with quickly.With four sections of twenty levels each, there are plenty of puzzles to solve. On top of that there is a level creator to build your own fiendish puzzles, although there is not yet any in-game method of sharing levels with the community. User-made levels can be downloaded by getting files from people on the forums, but hopefully a more intuitive sharing system can be implemented in a future update. I’ve been enjoying my time with Mousecraft. It’s a cute and perfectly paced puzzle game with some great ideas and adorable graphics. It’s currently part of the Indie Piñata promotion (a selection of games on discount with further discounts if you own any of the others in the selection) and offers players around 5-6 hours of charming puzzling for the main game. It’s helped me put the mouse war of 2012/13 behind me and heal old wounds. For that, I am eternally grateful. Mice, all is forgiven.From Coffee Break Gaming[www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk].			"

												Mousecraft is a fun little puzzle game. Ignore the sales pitch about Tetris and Lemmings though, the actual gameplay doesn't really have much in common with either of them.The puzzles themselves are fairly traditional fare. For each level you are given a set of blocks that you need to place on the map to guide your mice to cheese and collect as many crystals along the way as possible. Overall the levels are pretty simple, even if the addition of different special blocks in later levels does complicate things a little bit.The action does happen in realtime, but as you can pause and undo freely, things never get too hectic. Overall the difficulty level was pretty low, there's pretty much always an obvious solution that gets you at least some of the mice and crystals and usually even the perfect solution is not that hard to figure out.Despite some minor flaws Mousecraft is a pretty enjoyable experience and I'd recommend it to any fans of simple puzzle games.The good:- Clear colorful art- Decent amount of levels- Good variety of different blocksThe bad:- Too easy- No way to check exactly how many mice/crystals you have collected in each levelThe ugly:- Occasional UI issues, restarting the game generally resolved these problems			"

I could see this as a good game, but I was left disappointed.In the end, this is just not the puzzle game I was looking for, but I can understand others liking it.  The premise: lead mice to the cheese reminiscent of Lemmings in a game with a fabulous graphics style...   Sure thing!  I'm in!Each level you have 3 mice to get to the end, and 3 gems to get along the way for a Perfect score.  To guide and protect the mice, you place ""Tetris"" shaped pieces for the mice to climb over, to use as bridges, to fill gaps, to crush evil 'robot rats', or you can use bombs to remove certain already placed blocks.  Um, okay, I'll go along with this and see where it goes.  The mice can climb up one brick, and fall 3 bricks high without harm.  So you place blocks along the way to meet those requirements and as the game progresses they introduce other blocks.  Blocks allowing mice to land safely from great heights (jelly bricks), for example.In completing the first 22 or so (of 80) levels, I saw there was usually a single-solution ""trick"" to the level more than just using logic to solve a puzzle.  At least that's how it seems to me.  And I got kind of tired seeing if I could find the trick to get a perfect score.Overall:  It's a great style, I love the idea and the gameplay itself is pretty well done, but I didn't like placing Tetris"" blocks and looking for tricks to solve a puzzle.  7 out of 10.

												Okay, so you've got to get your mice from their hamster wheel to the cheese by positioning various kinds of blocks and avoiding obstacles. There's no time limit so you can sit back and carefully consider all the possible ways of achieving that goal. The levels start out very easy and get more challenging as you progress. You'll eventually find yourself staring at the screen, running possible permutations through your head until.... ""eureka!"", you figure it out and feel a right smarty-pants... until you see the next puzzle.Different kinds of Tetromino-shaped blocks are introduced throughout the game to keep it fresh and interesting. These include jelly, explosive and electric blocks. There are also water and acid hazards to add to the challenge.The game is addictive. When I finished it I wanted to go back and gold-star every level. And when that's done there are a bunch of Achievements to be had as well. Most of them you'll get playing through the story mode, but there are others to aim for, too, like frying 10 mice!For one of the Achievements you have to make your own puzzle in the Level Editor. You know, Nintendo are really pushing level design in games like Pushmo World, Mario vs Donkey Kong, Smash Bros and soon, Mario Maker. Well, you can do it in MouseCraft, too. It would be nice if levels could be shared via Steam Workshop instead of in the forums, but it's a minor gripe. Overall, I really enjoyed Mousecraft and wholeheartedly recommend it to puzzle game fans.			"

I like the simple design and the non-bloated graphics, the sound is great and not annoying! Thumbs up!			"

												How in all the hells does this thing have a 96% approval rating? This is a game that should be ad-paid on mobile, but it's $15 on Steam instead. I'm not even exaggerating. The puzzles and mechanics are ridiculously simple. I'm not talking casual-level simple, I'm talking 'may entertain a small child' simple. This is NOT a cross between Tetris and Lemmings. You don't have block falling from the sky that you have to accomodate, you just pick them up and place them where you want them at any time you wish. You also don't have a team of skilled laborers. You just have 3 idiot mice that walk forward and can climb 1 block and fall up to 3. The ONLY thing this game draws from Tetris is the shape of the tetrominoes, and the ONLY thing it draws from Lemmings is rodents that continually walk forward.Both Tetris and Lemmings are better games than this, and you can play both of them for free.This is a rip-off.

												MouseCraft is sorta a mix between Mouse Trap and Tetris. Many of the stages are easy to figure out after a run or two through some mishaps, so it's a great little timekiller that should not get one frustrated. There are a good number of specialty blocks/items that make figuring out a safe passage for your mice an interesting puzzle, but luckily the player is allowed to learn these since new blocks/items are phased into gameplay rather being dumped all at once.There is not really much of a story as far as I can tell; I've made it halfway through the stages and it has been trap after trap. Perhaps there's one at the end? I'll update when I get there.			"

												Highly recommended, with an additional ""Very"" if you know what a Lemming is and if you still wake up to the crunch of Tetris blocks dropping from your room's ceiling.Here's a new batch of rodents to scratch your puzzle itch. And you can't drop 4-pieces for a Tetris.There's this mad scientist cat Schrödinger running experiments FOR SCIENCE, all of them involving three mice making their way through a puzzle-maze thingie. It's your job to make sure at least one mouse makes it safely from its little wheel to a faraway piece of cheese.That's the core premise. Your mice are blissfully stupid and just walk in a straight line until they hit an obstacle they can't jump over, which causes them to turn. You're given a couple of ""tetris"" pieces, and must drop them into the right spot to create a path to the exit. Mice don't jump very high- one block, that's it. Mice also can die from a long drop, or being squished by a tetris piece. It's a dangerous lab for sure.One thing that MouseCraft does absolutely great is establishing the puzzle formula and then adding to it. As usual the first few levels are really easy, and once you've got the basics down, more and more elements are added. In order to make it into later levels you need a certain amount of glowing blue crystals, which your mice can pick up on their way. Enemies (robot rats) start to roam the levels. Blocks can be destroyed with pickup bombs, slippery ice blocks and bouncy jello blocks are added to your arsenal. And more often than not there is a simple solution to a level, but in oder to rescue all three mice and collect all the goodies, you'll need to think around corners a bit. At around level 12 I found myself starting to really think, instead of just recognizing a standard challenge ""that has been done in other games"". It's a solid puzzler and it seems to deploy its collection of blocks, timing, environmental hazards and the greed to score ""perfect"" to great effect.It's also a downright cute game. The 3D models are nicely animated, from the sweet little mice to the downright hilarious Schrödinger, who always keeps an eye on the experiment with gleeful joy or puzzled amazement. The sound effects are okay, but not outstanding; the music however, really can get stuck in your head. It's all really whimsical and cartoonish; my only gripe is that the mice themselves just lack the personality of their Lemmings ancestors. Controls are simple and easy. Blocks are picked and places with a single mouse click, and the interface allows quick restart and even has a ""fast forward"" button to speed up the slow pace of the rodent odyssey. You also get an ""active pause"" that freezes time but allows you to still place blocks- all you need is there in the form of friendly large buttons.Despite the child-friendly presentation (no violence at all, even a dead mouse just turns into... a cartoon mouse ghost) the puzzle difficulty starts to ramp towards the end of the first ""map"" (20 levels), and the game boasts a total of 80 levels- so I haven't even made it to the halfway mark and can't say how tricky things will be later on. It's probably too hard for children, who may still enjoy watching someone play the game. It has this thick cute charming feel.80 levels are a good amount of content, too, especially when you're the kind of player who MUST have all the perfect scores. And if 80 levels are NOT enough, you can make your own with an easy-to-use level editor. With Steam integration in place, you can easily make your own contraptions and share them as you see fit.The price is probably a bit higher than one expects from a ""simple puzzler"" these days- but the overall quality of the game easily justifies the price tag. You get a really polished, solid brain-twister here, you can make your own levels, and did I mention how insanely cute the mice are? Really, give it a go!			"

												An OK puzzle game, will admit to looking at the guide a couple of times on the way through for a few levels I found particularly difficult to get 100% on on the way through. The addition of the moving block makes the last 15 levels incredibly easy. Not exactly an amazing story, but a fairly relaxing way to pass the time.			"

												I've grown more and more appreciative of the casual puzzler indie game genre and I must say that MouseCraft is one of the best I've played. Although I'd still identify as a ""core"" gamer, sometimes you just need something that's slower paced but still challenging. I appreciate the art, the humor and also find the game mechanic of an updated lemmings to be quite enjoyable. This game is a glorious example of how Steam Greenlight can bring gems to the surface that might have otherwise been lost to potential fans.			"

												This puzzle game is a cute, casual timewaster that I'd rather play on a mobile device than a computer. The learning curve is also sharp - the tutorial levers are beyond obvious, but the first real level had me truly stumped on how to get a perfect for 5 minutes.  If you enjoy cute puzzles, pick it up in sale. I got it 50% off but still feel like I overpaid.  It is satisfying to crunch the robots though.			"

												MouseCraft is cross somewhere between Lemmings and Tetris, which might sound bit strange mix, but it works pretty well. Both of those games are classics, everybody should know Tetris and while Lemmings isn't as widely know, it can be considered a cult hit. For those that weren't playing games during 90s, in short Lemmings was game where lemmings needed to be lead safely to exit. That was done by assigning different tasks like digging to few of the lemmings. As that has to be done at the same time when lemmings were dumbly walking forward, things could get quite hectic. In more difficult levels that lead quite ofthen to giving up by blowing up all the remaining lemmings. What Mousecraft has taken from Lemmings is that mice have to be lead to cheese.  They're as dumb as lemmings and will keep on walking forward, no matter if they will drop to acid pool for example. How those dangers are avoided is that blocks can be dropped and that block will for example cover pool of acid. Or more commonly those blocks can form stairs that mice will climb up to the cheese. Challenge comes from shape of the blocks and fitting them with the obstacles. Blocks have been predefined to suit the level. How they suit the level and help the mice with their objective is up to you to figure out. Regular blocks are just the beginning as later levels introduce blocks that have new features.Game can be finished in a weekend, though finishing all the levels perfectly provides additional challenge. To me it felt like most difficult part of the game is somewhere in the middle. Last part of the game has less challenging puzzles, challenge comes more from timing everything right in order not to squash the mice with the blocks. There's no Workshop support, so sharing levels created with the level editor is not as easy it could be. Get it, if you like puzzle games.			"

												A nice little puzzler thats well polished and fun to play through. Graphics and UI obviously designed for tablet audience but work well enough with PC/Mouse too.  The difficulty level is pretty similar all the way through with majority of puzzles in the easy/moderate range. The variety is adequate with introduction of different brick types but the mice behaviour remains the same so its definately nothing like 'Lemmings' which is mentioned in the description.The level editor is a nice touch and the game would have benefit from Steam Workshop integration.Overall a solid game with 5-10hrs of gameplay over 80 levels. Probably a bit much at full price but I picked it up -60% and for that its well worth the price.			"

								Good for casual puzzle games. The difficulty so far may be not enough for hardcore puzzle players. The graphics, music and effects for a puzzle game is great.The game divided into 4 sections and the beta version only available 2 sections and 1 more level from the 3rd section, which means 41 levels. There should be 80 levels in the full game.As the game goes, new features will be unlocked, giving more variety things to the puzzle.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the launch of the game, I played through the whole game in several hours. Most of the remaining 39 levels are not tricky. So if you hope for some hardcore puzzle game, this may not give you satisfactory, and it's a little bit expensive for the game this short.Hopefully there's a level editor. I'm looking forward to release some more difficult puzzles.			"

												Not if you want to play on Linux / Steam OS with a Controller. I now need to place some bombs, however the Howto Popups only mention Keyboard shortcuts.			"

												Commercial with great voice acting! The game doesn't have it, though, and immediately is a lot less amusing than you'd think. The puzzles don't actually get interesting before you close the game and uninstall. Pity.			"

												Eh, the trailer is misleading, there is no voice acting whatsoever in the game. Also, I find it amazing how this was early access for steam but yet has the interface of a smartphone app. Something is not right and in any case this game is too expensive so you shouldn't get it unless it's on a sale higher than 50%. To be honest, if i were talking to a friend and he saw this game and asked me if I should recommend him getting it, I would say no, and hence, I wil say no here as well.			"

												Brilliant puzzle game and concept. However, the control issue is plaguing the game (as of today, Aug 15, 2016). I play with a PS4 joystick using Input Mapper. Right shoulder is supposed to rotate the bricks, but somehow the game also speeds up the mouse walking rate. This is very frustrating. I really hope that the author would fix this issue. I think once the control issue is gone, I could definitely recommend this game.			"

												Oh dear, that was a waste of 10 quid.Nothing like Lemmings or Tetris, and the puzzles are so simplistic that I actually started to try and make it harder for myself by not reading the instructions, If I'd bought this for £2 on my iPad it would just about be acceptable. I can only guess that all the positive reviews have come from peole who are very easily amused, and have money to spare.			"

								If you feel bored about there Big Game, I would recommend you to play it. It is a good time-killer, with low space, high fun. If it has mobile phone version, I will take it immediately.			"

												If you mix the gameplay from Lemmings with the blocks from Tetris you can kinda guess how this game works - just to keep it in short.Not badly made, really.			"

												Mousecraft is a fun puzzle game where you are trying to save the lab rats from all the perils of living in a lab.  Yes, yes, supposedly you are helping the crazy cat scientist do his ""experiments"" and test his ""inventions"" but you really are just saving the lab mice from untimely deaths.The first levels are fun and interesting, but the game ramps up in difficulty.  Every time you learn about a new type of block or situation, you have a level or two to learn and then BAM!  You have to step it up or turn into the Death of Lab Mice.I recommend this game to puzzle platform lovers everywhere.			"

												Fun puzzle game. Rules are simple but the game regularly introduces new puzzle elements to keep things interesting.As usual, some people complain about the game lacking in challenge. It is usually pretty easy to complete each level but to complete levels with a perfect score can be a significant challenge. Except for those pros who find everything to be too easy, mostly boasting I would guess.			"
