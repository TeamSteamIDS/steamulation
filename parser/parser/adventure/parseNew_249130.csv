												Lego Marvel Superheroes was my dream come true lego game. I always wished that there were a lego game about Lord of The Rings and a Marvel lego game after playing Lego Star Wars, because I really liked the relaxed and easy-to-access gameplay style. And then, multiple Lego games later, including Lord of The Rings, it is finally here. After multiple iterations, has the gameplay changed enough to justify the purchase?Let's start with the controls. This is my first time playing a Lego game on a keyboard(I do not own a gamepad, sadface). The Lego franchise was definently made for controllers, which I definently noted playing this game. The default controls for moving and doing actions worked fine on a keyboard. My only problems with moving were with the flying in the free-roam section. The flyinf races were just plain annoying to do and caused lots of frustration. I accidentaly kept dropping out of the flying mode while trying to adjust my flight course. But the biggest problem with the controls were the camera controls. The default camera controls were really awkward to use, especially while fighting. I pretty much had to stop either moving or fighting to adjust my camera. This problem is resolved by using a controller, so it's not that big of a deal, but it's still not nice.The gameplay is the same as in the previous Lego games. You control multiple characters do solve light puzzles and fight goons and villains. Which there is alot. I mean a lot, since there is a 100+ characters to play as. Many of the characters have special abilities to solve puzzles, such as Iron Mans rockets to blow up silver legos, Spider-Mans spider-sense to find hidden stuff and the list goes on. The game captures the feel of the characters through different animations and abilities, which is awesome. Mr. Fantastics animations are a definite plus. This game also includes the new Big-Figs, which include Hulk, Juggernaut, The Thing etc. They have their own things only they can do, which is indicated by green handles. They are a nice inclusion, and fit nicely to the regular sized figures.The game ofcourse has a ton of collectibles, which are fun to collect. You could say it's addictive. Those are going to take most of your time, since the campaign isn't all that long if you turbo through that, like I did.In the end, the game is lots of fun to play. I didn't notice any bugs or glitches, which I cannot say for the previous lego game, Lord of The Rings. Experienced a lot of bugs with that game, so it was nice to have a smooth experience with this game. The game doesn't require that much to run smoothly, so pretty much everyone can play this excellent game. It is just pure fun.The game is really solid, and you should buy it, especially if you like Lego games, or the Marvel license. PS. This is my first review ever, so apologies if there is any rambling or repetition, for I wrote off the top of my head. Thank you for reading :)			"

												I originally got this game for my children.  And then I shoved them aside and played through the game myself, cause I was hooked.  I grew up loving both Legos and Marvel.  This is a fantastic merger of both.  Pros:- This game has a lighthearted storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously.  - The antics and quips made by the characters are humorous and satiristically appropriate.  - Kid appropriate means that I can sit down with my children for an hour or two to 'bond.'- Marvel.Neutral:- Gameplay is typical of most lego games; get coins, find gold/red bricks, unlock characters.Cons:- It does get a bit repetative sometimes; gameplay and 'flavor' dialogue.- There are a few bugs still in the game.  Though they don't crop up all that often, it is annoying to have to quit a level simply because the bug prevented your advance.- Flight controls were terrible (or I'm old, and just don't get it).

												Certainly not flawless, it has it's issues, coming mostly from the vast not-so-well-polished world. But it is a great fun and a total enjoyment for any Marvel or Lego fan, let alone of both. Dialogue is fresh as always, having fun with cult movie phrases, the character list would satisfy I believe any needs, characters themselves have their own unique personality and specific set of skills, and the open world lets you roam the streets of the Big Apple up to the S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier soaring above. It has a very decent replayability value too, considering to fully complete any of the missions you have to use more than the basic character list you are first given access to for the specific mission, so that once completed, you can get back with another team and discover more. Overall it's a very decent (should I add uber cute too?) incarnation of the Marvel universe, giving proper tribute to both the movies and the comic books, with a huge range of characters, vast open world and a story that seemlessly mixes a range of different traditional storylines into one whole big living Marvel adventure. Give it a try, it's worth it.			"

												Definitely not what I was expecting.  I got this game for my 5 yr old, It's the first video game I've bought with him in mind, he has not shown any interest in any of the games I play, so i decided to buy something for him specifically. I played the first few missions to see if it would be something he'd be able to figure out easily.I finished the first 3 stages and thought the game was pretty good and my son might enjoy it. Little did i know that the first 3 levels were just appetizers and was barely getting into the main course.  The game becomes an open world game with plenty of things to do. The city (New York) is pretty big, and tons of things to do and characters to collect (Seriously, there are a tons of characters to collect). You can go through out the city and complete mini missions to help out citizens, you get driving time trials and help out Stan Lee a bunch of times! After seeing how the game opened up, I had no doubt my kid would enjoy the game. So i handed him the controller and let him fly around as Iron Man, he immediately loved it, he was having fun. He got the hang of it pretty quick, figured out he had to double jump to start flying, and once he was flying how to ascend and descend, still needs some work with shooting targets, but he was managing.  I then let him try the Hulk, he showed little interest and switched back to Iron Man. Can't blame him, because the Hulk is a lame-o. lol. Then I switched him over to Spider Man, he loved it more than Iron Man. He played for an hour straight before I cut him off...... because it was MY TURN. lol.So far i am 13 hrs deep and have not even proceeded to start level 4.  Highly recommended even if you don't have kids.			"

												When someone mentions the word LEGO in a game title, I'm sure most people will think this is a game just for little kids. They could not be further from the truth. The LEGO games are actually fun for pretty much all ages, due to the reference material they use. We've had LEGO games ranging from Star Wars to Harry Potter to Batman, and more. And now we move on to something odd. Marvel Super Heroes. I say odd, because this is a WB game. WB which owns the rights to publish DC related stuff. DC which is a rival company of Marvel. And Marvel, which is now owned by Disney. So this is indeed an dd pairing. Traveler's Tales are just such big fans of Marvel (and who can blame them) that they wanted this to be made. And here it is. And here is probably the best LEGO game to date. A labor of love from fans of Marvel, made for fans of Marvel. LMSH is a completely original story in the Marvel universe, which borrows characters from the Marvel movie universe and also the comic universe. In fact, it has a roster so massive, it is the biggest roster of any LEGO game to date. You'll find all of your favorites, ranging from the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Blade, Daredevil, Spider-Man, and more, and even an assortment of odd picks like Howard the Duck (who even has his own achievement) and more. Of course what's a superhero game without supervillains. So yes, you can play as a number of baddies as well. Normal sized characters have normal LEGO scaling, and the big bruisers like The Incredible Hulk, Colossus, and others have been turrned into bigger LEGO characters called ""big figs"". And your larger than life characters like Galactus have been given the normal mini fig versions when you want to play as them. LMSH features a msssive hub world recreation of comic and real world fused Manhattan, complete with a wide assortment of side missions, challenges, and unlockables to discover along the way. You can run, jump, fly, or ride vehicles to get around the city at your own leisure. and when not tackling main story missions, there is a ton of things to do. Even after tackling the main story, you will find so many things to unlock, from characters to vehicles and new mission. Some things will warrant replays through missions with different characters, shooting replayability through the roof. As for gameplay, LMSH offers the most refined combat of any lego game to date, mixed with the usual puzzle solving based on character powers. It's fun, varied, and easily the most satisfying in the series. The game also puts a huge emphasis on combat more than any LEGO game to date. My only complaints on this game are the unispired soundtrack, which pales in comparison to previous LEGO games. And also the character creator. It's sloppy. It lacks full customization. And unless you want to unlock a couple of achievements, is completely unnecessary. Pros:  - Biggest roster to date - Best moveset to date for individual characters - Big fig characters! - So much content packed in. Even after completing the game, there is so much to do. Cons - Boring soundtrack - Character creator is not good			"

												Lego marvel super heroes is a lego game with simple gameplay good story, good open world and lots of characters and vehicles.GameplayThe gameplay is mainly just smashing stuff making stuff and hitting enemies like every lego game,The game has lots of characters and theres a decent amount of story missions.The open world is one of the strongest points since theres alot to do like: deadpool missions,unlocking characters, doing races, doing sidequests which give you a golden bricks to unlock deadpool missions.each character is unique some can fly some not,and they all have different super abilities e.g  cap america his shield makes him unable get damaged from the front,spiderman has spider senses and lots more.you can also play as villians.However you need a controller like with the other lego games or else its unplayable.GraphicsThe graphics are good the characters, the building textures arent as good as the characters but thats understandable since its an open world game.the graphical setting are okay.AudioThe music isnt special its quite relaxing.and all characters have voiceacting which is niceStoryI am a mcu(Marvel cinematic universe) fanboy so i love this game and its story and characters. The story is about galactus who wants to eat earth so he gets silver surfer to go to earth, but then he gets shot and his board gets smashed into lego bricks, then the villians try to collect those to make a weapon of destruction and you try to stop them. you go to famous marvel locations to stop them. the writing is good and this is my favorite lego game.Final verdictIts a fun open world lego marvel game with lots of characters and good graphics "

												This is by far the greatest Lego game I have played since The Complete Saga. Not only does the game feature a huge roster of playable characters who actually have the personality and abilities of those they represent, but the game also features a unique storyline where the voice acting actually fits the game. The story is fantastic this time around. The voice acting being recorded specifically for the game helps it to not be as cheesy or low quality as before. The cinematics then also can be how they used to be and have a lot more fun and freedom without havign to fit within a prerecorded audio clip.The characters are as high quality as they are numerous. Multiple characters and costumes leave almost no one out (except nightcrawler...) and will have a few choices for everyone. They each are unique and are fun to play and although I do wish Hulk could scale buildings they stick pretty close to th source. Manhattan is a great hub area featuring TONS of content to do either while between missions or at the end of the game and are just looking for tokens for new characters and vehicles.Combat has also been improved where each character has their signature moves and bad guys actually can be comboed and used to make tons of studs. Speaking of studs, there is no lack of them here and you will be hitting 1 millions before half way through the game.Overall it was the best in the series and I really could not think of much to improve on other then some wonky flight controls and some races that were a bit unfair in that regard. BUY THIS!			"

												LEGO games are simply amusing. They always seem to turn a franchise into a complete LEGO themepark, and this game's no exception. And as usual with the LEGO games, they add a little slapstick in the cutscenes to keep it fun. Really made for the lighthearted entertainment.They did quite a nice job on getting the whole Marvel thing in.			"

												My kids mostly play this game.  They really enjoy being able to free roam around the city playing as their favorite Marvel superheroes.  Had a few issues further into the game where getting into a vehicle would cause the game to crash to desktop.  Starting over with a fresh save fixed this issue.  Otherwise this game has been a fantasic coop game for my younger children.  Couldn't recommend it enough for parents and kids to play through together.			"

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an action adventure game developed by TT games and published by Warner Brothers, releasing in 2013 on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One, and of course, PC and Mac. Game play is similar to that of other Lego titles, you are able to take control of around 150 characters straight out of the Marvel Universe, and each of them have their own abilities. Each of the game’s levels consist of a series of puzzles which use specific characters special abilities, as well as breaking objects to them build other items to help you traverse the environment. In between each level, you enter a free roam type area around the streets of New York. The free roam contains opportunities to complete small side missions which are narrated by none other than Deadpool.  When in the main missions, there are a few side actives to complete too as well, which include Marvel co-creator, Stan Lee; this segment of the game is called “Stan Lee in Peril”. The graphics in Marvel Super Heroes is very much the same as other Lego games, you will find it very hard to fault the visual department of this game; it looks colourful, animated to perfection, everything in the game is made out of Lego, so it has that childish charm that is just gorgeous. There is a wide range of resolution options, but a lack of any other graphical choices, other than texture quality which still only has two levels, high and low. There is really no difficulty in the game, there is no penalty for dying, since you just respawn straight away, you will be stumped for ideas on a few of the puzzles and you will just have to experiment with your characters in order to progress. The boss fights are all uniquely challenging and offer various different waves of battle for you to learn.  The game’s level design is perfect; there is an in game “brick counter” which you can fill up by breaking other Lego objects in game for other smaller bricks. I played the game with my partner and we made it our aim to fill this counter on each level, this adds another challenge to the game, and lets you have the satisfaction of breaking tons of Lego and collecting thousands of smaller bricks. On top of this, there are also plenty of small Easter eggs too, which the odd appearance from Deadpool (who doesn’t appear as a main character in the story).We finished the game in just under nine hours on co-op mode with collecting 100% of the bricks on each stage. What makes the Lego games repayable is that after you complete a level, you have the free play option unlocked – this means you can play as any character on that stage to unlock special areas for more side missions and collectables. Whilst on the subject of collectables, there are so many to find! On top of the regular cast of characters, there are over 100 more to find and discover whilst completing side quests, achievements, and finding items.  Complentionists will have a field day with this game.  Sadly we did run into a few technical problems during our play through. The main one being one of the levels just freezes all of the time; this is a known bug and the only way you can progress is purely by restarting the level and hoping you are lucky – thankfully this bug is right at the start of the stage, so you don’t lose much progress.  Another issue we ran into was fairly annoying, in that characters can sometimes get stuck in the environment, this isn’t too bad if you are able to kill the character with another player, but sometimes this isn’t possible so the only way you can get around the issue is by restarting the level; this can sometimes be painstakingly annoying if you are right at the end of a stage.  We did have a positive experience both using a 360 controller and the Steam controller to play though. I would strongly recommend anyone picking this game up to use either of the two controller options. I have come to the conclusion that Lego really make fantastic games; and Marvel Super Heroes is no different. You have two of the biggest franchises in the world today and combined them; you have a recipe for success straight away. We had such a blast whilst playing and I would strongly recommend Lego Marvel Super Heroes to any fans of Marvel or Lego out there. The regular price of £14, 99 is spot on as well. If you can get it any cheaper, do not hesitate to pick it up, you won’t be disappointed.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												My favorite childhood pastime toy combined with my favorite reading adventures leads to a nerdgasm of enjoyment. I mean really who doesn’t love LEGO or super heroes? Playing with many of my favorite heroes in LEGO form to battle it out with many great supervillains and lead to a giant battle with Galactus is just a dream come true.LEGO Marvel is another great addition to the LEGO game franchise that deserves its recognition. The game features 155 different characters to unlock, 26 levels to play through, and a huge New York City to wonder around in. You also have the standard gold bricks and red bricks to find too. There’s plenty here to take up many hours of your time to complete 100%.The story is about Galactus coming to Earth to devour it like in the old Fantastic Four story. Silver Surfer is shot down when he was scouting the planet and the supervillains are trying to use his cosmic power to take over. You’ll battle through 15 different levels for the main campaign which will take place in places like the Baxter Building, Latveria, and the Savage Island just to name a few. There are 11 levels you can access after collecting the right amount of gold bricks to unlock them. These are mini missions to play where you find the red bricks and some of the characters to unlock. Voice acting wasn’t too bad in the game and it also had plenty of goofy LEGO humor to go along with it.The gameplay is pretty much the same as other LEGO games but the characters are pretty good with using their abilities and fighting skills each in their own unique way. Thor fights with his hammer for melee and calls down lighting to power up certain objects or even shoot enemies or Spiderman who shoots his webbing, has a spider sense for hidden objects, and swings around on his webs. I really enjoyed playing through the levels and playing in the open world of NYC but it did become a chore finding everything. Especially the races you had to do to get some of the gold bricks which would become frustrating and annoying. Most of the game ran fine but I did run into a few bugs. Sometimes I couldn’t pick up objects I needed, I’d get stuck on stuff, or couldn’t get NPC’s to do what they were supposed to do. I even had the game crash on me a couple times. Even with these items I still had a great time playing and they never really took away from the experience.If you have enjoyed playing the previous LEGO games and enjoy Marvel comics this is a great game to play. It did feel a little more refreshing and not like every other LEGO game before but it is still a LEGO game so don’t expect a world changing game. Just enjoy it for what it does and have fun. It may bring back childhood memories and can even be fun playing with the kids if you have any.Bear Rating: 8.5/10			"

												I had tried other Lego games at friends, but this was my first lego game purchase of my own. Not only do i enjoy this game, but the fact you can play on the same keyboard or have 2 controllers and play locally with family and friends hooked me. I was satisfied playing through the linear missions to open some of the, over 100 character unlocks. So imagine my glee when right around the third mission an Open World Lego New York becomes available. Take cars, use any character you have opened, explore, side missions, custom characters, races, collectibles and 50 Stan Lee's to save. Since i got this on sale, it is currently my best gaming purchase of 2014. If you like lego games or the Marvel universe, this is a must have.			"

												WARNING: Contains very minor spoilers. And chimichangas.There's a reason LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is one of the highest-selling LEGO video games of all time; actually, three reasons.First, the characters. The game features not only the existing Avengers, X-Men and Ultimate Spider-Man LEGOs on the market, but a legion of characters and vehicles either only recently released in 2014 or not even created yet. From the Fantastic Four to the Sinister Six, this game includes the majority of Marvel's well-known characters along with a handful of lesser-known ones. Plus they've included the legendary Stan Lee himself as a playable character possessing multiple superpowers. What more do you need from this game?Speaking of characters, the next reason is what the minifigures take part in: the story. You can tell the writers and game designers had fun trying to combine a coherent Marvel storyline with the quirky humor found in every other LEGO game. And you know what? They did it. The story features the Avengers, Fantastic Four and X-Men teaming up against villains like Magneto, Doc Ock, Doctor Doom, Loki, Abomination and Sandman, in an epic quest filled with crazy left turns that only a LEGO video game could have. And it all leads up to a stunning twist you'll never expect (so I won't ruin it for those who haven't played yet).Finally, the gameplay. I was very pleasantly surprised just from playing a free PC demo of the game which was released online early last year, featuring the game's very first level, Sand Central Station. This level features Iron Man (Mark 6), the Hulk and Spider-Man taking on Abomination and Sandman in New York's Grand Central Station. But what blew me away the most during the level was the sheer number of abilities each character had, from Hulk's famous Puny God move from The Avengers, to Spider-Man's ability to actually swing around on a web. When I finally bought the actual game, I was thrilled to discover that the rest of the characters in the game were just as incredible.So, if you're skeptical about buying this game, I suggest you try out the demo featured on marvelsuperheroes.lego.com first, and if you still don't feel like buying the game, then at least you technically tried it for free. But based on my personal experience, I think all of your doubts will go away and you'll want to buy LEGO Marvel Super Heroes right away.			"

												The serie of Lego games are all pretty nice, and this one is not different.The beginning of the story is linear and kind of boring, but a little after that point the game throws you in the open world and you can play the story when you want and start to explore the city.The story is very nice and it keeps getting better until the end. There are a lot of jokes and funny moments for the children but even that is ok and it matches to the storyline.I played the game without any DLC and there are A LOT of characters, heroes and villains, from Avengers to X-men to Fantastic Four... Everyone of them has an specific reason to be in the story and it is great, also after finish all the chapters you can change the characters at your will, which is pretty nice.The gameplay is simple but very nice, you can fly with Thor or Human Torch, swing with Spidey, run over everything with Hulk, take vehicles like cars, boat and planes and everything works nice.Besides the story there are A LOT of side missions, new characters and clothes to unblock, things to do in the city like races and help people and hidden items on the chapters that was impossible to get without the ability to change the character at any time. There are so many things that I completed the storyline and was only 20% of the game.The voice acting is awesome, the sound is ok, but the soundtrack isn't the most remarkable thing you will hear, after a while playing it seems the same track all over again.After all that, I'm sure that if you like the Marvel universe or Lego games or super heroes (who doesn't???) this game has everything for you have fun.

As i do with most LEGO games i highly recommend a controller !! It makes the games much more easy to control and move between charcters faster.I love this one with the Open World setting and all the brick and collecting goodies found all over the map !!I have the LEGO Lord of the Rings one and i think this one is just as good !!So i also think this one will appel to the Marvel fans even if you arent into LEGO's or LEGO games ;) I say give this one a shot !!!

												Highly recommend LEGO Marvel, I was blown away by LEGO Batman 2 when it came out but this is IMO a better game, not only is it a bigger game but you have more characters and more levels then any other LEGO game previously. Side quests are more varied than in previous games but some of the same types apply here, fetch/escort/race. Flying controls may be a bit weird to get used to but you should be fine with them eventually.It took me 36 hours to 100% the game with every achievement/collectable and the story itself is about 9-12 hours.LAST POINT, yes you can use a keyboard but I wouldn't expect a great gameplay experience as a controller is recommended. Do not expect online coop either, it's local only which means you're playing solo or getting friends/family to play with you by hooking up some controllers (or using the keyboard/mix of the two).So yes this is definitely the best LEGO game currently out there right now.If you're a LEGO Fan you owe it to yourself to play this, if you love Marvel then you'll enjoy it. If you dont like either, what is wrong with you?			"

												LEGO <insert title> is a really fun game, just like the other LEGO games. Just like with the other LEGO games LEGO <insert title> lets you choose from a plethora of playable figures from the <insert title> universe. Themes we all know and love from <insert title> are picked up and portrayed with typical LEGO-charme, which adds a whole new dimension of fun to the story of <insert title>.In addition to a really fun story LEGO <insert title> also offers a wide range of side-quests in order to unlock all the characters you know and love from <insert title>, and about 140 others you’ve never even heard of. Like the other LEGO games LEGO <insert title> is a great game to waste countless hours in order to unlock all characters, vehicles and other stuff in order to get the magical 100%, the best way ever to prove you don’t have a life, or people you even remotely care about.I sincerely recommend LEGO <insert title>, not only for adults, but for the whole family.

												If you love Marvel and Legos and you love them both together well then lol this is the definitive game for you!. Characters talk and plenty of humor to go around. There is both a story mode and then an open world free to play mode once you complete each section of the story mode. Plenty of characters to play as within the Marvel Universe. Also I should add there are plenty of things that can be destroyed  within all sections of the game ;) I would say wait for a sale to get your money's worth however it's still very much worth it at full price!

												For a long time, whenever someone would ask which Traveller's Tales Lego game they should guess. I couldn't give them an answer. They were all about equal in quality, just pick one that is an ip you like. No longer, I can definitively say that Lego Marvel Super Heroes is the best Lego game Traveller's Tales has made to date. It has the greatest variety of useful  characters, the most activities, the largest world to explore, and just the best looking visuals and writing. It is also more challenging than most Lego games. Especially if you are going for 100% completion. There are some collectibles (and rescuables) that are quite the head scratcher.  This is enhanced by the open world. Easily one of the best looking open worlds in this type of game. Clearly Traveller's Tales best most detailed open world.  People on the street will often respond to whatever character you are controlling. Every place is properly detailed. It must have cost a lot to create it since they are reusing it for Lego Marvel Avengers. Lego City for the WiiU is a close second.The game shows the staff at Traveller's Tales that worked on this game really loved Marvel comics. There were many deep references that casual fans, and Cinematic fans would miss but would delight long time fans. Not that you would need to be a long time fan. The entire game has plenty of clever writing, humor and sight gags to entertain fans and non fans a like.Let me stress this isn't a perfect game. There are some glitches that happen from time to time. There is one area inside the Statue of Liberty where characters will often slide off platforms and to there deaths for no apparent reason. The driving and flying controls in the open world are particularly frustrating in race events. Nothing that kills the general game play or fun, but if you are trying for 100%, you will get frustrated sometimes.Also if you are suffering from Lego game burnout, you might want to take a long break before playing this game because its easily the most Lego of all Traveller's Tales games.  If you are ready for one, this is the one to get. At least until Lego Marvel Avengers or Lego Dimensions comes out.			"

 Overview  Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an action-adventure game themed and designed around the world of Lego and the Marvel universe. Played as either single-player or split screen co-op, you’re tasked with stopping Dr. Doom and his cohort of super villains from yet another scheme to destroy New York and more importantly,  the world.When you start the game, you’ll be granted a bit of backstory and your first few superheroes to work with. Starting the game will throw you into one of fifteen main story-line missions with an additional twelves side missions you’ll need to unlock as you progress. During the first rendition of each level, you’ll be limited to a very specific few characters that it [the level] was designed around. After completing the level, you’ll unlock “free play” which allows you to use any character you’ve sense unlocked. You’ll also unlock “free roam” which puts gives you a sizable amount of New York to explore for side quests, missions and general mischief and mayhem. Speaking of characters, the game goes all out on character design and implements well over a hundred different characters to choose from. The main characters are all voiced, albeit not from the well-known voice actors of the movies except Agent Coulson who is in fact voiced by the one, Clark Gregg. While the difference in voices is noticeable, I never found them to be off-putting or felt they detracted from the character’s overall appeal. To substitute for this, the characters in-game were modeled by their real life counterparts. Depending on the character you play, they each have specialized abilities that you'll need to use to complete levels and collect items during your adventures. For example, larger characters like the Hulk can lift heavy objects, while Iron Man can destroy silver and gold bricks with his weaponry. Characters like Beast can dig, Mr. Fantastic can stretch into various shapes and sizes and Captain America can deflect lasers with his shield. There is a long list of abilities that keep the characters somewhat unique and refreshing. Granted, there is obvious ability overlap, but that is to be expected.The meat and strongest aspect of the game comes down to the content it supplies. As mentioned above you have 27 total missions to complete, but there are a slew of secrets, mini games, time trials and collectibles to find for those willing to put in the time and effort to find them. Even if you’re not an achievement hunter or a “completionist”, you may find it beneficial to find these items to unlock some of your favorite characters or alternate costumes. Having completed everything in the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The game isn’t by any means perfect and it does have some issues that would have taken it from a good game to a great one. Collecting everything in the game doesn’t come off as a chore and there never felt like there was an excess of side quests as a facade for a lack of available content. All that said, there are some key issues I wish the game addressed.Marvel Super Heroes is just one of the Lego games that offer split-screen co-op, but no global co-op ability. Having played the game entirely in co-op split screen, the game felt fluid and responsive to jumping in and out of sessions at will in terms of frames, but did trip over itself while doing so when it comes to the mechanics. We ran into several issues during our time playing co-op.Sometimes the mini map or markers would fail to show for player two, or markers wouldn’t show for side quests unless you talked to the NPC twice, such as in the Spiderman photo quests. The more prevalent and obnoxious issue was when you’re playing co-op and one player is doing one side quest, and the second player starts theirs. Often the quest of the first player will glitch and many or all of the components will seemingly disappear. The only one to fix this is by either fast traveling to a new area or reloading the game. It was prevalent enough to the point that we rotated quests so we didn’t ruin the other’s progress; it was a real issue.Lastly, the camera was problematic for us while we played. Playing split-screen would cause the camera to occasionally have difficulties panning far off screen to targets at the edge of the map, forcing us to frantically move the control stick to get the camera to pan properly, or temporarily dropping in and out to give one player the full screen. There is an option for a more dynamic camera that will change based on your location from one another, but we found that caused more harm than good and chose to leave it off in favor of the fixed view. On a final note, for those wondering about controller support, the game works fine with a controller and I recommended playing it with one instead of a mouse and keyboard, as the game felt cumbersome with a keyboard.  Pros   A wealth of content Tons of characters to choose from Great sense of classic Lego humor  Great level design and animations fully rendered in nothing but Lego pieces Cons    Issues with camera work Bugs with co-op causing side quests to break or disappear  Split screen-co-op onlyOverall and despite the drawbacks, the game as a whole is still enjoyable, but you’ll find yourself fighting some of the above issues we had more than once during your playtime. While they can be frustrating, I still feel the game offers some fun, but it’s limited by camera issues and buggy co-op play that may turn off some potential buyers.			"

												Best Marvel game since Marvel:Ultimate Alliance. Was a bit skeptical getting this on PC as it seemed like a kids game, but its not totally. The subtle references to things like the disaster of the Spiderman musical and Snakes on a plane are just a tip of the humour is in this game.I thought it was better/funnier/more memorable than GTA V, and am not really a fan of races etc, but there is a LOT to do in this game. TONS of characters, with even one having their own move-sets, voices, and general comic book charm.This was my first LEGO game, got it on sale for about eight euro, with all the DLC which makes it really worth it. I think  might have to get the new one too			"

												Typical LEGO game where you have different characters with different special skills that need to be used throughout the game so you can solve the simple puzzles placed throughout the 15 levels of the story mode.  The big difference here is the number of characters that you can unlock, the additional Deadpool levels that you can play, and the open world New York City with tons of side quests that you can take on.  The game is huge.  The story is fun and new and it gives you a great reason to play as your favorite super heroes.This is one of those games that screams to be played with another player and my kids loved every minute of it.

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is like any other Lego game out there. It's not innovative anymore (if it ever was in the first place). It's an open world where you can do your own way and complete missions and unlock tons of (hidden) characters. The title might have given it away already, but this one is based on the Marvel comics. I'm a big Marvel fan so I was really looking forward to playing as my favorite characters but the game is just meh. It always comes down to; use this character to do this, so the other one can do this and the last one can do this. Which is fun for one or two missions, but come on, 15 missions is just 13 too many for this gimmicky type of gameplay. There's just too little variety here gameplay wise.The graphics look sharp, colorful and Lego-y and the humor is, as always, kind of fun (if childish), which is a thing the Lego games manage to do right. The voice acting is also better than expected and some of the original voices have been used. Which is great, but it would've been even better if it used the voices of the original Marvel-movies-cast. Just saying.Completing the game takes at least 8-9 hours and to 100% it you can add tens of hours to that number. Impressive, I'd say.In the end Lego Marvel Super Heroes isn't a bad game, just not a very innovative one. I wish they change the Lego formula in the future so we can expect some new stuff instead of rehashing the same type of gameplay and putting it around a different theme.[Rating: 71/100]			"

												Video games, comic books and LEGO bricks. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is an incredible game for both LEGO- and comicfans.The Good:· A fun story that stays true to the Marvel universe.· Countless characters like Spider-Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America... Basically any Marvel character you can or can't think of. (Even Stan Lee. Hell yes.)· An open world with tons of side activities, collectable Bricks and breakable LEGO constructions.· A wide variety of character types that offer for great replayability. Sometimes you will need to replay a level with heroes you have unlocked later on to reach secret areas and so on. For example: Captain America's shield to walk over flames, the Hulk's force to break weak walls, moving metal object with Magneto, and so on.· Plenty of fun references to the Marvel movies.The Bad:· No online co-op, only a local split screen option (that doesn't always respond all to well, unfortunately).· The game basically requires a controller to play. You can play with the keyboard just fine but there are no mouse controls, which takes away some of the experience. It's not especially a downside, but I thought I'd list it so you know what you're up against if you don't have a controller.The Ugly:· For a LEGO game it's absolutely stunning. Gorgeous lighting effects, fun animations, amazing voice-actors... It's a LEGO game to be proud of.Final Verdict:An amazing game for both casual gamers, LEGO-lovers and comicbook fanatics like myself. A game every Marvel fan has to own. 9/10 "

												Whether you're a LEGO fan, a Marvel fan, both, or neither; this game is an enjoyable piece of fun worth your time.Admittedly, it will appeal more to you if you're familiar with the Marvel universes. The characters, the stories, the references; they all shout Marvel. But it's the combination with the LEGO franchise and mechanisms that brings the real fun and jokes!In this game, you will play through 15 levels, each chapter with its designated duo of characters. But once you've finished the level, you can play it again with any character you want, which is needed to find some of the more hidden collectibles. And there is a mass of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities (although most abilities are available to multiple characters.) You will have to collect these characters though before they become playable, and this is where the mainpart of the overworld comes in besides the connection between chapters: This LEGO Marvel version of Manhattan is crowded with side quests, races, hidden objectives, and so much more. Just exploring the overworld alone is a lot of fun.Most achievements you'll get from just playing the game, but there are a few that will make you collect everything possible to collect and search in every nook of Manhattan and the levels. I managed to 100% the game in just a little under 50 hours, and it never was boresome or tiring.And if you need any help, Deadpool's there for you. If you can find him.			"

Other then the great and fun storyline, it has a big area you can play in and do activity's.These unlock more characters, gold bricks, aircraft (some characters can fly, such as thor, silver surfer, ironman and more) or vehicles.I really enjoyed this game and thus decided to finish it 100% and it was money well spend, specially since I bought it on sale. The onlu thing id like to see in this game is a Camera controlled with your mouse.Now I fear that 1 day I shall own all Lego Games :P			"

												The best thing about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is that it delivers almost everything a Marvel fan could want. From Abomination to the Wizard, this game is an A-to-Z (well, A-to-W) love letter to the Marvel Universe that starts with the Silver Surfer gliding across the title screen and ends with a credits song that could not have been better chosen. A few technical glitches and some carryovers from the franchise history keep it from being an outright masterpiece, but it easily ranks as one of the best superhero games I've played in years.                                                                                     It starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative.What's Next-Gen LEGO Marvel Super Heroes Like?The same is true of the villains. You can start by chasing Doctor Octopus from the Baxter Building to the Daily Bugle, but you'll soon be flying off to thwart Dr. Doom's plans in Latveria and taking the Rainbow Bridge to stop Loki from stirring up the frost giants in Asgard. I particularly liked how each mission played out as a sort of protracted chase, with the heroes in pursuit of folks like Magneto or the Red Skull, while battling lots of lesser villains like Pyro or the Leader along the way. As great as it all is, telling such an earth-shattering story without major characters like Dr. Strange or Sub-Mariner present feels off. Still, when a game features lesser-known characters like Black Bolt, Captain Britain and HERBIE, it's hard to complain. Maybe they're saving Kang and Ultron for a sequel?The puzzles in the LEGO games are almost always solved by matching the right power to the right problem, and the Marvel take on this mechanic is particularly inventive. TakeLEGO Marvel Super HeroesLEGO Marvel Super Heroes offers an original storyline in which Nick Fury calls upon heroes spanning the Marvel Universe to save Earth from such threats as the vengeance of Loki and the hunger of Galactus, Devourer of the Worlds.Great Games with Huge CastsSuper Street Fighter IV: Arcade EditionLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsSkylanders Swap Force Black Widow for example. She, like Invisible Woman, can spoof security cameras, but Widow also has the acrobatic skill of Captain America, which enables her to access remote areas of the levels, and the brains of Tony Stark, which lets her use certain consoles that would be off limits to other heroes. Throw in a gun, and you've got a very useful character made up of a number of different power sets. Storm and Thor, for instance, can both use electricity to power up stations, but Thor can smash open walls while Storm can put out fires. Even though there are only maybe a couple dozen powers to share among them all, the various combinations of powers ensures that no one feels entirely redundant.You will get a few power sets that seem a bit out of place; Captain America's ubiquitous shield switches seem a little arbitrary, as does the notion that Wolverine should be really good at digging and climbing. There are also a few that make sense but aren't particularly well implemented. The special sixth sense shared by characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil is really more for recognizing what walls you can climb than for keeping those characters out of danger.I finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River. The city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend.Experienced gamers won't find many of the open-world puzzles and challenges to be much of a contest; for the most part, you'll simply need to identify the type of task you're facing and then just go hit the right steps in the right order. It's clear that the challenges are aimed at LEGO’s young demographic, so gamers craving a challenge will be let down here. Still, if the allure of putting Daredevil on a motorcycle and having him race Ghost Rider through the Upper West Side sounds fun, the difficulty is sort of incidental. The rare exceptions are the timed challenges, or those that require you to search out objectives that aren't in the immediate vicinity of the challenge.The biggest pain is the inconsistent, confusing flight system. It attempts to use the same control scheme from the missions where the up and down motion of the thumbstick moves your character toward or away from the camera. Now you'll use face buttons to control the pitch of your character's flight. The problem is that the button you use to ascend is also the button you use to accelerate, and I frequently found myself flying into the side of buildings or massively overshooting my objective. Even with a week or so of playing, it still seems weird to me.Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Manhattan tourEven with that one chief complaint, there's just so much to love about LEGO Marvel that I've been playing it a few hours a day for over a week now and am still finding new charms. From unlocking Gwen Stacy and making her jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to watching the heroes dance at Tony Stark's house parties, this game is full of the moments that make Marvel one of the best brands in entertainment.THE VERDICTLEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best thing to happen to Marvel games since 2006's Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It's a warm and witty, multi-layered approach to the brand that ties in hundreds of Marvel's most iconic characters, settings, and stories. While you can knock out the campaign story in around eight hours, the world is rich with content, and I've found myself up late every night for the past week playing for ""just one more hour."" It may not offer the challenge or player-driven context of this year's other open-world games, but those games would be hard-pressed to deliver as much fun and happiness as you'll find. 9.5/10			"

Makes it so you do't loose all your progress on a level if your computer or game crashes.The open world is a bit confusing after going from the Harry Potter games which mostly only let you go where it wants you to.Figuring out how to buy new characters is really confusing. Holding the ""u"" key for awhile.The awesome ability to use all of the marvel characters is great. Tons and tons of characters with all kinds of powers and abilities.All in all a great game.  9/10			"

												Just 100%ed this game. Personally, I absolutely loved it. Great game, like most LEGO games in my opinion.If you're contemplating getting the game, however are turned off by the reviews telling you that you need a controller, well I played the entire game without one and honestly it worked competely fine. I just mapped WASD to movement, space to jump, and num keys 8, 4, 5, and 6 to tag, attack, map, and special ability respectively. Sure it's not as smooth as a controller would be, but it gets the job done.If you like LEGO games and Marvel, get the game.			"

												More like lego Avengers. Most of the missions just feel like a Avengers story. It's nice they throw in marvel characters and all, but the whole story and missions seem more avengers based. I like the xmen and boy do they get neglected here, also other super hero teams. This game clearly was meant to push the avengers movies or ride on the little success that movie got. Thowing in random marvel heroes who have nothing to do with the games story is enough to not call this Lego marvel super heroes, rather Lego Avengers. That little segment with the xmen was lacking and that one particular mission that had jean grey in it, which makes no sense. when was the last time you seen jean outside of a xmen story, without other xmen characters around her, or without her phoenix powers. I can't even call wolverine a xmen anymore, since hes on every freaking team. Wolverine the team S%^t is what they call him. All and all this game has good Marvel fan service, not as deep into the marvel universe as i wanted, but enough to please a loyal comic book fan. The gameplay is great, the controls on foot is perfect, the flight controls is very debatable. The flight controls, the flight controls. I'm not one to complain but, i assume no one tested the controls of the flying heroes, wen putting this game out, huh? They have the nerve to put flying mini-games where you fly through rings, though tight turns in the game which has horrible flight controls. I can yap on about this game but in the end i loved it. Took me a while to appreciate the game, but at the end of the day i loved it. This being my second lego game, it taught me how to love the lego series. The fact that the series pretty much puts you into a play world and let you go crazy, by giving you options to tackle different things basically over whelm me by choices. Because of this game i now know taking my time is how to fully enjoy a lego games. This is a pretty good game and worth the pick up, the only challenge here is the flight mini games, so be prepared and be ready.			"

												A solid LEGO game. This was my first open world LEGO game and it took a while for me to warm up to the concept. But after I hit a certain point, I was addicted and didn't stop playing until I 100%'ed it.Be warned though, I ran into SEVERAL bugs with sidequests randomly resetting, the Deadpool ""GPS"" going the wrong way, things not spawning when they should, and the occasional crash. None of these things were so frequent that it ruined my experience, but they were frustrating when they happened. I was playing on Windows 10, if it matters.Still wholeheartedly recommend to any LEGO game fan.			"

It has the most hours of gameplay, in my opinion, compared to other lego franchise videogames.  The achievements are top notch and fun for any completionist.  The storyline is rich with comicbook history and origin stories.			"

												First off, I love LEGO games. Seriously. Lego Star Wars: The Video Game was my very first video game, and it still holds a fond place in my heart.That being said... I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend this game or not. Here are my opinions, and you can decide:PROS:-Free-roaming is one of the best aspects of gameplay in LMSH.-The sheer amount of characters included in the game (including people you never see in a Marvel game, like Psylocke or the Guardians of the Galaxy, or Phil Coulson, or Stan Lee himself!).-The team pair-ups in the levels themselves are very pleasantly unorthodox, such as Captain America, the Thing, and Storm teaming up.-The story in LMSH, while drawing elements from the Marvel films, is totally original and manages to connect to the comics fairly well.-The character creator allows you to make some very fun combinations (for example, I gave Thor's hammer to Mary Jane Watson).-There is a huge amount of attention to detail in the design of the levels, the overworld, and the characters in particular.-Every car you see is more than willing to let you just jump in and ""borrow"" it for ""official superhero business.""-Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) makes bad jokes or puns throughout the game.CONS:-You NEED to play this with a controller. There's not really a good way not to.-There are a lot of small bugs and glitches in the game, such as characters taking too long to switch between, or someone's arms disappearing.-Some of the hitboxes or ranges on the different powers/abilities are not very clear or consistent (i.e., activating a power from right beside an NPC or several feet away from them sometimes doesn't work).-The character creator, while it has A LOT of combinations, is sometimes very goofy in the way that some of the combinations work together. For example, I paired Wolverine with the Human Torch, and the character got all of the shared powers except flight. -If you are not playing with two people, the second player's AI is garbage. Often times they will get stuck in a location, or go off somewhere else just when you need their help.-The levels themselves...just aren't very fun. Numerous times throughout my playthrough I found myself completely confused about what I was supposed to do, particularly during the boss fights. The hint system for the Minikits and overworld locations is sometimes just as bad.-For me, there was not a lot of replayability in LMSH. By the time you unlock all of the characters, you've essentially done everything the game has to do several times over, so even though I had gotten some characters I love playing as, there was nothing left for them to do...besides run around and ""borrow"" taxicabs. While this game is fun, it feels a bit hollow. 7/10			"

												As a big fan of the Lego Star Wars games, when I saw ""Lego Marvel Superheroes"" I was like ""On snap, I'm about to get IN THERE."" Since then, I've wrecked this game 100%, and now I'm here to talk about it.Here are some of the things that I really liked about Lego Marvel:1. The hub world of NYC is humungo-jumbo sized. It's filled with tons of missions to do and things to unlock. The Lego Star Wars hub areas are like little fluffy cupcakes compared to the sumo-sized birthday cake that is Lego Marvel's NYC hub. It's big and I like big things.2. The character roster. Lego Marvel features 155 playable characters (not including DLC), as well as a big number of custom characters for you to create. They even have lesser-known heroes like Moon Knight and Squirrel Girl. The conclusion: the character roster is GODLIKE.3. The main story and bonus Deadpool missions are good fun.  The story has you playing as different characters all the time, and the villains plotting against you also change constantly. Just like the previous Lego games, the main story has some good content to keep you busy.  I should also mention that co-op play is always available, and that is a MAJOR PLUS.And here are some thing you might not like so much:1. Keep in mind this game is aimed at younger audiences, so expect lots of simple beat'em up gameplay, simple puzzling, and corny dialogue. Some like it, but it isn't for everyone.2. This game can be very glitchy. One time I was replaying the first level and The Sandman turned huge. I was about to spray him with water and DESTROY HIM, but instead of destroying him, he slowly sunk into the ground and glitched out of the map entirely. I had to restart the level in order to continue. I have also encountered bugs where hub world missions wouldn’t show up at times and I've even heard that freezes can be common.  Bug-filled games really wound my soul, so be aware of this before purchasing.At the end of the day, Lego Marvel is a pretty fun game. I recommend it especially to those who are fans of the Marvel universe or the past Lego games, and to the younger audience as well.Overall, if Lego Marvel Super Heroes was a beverage, it would definitely be a tangy, chicken-flavored soda drink with an amusing aftertaste that leaves quite an impression. Thank you for reading.			"

The sheer size of the New York City hub, combined with such a large roster of playable characters just make running around smashing or racing fun. Definitely recommended.			"

												It's honestly brilliant. This is by far my favourite LEGO game, the adverts and trailers don't show you the fun in collecting all the vehicles, characters and minikits, and eventually getting 100% of the game completed, after you finish the story and got all the vehicles and characters, the only think motivating people to getting 100% is the satisfaction, this could be viewed as a downfall, but for me, satisfaction is everything. I'd reccomend this game to people who like LEGO, LEGO games, Marvel and collecting things.			"

												when i looked at this game when they did a little insider on the gameinformer mag, i already knew i wanted this game. It has ppl all the way as stan lee to carnage to hulk even HOWARD THE DUCK! lol but anyway theres a hugeeeee collection of people in the game as well mary jane watson, the story was pretty good but the most fn you will have will be the free roam in the game the ablity of things you can do is amazing espically on the PC it self. If i could rate it i would say about a 9/10 the game is perfect imo just a few couple changes to the story. The free roam has to be the best part of the game aswell as the dlc that recently came out on the 18th of december.this is my final and last part of the review i will say, theres things in the game where they can get annoying.... but anyway the glitchs with deadpool has been fixed so get rdy to be 100% on the game. the dlc is kinda cool, some of the extra chars are pure stupid imo. Aunt may.... wtf and others like the shield chars are dumb and dont reallly need to be added			"

												Easily the best LEGO game. I have been having lots of fun with this new game. Since I bought it last week, I've played for nearly 15 hours, and it's become the game I play second most (Minecraft is still #1). Great voice acting all around. I would reccomend this for any ages, even adults. While it doesn't have all of the fan-favorites, some people will learn about some new characters in this blocky, expansive MARVEL universe. It is really a good game, I can't say it enough. It is very fun. The open world is amazing, and unlike LEGO Batman 2, it's beautiful. With citizens walking around, driving in the city, a beautiful sky to fly through, and stunning graphics (not really nextgen graphics, but better than the standard LEGO graphics) the open world is one of the best parts of the game. Each character has a special power which can be used for puzzle solving. Troy Baker delivers on a great Loki as well. Although it is not Tom Hiddleston, it is still great. Nolan North voices Deadpool in the Deadpool side missions. Clark Gregg (the real deal) voices Agent Coulson, and, the big finale, SAMUEL L. JACKSON voices Nick Fury.Overall Score: 9.75/10 (No game can be perfect...)			"

												This is kind of odd for me to write a review for.  I really wish that steam had a middle option between thumbs up and thumbs down.  It's definatly not bad, and it plays like a lego game, but as far as I've gotten I've noticed quite a few patterns that i didn't see in previous titles that make the game seem rather lazy.  It is definatly a huge game, with quite a few playable characters, but the story levels seem to be lacking.As an example, every boss I've encountered so far has played out the exact same.  You fight a horde of enemies, then you're allowed to his the boss once, then another horde of enemies, then you can hit the boss again, then another horde of enemies and then you hit the boss again and win.  I've gone through quite a few bosses and since every one has played the same, I don't see them changing it up later.  Needless to say it gets rather boring rather quick.  The humor also seems to be lacking, and I am comparing this to the lego star wars.  Now I haven't played lego lord of the rings, so I don't know if it also has voice acting, but I feel like the voice acting and actual dialouge has really taken away a lot of the humor.  Each character that talks has a single character trait and tends to just repeat it in differant ways.  Spiderman just won't shut up about all the teen-angst he's having to go through.  I don't think I've sat through a conversation with him where he didn't mention having to do homework.  Again it gets very tired very quickly.  The funniest parts tend to be the deadpool cameos.  Those are done in the old lego game style, through humerous movements and noises.The game is also far too story focused.  There are few games where I'd consider this a bad thing, but this is one of them.  There is a bleeding cutscene every 4 minutes, and this game sufferes from one of the worst features in all video games.  Unskippable cutscenes.  That is almost as bad as micro transactions.  People like me don't care about the story of a lego game.  The story is also incredibly redundent.  There are cosmic bricks from the silver surfer's surfboard and Dr. Doom wants them to rule the world.  There that's the plot.  Be prepared to have that drilled into your brain in every single unskippable cutscene.  All that being said there is still a really nice charm to playing a lego game.  Playing as the characters and seehing how they're differant to each other is really great fun.  I love being able to swing around New York as Venom (so few games have Venom as a playable character and I don't understand why.  Venom is amazing).  I like being able to go insanely fast as iron man (although, I won't lie, he's an utter pain to control while flying).  That's the main driving point to continue playing; seeing what new character you'll unlock, or working twords unlocking your favorite marvel character.It's a really weird situation writting a review like this, because if you play it the way you're supposed to (the story mode) it's really rather boring, but if you play it just dicking around as the characters you unlock, it's rather great fun.   If you don't get bored easily or you like constantly doing the same thing, go for it.  Otherwise I'd say it's safe to avoid unless you're a massive Marvel fan.			"

												Review time! This time we're discussing LEGO Marvel Superheroes. I'll give you the breakdown of the goods and bads of this game. So lets hop right in.OVERVIEWIf you are familiar with the LEGO games, this one does not differ. LEGO games are one of the few games that are rated E that really are enjoyable to everyone. It doesn't matter how old you are, this game is fun. Like all LEGO games, this game is packed full of puzzles, cheesy one-liners, and a huge range of playable characters.PROSThis game is entertaining through and through. Both the campaign and the side missions are fun to play. The open world is huge and there's around 136 playable characters to collect (You can even be Stan Lee, who has several superpowers) along with a bunch of vehicles. Deadpool is one of the rarest characters in the game and has his own set of missions that need completed in order to unlock. Like all LEGO games, you can play campaign missions over again with any character you would like (and you'll need to do so if you are looking to 100% the game). Achieving 100% is usually the primary goal of the LEGO games, but many people just play whenever they feel like. I have not quite achieved 100% but I do intend to in the future. As far as the Marvel aspect goes, the characters/storyline do not necessarily follow the movies or comics. This does not take away from the experience at all (unless you're one of those weird die-hard comic guys). You can find almost every character thinkable in the Marvel Universe (except for a few, but I can't think of any off the top of my head). CONSThere aren't many cons, but there are definitely some that need noted. LEGO games have NEVER been meant for PC, there are a set of PC controls, but they are awkward, and don't even use the mouse. If you're going to play this game, I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. If you don't have a gamepad, don't worry, the game is still playable, the controls are just going to take some getting used to. Another thing about controls, while flying, if you run into the side of a building, you will come to a jolting halt and the camera will be a bit weird in adjusting. As you improve your flying skills, you'll run into this problem (no pun intended) less and less.The other large con is that you cannot kill civilians in the open world, which is a real shame. While there are enemies in the open world, you can only fight them during side missions or while at The Raft (The prison). This is very disappointing, but I heard it might've been required to maintain the game's E rating. Still, a shame.VERDICTThis game is super fun. If you are a Marvel fan, or loved the other LEGO games, or both, then you really need to get this game. Even if you haven't played a LEGO game before, I recommend you give it a try. Pick it up on sale if you can, but I paid full price and have #noregrets. Liked the review? Let me know by hitting the thumbs up button below.

												An absolutely delightful gem of a game, even among all the various LEGO games out and around. I would have to say that despite a lack of movie music and voices, the game is still brilliant. The one and only downside to this is the somewhat problematic flying controls, especially if you're in a race - then it can become a little frustrating.That aside, this game is absolutely awesome. Incredibly fun abilities (super strength), attacks, powers, and travelling (especially web-slinging) and a reasonably interesting plot, with an extra dose of both comic and movie references make this something to be savored, especially by fan of Marvel comics - it's not just the Avengers that make an appearance here, there's also the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and of course, a million cameos by Stan Lee, to name a few.This game is also very funny, with SHIELD incompetence, bad puns, and amusing dialogue in the cut scenes, accompanied by a healthy dose of Deadpool breaking the 4th wall. 100%, anybody? However, probably the best thing about this game to me is the world map - you can freely roam the city of New York (AND THE HELICARRIER), completing extra quests and acquiring extra characters and vehicles.Definitely worth a look.

												Okay fun.Okay VERY fun.Okay VERY VERY fun.Make sure you have a controller. I can't stress that enough.There's nothing deep or compelling in the story but you aren't playing for that, are you? It's silly enjoyment ""HULK SMASH"", flying around as Iron Man and wiggling your bottom over obstacles as Black Widow. And Venom, Ah yes, the nefarious joy of Venom.If you're looking for some simple child-like comic book joy... this game is it. The visuals are pretty stunning too considering they're made up of Lego bits. Asgaard was surpisingly beautiful. And have fun in New York running over everything like you're playing GTA without the bloodshed.Go have some fun :D			"

												Like LEGO and Marvel? Looking for a game that'll provide days of guarenteed fun? If you picked up this game, I think you made the right choice. You have a huge map of NYC to explore, over 100 characters from the Marvel universe, a chance to make your own additions to the universe (I'm talking about a character creator, baby!), and a decent story with lengthy levels and even mixes things up a little. You got the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men teaming up along with other heroes like Spider-Man who join the party. The humor is a little half-baked at times, but there's some good stuff in there. You just gotta find it. But trust me, this game will leave you wanting more each time you manage to put in down. It's no game you can complete in one day, so be prepared to work on it!			"

												Review time! This time we're discussing LEGO Marvel Superheroes. I'll give you the breakdown of the goods and bads of this game. So lets hop right in.OVERVIEWIf you are familiar with the LEGO games, this one does not differ. LEGO games are one of the few games that are rated E that really are enjoyable to everyone. It doesn't matter how old you are, this game is fun. Like all LEGO games, this game is packed full of puzzles, cheesy one-liners, and a huge range of playable characters.PROSThis game is entertaining through and through. Both the campaign and the side missions are fun to play.

Its interesting. As I already finished story mode im going in freeplay and unlocking more storys by collecting gold bricks. The ""after story mode (freeroam / freeplay mode)"" is not so interesting but its okay to play in free time when bored. And I already know a trick how to get alot of coins in the stark tower (check out my video) , then its not really cool to play the game anymore. I feel like everything is done here.       But anyways. The game is cool , graphics are nice and I love how its like ""real life graphics"" + ""lego graphics"".Its looking really good that way , good job developers. Really nice xbox 360 controller support. Totaly the best ive seen.Co-op mode is like in any another lego game , but this one just feels like the best. Sadly , I expected it to have multiplayer , like online not just co-op , but well , its a good game , so I got nothing bad to tell about it.      Alot of cars and charatchers to unlock while playing , as well as the ""hacks / cheats"" what you can unlock ingame !Thats just one of the coolest things.      And what I love most about this game is that it got sounds like people talking not just text what you need to read.You can too add lyrics in settings if you want , I like having ""People talking sound"" + lyrics. I recommend this game to everyone from age 5 to 16.     Even if its lego , its interesting.~Girl gamer   ~Anna			"

ALSO, to get the F.F. characters, you don't need cheats. You can get them without cheats, I did. Also, the Deadpool missions are quite funny.

												Lego. One of my favourite types of games it may seem childish but who cares? This game is a big improvment from previous lego games with features such as free roaming. The games story isnt anything to freak out over it's ok but it tells a differen't story with a differen't charecter every mission to build up to a final one but the great thing about this game is the gameplay it's self, it has a huge range of charecters from your all time favourites like hulk, spiderman, wolverine, captain america, iron man etc to the lesser known people like red skull or the juggeranaught and almost every charecter has differen't abbilities some are super strong while others can fly overall it's a blast but for some it may feel repetetive and boring but it all depends on what your into.86/100			"

That said the levels can get a little boring sometimes and the story is pretty basic. But over all LEGO® Marvel™ Super Heroes is a game that has lots of characters, a large free roaming map, and is most importantly is a lot of fun. 8/10 "

												Enjoyable and accessible, this is a genuinely fun PC co-op game, and the best that LEGO has to offer. The variety of the characters in gameplay and style give you quite a bit to work with, and the overworld hub of New York City is one of my favorites. That being said, replay value is somewhat short for those who aren't all about collecting, the game itself is fairly easy, and there isn't much compelling going on in the overworld past the novelty. A good buy for $10-$15, wait for a sale.			"

												I have always loved Lego and Marvel, this game is a great mix of both and a real treat. The humor is lighthearted, the characters and missions are fun to play. To make for an even better cooperative playing experience go for 2 controllers and play on the TV. I was delighted that after finishing the first 4 missions or so the game opens up open world style (think childhood GTA). The map is surprisingly large, and there are a lot of missions and new characters to unlock. I got the game for $5 during a sale, but its easily worth double that with the game play and open world. Grab it for your children or as a guilty pleasure for yourself. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I dunno what to say, man. It's another friggin' LEGO game. It seems solid as hell, but holy crap the formula is stale at this point, and I still don't think they'll ever top the Star Wars games they started with. The pantomime was better than the voice acting, and the lightsaber-and-blaster combat mechanics were better than anything they've come up with since. Occasionally baffling inobvious context sensitivity required to progress is still a thing, too.If it's your first LEGO game, knock yourself out. If it's not, maybe stick with the ones you have.			"

There are tons of characters and vehicles to collect from throughout the Marvel Universe, It does get a bit repetitive if you intend to go for the 100% like I did, but that's just an excuse to use the vast amount of playable characters at your disposal.

												This is the best Lego game so far. It's got so much variation - in the levels, in the free play, and in the storyline that it just never gets old. I completed this game 100% and got all the Steam achievements, so I uninstalled it, and I was quite sad that I couldn't play it any more. Then I found the DLC! A great little bonus. The newer Hobbit game had great levels but quickly became tedious in free play. The Lego Harry Potter games are a very close second for me, because unlike Marvel the free play is quite tricky to navigate in. But I'm a big HP fan so perhaps I'm biased towards that. That said, I'm also a bit LOTR/Hobbit fan, and neither of those games are even close to Marvel Super Heroes.My verdict: if you are going to buy any Lego game, make sure it's this one.			"

Have to be careful with two things.1) You will have issues with the PlayStation 4 controllers emulating the Xbox 360 controllers, and still haven't found a solution to that. So pick a Xbox 360 Controller to play this game or a PlayStation 3 Controller.2) This game will be slow in some parts of some low end machines, so double check your specs before installing this game.Aside from that I give it 9/10 for the wonderful job in the sound department, visuals, flexibility, HUD, programming and interactivity.

												I have always loved Lego and Marvel, this game is a great mix of both and a real treat. The humor is lighthearted, the characters and missions are fun to play. To make for an even better cooperative playing experience go for 2 controllers and play on the TV. I was delighted that after finishing the first 4 missions or so the game opens up open world style (think childhood GTA). The map is surprisingly large, and there are a lot of missions and new characters to unlock. I got the game for $5 during a sale, but its easily worth double that with the game play and open world. Grab it for your children or as a guilty pleasure for yourself. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I've never been a fan of the Marvel Universe -- if anything, I was a fan of Spider-Man (yet only slighty).I've been a fan of LEGO since I was a little babbie.When you combine these two, what do you get? You get an interested Cydran.To begin, I need to point out this game does not support mouse controls, however I do recommend using a controller when playing pretty much any of these LEGO games.The game itself has wonderful looking visuals, with a nice gloss effect on the characters and certain objects in the unique environments. Every level is designed differently as the LEGO games usually promise.As per usual with these games, there is a massive amount of characters available to play as, heroes and villians from the MARVEL franchise included. Once you unlock a character, you need to buy it with studs, which you obtain through playing the levels of the game (or even through free roaming around the city).This leads me to the free-roam side of the game. After levels, you'll be taken back to the city in which you can explore as you wish. Side quests are available to complete with Gold Bricks as the reward.One part of the game that I think lacks is the combat system. It's the same with every LEGO game but I feel it doesn't flow well, and at often times you're stuck fighting with the controls to hit a single enemy. The same can be said with switching between the three characters you are usually found playing in a single level; sometimes when you try to switch to a character right in front of you, it'll switch to a character that may be in a different direction, causing some frustration.Some of the dialogue and voices in the game sound quite low quality, but this seems to only be the case with a few of the voices.The story is as simple as ""Found a special artifact, villians steal it, must get it back"" but it's done in quite a funny little way.All in all, it's a pretty good game, looks sexy and quite worth the pricetag (although it can go down to $5 on sales).

												One of the greatest LEGO games of all time!This game is truly the greatest: an original story of heroes and villains that perfectly captures the essence of every character in the game (and believe me, there are a lot of them, 200+). Tons of collectibles make this game easily replayable (though most LEGO games are).This game is better than the newly released LEGO Marvel's Avengers. This game includes characters from the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, and others, while LEGO Marvel's Avengers is too stubborn to allow these characters into the game.			"

												A typical LEGO game.  Full of the traditional cartoonish hyjinks and hours of gameplay for those of you who strive to see ""100%.""  I've been very pleased with how the LEGO games improve over the years, and this is no exception.  My only (very minor issue) is that even though the game offers full controller support (hype!), the support doesn't seem very ""full.""  Yes, my controller works perfectly fine and the controls are the exact same as any other LEGO console game (huge plus to these LEGO games); however, it will read ""Button 12"" or whichever button on the screen instead of ""A"" or ""X"".  As much as I've tried to fix it, I've found no solution.  As I have the majority of the LEGO games on console, this is a very minor issue since I am already accustomed to the controller layout.  Overall, this game is well worth the purchase and is one of the better casual co-op games out there.			"

												LEGO Marvel Super Heroes follows the general trend that LEGO games usually take - easy, but sometimes unforgettable. I believe it is evident now that every LEGO game is pretty much identical. This game takes a LOT of Marvel characters and mashes them into a relatively straight forward story. It is better than LEGO Marvel's Avengers, mostly because the dialogue is much better. Graphics wise it looks relatively cute, but the open world cities are not especially great looking. The locations vary throughout the missions, from Asgard to the X-Mansion. Unfortunately as with any LEGO game, they are amazing initially but ultimately grow really repetitive and downright boring. Because the game is relatively easy there is an almost apparent feeling that there is no challenge, and I didn't find it too fun after a while and certainly wanted it to end. Gameplay is the same as any other LEGO game. I wish they'd make a standalone LEGO Spider-Man game, it would be pretty damn good. Couch co-op is definitely an option. You can play keyboard (player 1) and controller (player 2) and it does work! Sometimes co-op is much more convenient to solve puzzles than to do puzzles by yourself. Controls are customizable thankfully so it isn't a pain. The most fun characters tend to be the big guys, like Abomination, Hulk and The Thing, since they are mobile and can hit a lot of things. Is the PC version good, though? Well, yes. And, kinda. With a spice of no. It barely has any options to tweak graphical settings, and it has some weird problems. I can play it at 720p at about 400fps but then you switch it to 1080p and things mess up. For some reason, during some cutscenes, the game drops in frames. It certainly is not game breaking, but you will notice it and it is really weird. (I am running a GTX 960 2gb, Intel Core i5 4590, 8gb RAM.)The story is pretty decent, the game is fun while it lasts and there certainly is a lot of content to be discovered.I don't regret buying this at £3.74, but if you have played A LOT of LEGO games and are getting sick of them, I don't recommend this game to you with a full heart, and therefore you should get it on a sale, because you will be much more forgiving on yourself.

												I love this game! The hub, Manhatten, is awesome and very big. Lots of streets to drive on and lots of cars, many fast ones. There are many air vehicles also. Each character has their own ability and specials they do to people while they're fighting. I hope LEGO® The Hobbit™ will be a lot like this game, in Middle Earth... no cars and stuff... Instead, horses! Anyway, I really like this game, I knew it would be fun, everyone's been talking about it, but it was more fun than I expected! It is worth buying. :) The Asgard character pack is awesome, but I wish Sif could throw her sword, like Gamora. Maybe her symbol on what she's going to throw it at could be the same as Thor's, the Asgard symbol, but silver and without lightning. :) I wish there was a DLC for a few other characters, Loki with his black outfit and his other outfit but without the helmet, and Deadpool normal clothes. And I wish Loki's clothes were in the character creator and hair like Viper's and Malekith's but black, I would use it for Loki. :) It's a really fun game, worth getting. :)			"

												This was my first LEGO game, I wasn't really attracted to them at all, but when I saw Marvel I had to give it a try and I'm glad I did it, awesome game.The story is great, really funny, enough to do it for a second time to save each ""Stan Lee in peril"" of every level and another hidden items. Maybe this could be a cons for someone, you are forced to play it twice because there's no way to unlock everything with the first set of super heroes you have in each level in the first playthrough.20 hours on it and still 75% to go. The main story it's only like 20% of the game, you have a ton of side activities like races, destroy/killing X things in some amount of time, items to collect, characters to unlock, help citizens in distress who needs you to find his monkey (!), common things in the life if a superhero. Sadly it doesn't have online coop only local. Btw, I really liked the split screen (maybe it's something common, but I don't usually play local coop) During story playthrough I got two breaking bugs that forced me to start the level all over, it was a bit frustrating at the moment but in the end, it's so funny to play that I really didn't care of them.One thing I didn't get is that you can save in each checkpoint, but the time I did a save and exit, when I loaded the game again I had to start the level from the beginning, so, really don't know what's the point of that save there. This being an open world game was a surprise, I really didn't have any idea when I got this, I thought it was just a story with LEGO figures, how wrong I was.If you like Marvel don't doubt it, you'll love it.

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is fun for all ages in my eyes. I enjoyed the game and I'm 15 1/2. I grew up with Lego Games I've played all the Lego Star Wars, Batman, and Indiana Jones. This one was by far the best Lego Game to date and the only compareable game would have to be Lego City for the WiiU. I recommend having an Xbox controller though because the PC controls are very obnoxious. It has 2 players co-op which I sadly never got to try but, if I had a second controller I would of gave it a shot! This game overall is very fun. It has the feel of Grand Theft Auto mixed with Marvel. Overall this game is really good and my only complaint is the Keyboard and Mouse controlls. If you're a Marvel Fan you should give it or a try or if you want something you can play through with your children I would give it a try.			"

												The game itself is awesome. You get to play and unlock hundreds of heroes and villains and the amount of customization is amazing. And on top of that you get the whole open LEGO world to explore and interact with.BUT to me all this becomes such a shame when you see how poorly this game was ported and optimized for PCs. 1) Game controller is highly recommended. While it is not necessary you gonna have some difficulties controlling the game with the keyboard only (to me the mouse didn't work at all for i.e. looking around etc. = again speaks volumes of how lazy this port is). Good thing I found my old trusty Logitech controler. 2) Poor optimization and fps dips. No matter how awesome the game is it all becomes such a waste if the game is not responsive or dipping in frames. Let me give you an example:My pc: i7 6700k, Asus strix gtx 980 ti, 16gb ram, the game is stored on an SSD. During the close area missions the game will run on 4k and will usually stay at 120+ fps but here and there with no reason (no explosions or other graphically intense stuff) the game will dip to 60-30 fps. Then after a few intro missions you get to see and explore the open world finally. No matter what I did (switching resolutions from 4k to 1920x1080, playing around with other settings) the game will constantly drop from 130 to 90 or 60 or even sometimes 30 fps. A sudden dip from 130 to 30 is very unpleasant and gives the feeling of unresponsiveness. Thinking this is my hardware issue/ software problem I spent some time googling around and found out that this is the way the game was ported to PC and there is nothing much you can do about it besides living with it. The world keeps loading in stuff, popping up various objects and since it is doing it all the time (say you are Iron Man gliding above the streets of Lego NY) the frames will keep on dropping. You take a sharp turn in the sky, the frames dip from 120 to 60 then back up to 120 (which can cause motion sickness btw). Then you take another sharp turn and here we go back to 90 or 60 until the game loads everything on the ground. No settings, resolution changes could fix that. It is a shame because this game is so much fun and has so much stuff to offer for you to do.			"

												A friend described it to me as ""Grand Theft Marvel,"" and indeed, I was able to rampage around New York as the Rhino and then steal a car as Doctor Octopus (not sure why he would need to, but it was amusing).This game is huge, and I imagine only the truly dedicated will ever 100% complete it.  Between plenty of driving challenges, unlockable characters and vehicles, and a Marvel character around nearly every corner in the open-world part of the game, plus a complete campaign and a second ""deadpool"" campaign nearly the same length, this is a great game to keep you or your kids busy for weeks if you want.Seriously, i beat the main campaign and had about 35% of the game completed.

Lego Marvel Super Heroes takes your favorite characters from the Marvel universe and puts them into one fantastic game. The end result is what may be my favorite Lego game to date.The story of the game is simple; the Marvel superheroes team up to to stop the Marvel villains from taking over the planet. Even if you have no idea who these characters are, you can just hop right in and enjoy yourself. The gameplay is similar to the other Traveller's Tales Lego games, meaning that you'll have to complete each level by building Lego pieces and fighting other Lego bad guys. Playing through the main game is fun, especially with a controller and a friend with you.There are over 130 characters to unlock and play as, ranging from popular Marvel characters like Deadpool and Venom, to more obscure characters such as Squirrel Girl and Captain Britain (you can even unlock Stan Lee later on). In addition to these characters, there are also many alternate outfits for some of the main characters, such as the many different suits of Iron Man.But what makes this game really great is the New York City hub. When you're not in a mission, you'll be placed in the big map of Manhattan to do whatever you want. Do tasks to unlock characters, undertake sidequests given by civilians, or just fly around as Iron Man: the choice is yours. There are many hidden unlockables, missions, and objectives to do so you should be occupied for quite a while.You don't need to be a Marvel fan to see that Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a blast to play. Whether you're flying a jet through New York or fighting Red Skull, you will always have fun with this game. It's often on sale for $4.99, so grab it when you have the chance.			"

												Orginally, I loved the LEGO video game franchise. Then I played the Pirates of the Carribean on the Wii, and it was terrible. Not knowing what to do in the game was bad, but the bugs, and crashes were terrible. I was then a bit worried that this game was the same... BOY, I was WRONG!!! This game is amazing! I've played about 6 hours so far, but have encountered no bugs at all! The story was over the top, but good. The selection of characters, and customizable ones were awesome. It might get a bit repetitive, but it is worth it! After the six hours, I've only completed 6.9% of the game!UPDATE: After 7 1/2 hours I am 10.1% done			"

Great with Steam Big Picture (with an xbox controller), couch co-op, tons of unlockables, and just a feeling of progression with every play.   Open sandbox hub world is a treat as well!  Great for Marvel fans!Downsides are flight and vehicle controls that take getting used to, which thankfully are all just for side missions.(38 hours played, most of it with my wife and I, 100% achievements)			"

												This game surprises me it has gotten me to play more hours than what I expected , I know this game is supposed to be for kids and blah blah. But me as a teenager enjoyed this game real well , it feels like an adventure roaming the city and unlocking new stuff, solving puzzles and everything else. I suggest everyone should pick up this game. There is some minor problems. 1. Your Mouse and this game wont work, you have to set your keys and move your camera with different keys in my opinion it feels awkward.I.M.O.P This game has very few problems, sometimes I struggle on this game trying to solve puzzles ( Yes sometimes I'm dumb enough not to notice certain stuff) , over all I like this game and I believe this is an experience everyone should have.

												I was very reluctant at first when it came to purchasing this game, I am a Marvel addict but not a Lego one. I did however play Lego games and grew up with a sibling that loved Lego's more than life at times. So I spent 20 dollars and found, that this game is so amazing.It has a great and accurate story, runs great on my computer, and the best of all STAN LEE IS IN THE GAME. Well not really the best thing, but it is great to see him in another MARVEL franchise. However the game has more to offer than a story, it has local co-op and can be played with a controller, which of course made me purchase a used controller at the nearest game store. And it has free roaming, I can now compare it to GTA or just call it a rated E version of GTA. You can fly, drive, interact with civilians in need, punch bad guys, or be a bda guy and punch everything in sight that isn't breathing.This game has so much to offer to fans of Lego (games or phyiscal brand), or Marvel.9.5/10			"

It also offers many characters with different power sets, and the opportunity to walk around in Manhattan and do side quests.Downsides: the main storyline can feel repetitive after a while, due to similar kind of puzzles (when stuck, find something in the specific area that a member of your team can use his/her special powers on, use the special power, fight low-level enemies, repeat). Having said that, it's still a fun game that seems to be solidly built.			"

												Another high quality Lego take on a licensed property. Gameplay is very enjoyable, if fairly straightforward. Simple puzzles are tossed in to present a little challenge (although few would be considered tough). The storyline keeps the player moving through the levels, with Free Play offering even greater depth of play throughout. True to Lego & TT's past writing, you will find quite a few chuckles along the way.Pros- LOTS of characters, including Big Figs- Lots of vehicles- Quality voice acting (check the IMDB cast)- Plenty of things to do, places to go, objects to SMASHCons (mostly minor)- Hero flight controls - BLAH! You really should have avoided double up (dash) and double down (stop), as it makes trimming a pain- Some pathing issues, resulting in what should be avoidable deaths. Also a couple of PC crashes while playing- Auto, Boat, and Air vehicle spawns could have been different logos. I've seen many reports of players not getting 100%, until they remember the dock or air spawns needed to purchase remaining unlocked items* DLC doesn't seem to have much value (unless you really want those few characters)...also, is it just me, or do the writers not like Jean Grey (e.g. use her powers to push chairs back under a dining table?!)

												I was very reluctant at first when it came to purchasing this game, I am a Marvel addict but not a Lego one. I did however play Lego games and grew up with a sibling that loved Lego's more than life at times. So I spent 20 dollars and found, that this game is so amazing.It has a great and accurate story, runs great on my computer, and the best of all STAN LEE IS IN THE GAME. Well not really the best thing, but it is great to see him in another MARVEL franchise. However the game has more to offer than a story, it has local co-op and can be played with a controller, which of course made me purchase a used controller at the nearest game store. And it has free roaming, I can now compare it to GTA or just call it a rated E version of GTA. You can fly, drive, interact with civilians in need, punch bad guys, or be a bda guy and punch everything in sight that isn't breathing.This game has so much to offer to fans of Lego (games or phyiscal brand), or Marvel.9.5/10			"

												This game surprises me it has gotten me to play more hours than what I expected , I know this game is supposed to be for kids and blah blah. But me as a teenager enjoyed this game real well , it feels like an adventure roaming the city and unlocking new stuff, solving puzzles and everything else. I suggest everyone should pick up this game. There is some minor problems. 1. Your Mouse and this game wont work, you have to set your keys and move your camera with different keys in my opinion it feels awkward.I.M.O.P This game has very few problems, sometimes I struggle on this game trying to solve puzzles ( Yes sometimes I'm dumb enough not to notice certain stuff) , over all I like this game and I believe this is an experience everyone should have.

												50 hours. That is how long this game takes to complete for an experienced LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga player, like myself.  This means that the WHOLE 50 hours consists of me finding/doing something new, and generally having fun. Okay, so 4 out of 50 hours consisted of me and a few friends screwing around and causing chaos, but that's STILL more fun than going through the same Star Wars level 2 more times in repetitive ""Challenge"" and ""Super Story"" time trials, wherein you encounter nothing new. Fortunately, this game does NOT have these modes.Onto the game itself, it's standard LEGO platforming goodness. If you came here expecting something new and wildly different, you're out of luck.However, if you're a fan of adventurous, exploration-heavy platformers like Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet and Clank, you can't go wrong with this. The story's quite entertaining, and the characters are likeable. It's really on the easy side, but that just means you won't tear your hair out in frustration most of the time.Just watch out for the bugs, though. It's not as stable as LEGO Star Wars, and you might get stuck in due to an elevator door closing in on one of your characters, or just being unable to tag/switch to the other active character until heading to a new area.Also, turn off Vsync when using an LED monitor, or else you'll crash at scene changes.8/10			"

												This is the first LEGO game I have played since Indiana Jones and I am incredibly impressed at the improvents the series has made since then. The whole scope of this adventure feels much bigger than the ones before it. The voice acting is pretty great, even if it kind of deviates from the typical formula that I know. I'll find myself just running around New York City looking for collectibles and not even worry about the main story. There is so much to do in this game and it totally worth playing.			"

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is yet another 3D Platformer Lego game from Travellers Tales, this one coming out fresh from factory in 2013. This time it's all about pasta of Marvel. It also came out for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and WiiU. And there was handheld version ""universe in peril"" for NDS, 3DS and Vita. Which apparently had no free-roam, shortened levels with various many changes. And I guess you could fail the mission. Interesting.Anyway, they finally made PC version to be on same level as consoles, by having Steam Achievements and having all DLCs available to buy. Not that anybody would care about those DLCs, really, but we are talking about it in sense of ""is it complete version?"".Technically, it's about on same level as other recent Lego games. Glitchy sometimes. Like, at boss of Level 11 where I was supposed to switch to Wolverine, I probably switched way too early and the controls got completely stuck. Yea, at this point you are supposed to mash Special button to free this guy, but it didn't do anything and there was no promt to do it anyway. Then I quit the mission and tried to re-enter the level, where the game immeditly froze.So yea, people also report occasional crashes and other bugs and getting stuck in level geometry.Anyway, it's yet another Lego games. And the funny thing is that this one actually became a blockbuster of sorts. What's so different about it? Well, almost nothing, it just continues the sloooow evolutionary movement of Lego series. Compared to previous there is nothing big. But I guess it's true how saying ""keep doing things until one of them shoots off"" worked in this case. Probably because of all the Marvel fanservice.Or maybe because it just all fit nicely. Who knows.Anyway, can't die, beat everything, crush everything, do puzzles by choosing right characters, auto-build stuff. Stuff!I mean, what's the new here. Well. I guess that combo system is back like in Lego Batman, with a bit of Lego Batman 2. The more you defeat lego baddies, the higher combo number goes, up to 10. Which multiplies the studs that you grab. And also starting with 2x combo the enemies themselves drop the studs. So it actually becomes quite easy to get the needed studs per level for golden bricks. Oh well, jolly fun.There are also freeroam in a city. With quests. Probably better than Lego Batman 2. At least flying is done good here. Aside from doing sharp turn while flying fast, you can forget of it. It's fun.And look, you can be a hulk here!HULK SMASH!CLUBBERING TIME!Aside from times when you don't have hulk-like character.And for sake of Thor, the lazer-aiming thign is still too sensetive!It also has a bit more aggresive, albeit dumb, AI teammate. Bosses are fun and always there. And music seems to be both original and rocking.Eh, yet another Lego game. But I guess if you need to pick which one to play, then it should be this one. Maybe.			"

												I just finished the main storyline a few hours ago... The missions were really interesting and fun.. quite enjoyable... fewmissionswere shorter than others and some were longer. the final boss mission was one of my favorites. giving us the variety of using few famous super heroes and villains to defeat the boss.... free-roam gameplay is very amusing too. lets us unlock vehicles and characters and play side-missions too. another good thing about the game is that it is a game based on marvel. we get to play as our favorite super heroes and villains. and we get to use the vehicles. we see a lot of famous characters in the games and also a lot of iconic vehicles like the x-jet and the fantasticar... really good game overall. but what they could improve it with is adding dlc's with bigger maps and maybe different locations besides manhattan, new york. and maybe a dlc space pack or a DLC allowing us to play free-roam or do side missions in Asgard. It would be great if they have dlc's that enable us to add more maps to the current game map so we can roam in new places. maybe to that island in chapter 12... or a passage way to Asgard or some rocket to the space station. it would be better if this were in the main game.new, 31/10/14- They should add a DLC including the following characters i mention, that i thought should have been in the game due to their popularity and importance: Apocalypse, Ultron, the Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch & Kang the Conquerorgreat game overall...9.7/10			"

												I have loved every minute of this game! I've been a fan of all the lego games and mind you the series has definitley gotten easier than the original lego starwars.  But its still fun to play and has alot of laughs in store if you're into slapstick humour.			"

												Only REAL geniuses would think of a game like this. Lego Marvel Super Heroes is fun for everyone at any age, and you can play as several famous heroes and villains like Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Doctor Doom, Venom, The Abomination, Magneto and Spider-Man. Trust me, This is a really fun game :)			"

												I bought this game earlier this year, and was excited since I had been looking forward to playing it. It didn't let me down. I really don't think I can complain about Lego games since they're just kid-friendly fun. This modern one brings the Marvel super heroes together for the first time which is great to see since Disney and Fox license stuff, blah blah, and this game has a wide range of characters, fun levels, different gameplay elements and deadpool. For people saying keyboard controls are bad, I've got used to them.			"

												So I bought this rather than Lego Marvel's Avengers on the advice of a friend who said this had more content. He wasn't kidding! It's packed full of tidbits and Easter Eggs, nods both heavy-handed and subtle.Same basic gameplay you get in every Lego game - if you've played any before, there's very little new offered here. The hub world is a mini Manhatten, and it's impressively sized. Hundreds of side quests, races, hidden gold bricks, and characters are dotted around, and hunting them out can be quite the challenge! There's an impressive array of heroes, mutants, monsters etc. available, though apart from Iron Man very few people get even one alternative version - mostly just palette-swaps, although in some cases (Iron Man, Green Goblin and Jean Grey are the foremost) the alternative can be radically different. There are also vehicles available to collect and buy in a similar fashion, although since you unlock Iron Man as the very first character, as soon as you're free to explore the hub world you can fly anyway, so vehicles feel a little superfluous except for some of the racing side-quests.Levels are linear, and for the most part quite simple - though there is the occasional part that may leave you completely stumped! These games are aimed at a generally younger audience, so don't assume there'll be a great deal of challenge. There is a nice variety of challenges though, even if quick-time button-mashing gets a little stale. Overall, a bright and witty package that, while not difficult, still has enough content to entertain most people for some time. I've 100%ed it in just under 50 hours, which is a fair amount of playtime. One for fans of Marvel, or younger gamers.			"

												This is another in a long line of amazing Lego video games. If you've enjoyed one in the past and have an interest in the Marvel universe than you will without a doubt enjoy this game. Over 100 playable characters to choose from along with the ability to create your own! This game is great for children and adult alike, a combination of the usual interesting Marvel storylines with just the right amount of whimsy. Honestly I can't say a bad thing about this game!			"

												What an absolutely wonderful game. For anyone who has ever played the Lego games before, this is a giant step up, particularly if you haven't played since the early games like I have.  They added voice acting, open world, more detail, just everything.The amount of characters you can unlock is staggering, and they even group characters that are the same. So the variants of Iron Man are all in one rotating selection rather than separate characters themselves to pad out the character list that's already enormous. The open world of New York is amazingly fun to go through, and the game gives you many ways to go about it. The voice acting is top notch, they even managed to get Clark Gregg to reprise his role as Coulson, although having James Arnold Taylor as Spiderman was a bit offputting at first, kept seeing Ratchet instead of Spiderman.New York has many side-quests for you to do to unlock new characters, vehicles, and Gold Bricks, many of which require you to get new powers to obtain them so you can't get them all in one go. The streets are littered with attention, constant amounts of Studs placed around for you to pick up, with each area having completely different patterns and placements so no two buildings are the same. Really appreciate the time the folks who placed those put into it. You can hijack cars, although they're much slower than any form of transportation you already have, and drive into other cars, drive like a maniac, etc. But since it's a Lego game the characters don't break apart, they mainly just fall down and yell at you to watch where you're going.Side-quests by themselves are pretty standard, either you go pick something up, fight a wave of enemies, escort someone through the open streets, or race someone. The best part of them is honestly the starting and ending comments the characters make, and that makes up for the monotony of the whole thing.The writing is great, tons of jokes for kids, tons of jokes for comic fans, tons of jokes for adults, tons of everything for everyone to enjoy. The writing is also really aided by the silly things characters do in the background, like The Hulk sweeping things, or Coulson making jumps to save things Fury threw away, etc. SDeadpool can get to be pretty annoying, but I understand that's his entire thing, so I can deal with it, while Spiderman can be annoying at the start but ends up being enjoyable. Iron Man/Tony Stark is by far my favorite character along with The Thing, they both were great.The story levels are very enjoyable from a writing standpoint. It's really nice to hear the silly banter between characters and see them in the cutscenes. The levels feel alright, they're basically just ""Find a way to get this guy over here so you can get him to open something up for the other guy to open up"" over and over without much change throughout the entire game.Regarding gameplay, the fighting is the same as it always has been, mashing X to win, although the bosses seem to be way draw out this time. All bosses amount to spending ages waiting to hit them for one damage on their 3-6 heart health bar and then they fly away for a while and taunt you while sending a bunch of mooks your way. There's really no penalty at all for dying, you basically just lose 1,000 Studs which is absolutely nothing even from the start, and there's Extras to increase your four hearts to five as well. The actual use of the characters is fantastic though, any characters with flight, particularly Iron Man, are a joy to use pretty much anywhere and especially in the overworld. You get to go super fast and doing things like falling to the ground and boosting straight through the street never gets old. Now, the game does have its own share of problems. The draw distance is very poor, you will see stuff in terribly low resolutions on anything pretty much two buildings away even on high. The top of the Empire State Building has its spire and the ""fins""(Pardon me, don't know the exact name of those things) in some horribly low quality even when you're standing right next to it. In certain Free Play levels(5 for me) you can get stuck in elevators during area transitions, so you can't progress anymore because one character gets stuck in an infinite death loop and you can't switch or get them out in any way. Save and Quit sometimes fixes it, but not guaranteed. Help messages are a constant if you put subtitles on. They will never go away, they will always show up, even when you've beaten the game unless you turn off the subtitles. Getting stuck in items is very common, I would get stuck in boxes, walls, or sink into the floor at times which would require to either switch to another character and then wait a few seconds for the AI to teleport to me, or save and quit to fix it. The driving is completely awful, you turn so sharply that it's hard to control things and get caught up on the slightest of ledges in certain vehicles which makes the racing missing just that much harder. The AI pathing is awful. If you don't give the character an Iron Man(Or sometimes, even when you do) they will end up running into a corner for eternity because they can't get out. This is especially bad when they're Spiderman-type characters because they will get in a ""Jump on wall --> Fall down --> Run at wall --> Repeat"" pattern.All in all, this is a wonderful game. It's extremely charming, appeals to pretty much everyone, and even though it's quite easy and repetitive it knows how to hit all the sweet spots, whether you're a comic book fan or not. You also owe it to yourself to try out Iron Man at least once, flying as him is amazing and done perfectly.			"

												I'm gonna try something different and start this off with all the problems I have with this game.THERE IS NO SHUMA-GORATH.At its heart, this is a childrens game. That means there are going to be hint messages popping up nonstop. They will quickly get annoying, telling you things you have already proven through gameplay that you know how to do. There's no option to shut these off, and besides cluttering up the screen nonstop, this ruins a lot of moments that you might have to think for a few seconds over which character you should be using for something.Another thing you can't skip are the cut scenes. Even when you go back and replay a level in free play mode (as required in these games if you want to get completion) you will have to sit through the majority of the cut scenes. Rarely, it will let you skip one here and there while the rest offer no such option. I'm guessing this has to do with the cut scene in question being an in game cut scene, which many are, or an actual video that gets played. There is no online multiplayer. How the hell is this a thing developers still leave out? Not only does including drop in / drop out multiplay make your game more fun, but it means I will be playing it much more once I complete everything.The fighting mechanics really need some work. Characters automatically lock on to other characters, which means it is not uncommon to be trying to break an object while your hero constantly punches a harmless npc to death. This is sloppy on the development side, and really doesn't go with the whole ""hero"" thing they are trying to do with this game.The flying controls are also pretty bad. They will not so much block your progress as annoy you here and there. Flying close to the ground can result in landing when you had no intention to do so, and pitching up or down can be cumbersome and lead to you overshooting your desired position.The developer seems to have no interest in patching any of the issues people have with the game.You'll notice I still recommended the game. That's because it's a great entry to the LEGO series. Granted, I've missed a couple releases (I'll talk about why in a bit), but this changes a lot of the older design choices that were present in the first few titles. There's a real hub now, instead of just a room with doors that lead to various levels. You can run (fly, stomp, drive, whatever) around New York city, doing little sidequests for various NPCs, unlocking vehicles, or collecting studs. You can also return to the shield Helicarrier for other things to do, although it's much smaller in area than the hub is. The hub map can be used to replay levels, so you don't have to run back to the levels location.There are an amazing amount of playable characters here. You'll most likely run into characters that you will have to look up on wikipedia, as you may have never seen some of the more obscure ones. Howard The Duck even shows up. Sadly, some favorites are missing from the roster. No Shuma-Gorath? Really? Come on, LEGO. You did the tendrils on Venom and Carnage, why couldn't you have done Shuma's tentacles?  Still, Carnage is a nice addition that I wasn't really expecting. I thought they would have focused more on the characters that the general public was aware of from the movies.If you hadn't played a title in this series for a few years, as was my case, one of the first things you will notice is that the characters have voices now. I'm still not really sure how I feel about this. As far as I know, this started with Lord of the Rings. It's the reason I passed on picking up that title. While they aren't badly done, and allow deeper story telling, I feel the voices take away from some of the charm and silliness that the older silent figures.There's a lot to do here, and the hidden levels are interesting enough to want to seek out. The LEGO series has been around long enough that you probably know if these are your kind of thing or not. If they are, this is one of the better ones and worth picking up. If not, you may want to wait for a sale. This title goes on sale for five dollars on Humble Bundle and some other sites, so don't pay the full 20 dollar price tag here if you aren't dying for some LEGO fix.			"

												Pros: - Open world- Wide range of characters with unique characteristics and skills.- Details like, Spider-Man suspending himself upside down with a web-sling when you stop moving.- After beating the main storyline there is still 20+ hours of exploration, unlocking new characters and challenges to do.Tip: avoid any challenge/mission/etc. that involves flying.- Playing with friends made the game even better.Cons:- My fav. mutant is not included: Nightcrawler also Quicksilver, X-23,Kitty Pryde and Rogue.That makes me sad :'(- Game crashed:  3-4 times during story mode, 5-6 times during the Dormammu mission and never crashed during free play.- Got stuck with Hulk and Thing a few times and had to restart the mission.- Flying controls are horrible.I tried a few of these flying challenges and everytime I wanted to throw my controller across the room.I got frustrated a few times but in the end Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a great game and I've enjoyed almost every second  (Frigging flying races/challenges/whatever) I've  spent  playing.I recommend buying it and if it's on sale I HIGHLY recommend buying it.I'm sorry for my poor English.

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a great Lego game that holds hours of content.>Story:The game has his own story that is not based on any of the Marvel Universe movies or comics. Because it is not based on any movie or comic you will find a lot of heroes combining in diffirent teams which you have to use to solve puzzles and fight through heaps of enemies and super villains.The puzzles are well made and integrated into the story. Some puzzles might be a bit too hard for children, because the solution is not always showed immediatly. These harder puzzles do make it more entertaining for teenagers and mature people. >Gameplay:The Gameplay is nice and smooth, you don't need to have a very expensive PC to have nice graphics and good performance. One of the bad, yet importent thing in the gameplay is the fighting. Each hero or villain has his own special auto attacks that he or she will use from time to time. The auto moves are often not fluently when you are fighting and you down with what you are doing. In my opinion the moves look great, but they should take less time to finish or way to snap out of it since it can get frustrating when you are fighting a boss and there are a lot of enemies to kill.Besides this the game is great! The game features a great open world based on New York City that you can explore, discover, collect and help people in. In this open world there are story mission implemented. Aswell as in the story missions and the open world you can collect gold bricks which unlock the special missions of Deadpool. All these things will make sure that you are at least 30-40 hours busy to just get all levels and then there is still not everything in the game done.Another great feature of this game is that it supports nearly every controler. I plugged in my PS3 and PS4 controller and they both work with the game. The keyboard controls are not very friendly to use. Especially when you are playing with a friend so the ability to plug in two controllers and go is just great.>Characters:One thing I liked a lot about this game is that it features nearly every character in the Marvel Universe. Since this is a thing the movie world has problems with I found it great to play with aswell Iron Man and Wolverine. The game is also made in a way where diffirent characters need to use their abilities to help their team mates. It is impossible to do one level with just 1 character.>Final Verdict:The game is great and gives you more than enough content to play with for the price you are buying it for.  I recommend this game to everyone that likes Lego, Marvel or just puzzle games in general. I am still having a great experience with this game and I love the controller support which makes it so easy to play with my friend.9.5 / 10			"

												If you're a Marvel fan, or just a LEGO video game fan, I highly recommend this one. The gameplay is fantastic. There are a ton of chartacters and each one has a unique power based on their comic book counterpart. There is also alot of slots for creating custom characters. The voice acting is good for the mpst part but some are not ideal for that particular character. However, some of the characters are actually voiced by their movie actor like Clark Gregg, who plays Agent Coulson in the movies and TV show. One thing I really enjoy is the free-roam. When not playing the story, there is a huge free-roam area. In this area, you can destroy things, drive cars, do small missions, etc. I grew up playing LEGO Star Wars, which doesn't have a large area to roam. Especially in The Complete Saga. It was just the Cantina. So from playing that game, to now playing this one, there is a huge and positive difference. The only thing I would say got me was the actual levels themselves. They are extremely repetative, unlike other LEGO games where the game goes along with the story from the moives. This game has a made up story so even though the background and enemies are different each time, the style for each one is similar. But other than that again, I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a LEGO game that takes a while to get to 100%!			"

												This was a change of pace from the more recent games of the Lego franchise, it almost had that old nostalgic feel of being able to explore in story mode and find secrets and or minikits,  if you were willing to spend the time to do that rather than being locked into the linear progression of the actual story.  I must say I did enjoy it, I've always like the large hubs to explore this game is one of my favorites for that reason alone. The amount of characters is always growing for sure but the character customizer has lost the fun it used to have.  Seems like Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga had way more customizing choices than this. But for the most part if you like Lego games you'll probably enjoy this one.I give it a (8 out of 10).I'm looking forward to playing Lego Age of Ultron for sure!			"

The added touch of actual voice acting instead of just generic grunting like sounds adds another level of awesome.I would recommend playing with an XBox controller however, as in my opinion the keyboard controls are a bit awkward. Other than that, excellent, fun game.			"

												I really enjoyed the game, as a lego and a marvel fan this game was perfect for me. There are problems with the flying being not very good and some of the map icons for stan lee being covered by other icons, appart from these tiny errors I found this game one of the most enjoyable lego game I ever played.

												This game is like a dream.  Literally.  Some things are weird, some things frustrate you, but it is magical and amazing the whole way though.  If you're a big comic reader, there are tons of Easter eggs to amuse you.  If you've only a casual fan, there are still plenty of funny bits for you too.  Best played with a friend for zany antics.  Do not ever use Hawkeye's sky cycle.  It is the worst vehicle ever designed by man.			"

												Game Review by Dragon: Lego Marvel Super HeroesStars: ***Good bits: Lots to do. Heaps of the Marvel characters are playable. Game only _really_ needs two playthroughs.Bad bits: Many of the (freeplay) side missions are repetitive, boiling down to 'cabby', 'fetch', 'race', 'destroy', and 'obstacle course' (my least favourite). No 'skip' function for Deadpool's intro's (funny, for sure, but once is enough).Main story: Made as much sense as any real-world Marvel (or DC for that matter) story. :) Other stuff: I loved the inclusion of so many of the Marvel minor players (Squirrel Girl!!). I would've preferred Deadpool was playable from the get-go (but that's me - he's one of my favourite characters). For a game aimed at little kids, I think some of the missions and puzzles were extremely tough, possibly impossible without a very patient teen or adult 'helper'. That said, I had fun. Worth the price? Yep.			"

I did like the quality of the game, voice acting and humor. The story was fantastic, and side missions were entertaining. I finished the game 100% and the only thing I did not feel like I wanted to do in this game were the sky races. Flying was jittery and not as smooth as I would like. Other than that this game is a definite buy if you enjoy LEGO games.			"

												Classic tried-and-true puzzle-platformer LEGO game format meets Marvel's really bloody big character pool with a fair few well-known voice actors and a fantastically written for-all-ages script.Given it's a LEGO game with another properties' stuff, you've got LOADS to do if you want to 100% it, too. While some of it is retracing your steps with different characters in free-play modes of the standard non-hub levels, there's a surprising amount to do outside in the hub.The hub is Manhattan, so if you play as LEGO Spidey, you can be playing a simplified child-friendly Spider-Man 4, basically. Each character has their own abilities, and you figure out what character combinations can solve small puzzles together to unlock more characters to play with in free-play or about NYC. On top of that, there's races, citizen-helping, Gold Brick collecting... etc; etc.Basically, it's a big game with a lot to it, the only /real/ big problem is that LEGO gameplay is pretty familiar at this point, but that's only really an issue if you've played a lot of these.

												LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is pretty much what it sounds like- a Lego game with Marvel super heroes. Following in the footsteps of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, it is the second Lego game in recent years to be open world, in this case in New York City. The city is pretty big if you're just walking around but if you're flying around as Iron Man or another character, it doesn't take too long to get from one side of the city to the other. If you want to explore something other than New York City, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is up in the air as well. As far as the story goes, it feels like a Marvel story mixed in with the humor you expect from Lego games. I'm only a few missions into the game but the story so far isn't too bad.The game plays pretty well, although I have heard some complaints about the keyboard layout which you can change if you don't like it. The way you control the camera is a bit weird because movement is mapped to WASD and the camera is mapped to PL:"", and there is no way to use the mouse to control the camera. I don't really mind this that much but it is still a minor nuisance. Some characters have special movement abilities like flight. Others like Spider-Man and Venom can web-swing. The web-swinging can look weird sometimes because the webs don't actually connect to buildings. You can be above all of the buildings up high in the air and still be able to web-swing. Again, I don't mind it that much but it looks pretty strange and unrealistic.If there's one thing I'm really happy about with this game it's the amount of playable characters. I'm pretty sure theres over 100 of them, possibly 150, some with a few different costumes. You unlock these characters either by earning them by completing levels or buying them with studs. There are also several vehicles to unlock.The game looks great. The graphics are great, the character's costumes look great, and each character has their own unique animations that look awesome. The soundtrack is really good as well.That's pretty much it. This is one of the best, if not the best, Marvel super-hero games I've ever played and is one of the best ones ever made. The last Marvel super hero game like this I played was Ultimate Alliance (the first and second) which I absolutely loved, and this beats them by a landslide. If you're a Lego fan, a Marvel fan, or a super hero/comic book fan, I highly reccomend this game. 9.5/10			"

												LEGO Marvel is the freedom of LEGO Lord of the Rings, feel and level design of the original LEGO Batman, and original story of LEGO City Undercover, all mashed into one awesome game. My only complaint is the large amount of glitches; most of them can be easily fixed by lowering the screenres, but the now-infamous ""Ripple"" across the screen in water/illusion levels can only be fixed by messing around with Bloom/Depth of Field. But glitches aside, this game has everyone from MODOK to Howard the Duck, from She-Hulk to Doctor Strange, and everything in between, featuring 50 cameos from Stan Lee! If you like LEGO games, Marvel, or are just in the mood for a free-roam action game where you can pick up and throw cars, this is the game for you. 9/10			"

												I've started playing the Lego-games when Lego Star Wars first came out.The games are pretty uncomplicated, and the basic gameplay is easy to learn and great fun!Same goes for this version: it's great fun.The only thing i hated though was the racing part.Seems like you need an gamepad to do so, otherwise this is really hard.(i haven´t been able to complete a single race with my keyboard...)Playtime will differ a lot per person, depending mostly on your motivation to collect nothing or everything.Single playthourgh of the storyline took me about 15 hrs.Collecting everything... well, still ongoing (don't know if i'll make it though because of the all the races).Downside of colleting everything is that the gameplay gets very repetitive.So in short: great game with a lot of humour, mostly targeted on kids (or Lego fanatics).

												One of the best Lego game to come out for years!Lego Marvel Superheroes has fun free roam missions, and an amazing list of characters (Although a few fan-favorites are missing, like Nightcrawler and Vision). The dialogue in story missions can be a little cringe-worthy, but it doesn't take away very much from the neat environments you get to explore, like a dinosaur-inhabited island, or a super-villain prison in the midst of a breakout. I must say that the character customizer is very fun, the only downside being that certain powers you may want are linked to a certain hero or villain's piece: For example, you can't have elastic abilities unless you use Mr. Fantastic's hair. Vehicles obviously don't have to play a huge part in this game, since the very first character you unlock is a FLYING minifigure, but it's still nice to have The Punisher's truck, and Ghost Rider's bike. This game is almost like GTA 5 in the sense that there are lots of glitches you can find when playing, but they only seem to add to the fun, rather than be an annoyance. Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone (Regardless of if they like Legos) who enjoys free-roaming and exploring for hours; Even story missions are fun to replay, because there are so many hidden things to find!... There is just one more thing that bothers me a bit: How come out of ALL the weapons in the game, Moon Knight's BOOMERANGS are the ones that DON'T come back to you after they're thrown?  :P			"

												The LEGO games seem to have an incredible way of turning a popular franchise, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even the Marvel franchise into a fun, enjoyable and jam packed with content into one single package, and many people seem to think that Marvel Super Heroes could be the best out of the Lego series, and frankly, I would have to agree with them.Marvel Super Heroes has sooo much in it, and it completely took me by surprise when I first realised this. I had opened the game, and jumped straight into a level, presuming this was similar to one of their earlier titles, LEGO Star Wars which was mostly just pick a mission and get started. Oh, but this was not that. After I had finished the mission, the game rather quickly decided to show me that this game was nothing short from a sandbox game where you could play your favourite super hero and run, or fly around the city, doing missions and beating up bad guys and whatever else the citizens needed your help with.The sandbox element was a great implementation, and certainly increases the lifespan of this game, along with all the collectibles you can get and all the super heroes you can unlock. Which, brings me onto my next point.This is a pretty big game, and it's no secret that it will be much more fun with freinds or family, of all ages I should add. The game isn't too hard to get a handle on, there's no gore, no obscene situations that could get you in trouble, and whether you're 8 or 80, you can enjoy this game. The younger audience will be a fan of the fun, enjoyable combat, the cool super heroes and even the humour, and so will anybody else, along with some more adult-esque jokes that won't necessarily be understood by the younger lot, but it won't stop anybody else having a nice little chuckle.Overall, this is a great LEGO game, and a great game in general for that matter. Loads of content, suitable for pretty much all ages, and an all around good, fun time.			"

												As with other versions of LEGO games, it follows the similar style of lego being the main recipe of the game but by no means does that make this it boring. The story is fantastic introducing a wide array of characters from the marvel universe as well as Stan Lee, of course. The aspect which I particularly enjoyed was that you are able to free roam around New York at any point so if you get bored of the story then you can attempt challenges and races throughout the streets of New York and not to mention the SHIELD Helicarrier.Once you complete the story which will set you back some time, there is still plenty more to do and plenty of characters to unlock. The humour and easter eggs are littered throughout the game which will just add to the pleasure of playing the game. Any fan of marvel will enjoy playing the game very much and lovers of lego can add this to their collection in confidence that it is a great game.			"

												This game is too good for words.I was expecting much lower of this game but with all the variety with the characters is mind boggoling. They must've worked their brains out, and the graphics in the cutscenes are amazing and I especially love how a character can have different costumes, so its not just a seperate character. It's extremely hard to spot any plot-holes, bugs, glitches or things to exploit wich makes this game AMAZING, SPECTUACULAR , FANTASTIC!!!! (Yeah i went there!) and all of the little details in the background eg. Vote JJJ, Mark 6 billboard and so on..*SPOILER DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE GAME OR ARE ON THE LAST LEVEL*The Galactus plot twist was awesome...i never saw that coming!!*UNSPOILER*One teensy problem is...the galactus character....well its the size of a nomal mini fig and thats sorta dissapointing...The DLC  is AWESHUMSummary:This game will be worth both your time and money, 4.9 starsStory: Good and humorous,overall score is 8/10Characters: So many of them and so much variety and costumes..villans heros the netuarals...10/10 I also like the concept of big-figsFree Roam: Iconic Buildings that will be sure to strike a Marvel fans attention. Web swinging and flying is fun to do.Boss Fights: Boss fights are fun...but sometimes get a bit too much puzzley. Like the levels sometimesThis game is fun and you won't wanna stop playing till you've done 100% of everything so enjoy this game True Belivers...EXELSCIOR!!!!			"

												I've played just about every single LEGO video game. This one has been by far the best of the franchise. My 9 year old son and I have enjoyed it endlessly. There is a huge roster of characters ranging from the popular and familiar characters down to the much lesser known. Of course, the lesser known characters available to play are a bit bland to use but some have special necessary skills around the world of which can progress the player. Flying around as Thor or Human Torch and etc. hasn't been manifested in any other game like this. Yes it is a LEGO game so you can't expect anything ground-breaking but it is a ton of fun.			"

Some of my favorite parts are when you actually get to Lego, they just let you Lego all day, there's even a part where you Lego my Eggo (What a throwback!). Sometimes people ask me ""All Night Lulz, what game should I play?"" I say ""Who are you. How did you get in my house. Its 3AM. Play a Super Lego game. Get away from me. I'm calling the cops."" And then the cops show up and I'm like ""I dunno officer, it was really dark and I couldn't really see what he looked like. He had a hat. I think.""If that isn't a good Lego Brick game then I don't know what are. "

												Being sceptical I was always a bit put off by all these lego games but I had my family/friends finally talk me into to trying it and its a game I could play in front of my kid.  So I gave it a shot and for the love of god I think I found this more addictive then half the games I have played of late. Not only is this just childish fun for all ages its was made to to practically just enjoy. Not only that it is a game I can keep around and save for my kid when she is a bit older and can use controllers and such right that she would most likely enjoy. It was fun to play and have my friends watch to have them get jumpy when im at an edge or guess what the next thing to be constructed to go forward would be. Thanks to the play time on this one I will be grabbing more of these games in the future. They are a good games to chillout with alone, with family, or with friends. The nest part of feeling like a giant kid again is seeing characters I grew up with used to entertain kids still and just like some of the movies out there this game delivers that. Its a nice introduction to characters for kids of all ages who don't know who they are or may have only heard of them. That and this game gets you thinkingand changing thing up with the needs of other characters to work together to get things done or the need to g back with a certain character just to unlock things. Its a small mental and memory practice in a creative game. If your kid, friend, or family member loves fun games, has ever loved legos, and loves super heros this is a good grab for them. Kick back and enjoy some childish fun!			"

												I am enjoying this game, both as a comic books fan and a gamer at heart. While some parts might be cheesy, the game is full of  Marvel fanfare, from the frequent Stan Lee cameos (like seriously, the man will appear more than most superheroes) to many jokes about some of the heroes via idling. I do have concerns though; the game sometimes crashes without any notice like freezing or sudden audio breaks, the jokes may be too childish for those looking for a serious storyline (like the constant reference to the shwarma through the game), some continuity issues may bother some (Why is Doctor Doom asking for Red Skulls help? He hates Nazis) and Maria Hill is too chippish for my taste (SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A SKRULL!!). All in all, it's a good game			"

												LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best of TT's LEGO games; great presentation, lots of Marvel characters to choose from (with a ton of comic references) and simple but fun combat. The inclusion of NYC as an open world hub for level selection puts other 'open world' superhero games  to shame thanks to the simple LEGO game mechanic/staple of wanting to  destroy and loot everything, thus making the world far more interactive and fun to be in. I'm more of a DC guy than a Marvel guy, but this is game is an absolute treat for all comic fans and probably the best use of the licence since Marvel Vs Capcom series.			"

This game is made for the fun, for the action, and— HEY SPIDERMAN IS HERE WITH THE AVENGERS. Oh and every superhero character in the MARVEL universe is here. Best played using a controller.			"

												I liked it and it was a fun, very relaxing game. But I thought I'd take to the reviews section just to warn everybody about the rooftop remote-car race - goddam buggiest piece of poop I ever did see. Mega frustrating and almost ruins my recommendation based on relaxation. But overall I'd say the 3rd best lego game after Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.			"

												I'll start by saying this game is fun.  It's a great open world Lego take on the Marvel universe.  If theres a Marvel character you want to play as theres a very good chance that they are in this game.  The game also covers a good amount of recognizable marvel locations that also gives a good variety in the playable levels.  The game isn't very long if you just play the main story missions.  However there is a a lot of side content that adds some length to the game, though one downside to that content, it is recycled a fair bit.  You can only battle 'X' amount of guys, race against a character or fetch someone/something before it gets a little repetitive.  There is a couple of annoying bugs here and there if you are going for the 100%. Things like character tokens appearing but no mission showing (you can get the character just have to wait for the mission to show up, a little frustrating).  Sometimes some prompts won't show up and have to do some manual targetting.  But other than that never ran into anything game breaking.The game goes on sale frequently, so I suggest pick it up on a sale and enjoy.			"

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes is similar to most other Lego <Insert X franchise here> games, Although Traveller's Tales have really stepped up their game here. Lego Marvel features a TON of different characters from the Marvel Universe as well as vehicles, locations, easter eggs etc etc.This game is a lot of fun both single-player and co-op. The Story missions have you doing puzzles to progress in levels and at the end of each main campaign mission you get to fight a boss, the boss fights in Lego Marvel are all very puzzle based but I think TT did a great job with them because the fights all feel very satisfactory and nice to pull off even if they are somewhat simple. Lego Marvel has an insanely good Game Feel, wiping out tons of enemies feels good, finding secrets feels good. Everything just feels good.I got 100% in this game in around 30h and it was well worth it, the Open-world segment of the game is so much fun with tons of secret collectables and fun sidequests to do, the rewards for collecting stuff is good as well so it feels worth it to do everything in the open-world hub.Overall, Lego Marvel plays like your typical Lego game but with many recognizable characters from the Marvel universe as well as a fantastic Open-world mechanic and a lot to do.9/10			"

												I've played just about every single LEGO video game. This one has been by far the best of the franchise. My 9 year old son and I have enjoyed it endlessly. There is a huge roster of characters ranging from the popular and familiar characters down to the much lesser known. Of course, the lesser known characters available to play are a bit bland to use but some have special necessary skills around the world of which can progress the player. Flying around as Thor or Human Torch and etc. hasn't been manifested in any other game like this. Yes it is a LEGO game so you can't expect anything ground-breaking but it is a ton of fun.			"

Some of my favorite parts are when you actually get to Lego, they just let you Lego all day, there's even a part where you Lego my Eggo (What a throwback!). Sometimes people ask me ""All Night Lulz, what game should I play?"" I say ""Who are you. How did you get in my house. Its 3AM. Play a Super Lego game. Get away from me. I'm calling the cops."" And then the cops show up and I'm like ""I dunno officer, it was really dark and I couldn't really see what he looked like. He had a hat. I think.""If that isn't a good Lego Brick game then I don't know what are. "

												Game Review by Dragon: Lego Marvel Super HeroesStars: ***Good bits: Lots to do. Heaps of the Marvel characters are playable. Game only _really_ needs two playthroughs.Bad bits: Many of the (freeplay) side missions are repetitive, boiling down to 'cabby', 'fetch', 'race', 'destroy', and 'obstacle course' (my least favourite). No 'skip' function for Deadpool's intro's (funny, for sure, but once is enough).Main story: Made as much sense as any real-world Marvel (or DC for that matter) story. :) Other stuff: I loved the inclusion of so many of the Marvel minor players (Squirrel Girl!!). I would've preferred Deadpool was playable from the get-go (but that's me - he's one of my favourite characters). For a game aimed at little kids, I think some of the missions and puzzles were extremely tough, possibly impossible without a very patient teen or adult 'helper'. That said, I had fun. Worth the price? Yep.			"

												Not without its flaws, but still does a great job of selling the superhero power fantasy, and has plenty of stuff to collect and do. I was disappointed when I realized that its multiplayer is local only, since that's a strange thing to have on a PC game, but the single player experience was still well worth the price of admission. Combat can get a little samey and the special moves sometimes drag on, but it's still a fun beat 'em up puzzler, the same as I've come to expect from most Lego titles.			"

												I took advantage of Steam Holiday Sale and bought LEGO Marvel Superheros. It took me a while, but I managed to finish this game in 100%. It wasn't a walk in the Central Park, though.I really enjoyed the main storyline and Deadpool stories and even going back through all levels with different mix of heroes and villains to get every possible collectible was quite fun. Especially when some characters have very unique special attacks, which keeps things interesting.On the other hand, the free roam on the streets of Manhattan felt more like a chore. The sub-quests for citizens and heroes quickly become repetitive. I suppose the racing quests were supposed to keep things fresh, but, because of dreadful controls, those were an utter failure. Driving races are just so-so, you can do them when you accustom yourself with how the vehicle reacts to a controller. The flying is just frustrating. The idea of using acceleration and free-fall buttons to adjust height must have come from a mind of a sadist.Let me explain how flying (not) works: to fly upwards, you press A button, but if you double tap it, the flying hero goes into hyper-fast flight (usually in the wrong direction). Similarly, to fly downwards you press B button, but if you double tap it, you loose all speed and just drop to the ground (dragging the camera with you).Overall it's a good game, but it has it's flaws. Because of it's flawed controls, I enjoyed only main missions part of this game, so I don't think it's really worth full retail price. It's best to wait for some kind of sale or a price drop.			"

												While it's probably the most well made LEGO game since the LEGO HP series, the ""side quests"" of collecting gold bricks in the open world is way too tedious to be worth your time. I didn't play through LEGO LotR/Batman 2, and maybe that was an issue in those games as well because of the open world, but in all other LEGO games I found those sections of manipulating the world with new characters to be the best aspect of them. In this, it's a lot of escort quests (that are infuriating because you have to run along side whichever character you're escorting back to the start of the mission) or helping another hero kill some kind of enemy. Collecting the character and vehicle tokens around the world is a little bit more enjoyable, but it's not enough to save what I thought was the most fun part of some of the other LEGO games.All that said, the story and Deadpool bonus levels are loads of fun, and Traveller's Tales proves yet again that they can construct a game which stands on its own without relying on another storyline in the property. It's still well worth your time and money, I just didn't enjoy the extra content as much as I have in the past.			"

												LEGO Marvel is the freedom of LEGO Lord of the Rings, feel and level design of the original LEGO Batman, and original story of LEGO City Undercover, all mashed into one awesome game. My only complaint is the large amount of glitches; most of them can be easily fixed by lowering the screenres, but the now-infamous ""Ripple"" across the screen in water/illusion levels can only be fixed by messing around with Bloom/Depth of Field. But glitches aside, this game has everyone from MODOK to Howard the Duck, from She-Hulk to Doctor Strange, and everything in between, featuring 50 cameos from Stan Lee! If you like LEGO games, Marvel, or are just in the mood for a free-roam action game where you can pick up and throw cars, this is the game for you. 9/10			"

If you're a big comic reader, there are tons of Easter eggs to amuse you.  If you've only a casual fan, there are still plenty of funny bits for you too.  Best played with a friend for zany antics.  Do not ever use Hawkeye's sky cycle.  It is the worst vehicle ever designed by man.			"

Look out for the cut scenes, they make the game, some great one liners. Very easy to control, even our four year old son is a bit of an expert now, to the point where he tells us what to press and how to get on ledges and ropes etc.  Too many hours of fun playing the characters, both the well known Marvel line-up and the more obscure and nerdtastic.

												I am enjoying this game, both as a comic books fan and a gamer at heart. While some parts might be cheesy, the game is full of  Marvel fanfare, from the frequent Stan Lee cameos (like seriously, the man will appear more than most superheroes) to many jokes about some of the heroes via idling. I do have concerns though; the game sometimes crashes without any notice like freezing or sudden audio breaks, the jokes may be too childish for those looking for a serious storyline (like the constant reference to the shwarma through the game), some continuity issues may bother some (Why is Doctor Doom asking for Red Skulls help? He hates Nazis) and Maria Hill is too chippish for my taste (SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A SKRULL!!). All in all, it's a good game			"

 I'm not a Marvel fan, and I also don't like the idea of mixing movies together which has basically no connection with each other. Makes no sense. I prefer playing LEGO Games that walk through a full movie, like the Harry Potter, but this one was about only random missions with characters that I've never heard of. I like games with a long story mode, but this game is 85% about side quests which have no connection with any Marvel movies. And I really... really hate all the races in the open world.But hey, did you ever wanted to ride a lion to the top of a skyscraper?I gave a chance to the game and well, I enjoyed it after I stopped comparing to other LEGO titles.100% progress and all achievements unlocked.

												Not without its flaws, but still does a great job of selling the superhero power fantasy, and has plenty of stuff to collect and do. I was disappointed when I realized that its multiplayer is local only, since that's a strange thing to have on a PC game, but the single player experience was still well worth the price of admission. Combat can get a little samey and the special moves sometimes drag on, but it's still a fun beat 'em up puzzler, the same as I've come to expect from most Lego titles.			"

												Best LEGO Game ever. Of all time. I know that sounds like a cop-out, but it's pretty much true. The LEG games don't vary too heavily in gamplay, but neither do the Call of Duty games, the Portal games, or the Mega Man games. And guess what? They're still awesome. So is LEGO Marvel. The character roster is of record-breaking size, busting even LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga's impressive list. The world is massive, yet fun to explore, much more so than in LEGO Batman 2, and that was still fun. The voice acting is solid and very charming, with all the characters's protrayals bridging a fine line between proper representation and parody. There's plenty to do, but sometimes it's just a heck of a lock more fun to simply rampage around as one of the unstoppable powerhouse bigfigs.The character creator is disappointing, since, while it gives your characters many of the traits and some of the abilities of the templates, it does not give you all of them. For example, with Human Torch's powers, you can shoot fireballs, but not a heat beam, and you can't flame on. That just doesn't seem right. There's also a consistent visual bug with Mr. Fantastic's powers, with the arms and face not rendering when stretched. The concept was a really good one, though, wihich makes this all the more disappointing.Overall, though, if you steer clear of the clunky creator, you should be good, and you will most likely have a whale of a time with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.Oh, one more thing. Venom is so totally the coolest character in the game. Don't let anyone tell you differently.			"

												This game isn't exactly original. It uses characters that almost everyone knows (and many that only a few Marvel superfans will know) and places them in a game that uses mechanics, puzzles and systems identical to almost every other Lego game. However, it's the execution that makes this game amazing. The world looks exciting and is huge, full of side quests that I'm going to spend weeks doing. The missions are surprisingly entertaining considering how formulaic they are. Plus, it has the classic co-op you've come to love in a Lego game. That means co-operation until you get to the main hub at which point, god help us all. This game is full of content that could take months to finish but it's all entertaing. This is easily the best Lego game I've played and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Lego, Marvel or fun.			"

												Finished the gameplay in about 15 hours and have spent the rest of the time unlocking as many characters as possible as well as playing the mini-games and extra levels afterward.  I'm a big Marvel fan, going way back, and it's great to see that they have included some really old-school characters in here as well as incorporated the various iterations of some characters through the years (I'm really glad 80s Wolverine with the brown costume is here, but I'm also kind of bummed Silver Centurion Iron Man isn't).  Regarding gameplay, it's a LEGO so what else can you say?  Smash & break everything you can and keep collecting those bits.  Saving Stan Lee in every level has become my current mission.

												LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best of TT's LEGO games; great presentation, lots of Marvel characters to choose from (with a ton of comic references) and simple but fun combat. The inclusion of NYC as an open world hub for level selection puts other 'open world' superhero games  to shame thanks to the simple LEGO game mechanic/staple of wanting to  destroy and loot everything, thus making the world far more interactive and fun to be in. I'm more of a DC guy than a Marvel guy, but this is game is an absolute treat for all comic fans and probably the best use of the licence since Marvel Vs Capcom series.			"

												One of the best games i've ever played!Pros:- A bunch of different characters- Nice missions and story levels- Cool humor- Open World is fantastic- LEGO- PriceCons:- A little buggy at some levels (nothing that makes the game unplayable)Final word: If you love LEGO and like a little bit of Marvel, that's already your favorite game. A good humor mixed with a lot of variation of everything. If you have the money, you should buy it!			"

												cute and entertaining first person game that had both action and a few puzzles to solve (nothing difficult)- cute graphics, looks good (even on a big flatscreen)- good controls (and you will need them)- Long levels with a few stories/movies in them to tell the story (very entertaining)- lot of levels, so you will have a looooot of hours to play.- very kid friendly.- multiplayer / co-op support (playes it with two players / split screen) "

												Pros:-Individualized movesets for the characters, plenty of wink-nods at the comics and movies-Lots of attention to detail-Impossibly huge roster-So much to do??  SO MUCH IT'LL NEVER GET DONE-Huge open world, relatively fast loading screens-DeadpoolCons:-Weird glitches here and there, character select is quirky-Game-breaking glitch at the end of the Lady Liberty level, cross your fingers-Car controls are not great; toy car controls are Hulk rage-inducing-Flying is awesome but also controls like a shopping cartThat said I was able to drive down the sidewalk in an ambulance as Captain America.10/10 would simulate American health care system again.

												4/5 - More fun than you're probably expectingOk it's Lego, however don't be fooled, this isn't just for kids, really good writing and the occasional dodgy reference from deadpool mean that I enjoyed this title maybe more than if I were 12 again. So much effort has been put into Lego games as of late that they're really worth checking out, and this may be the best one yet.It's an open world manhattan island, in which you can run around as almost anyone you want from the marvel universe, whether you're swinging between tall buildings as spiderman, smashing cars as juggernaut and or recreating your favourite moments on sheild's sky carrier as nick fury, it's all a blast. Obviously it's not as gritty as other sandbox games like GTA, but you can steal cars, even though you feel pretty silly doing it when many characters can fly.The gameplay is half action half puzzle, so boss fights are rarely about who can punch who the hardest and much more about how can you leverage the environment to best your foes. It leans hevaily on the Lego dynamic, requiring you in many cases to build solutions to your problems from the rubble caused by the fights themselves, all the while battling increasing numbers of super powered minions to boot. This does get in the way once or twice as boss characters were left standing in the middle of the map, completely invulnerable while I ran around looking for stuff to build. However, once I got into the puzzle frame of mind, these things didn't stand out as much. It's not dark souls after all; once I stopped waiting to backstab the red skull while he was reloading things moved on a little quicker.Levels are well thought out on the whole with puzzles that require you to switch characters and work as a team; often one character will need to open the way up for the others who can't traverse a particular section yet. Sometimes this feels a little contrived as there are switches which only be opened by Captain America's sheild or Wolverine's claws; probably not the best feature to have inside your evil lair is it Dr Doom? However the game is varied and fast paced enough to keep this from breaking up the flow too much.The main draw here is the attention to detail that's been put into creating the Marvel universe, each of the characters make jokes and references to their joint past, especially as shown in the recent films, and it gives a real sense of continuity to the storyline. While it builds on the recent movies, the story itself is completely new. It ties together a vast array of charcters, tying them together in interesting, if not always surprising ways. I think this was pulled off better than in Arkham city, which felt more like a parade of characters, whereas LMSH has the usual suspects joining forces and advancing the plot a little more seamlessly.If you're a fan of Marvel give it a bash, the jokes are actually pretty good and the amount of Marvel-y stuff to do will definately keep you entertained. It's not gritty or particularly deep but blasting your way around the New York skyline as your favourite superhero actually doesn't get tiring too quickly.			"

												Finally a game that lets you play as the Avengers,the Xmen, the Guardians of the Galaxy or if you fancy it you can play as one of the bad guys like the Green Goblin or Loki. This is another brilliant game from the Lego series and like previous Lego games it's a lot of fun and a game that has appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers. This game sees you through various missions where you will play a variety of Marvel characters each with their unique abilities and advantages. So Hulk can lift heavy objects while Iron Man can destroy them with rockets. The levels are the usual types that you'll see in a Lego game i.e collecting studs, using different characters abilities to progress and so on. When your not playing a level you have a nice open-world Manhatten to explore where you can solve puzzles, do quests and races to unlock gold bricks or more characters. The game also introduces driveable vehicles which although are not utilized much in the levels are still a fun distraction in the open-world section.The story isn't bad either with all the villains teaming up under Loki and Dr.Doom to collect cosmic bricks which the heroes have to stop them. One of the great things about the characters in this game is they are all brilliantly voiced in the game which really brings the characters to life in the game.The Good:-has pretty much every Marvel hero and villian from the more famous like Iron Man and the Hulk to the more obscure.-fun gameplay that can be enjoyed by anyone.-open-world Manhatten is a great feature with the ability to fly around or even drive.-characters are brilliantly voiced in this game (Deadpools commentary in the extra levels is fantastic)The Bad:-gameplay can feel a bit repetetive at times- AI can be terrible at times particularly in freeplayOverall Lego have pulled off another brilliant game that anyone with even a passing interest in the Marvel Universe should check out. 9/10			"

I doesnt just have normal heroes and villains like Hulk and Dr Doom but it also has heroes I havent heard of like Moon Knight, Havoc, and Rocket Racoon.With a 12 hour campaign and over 10 bonus levels plus and open world were you can steal cars, unlock characters and vehicles, do quests for people and explore the entire helicarrier it makes an authentic Marvel game.I also think co op is really great now with split screen you finally can move freely without being forced to follow P1.

												A pretty solid LEGO game with more content than any of the others (as far as I know). The New York hub level is fun to mess around in and has lots to do if you don't feel like comitting to a mission. My girlfriend (who isn't so much into videogames) enjoys playing the local coop as well. However, for a game this big, it's hard to ignore the minor quibbles that pop up throughout the hours of content:- You have to beat almost the entire story to unlock the full range of superpowers and thus be able to access all the content in free play. Basically you shouldn't bother replaying missions in free play until after you beat the game, because you won't be able to unlock everything anyway and will need to re-replay them.- Several optional missions have extremely high unlock requirements, requiring hours of effort in free play to meet them. This seems odd in a game targeted towards children- The flying controls in free play are absolutely maddening. I have no idea how they expect children to beat some of the time trials- The vehicle controls kinda suck too. Except for the Cloud Rider. Unlock that baby ASAP.- The difficulty curve is uniformly low with a few bizarrely high spikes. I had to consult guides for several sidequests.- Some sidequests are buggy and essentially unbeatable without looking up a guide- A lot of the fighting animations are extremely drawn out and uninterruptable. Fighting large groups of enemies with a close-combat character can be pretty frustrating- Deadpool's custscenes are unskippable and excruciating to watchAll of that being said, I still enjoyed it and am still trudging through towards 100%!

												Best $7 I ever spent on Steam. I was able to purchase the main game plus all DLC for this one low price. I feel like I have barely scratched the surface at 25 hours of gameplay. I love this even more because of the local co-op and I have been able to play with my younger sister without worrying about excessive violence or language. I have hooked up my laptop to the television and it looks and plays well with the added bonus of entertaining small children without the fear of having my computer damaged. Pros:-Amazing cast of characters to choose from (The Avengers to the X-men to Fantastic Four to Deadpool) and how individual each of the characters are. -Huge open world of New York and a moving Shield Helicarrier!-Getting studs is as addictive as ever-The puzzles are fun and challenging without being repetive or too easy-Local co-op-You can smash as Hulk!-Save Stan Lee!-Probably 50+ hours of fun-Lots of side quests-Jumping of the Helicarrier into the  city is always good fun. Cons-You can't play this without a controller. The keyboard controls really suck. -Fixed camera. In some levels it is hard to judge depth or see what/where you are meant to do/be. -DLC only adds characters for free but not much other content-No online co-op-No way to edit graphics settingsOverallIf you love Marvel, Lego, or want something to play with younger children then I can't recommend this enough. 9/10			"

												Upon the announcement of LEGO Marvel I was very conflicted. On the one hand, I thought “Oh my god, Marvel”, but on the other I couldn’t help but think “really? More LEGO?” Upon release however, the latter thought quickly vanished. Not only can you take control of an absolutely massive cast of Marvel characters, known or not, it’s funny, charming, gorgeous and playable by literally everyone, kids and adults alike.In making this game, TT games could do what Marvel Studios cannot. Have The Avengers team up with characters such as Spider-Man and the X-Men. This in itself is an exciting aspect of life as we know it. Fully voice acted, interactive storyline set in the film universe, with the addition of fan favourites that can’t be shown on the big screen for legal reasons. The game takes place pretty much straight after the Avengers film, leaving S.H.I.E.L.D on high alert of a new threat, calling in every possible force they can….and Howard the Duck. You know this game is thorough and true to the law when they introduce Howard the Duck. As it takes place in the film universe, you will see many recognisable places from the films, ranging from Stark Tower to Asgard, but you will also see many locations that haven’t (yet anyway) appeared in any film, such as The Raft. To add to the impact visiting these places has, are the graphics. This game is gorgeous, it may only be LEGO but the detail is astonishing, especially on PC and now current gen (Xbox One, PS4) consoles. The picture is crisp, running in 1080p and the character models are incredible. Even the water effects are impressive, which isn’t something often said about LEGO!One thing that needs to be stated and praised about this game is the scope. It is huge! Not only do you have a decent length campaign to play through, there are hundreds of side missions and challenges to complete, gold bricks, red bricks and characters to find…a lot of characters. The list is full of the obvious choices including, all members of The Avengers, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Fantastic Four, X-Men, to the not so known ones, Iron Fist, Rocket Raccoon or DareDevil, with an equally packed villain selection, with every single one of the characters having individual voice acting. The level design is equally impressive, with a roughly 10-12 hour long campaign, it is surprising to say that it never felt repetitive, sure you do similar things in each level, but the variety in both the environment and characters in the story change it up enough to keep it interesting. Boss battles are more than just an attack of button mashing or QTE’s, which is nice, you could almost say they are mini puzzles you have to solve, figuring out stages 1 through 3 into defeating your current opponent. You could be running through a level chasing a significant character to the franchise, beating down A.I.M soldiers or symbiotes along the way, only to have the game change it up and throw something completely different at your face unexpectedly. Something that could have been addressed better are the actual puzzles throughout the levels. They can be pretty bland and tedious, making them nothing more than an irritation to your day instead of this exciting part of the level, requiring your wits to solve. Understandably so, as this game is made for the younger ages as well as adults but it feels as though a little more effort could have been but into the puzzle aspect.LEGO games have been notorious for managing to stay true to the law or the franchise it is recreating, whilst adding in some immense humour, making adults and children alike laugh manically, and this game does not break that trend. Although some of the jokes will make you hang your hang or cringe, others will make you laugh out loud or perhaps even ROFL. Each characters voice acting and interaction is fantastic. Not a single stone has been left unturned. The humour is embedded in this already incredible story that will make fans wish this could be a live action experience, as well as this hilarious game. Human Torch visiting Asgard with Thor, Wolverine taking on the escaped prisoners of The Raft and so many more awesome mash ups. Words simply cannot express how incredible this game is. If you are a fan of the LEGO game series, get this game. If you are a fan of Marvel, get this game. If you are a fan of games, get if this game. Even if you only kinda like Spider-Man but you aren't bothered, get this game.This game gets a 9.0/10			"

Pros:Variety of chracters, and abilitiesClassical Marvel sense of humour.Very nice scenario and screenplayEasy controls (for gamepad)Much Deadpool screentime (yeaaah!)Multiplayer optionCons:Flying can be very difficult in racing missions.Lack of variety in side missions.Too easy missions and villians.DLC's are little bit unnecessary and overpriced.  too short...They will release Lego Avengers i know, but they should make a sequel also.Total : 95/100			"

												It's a LEGO game. Not only is it a LEGO game, but it's a MARVEL LEGO game! Not only is it MARVEL, but it's based off more than just the Cinematic Universe! It takes bits from ALL the Marvel Universes! (Universi? Fungus becomes Fungi. I don't like seeing 'ses' on the end of plural words. It feels wrong.) It... does fall a littel flat compared to LEGO Star Wars or Indiana Jones because the story is original. You're not re-enacting famous scenes with LEGO characters, you're fighting your way through a new story. Whilst that does suck some of the comedy out of it, the game does still parody Marvel in general brilliantly. I am enjoying it considerably. Oh, it does need a controller though. Good luck mouse and keyboarding this. "

Love the game, has good graphics, typical gameplay for a Lego game, and a ton of characters, skins and Deadpool. Did I mention Deadpool was in the game? Everything seemed fine until I heard it... the dreadul voice acting. This was the first Lego game I played that had voice acting so I'm unaware if they started it in this game or in a later one. Everytime I hear them talk I just think to myself ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?!?!?""			"

												Finally a game that lets you play as the Avengers,the Xmen, the Guardians of the Galaxy or if you fancy it you can play as one of the bad guys like the Green Goblin or Loki. This is another brilliant game from the Lego series and like previous Lego games it's a lot of fun and a game that has appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers. This game sees you through various missions where you will play a variety of Marvel characters each with their unique abilities and advantages. So Hulk can lift heavy objects while Iron Man can destroy them with rockets. The levels are the usual types that you'll see in a Lego game i.e collecting studs, using different characters abilities to progress and so on. When your not playing a level you have a nice open-world Manhatten to explore where you can solve puzzles, do quests and races to unlock gold bricks or more characters. The game also introduces driveable vehicles which although are not utilized much in the levels are still a fun distraction in the open-world section.The story isn't bad either with all the villains teaming up under Loki and Dr.Doom to collect cosmic bricks which the heroes have to stop them. One of the great things about the characters in this game is they are all brilliantly voiced in the game which really brings the characters to life in the game.The Good:-has pretty much every Marvel hero and villian from the more famous like Iron Man and the Hulk to the more obscure.-fun gameplay that can be enjoyed by anyone.-open-world Manhatten is a great feature with the ability to fly around or even drive.-characters are brilliantly voiced in this game (Deadpools commentary in the extra levels is fantastic)The Bad:-gameplay can feel a bit repetetive at times- AI can be terrible at times particularly in freeplayOverall Lego have pulled off another brilliant game that anyone with even a passing interest in the Marvel Universe should check out. 9/10			"

Posted: October 18, 2016
												I got super hyped for this game when was announced, and I first got it on the X-Box 360. I was a big fan of Marvel and I still am now. But I didn't make much progress and eventually, I played it less and less and forgot about it. Recently, I thought about picking the game back up, but I couldn't find it. Fortunately, I noticed that this game was on Steam, and I bought it with both the DLC'S, and I got 100% in 8 days. Plot... (I'm trying to remember the story, so I might not get everything correct)The story of the game is that Dr. Doom captures the Silver Surfer and wants to use pieces his broken board to build his Doom Ray of Doom. Unfortunately for him, the pieces are scattered across NYC. Many different supervillains are on Doom's side as they try to collect the pieces, but SHIELD and its heroes are trying to stop him. In the end, Loki turns on Doom and uses mind control to make Galactus devour Earth. He is quickly stopped by a large group of superheroes (and villains) as Loki and Galactus are sent through a portal to deep space.Pros...The Lego games have a distinct style of gameplay. You play a level the first time only as specific characters, but replaying the levels as anyone can help you find secrets. This is because some areas can only be accessible as certain types of characters, which might not be in the level the first time. I kind of like this, as it has more replay value to it. The graphics are also nice and it is cool seeing famous Marvel icons in Lego form. The vast selection of playable heroes and villains makes a Marvel fan like me very happy. In the other Lego games, nobody talks. This is because in something like Lego Star Wars, the plot of the game is the same as the movies. However, in this game, (since they are not basing the plot on a specific movie or book) the characters talk. The voices are pretty good as well, but I'll talk more about that in a second. One of my favorite things about the game is Stan Lee. He appears all over the game and needs to be rescued around NYC and all the levels, and if you save him from everything, you unlock him.Cons... (Mostly just nitpicking)-Repeated voices in the NYC map can be really annoying at times-Deadpool is annoying and his voice does not match his character (Marvel Ultimate Alliance Deadpool is funny and his voice matches perfectly)-The web-swinging as Spider-Man, Venom, ect is difficult and frustrating-Having to get all the gold bricks can easily become boring-When I first got this game, my biggest problem was that Nightcrawler was not included, and he was my favorite Marvel character (mostly because I like his design)-My biggest problem with the game now, is that some of the characters either do the exact same thing as other characters, or do absolutely nothing, (Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Destroyer Minifig, Aunt May, Mini Sentinel, ect.)-Sometimes, the game will stump you by being unbelievably cryptic, (or maybe I'm just an idiot)Conclusion...Overall, it has its flaws it could improve on, but I still found it fun. 8/10			"

												Simply an amazing game. If you have'nt played this game, buy it because you are missing out!The characters in this game are amazing. Some I haven't even heard of! You can create custom characters and can choose any character from the marvel universe. Also, you get asense of accomplishment when you buy or unlock a character instead of having them all unlocked which occurs on too many games now.Further more, the missions involve fun puzzles and engaging combat. Plus, you can swing round, fly and parkour around the battle arena. However, the open city of new york is why this game is so good. You can emerse yourself into hours of gameplay just playing as a hero. There are little bonus quests you can go on. A nice example is saving Stan Lee. The city is very detailed and you can use different vehicles (Such as: planes, cars and boats) to drive around the street. You can drive about in a convertible bus!I only have a few problems with this game.A little annoyance is that the game can lag occasionally which spoils the gameplay. The only other fault I can find is that this game would be so much better with multiplayer. You can swing and fly around New York with loads of friends and start a gang war with other players. I would pay extra money for this add-on. It would be even better if it could be a steam-approved mod.In conclusion, lego marvel superheroes is a fantastic game that will please all ages. If you don't enjoy this game, you must have pre-downloaded a mod that completely destroyed the game. I beg to the developers or any modders out there, MAKE MULTIPLAYER FOR THIS GAME!!!			"

												What the hell does this have to do with Legos? Lego Batman 1 and 2 were fun. The Lego Star Wars games were fun. Lego LOTR was fun, but Lego games have gone downhill since then. This feels like a cash grab. They tried to hard to make it humorous, but since Lego characters have started talking, the humor has left. The only thing I really liked was the free roam. I got this game on sale, and I still feel like I wasted my money.			"

												I grew up with the Lego games and loved a vast majority of them. This game is within that majority and beyond. Marvel Heroes is super fun and I can hardly put it down. The voice acting could use a little work, to try and make the character sound like their movie counterparts, but when you get past that, it's just a fun action game featuring your favourite Marvel super heroes. I definitly recommend this game to people who like Marvel, kid's games and, of course, Lego.			"

												As a Marvel Comics fan, this game was an extreme blast to play through. The story was alright and funny, and the open-world to explore was great. You may be wondering why I have so much play time on LEGO® Marvel™ Super Heroes. Well, just like any other new LEGO video game, you have so much to do even after the main story to 100% complete the game. So much to collect, side missions, and all kinds of unlocks and side quests. Overall, it's one of my favorite LEGO video games for me. 8.5/10			"

												All lego games have their similarities, and they're all usually solid, fun and amusing. While this one doesn't have the impressive overworld map of LOTR, it does have solid gameplay, an original, funny and appropriately genre-fitting story and is one of the better lego games out there. For comic fans it's a must, as I have little hope for any other superhero games coming out as good as this, or with the sheer level of variety of characters, all of whom play with their full range of powers: the avengers, fantastic four, spiderman and x-men dominate the main story, with interesting team combinations throughout and a final level where you team up (and so play) Dr Doom and members of the mutant brotherhood and sinister six. In free play the variety is astounding, including a huge range of heroes and villains from the guardians of the galaxy to captain britain. Great fun with the sort of crazy, epic story you wish you could have in non-lego form. A few pet peeves, with slightly awkward flying controls, a rather unhelpful map and a few bugs when attempting side missions but otherwise a solidly built game			"

												Most LEGO games use silent comedy to portray their story. This has changed, and this game shows it. This game feels like so much more than a LEGO game. You can explore almost all of New York, you can play as your favorite Marvel superheroes (even Deadpool, even though it takes a LONG time), and even make your own. The voice acting really drives it home, though. If this game had no voice acting, it wouldn't be the same. In short, if you liked the LEGO Star Wars games, you'll like this game.			"

												Let me start by saying that this is a fantastic game.  I want to get that out of the way, as I'm sure that my review will have several negative points in it.  That being said, this game does much more right than it does wrong.  If you've played a LEGO game before, you know what to expect from this title.  It follows the formula laid out by previous LEGO games, but does it so much better due to the expanded amount of content available in the Marvel universe.  The story is much longer and much more diverse than previous titles, and the number of characters and playstyles available to the user is amazing.  That being said, a game this large is bound to be hampered by technical difficulties.  In my time playing this game, I experienced the following:  the game crashing, players getting physically stuck and the game requiring a reboot, items/events on the New York map not appearing and requiring a reboot, etc.  All of these experiences detracted from the overall product, but I think it's telling that they served to only take away from the overall experience and not define it.  The last point that needs to be made is that if you play this single player, your AI partner will be incredibly dumb and basically useless.  Seriously, if you play single player the enemy AI will be better than your partner AI and your partner will constantly get their♥♥♥♥♥kicked.  It's embarrassing to watch a random trash mob kick the crap out of a brand name super hero, but that's a reality in this game.  This is a great game and I would rank it an 8.5.  That being said, if you're planning on playing it solo I would give it an 8.0; and if you have a comic book loving friend who is willing to play through coop with you, I would give it a 9.0.			"

												Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Deadpool. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Stan Lee. Deadpool.-10/10 Would Stan Lee again Short Review Great game. Fun Open World, Cool Charcters most of us will know, fun levels and worth the money. Better than the Avengers edition of the game. Voice actors are good, but not the same as the ones in the movies. Controlls can be wierd and has a some bugs .Save system is wonky, but you figure ot out eventually. Great game. Long Review Great game. The Open World is by far the strongest feature. NYC is full of hidden places to explore and has so many things to do, find, and enjoy. I cannot stress this ebough. If you like open world games, this game is great for that. Compared to games like Skyrim of the Witcher 3, the world is a little small, but it still decent size on its own and is jam packed full of stiff to do and characters to unlock. Even if you beat the game, the open world is a fun place to run around, destroy things, ride cars of bikes, and just have fun. The storyline is OK, albeit a bit short (15 levels), but the levels are long, and you can save at specific parts in the level. It is a bit buggy and the controls can be a bit goofy and cramped. The best way to play is with a controller, or spacing out the WASD movement keys from the action keys. Otherwise, it feels like your hands are cramped together. If you are not a Marvel nerd and dont know all the heros and villians, dont worry. The game isn't really full of random heros. If you have seen any modern day Avengers or X men movies, you will be mostly fine. There will be some characters you do not know, but it doesnt detract from the game. The game does a really nice job of blancing heros and villains in the story, and playble ones. The more common ones are used in the storyline, and the more obscure ones are used in free play annd are unlockable. And if you are a Marvel Superfan, it does have easter eggs, hints, and other things you will enjoy as well. Extra levels and usage of the gold brick make this game have even more replayability. Deadpool and Stan Lee  cameo a lot, adding to the funny atmostphere of the game. The chrarcters, while not voiced by the actors from the modern day movies, still are well voiced, and drop a lot of puns and jokes, customary to all lego games. The fact that it is a Lego game makes it even better. Definetly worth the money and better than the Avengers edition of the game.			"

Also for my xbox i got all dlcs the only one that is worth it is the super one not the asgard that one is not worth it.

												I found this game to be quite enjoyable. I played this game co-op with my sister and we had a blast. There's a crazy amount of Marvel characters to unlock in this game. What you need to do to progress is not always apparent. Look for things to build or switches to push/pull if you get stuck. There's some light QTE stuff, but they don't require you to mash your brains out or anything just a little light repetition there. If you like same screen co-op and you have a buddy or kids around it's a good game to play. Just pop in a couple of usb xbox 360 controllers and have fun.			"

												I liked LOtR legos more then I did this one. There is so many super powers that are used that sometimes it can be hard to figure out which one you need. Telekinisis(sp?) magnitisum, cosmic power, and at times the game dose not let you know which one is needed, and other times the game will not shut up about telling you which power you need.Other issues I had is the flying which can be hard to control when doing the time trials, was a few crashes, one which caused the game to go 2-player and I controled both players at the same time on one controller, and at times I got lost in what I need to do to advance in a mission as it is not clear what you are sapost to do.If you liked other lego games, you will like this one also. takes about 30 hours to get to 100%			"

[]The gameplay is great as there are a lot of characters to unlock aswell as cars, helicopters and jets.[]The levels are easy and fun with puzzles that are hard but not to hard to get stuck on. The humour is also actually pretty good for a childrens game.[]The new free rome feature they added in is a nice touch as it is a great way to run around and test your new characters as well as looking for new quests, activities, races and puzzles to do[]The only problem i had with this game was that its main campain was kinda short but all the side activities and the fact you can replay the story with different characters kinda made up for that. The flying was also kinda clunky but not to bad.I would definetly reccomend this game to anyone who loves the previous lego game or loves marvel, bonus points if you love both!			"

												This is the first Lego game I have played, been interested in it after hearing endless praise for it.I'm not sure if all Lego games will be like this, but I find myself getting bored and can only do 1-2 levels at a time before I need a break.Pros: Variety in characters Colourful environmentsCons: Every level so far follows the same template with a boss at the end Teammate AI seemingly doesn't do anything No failstate (feel like I can mash buttons without any thought during combat) So many cutscenes/camera pans that you can't skip Often get stuck not knowing how to progress through a level "

In the open world New York you can get new characeters as well as Deadpool Red bricks, which allow you to unlock bonus features to enhance the game. It also pays a great tribute to Marvel as well as the comics it is based off of. If you have the money and love Lego games, BUY NOW!10/10			"

												Lego Batman 2 was quite an achievement in Traveller's Tales' long-running Lego series with its large sandbox city filled with tons of collectibles and an equally large roster of colorful and varied heroes and villains. The storytelling aspect got a major writing overhaul by officially leaving the 'mime' humor behind by bringing in the A-team of voicework that made the game able to tell its own, unique story rather than simply act out a film's plot.Lego Marvel Super Heroes does what any sequel should and expands on everything its predecessor was and more.The sandbox of New York city is positively ginormeous and filled to the brim with personality, be it in the faithfully constructed Marvel landmarks or the various quirky side-quest granting citizens and puzzles. There are even secret stages to uncover if you search hard enough!The stages themselves have also taken a boost and are more layered, boasting strong location variety and quirky creativety. The creators also managed to finally truly nail the length of the stages so that they go on just long enough while throwing encounters and thrills at you around every corner to satisfywithout overstaying their welcome and just becoming stale.There are boss-fights a plenty in this game, even more than ever beforeand, while they are all fairly unique, few bosses actually change their tactics mid-fight,leaving what will initially strike many players as impressive and fun fights to become rather repetitive by the time they land the final hit.One thing that has taken a hit since the last game, however, is the combat.Unlike Lego Batman 2, which used a miniaturized version of the Arkham games' combat by allowing you to unleash special moves when your multiplier was high enough, in this game, those moves now just randomly happen.It certainly adds visual flair to the fights, but feels even more button-mashy than previous incarnations.Still, all is not lost, most characters now have unique moves that can be triggered by pressing B at any time (it used to be a generic grab-button in LB2), which does add some much needed variety. Speaking of variety, Lego Marvel Super Heroes boast one of the largest rosters in any Lego game and all the characters look, move, fight and feel like they should, which is a large plus for comic-book fans who can finally say their favorite characters have a game that does them justice.Unfortunately, this game is not without glitches,on a 100% playthrough, you're sure to run into some sooner or later.In my experience, I had situations were certain NPCs wouldn't load,NPCs wouldn't jump into your Taxi and the game wouldn't accept 100% until I re-beat the final stage again. In all cases, simply continuously resetting the game until it worked eventually prevailed,so luckily, there is no truly gamebreaking glitch that'll make 100% impossible.Ultimately, Lego Marvel Super Heroes is superior to its predecessors in almost every way,though, as it IS more of a simple (unless you set your eyes upon the lofty goal of achieving 100% completion) and quirky puzzle-game by nature,I'd recommend to pay with caution if you expect something grander.However! If you like the Marvel universe, collect-a-tons that keep you playing long after the credits roll, puzzles or large sandboxes to roam around in and explore,then you can do little better than Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

Basic Information:Title: Lego Jurassic WorldDeveloper: TT Games LtdPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentGenre: Action, AdventureLEGO Marvel Super Heroes is by far the biggest LEGO game to date, and not just in map size. Almost every Marvel character you can think of is in this game, and it is very obvious that the game's developers were big fans of the Marvel universe, as no expense was spaired this time. However, although this game may seem like an open world LEGO adventure, don't be fooled. The truth is that the majority of the gameplay including all of the story levels are linear. The only time that this game is open world is when you are not in a level, and even then you are restricted to a very small city that feels a little empty. Saying that, the actual levels, although linear are quite fun, in the same way that every LEGO game is fun. One of the worst parts about this game are the controls, playing this game with a keyboard is a chore and doesn't feel right. This problem is easily solved by using a controller. After the main story has been completed there are hundreds of other things you can do and you will never find yourself bored whilst playing the game. There are some bugs, like all LEGO games but they aren't game breaking and wont limit your experiance in a major way. In conclusion, I would recommend this game, but only if you have a controller which you can plug in and use. Luckily, many controller brands are supported in all LEGO games, atleast on the Steam store.Scores:Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Audio: 7/10Story: 9/10Overall: 8/10Reviewed by Elliott Marc Jones for Redacted Network's Curator page.

												First time playing was on Xbox and it was very fun! So fun infact I got it for PC on a steam summer sale.Rating: 9.5/10What I like: Simple enough for people new to video games & fun enough to keep your interest.For such a simple style of game, graphically, this game is stunning! The lighting and water effects are beautiful and well done, but it's lego bricks! Ha ha! If you have played any lego games, you know they are goofy and fun with essentially the same main story arc as their theme. This is by far one of the best lego games I have ever played and is one of the first that implemented actual voice acting, which in my opinion was a good move and they cast some great voice actors. Nick Fury sounds just like Sam Jackson and a few voices are actually the same actors from the films such as Agent Phil Coulson.What I don't like: The controls are a bit wonky. Great controller support, but the standard control set up is awkward and does not seem very practical when in game. I have not seen an in game option to reassign key bindings, but that would be wonderful!			"

												This is a really fun LEGO game. Probably my favorite so far but a really close to Star Wars. The voice acting is quite funny sometimes. Surprisingly unlike other LEGO games the characters actually play vastly different and like they should. In the end I don't know if I will finish it though because well...it is just another LEGO game. I think its time to stop making them. All in all I do reccomend if you are into the LEGO series though. Great game to play with a girlfriend. She will be entertained and its only mildly hard at boss fights.			"

												uhhhhh what's better than being able to smash ALL the legos without haphazardly surviving the reprecussions of jaggedish pieces of hard shiny plastic....? AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE LEGOS OR BLOOD.... all the lego games... duhhh like instant win beb because what else are ya doiiinnn they're cute and junk but they're like kitty cactuses because you can't eat them because they hurt because they're hard and plastic but like you really want to right????.....That being said, storyline is like cotton, uh hopefully you paid 20$ to see the movie in the cinema like all your non lame friends because that whole movie was ugh but cool right? Because PEW PEW and HULK SMASH and like whatever she's got like moves and junk. So the game is exactly like that movie BUT WITH LEGOS. gameplay is annoying but amusing. (you know, like whoever you're dating)uhh visuals though.. BLOODY HELL MAN.... was NOT expecting that. But that's my bad because again, like DUH BEB IT'S EFFING LEGOS AND MARVEL... DID U THINK THEY WERE GONNA SKIMP ON GRAFX??? waa waa it's crunchy and delicious, good job game ppl. You made the thing with the shinys and like it looks all cool and junk.I got this on the cheap from that one site.... hell yeah for 5$ dewd.Anybody like chicken wings? This is the game you play whilest eating chicken wings. I'm a vegetarian though don't kill the chick chick chick ENSSSSS.... uhhh 7 american dollars is the top I'd pay for this thang. below that, though, worth almost every penny. *thumbs up!*Also like, I had like a crush on the iron man lego so like whatever ok???

												Well guys, if you're here you already know what you're getting into.  That's right the most hardcore balls to the walls hentai simulator of its day and you just want it so you can bust a quick nut and not see the shame of a Cam Girls face when you start weeping.  This game serves the exact purpose you'd expect from it with features like, screaming at your little man in a shrill Japanese voice and recording your facial expression when finishing on to your anime love pillow peripheral (Sold separately on Amazon.com).  Overall I'd give this game a 5 out of 5, its really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it gets the job done and at the moment I can't think of any other game on the market that can say the same... I'm looking at you Super Hardcore Anime Waifu Sim 2007.			"

												This is easily the best Lego Game ever! You start off as Hulk AND Iron Man (takes place after Iron Man 3, add on DLC takes place after Thor 2).  And somehow, it gets better.  Just awesome and fun. Highly reccomended, from the #1 player of this game on Raptr, myself.  Not kidding, I have hundreds of hours on record. Worth the money.			"

												As always this LEGO game is pretty much the same as the others. It is most enjoyable if you play it with a friend who sits next to you. The humor is simple but funny. The world is pretty big and you get to explore alot and do various side missions. And of course there is a huge set of stuff to unlock so this will keep you busy for many hours.			"

The open world is huge, there's 100+ characters, tons of extra things to do after you finish, plus characters have different and unique abilities. I would buy the dlcs as well, add great characters.			"

												I had a fun time playing this game. If you have played a ""Lego"" game before, you know what ypur up for. And thats a great action adventure game with some puzzle sholving. And before you think ""This is only another child game! BOOOOORING"" It's not, okay it kind of is but it's not boring and you don't need to be a child to enjoy it. It also has some jokes you will need to be older to understand. But I have to say: It might not be worth full price. Even if It has an open world/city and there is mutch to find and many characters you can unlock ion the open world becuse you will sometime stop playing it. I bought this game for 4.99 it is hower worth more maybe at 25% you can buy it and be happy. But it might be worth full price if you have a kid or you love ""Lego"" games. Becuse this is one of the best of them.Dope: Great open world          Funny story          Great humor          Mutch to do          Great voice acting (not by the actors from the movies)Nope: Will get bored          They didn't get every character to fell as thier ownConclusion: Worth it if you love ""Lego"" games or have a kid 8.5/10Sorry, for some bad english			"

												LEGO Marvel Superheores is a great game. I really like this game, and recommend it to anyone that likes Lego and Marvel. Has a huge range of characters and has a large free-roam area to do what ever you want in. the only problem, only two boats, but that's not a big deal. The game can be a bit glitchly at times but keeps you entertained for hours. When i mean glitchy, i mean real glitchy. I found this glitch with Thor, where i turned into the citizen? And i found two spots where i could go under the city and onto the islands in the background? I also was on the other side of the bridge, where i couldn't go. What?When they say there are a lot of characters, they are correct, because there are something like over 100 playable, and thats without the DLC. The DLC was pretty good, giving you extra vehicles and characters, but most of their abilities were the same as other characters, so i recommend waiting until they are on special as they are not worth their full price. The steam achievments are also good and provide something else to do in the free-roam city. Just a warning, there are cheat codes, but the one for the hulkbuster prevents you from getting 100%, so i don't recommend using them.There are a lot of bonus levels, which some give a good laugh. Suitable for all ages, even little kittens. Score 9.5/10			"

												I can't remember hints being THIS annoying in other LEGO games. In Marvel Superheroes, you can't turn them off, and they take away any semblence of difficulty. You basically just run around and do exactly what the hints say. What's the point of playing except to add ""punch everything that looks even remotely breakable"" to the ""follow the hints"" gameplay?edit:I booted up my old LEGO Lord of the Rings game on Wii, and sure enough, there was nothing but very basic hints when you start up, like ""B to attack"". I approached a spot with sparkles and got 0 hints at all. No handholding, telling me what kind of character to use or what substance I was battling. I adored LEGO Lord of the Rings, and I wish Lego Marvel Superheroes had a ""no hints"" option (seems SUPER simple to implement).			"

Because PEW PEW and HULK SMASH and like whatever she's got like moves and junk. So the game is exactly like that movie BUT WITH LEGOS. gameplay is annoying but amusing. (you know, like whoever you're dating)uhh visuals though.. BLOODY HELL MAN.... was NOT expecting that. But that's my bad because again, like DUH BEB IT'S EFFING LEGOS AND MARVEL... DID U THINK THEY WERE GONNA SKIMP ON GRAFX??? waa waa it's crunchy and delicious, good job game ppl. You made the thing with the shinys and like it looks all cool and junk.I got this on the cheap from that one site.... hell yeah for 5$ dewd.Anybody like chicken wings? This is the game you play whilest eating chicken wings. I'm a vegetarian though don't kill the chick chick chick ENSSSSS.... uhhh 7 american dollars is the top I'd pay for this thang. below that, though, worth almost every penny. *thumbs up!*Also like, I had like a crush on the iron man lego so like whatever ok???

Surprisingly unlike other LEGO games the characters actually play vastly different and like they should. In the end I don't know if I will finish it though because well...it is just another LEGO game. I think its time to stop making them. All in all I do reccomend if you are into the LEGO series though. Great game to play with a girlfriend. She will be entertained and its only mildly hard at boss fights.			"

I havent even got to the half mark and I already had to restart my game all over again 5 times. It doesnt matter what your doing, the glitches will come for you.Another bad thing is the voice acting. Alot of these characters are the exact oppisite of what I wanted to hear. I wanted to hear peter parker from the movies, not some wanna be,pun spewing, nasty♥♥♥♥♥ spiderman this game threw at me. (the same with all other characters)Do I think this game is bad, no not at all.Its just not one of my favorite LEGO games.MAINLY BECAUSE YOU GAVE THEM VOICESES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But whatever.

												A very fun game when I didn't think it would be. I figured it got good reviews and the gameplay looked good so I would give it a try for $5. I have put a lot of time into it now and always am having fun. It can be very cryptic at times during a stage until you get the hang of what the game wants you to do exactly, which for a Lego game shouldn't be so difficult to figure out basic things to advance a level. I have put a bunch of time into going around the city and unlocking new guys and replaying stages on free play to unlock the level secrets. One big problem with the game that I did not figure out until I googled it was how to switch characters while in the city. After coming out of a mission it locks you into two characters and you can't hold Y to switch. Until I researched it, I had no idea that I was supposed to first go to a blue vehicle/character machine to set the game to after you switch that way to then allow you to switch simply by holding Y. It makes no sense and should not be that way. There are a ton of characters to unlock, 100 total I think, a lot I've never even heard of. I just use Hulk and Human Torch most of the time because Hulk can run faster than any other character and can smash up levels and enemies much quicker, and the Human Torch is the easiest go-to flying character on the screen when I can't remember exactly who can fly and who can't. I just unlocked my favorite Marvel guy of all time, Magneto, and thankfully he is fun to play as. The game also has my four other favorites as well; Juggernaut, Carnage, Venom, and of course Hulk. Yay!Only Marvel super fans will want to sit and unlock all 100 chars, although needless to say, there is so much to do in this game that I have almost 30 hours in and still haven't unlocked all the characters. I haven't even finished story mode yet because I have spent so much time running around the city and unlocking things.The combat, sound, music, effects, story, script, and graphics are all fitting of a Lego game. It looks and performs very smoothly. The only real major complaint I have with the game is that the flying controls for some characters suck bad. I know exactly how the flying controls work, they just simply suck♥♥♥♥♥ The characters that don't control well are the ones who have the ability to fly fast, which so far have been Thor, Human Torch, Iron Man, and Wizard. So it's only true for a few characters, but still annoying since it is the fastest way in the game to get around.Of all the more challenging action and permadeath games I play, this is a nice casual game I can just relax and play without worrying about dying. Probably the most fun casual action game I've ever played. Worth it on sale but also at regular price if it is $20 or less.9/10 very good relaxing fun			"

Hulk can get past it (oh, was that him I saw leaping from skyscraper to skyscraper on all movies and comics? nah, my imagination).Even kids will cringe.			"

												This game is an absolute blast.   My son and I play, but he plays mostly..   There's a lot to do, but the only minor thing I hate is having to GRIND to get DEADPOOL.  .    Still, there are lots of characters to tickle your nostalga bone.. okay that was a weird way to put it, but none the less you'll feel pretty cool being your favorites from Marvel.   The Lego games in general are great at teaching kids the basics of gaming.   The puzzles are great for kids, and learning to fill up a meter , find bricks, and running around with a pal is always fun..    Adults will have a great time too.  The lego characters are funny and the story is goofy.. Just a good time ...again especially if you have children.. My son is 5, he's been playing the Lego games since 3.			"

												This game may have some glitches but its still a REALLY fun game. worth the $30. TONS of marvel characters and unlockables, endless replayability with side quests in a lego GTA type open world. So far i have only 1 DLC and its my personal favorite so i reccomend that too. Still even great games have downfalls and this is game has a few irritating ones;1.broken flying controls (i use an xbox controller) the whole flying mechanic is based on a 2 button system and way too complicated2.repetitive gameplay..its a lego game so all you're doing is walking around each mission trying to complete it and blowing everything up along the way for bits.3.weak and pointless bad guys. this isnt that big of a deal because its a gema made for the younger gamers, but for hardcore to casual gamers (like as myself) this is a big one because each level is WAY too easy with boring combat against weak underpowered baddies.as a result i give this a 8/10. still a great game but with little annoying blemishes "

												Lego Games. Nearly-consequence-free collect-it-all-a-thon. Simplistic gameplay, drop-in and drop-out local multiplayer, and lots of cool fan pleasing Easter Eggs. I'm a fan of the Traveller's Tales Liscensed Lego Games namely in the references to the source material and the fun treatment they tend to give it and this entry only expanded on the original formula, as I'm sure the series will continue to do in the future. It's great for kids and fun for bored, nerdy, or faint-of-heart people who don't want the stress that comes with certain more intensive platformers and brawlers.			"

I couldn't get past the first level because the stupid barrier sandman was supposed to break stayed as it was! Couldn't get a refund, just a new copy. Same issue. It's freaking steam's fault! But besides that I actually do reccomend this game. It was awesome.			"

												So, before I start a rant, I would like to state that I love the lego games and will always play them as they are great fun but......From since I was young and getting into games from the beginning, I knew split screen as split screen and I am 100% sure that it wasn't long ago that steam called it that, but, I purchased this game as it stated LOCAL CO-OP, now from when I remember when LOCAL CO-OP came in, it meant that you could play with someone through the same hub, so we had SPLIT SCREEN and LOCAL CO-OP.Why is it now that LOCAL CO-OP means split screen, I fell I have been cheated here on the basis that steam should of specified what it was, BAD JOB STEAM!!!!On another note, this game is brill, if you want to just chill out and play with ease of gameplay and just general fun, buy buy buy!

												Very silly and authentic for fans of the Marvel Universe. The world's greatest supervillains form a cabal to rule the world as a cosmic force makes its way to devour the planet. Only the united forces of the world's greatest heroes, including the Avengers, the X-Men and the rest of the Marvel Universe can stop them! So much fun. Howewer, the controls are pretty flawed and could use some tweaking. Nevertheless, a great game, definitely recommended for kids. I wish I could have been a kid playing this.There's no emoticon for what I'm feeling.			"

												LEGO has a way of keeping true to the core of the Marvel Universe and still adding their own quirky humor.  I don't know how they do it, they just do it well, and that's what counts.Each of the heroes' (and villians) have powers tailored to them that stay true to their character.  IMO, I think LEGO tends to make better superhero games than some of the serious ones I've seen.  None certainly include the sheer amount of playable chacters.Mission tells a fun story that involves almost all the major mainstays of the Marvel universe.  After finishing the mission, there still the long, and tedious, task of trying to 100% the game.  There's lots to do and this game will kill a lot of time to dedicated achievement unlocker.  Some may find it to be so repetitive that a break will be needed every so often.			"

												Over 100 characters, plenty to search out and do and some fantastic dialogue between characters, this game is worth your money. I will say that the story seems a little short and could have made more sense but who cares when you can smash everything.As for the DLC, not worth your time, 10 characters and a few races. Characters are just reskins and races only give you some coins and they dont disappear from the map once complete, fairly disappointing add-on when the main game is so good.			"

												Suprisingly fun. Simple but if a Marvel fun I really recommend it if only for a fun OPEN WORLD romp through New York / Marvel World. I had a blast running around and seeing buildings like the stark tower and such. I even enjoyed the Mario esque platformer puzzles which force you to use characters power to solve.It is extremly simple and geared for kids, but ignoring that I thought it was great. Best part was running around the main city GTA style crushing citizens cars because....Hulk MAD! Huge world to explore.Also this game does a fantastic job of making Hulk a powerful monster to play as, something few games have done correctly before.			"

And when playing lego games with keybourd bare in mind that it has not got mouse support, But after a hour i got used to it. Although i think Lego LOTR is the best lego game it is refreshing to play Lego Marvel Super Heroes and i rate it 8.5/10			"

												This game may have some glitches but its still a REALLY fun game. worth the $30. TONS of marvel characters and unlockables, endless replayability with side quests in a lego GTA type open world. So far i have only 1 DLC and its my personal favorite so i reccomend that too. Still even great games have downfalls and this is game has a few irritating ones;1.broken flying controls (i use an xbox controller) the whole flying mechanic is based on a 2 button system and way too complicated2.repetitive gameplay..its a lego game so all you're doing is walking around each mission trying to complete it and blowing everything up along the way for bits.3.weak and pointless bad guys. this isnt that big of a deal because its a gema made for the younger gamers, but for hardcore to casual gamers (like as myself) this is a big one because each level is WAY too easy with boring combat against weak underpowered baddies.as a result i give this a 8/10. still a great game but with little annoying blemishes "

												Lego Games. Nearly-consequence-free collect-it-all-a-thon. Simplistic gameplay, drop-in and drop-out local multiplayer, and lots of cool fan pleasing Easter Eggs. I'm a fan of the Traveller's Tales Liscensed Lego Games namely in the references to the source material and the fun treatment they tend to give it and this entry only expanded on the original formula, as I'm sure the series will continue to do in the future. It's great for kids and fun for bored, nerdy, or faint-of-heart people who don't want the stress that comes with certain more intensive platformers and brawlers.			"

												Over 100 characters, plenty to search out and do and some fantastic dialogue between characters, this game is worth your money. I will say that the story seems a little short and could have made more sense but who cares when you can smash everything.As for the DLC, not worth your time, 10 characters and a few races. Characters are just reskins and races only give you some coins and they dont disappear from the map once complete, fairly disappointing add-on when the main game is so good.			"

												Very silly and authentic for fans of the Marvel Universe. The world's greatest supervillains form a cabal to rule the world as a cosmic force makes its way to devour the planet. Only the united forces of the world's greatest heroes, including the Avengers, the X-Men and the rest of the Marvel Universe can stop them! So much fun. Howewer, the controls are pretty flawed and could use some tweaking. Nevertheless, a great game, definitely recommended for kids. I wish I could have been a kid playing this.There's no emoticon for what I'm feeling.			"

												Honestly, when I first bought this game, I thought, ""Well, here's yet another Lego game. Gotta keep up my old childhood tradition of playing all the Lego games."" But this game was amazing! As you can see, I've clocked over 100 hours, and, in my opinion, the only well thought out reviews are made by thise who have at east invested fifty hours into the game. That said, I didn't see very many cons to the game. The primary one is the grind or all of the characters, but that's a factor throughout all of the Lego games. Pros are as follows:  - Story- HUGE roster- Plenty of side missions-Difficulty enought for older people to play and have fun, but not too hard for younger playersPersonal rating: 9.5/10, becase really no game deserves 10/10 unless it has absolutely no cons.

												Very fun addition to the Lego series of games and definitely a win-win all around. I especially enjoy the fact that they actually attempt to capture each of the character's personalities and replicate them in this game (mostly from the movies they've been in of course) but everyone's dream-take on every character isn't going to be here of course. It's an awesome game for adults to burn some solo-play time on and it will even hold the attention of any parent with a careful eye out for what they put in front of the eyes (and ears) of their kids. There's also a few hidden nuggets (as in all Lego games that have come before) for all those players willing to go the extra mile and actually find each and every last thing in the game. Keep up the great work TT games and I'm sure players (and fans) will happily keep shelling out the bucks...			"

												If you've ever played a Lego game before, you know exactly what you're getting into. Almost everything you see can be destroyed for ""studs"", the currency of the game. As you collect more you can buy more characters and such. It has fairly basic graphics and as a result works great on an older computer. If you like the other Lego games, you're sure to like this one as well. They don't generally have any grand changes in gameplay, so don't expect anything out of the ordinary from every other Lego title.			"

												There are very few games I can define my experience with as being my discrepancy of ""fun"", but the LEGO Video game franchise has never failed to deliver that to me. Meaning this game is no exception, it has met and well exceeded my expectations from a LEGO game and from a superhero game. It is well balanced but at the same time the characters feel very unique and powerful in their own respect. The game runs great on my PC, I havent had a single texture or hitbox error of the sort you would expect from a low budget PC port, if that is indeed what this is. The physics feel very solid if it were not for the controls being almost frantic, adding super power combo controls to the 4 buttons used in a normal LEGO Video game configuration. The LEGO pieces feel very realistic and have a very plastic weight to them as they would in their actual form, thats not to say that the models that are sold dont feel sold. As for the storyline and the length of the main missions, I believe they are ideal, 15 missions (If im not mistaken) each running about an hour if you really get into exploring the whole level. The story is as good as you would expect from a LEGO game if not a bit better, given that it has character voice actors (Who do lego models a lot of justice for having a voice). All plot lines are well paced and have more than a few catch yet subtle jokes and references, making it a more than enjoyable experience even with the narratives lighthearted tone.In closing, The only thing to say more would be that this is the only review I have every felt necessary enough to post on steam, being a fan of the LEGO Video games and naturally scrutinous of squals, this is easly a 10/10 for the LEGO franchise.Recommend to fans of LEGO, Superheros, and Video games in general.

												Right, so... most people look at this and go 'It's ♥♥♥♥ing LEGO, why the hell should I play it?  It's for kids!'  Well, have you ever considered this tiny, little opinion of, if Steam is correct, 94% of the people who have bought and reviewed it, that the game is just good.  It's silly and fun.  You don't need super complex plots and everything, and if you have a controller, gameplay is great.  Going back for secrets and exploring NYC for others as you unlock more characters with various powers to deal with obstacles.So, yea, it's a LEGO game, it's not serious, but webslinging still felt good (not Spiderman 2 for PS2 good, but we're still hoping someone will once again make a game of that caliber).

												Have you ever been playing Grand Theft Auto and thought: ""I wish this was in lego... and I could play as the Incredible Hulk.""Yeah good, because it's nothing like that. Good for a rainy day, and once you get through all the missions it IS fun just to run around the open world, but the latter half of the missions reaaaaally drag. Story isn't its strong point, but I don't believe it was ever intended to be. Probably helps to be familiar with the source material (I knew enough to laugh at the jokes the first time they were uttered...)Some cool bits: Guardians of the Galaxy/Ant Man are apparently unlockable! And another* Nick Fury/Pulp Fiction nod (post credits ""mission""). And Spider Man in open world is never a bad thing. Ever.Uh yeah. Fun to bash around as Spider Man, Captain America, Hulk for a bit. The other characters are a bit clunky. Get it if it's cheap?			"

												I've always been a big fan of the Lego game series. Lego Star Wars and Lego Batman were two of many games that I played too much on the PS2 with my brother. Now I'm trying out a 2013 game on the PC, Lego Marvel Super Heroes.The game keeps the same gameplay formula as previous IP's in the series, where you have tons of characters to unlock, a story mode with a lot of collectibles and a free play mode (a big map where you can roam and collect and achieve more). You fight, build, solves puzzles, collect, achieve, race, complete challenges, play different heroes and so on. The story mode is a bit weak and does not offer anything special. The game is pointed towards children and you will get that kids humour a lot :). I would rate the difficulty easy/medium, since some of the challenges are a bit hard. The controls are fair enough on ground level, but I struggle to fly with different heroes. I recommend to play with a controller. You can either play solo, or local split-screen.I bought this game mainly to collect and play different super heroes. The game has a lot of content and so much to achieve. You dont play the game for the story mode, but for the freedom and all the fun you get from the Lego games. I used around 40 hours to collect everything and the game was really fun. There are so many characters to play, vehicles to drive, aircrafts to fly etc. The free play mode gives you a big city to play with. From there you can acess story mode missions, races, get challenges/task from bystanders and do common super hero stuff.   If you like to collect/achieve and are a fan of Lego/Marvel Super Heroes, I strongly recommend this game. I hope you enjoy the game!			"

												Great LEGO game? Or greatEST LEGO game?Maybe it's because I'm partial to all things Marvel. Maybe it's the fun voice work. Or, perhaps, the metric buttload of unlockable content, which requires you to go on adventures FAR beyond the story to acquire. Maybe it's the controls, which are not very keyboard friendly, but got me through just fine....no, no it's not that.LEGO Batman 2 has some strengths over this. I thought character interaction during the story mission, and the overall plot, was stronger and more interesting. LEGO Marvel, admittedly, just tore a bunch of stuff out of the various movies and glued it together wherever they could make it sort of fit. Buuuuuuuut on the bright side, that still ended up being awesome.I know we're all probably sick of LEGO games by now, but LEGO Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean are behind us...so we no longer have to worry so much about them definitely being terrible and worth skipping. We can say, with reasonable certainty, that whatever Traveller's Tales pumps out next for an instant cash in will be playable, illicit a bunch of smiles, and perhaps drop upon us a crippling addiction to unlockable characters.

												With LEGO Avengers coming out, I decided to make this review. Basically, this is a somewhat comedic Lego game, with Lego versions of marvel comic characters and it has a custom story. It was not as fun for me as it was to play the old LEGO Star Wars gaskets, but I did still decently enjoy it.My main problem is that I'm a big fan of the MCU, which is what I was expecting from this game. I hope nobody else makes this mistake.I still recommend itPS half my playtime is me accidentally leaving it on menus btw			"

												This is a really awesome Marvel game! And lego game! If you can forgive them for softening some of the darker Marvel characters (like the punisher being obsessed with blowing up vans and with Blade and Ghost Rider being obssessed with races) then this will certainly be a aweful lot of fun.One major problem is you can't unlock all the achievements as, once again, Traveller's Tales are TERRIBLE at doing PC ports. I have seen this issues in the new Lego Batman, LoTR and others that they have put achievements in and this is getting really irritating.However if you want to have fun with this game you can still play all the way through it and unlock as many characters as possible to have fun in. You even get the Guardians of the Galaxy in it too!			"

												Having just played Lego Batman 2 and 3 consecutively, this was a disappointment. It just seemed like a quick cash-in. Getting 100% studs, while I usually dont care about getting them, was so easy that not even going out of your way to get them results in 100% studs near the halfway point in every level. They didnt even bother to make it any kind of challenge. Being forced to use control stations around the world to change characters until you've completeled the story was very annoying too. That just seemed like a way to pad game length even further. The engine didnt seem to be very optimized either on PC. For such a simple game the fps would almost drag to a halt in certain non-intensive areas. While I appreciate that the story didnt follow any of the movies (I find those Lego games to be boring as ive already seen the movies) this still felt lame to me and after seeing recent Lego Marvel's Avengers gameplay it seems that will be a proper Lego Marvel game, but sadly its going to follow the Avenger movies. UGH, booooooooooring.Not worth full price, but its something to play, at a discount, if you're a devout Lego game buyer  :|			"

												Game was awesome. It was great until I reached up to the 15th and final level where we fight Galactus. Something happened. A bug happened And I can't smash a couple of bricks that I have to smash. I tried like 6-7 times. Resetted the level, resetted the game, resetted the computer. But no. It didn't work. And It just ruined my gameplay. Now I cannot complete the game. I cannot play with the Symbiote Spider-Man that I have paid extra money for. I can't refund the game because I have over 2 hours of gameplay. Guess what? I lost my money. And the worst part is that they will NOT fix this bug since the game is 2 years old. An awesome game, became the most annoying game ever. Please consider the bugs before you buy this game and DON'T do what I did, Don't pay the full price for this. Wait for a sale and than buy it if you want.			"

												5/10 game if not Marvel fan, 8/10 if you're a Marvel fan.It's fun in many ways and bad in many others. I'll go over bad because that's more important, controls are garbage half the time you don't feel like you're really in control. Flying in this game with a character like Iron Man becomes such a pain going up and down, I feel like a better system could've been implemented. I'm playing with a 360 controller FYI.Split screen is pretty bad in dynamic mode, half the time you can't see what you're doing depending on how it splits the screen. Game is tedious in grinding it's not even kill enemies, it's just break stuff to get money to buy characters you already unlocked. Last bad thing about this game is that it features a Jew and his creations.			"

												This is one of the best Lego games I've played.Pretty wide selection of character/abilities(I know every Lego game does this. It just seems to be a little more so in this case. Also I'm aware that Iron Man 42 & Beetle are pretty much OP & make the other characters almost obsolete.)The vehicles are a welcome addition. This entry into the Lego series is virtually bug free.(1 or 2 minor issuse, nothing game breaking or overtly annoying.No suicide inducing jump sections(I'm glaring at you Lego LotR). There is a terribly frustrating RC race though. Traveller's Tales should apologize in advance to the completionists.The story, visuals & audio are all on par with the Lego games.My only criticism is: WHY THE EFF HAVE THESE GAMES NOT INTEGRATED ONLINE MULTIPLAYER? This would have been a great one to play with a buddy.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. I really do. In terms of the positives, the gameplay is fun, although simple. There is a robust cast of characters from the Marvel universe, each with their own unique abilities and many of which that have multiple costumes and so forth. There are some puzzle areas where characters must work together to overcome an obstacle. There are plenty of collectibles to keep you playing and keep you coming back.Now for the reasons I cannot recommend this game. I cannot tell you the number of times I ran into gamebreaking bugs. There were so so many and all of varying types. In some areas where an event is supposed to trigger, it simply doesn't and you can no longer progress, forcing you to restart from your last save point or the beginning of the mission. Other times, your character can end up in an infinite death loop, again making it impossible to progress. Then there are times when you switch to controlling one of your other characters who the A.I. managed to trap behind a ladder. Try killing him and he respawns in the same place, right behind that ladder, still stuck. Again, this makes it impossible to progress. Add to this the occasional crash and there you have it. The game becomes too damn frustrating to want to play anymore. And this isn't a once-time or occasional thing. These game-breaking bugs occur REGULARLY. When I looked some of these bugs up, I found guides to the game that specifically had to warn you about these bugs and actively show you how to avoid them as part of the game guide. It's like there was absolutely no QA testing on this game. The Lego franchise games are usually terrific, but this one was a terrible misstep in the series, which is unfortunate because it had the potential to be one of my favorites considering the universe in which it is set. Do not play this game unless you have the patience of a saint.			"

												I don't even like superheroes, much less the cheery Marvel variety and thoroughly enjoy this game. _Almost_ makes me wonder if the LEGO Harry Potter games are any good.On a technical note, Super Sampling (e.g. Sparse Grid) is necessary to eliminate texture aliasing on shiny surfaces (there are A LOT of these) that may drive you nuts. This is par for the course in LEGO games and being that this is D3D9 it is simple to set this up (on NVIDIA GPUs).			"

												It's boring. It's incredibly boring.This is generally true of all Lego games. You run from level to level mashing the attack button constantly to destroy the environment and the enemies that pose absolutely no threat whatsoever. Scattered throughout the levels are various gates that can only be bypassed with certain abilities. Most people would call these ""puzzles,"" but I don't think it qualifies as a puzzle when you run up to it and the game tells you exactly what you need to do. It's just a hoop thrown out by the developers to make players jump through it before they can move on to the next section and continue destroying everything in sight to collect studs. After doing this for what feels like seven eternities back to back, there will be a boss fight where the boss spends 99% of the fight utterly invulnerable to your attacks until a certain amount of time has passed or until you've killed enough of the enemies that spawn to remind you how terrible the combat is. Want to master the combat? Press the attack button. That's all there is to it. This is the last time I'm going to try to get into one of these games. Since the original trilogy's Star Wars game on PS2, I've been trying, and I'd guess that I've played at least seven different Lego games, including Dimensions, which my sister poured nearly $700 into. They are all exactly the same: run around, smash everything, collect studs, press the attack button until enemies are dead, use the character the game tells you to use to solve one of its ""puzzles,"" and then move on to the next area to repeat. It's almost like a psychological experiment to determine the bare amount of ""gameplay"" people can put up with, or an experiment to determine how many times the same exact game can be re-released with different character sets. This game sucks, and Telltale needs to stop re-releasing it. I'm ashamed of myself for buying it, because I knew exactly what I would find--the same thing found in literally every other Lego video game.So the experiment is clearly a success. Now please, Telltale Games, call it off.			"

												Just so boring…Story:A bunch of bad guys escaped. Use the good guys to defeat them. And the bad guys at one point to defeat Galactus and Loki. It’s a simple plot but it just goes almost nowhere. In the beginning, it's established that you need to go after the cosmic bricks. And you spend almost every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level doing that. It seems like the plot got off the ground for 5 seconds, plateaued and fell back at the end. It has no interesting story and is just boring really.There are a fair amount of characters to play through in the main story although you don’t unlock the villains until the end. Each hero is just a 1D mock of themselves. Captain America loves America, Iron Man is rich and shows off, Hulk is strong. They try to play it up for laughs but it’s just not that funny. In other games, at least there was slapstick or visual humor. Here, there’s visual humor in the beginning and ending cutscenes and that's it. It’s just boring and uninteresting. Gameplay:It’s a lego game. You hit bricks, collect studs, fight, and build. It’s a simple concept and almost unchanged. The attention is back on using the abilities of the superheroes which makes sense but you can only have 4 at a time which I found kinda boring. However, this makes sense when you realize that most of the characters are actually the same. Iron man and Human torch can fire heat beams to destroy gold bricks. Hulk and The Thing are strong and can pick up heavy stuff. Thor and Storm use lighting (yes Thor can fly but I never used it) to open switches. When you consider that, it narrows the heroes down a lot and you end up with like 4 or 5 abilities spread through all of them. This is a problem considering the levels are just absolutely enormous so you end up repeating so much♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again but with pallet swapped characters. Plus, the fighting is so simple that you can’t fall back on it.There are hub worlds and literally an open city where you can have races and collect stuff with mini quests but I didn’t care because again, all boring and you only do it for completion. Now the most annoying thing in the entire game: THE ♥♥♥♥ING FLYING CONTROLS. Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ these are horrible. On a keyboard, you press “w” to go forward and “J,K” to rise and fall but press them for too long and characters just freak the ♥♥♥♥ out and it’s just horrible. Plus, most of the time, the level doesn’t even require you to fly. So what's the point? Maybe to get around the hub world faster but you don’t always have a flying character and your GPS doesn’t work while flying. GREATGraphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)I wish I could skip cutscenes. Like the minute long beginning that I’ve watched multiple times. And it crashed a couple of times. The game looks fine but stutters a lot when loading a new area or expanding out and it’s jarring. Also, some animations look horrible. Mister Fantastic stretching is the jankiest♥♥♥♥♥♥when dealing with a lego.Final Thoughts:This is the first time I’ve just been bored with a lego game. Most of the other games have similar problems to the ones above but they have something else that makes it worth it. HP had slapstick and the story. LOTR had the story (and a LOT of the annoyances). The lego movie game had interesting segments, enemies, and settings (while having the personality and padding issues). This game is just flat out boring and my I had to motivate myself to finish it. That’s always a bad sign.			"

												I had high hopes for this game. I really did. I mean, I love lego games, and I love Marvel comics (even if I think that DC is better). How could it go wrong? It was like a match made in heaven! Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be one.First off, it isn't really a bad game, it can even be considered as a pretty decent one. But for me, It was a massive disappointment.I'll start with the pros: +The hughe cast of character. There is a LOT of character, and that is great.+The open world sections are pretty fun, it can be really amusing to run around New York as one of your favorite characters.+The levels are pretty well made, forcing you to play with various characters and using their abilities to reach the end, like in any lego videogame. I know a lot of people don't like this mechanic, but I don't mind it.And the cons:-I hate comic books movies. I really do. And why I really hate marvel movies, is because they now leave their mark in comics. For exemple, Hulk is now stupid again, we have the ""Nick Fury jr"" and Coulson bullcrap, and Iron Man, one of Marvel's worst and most hateable character (at least, in my opinion), is now the big figure of Marvel. And the game is fully influenced by the movies, with Iron Man everywhere (Urgh), Coulson and many more things that are just here to please people who only watch the movies.Ho and poor Dr.Aldrich Killian and Mandarin. Iron Man 3♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you and this game continues.-There is a really poor use of characters. A lot of great characters are here, but they are just not the characters that I grew up to love. Their personnality is either altered, or thrown in a wash machine. They are often used in a really poor way. I get it, most of it is used for the humor and all and all, but sorry, Doctor Octopus cleaning up Daily Bugle office? really-Many characters are here. But you need mondey to buy them. And they aren't cheap. At all. So be prepare to do a lot of grinding if you want them all. I don't mind grinding, but for this game, it was just not worth it.-The music is annoying as hell. More than once, I cut the sound. However the one when you jump of the Hellcarier is actually pretty good.-Boss battles are repetitive as ♥♥♥♥.-The final level... I won't say anything. Just knowing that it exists is enough.-Also if like me, you don't have a controller, you may find the control a little bit unfriendly. The game wasn't made for a keyboard and you can see it really quickly.Conclusion: I excpected a lot from this game, maybe too much. I didn't like how the characters I like were treated and the fact that the Marvel movies now spread their influence everywhere just makes me furious. I wanted to love this game, and even though it played ok, in the end, it was a massive disappointment.			"

												IF YOU USE A PS3/PS4 CONTROLLER, DO NOT BUY. Controller support is VERY broken, even a year and a half after release. There is a currently unfixable bug that forces co-op when using a PS3/PS4 controller, but only player 1 can drop out and there's no way to assign the controller to a character without triggering the co-op mode. If you use a 360 controller, there is a fix but it isn't particularly intuitive. Devs do not respond to the issue and have not made any acknowledgement of the problem.			"

												Wonderful, just wonderful.  Traveler's Tales released yet another LEGO game, what a bore.  Hmm? What's this?  It's based on Marvel Comics?  Hmmm...then this game might have a chance. Unfortunately, it doesn't. If you have played (most of) the previous LEGO games made by Traveler's Tales, you'll see what I mean.  Every single LEGO game that comes out is the same thing: Break stuff, build stuff, get studs, buy stuff with studs, use specific characters to unlock secret stuff, etc. and the series just gets crappier and crappier. Nothing really changes in the LEGO games, but hey, at least they talk in this one.  The gameplay in LEGO games never change, sure this game is one of the first open-world hub LEGO games, but that doesn't change its gameplay. The puzzles and things you do are still the same silly, unoriginal, ridiculous things  that actually make it feel like LEGO, but not the thing that's in LEGO form, not for one moment in these games can those puzzles and stuff you do be serious and original.  A lot of people say the controls are crappy in this game, but I kind of grew up with PC gaming so I am used to any PC controls no matter how bad.  Yes, the flying and vehicle controls are kind of weird and eventually get annoying, but I don't really care and it doesn't bother me anymore.  By the way, who gives a flying rats crappy behind about mouse control?!  Seriously, it's a LEGO game, they never have mouse control, deal with it you freakin' idiots!The story is original, I'll give it that, but terrible. The humor is weak and there's too much of it. And some of the story doesn't even make any sense, for instance, Doctor Octopus and Agent Coulson cleaning up the Daily Bugle, seriously?  I know this game's audience was heavily targeted at children, but they could've been a bit more serious with this game. Come on, it's Marvel, treat it with respect you loony-toony game developers. And what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in this game?  Better yet, what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in Marvel in the first place?!Now I want to go on record and say that I LOVE the Marvel films, but this game just makes a mockery of all of it. They even left out some key Marvel characters: Quick Silver, Ultron, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and other important characters.Oh wait, you want to get %100? Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoooooh! These games are RELENTLESS when it comes to secret content. It will take you MONTHS to unlock every single little damn thing in this game. I only own ONE LEGO game where I got %100, ONE. Trust me, don't waste your time unlocking all that crap, it's just not worth it. I would rather watch Disney's Frozen a thousand times so I can play the whole damn movie in my head while having Let it Go stuck in my head in the process than get %100 in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.This game is crap. Don't you DARE buy this game, because if you do, you'll be giving Traveler's Tales money and giving them another reason to create another one of these LEGO-shaped garbage cans. If you're a kid, this game will probably be the best thing that's ever happened to you. If you're an adult, not so much.3.8/10 Seriously, don't bother with this game. If I were you, I'd instead wait for Rovio to come up with an Angry Birds Marvel Super Heroes and buy it immediatley. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Marvel in Angry Birds would probably be a whole lot better than this stupid game, trust me.			"

												At this point, I don't even want them to fix the issues I'm having with this game anymore...I just want my money back.I mean it, I don't want to support this. I've waited for well over a year in hopes that someone out there would figure out what the hell is wrong with this game's control mapping. Am I not allowed to play it by myself? Is a second player required? I understand that some of you have gotten this game to work perfectly fine with a controller, but that doesn't excuse the fact that a lot of people paid for this game that is unplayable to them for some random reason. Nothing works. No matter what button/key is pressed, a second player is added. Instead of ""No Device"" it reads a device with no buttons. Yes, I understand this should be posted in the forums/community, but that didn't work for anyone else that tried it. There's no excuse for this.Next time, try giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												LEGO MARVEL Super Heroes is my first venture into a lego game and while I didn't hate it, I didn't love it either. There is a first for everything and I'm glad I tried.The game is very linear with 15 levels and while at times I got stuck, it always end up being some easy task which I didn't think of, or some lego structure I didn't smash through. The boss fights at the end of every level are extremely easy and repetitive though. To be honest, I enjoyed the puzzles more.I would not recommend this game, with the pushing factor that if anyone were to read this review, it would be someone on my friend list, and most of them wouldn't enjoy it either. However, it would be a different story if you are getting it for your children. It could provide suitable entertainment with mild stimulation and it might be worth purchasing the game when it goes on sale again.6/10			"

												The first LEGO game I didn't compleate (I 100% most of them), the story it not that good, you feel no drive to continue after each stage. The new voice acting just takes away the LEGO charm and I'm suprised people dont want the silent minifigures again, for example the scene in LEGO Star Wars where Lord Vader tells Luke he is his father is awesome (look it up if you've forgotten), but scenes from for example LEGO Lord of The Rings where they say ""We are the fellowship of the ring"" (or something like that) is super lame in LEGO form. Why am I mentioning other LEGO titles? Well cuz if I recall corectly this is the one that started it all, a downwards trend. Do not recommend this at all.			"

												Poor control scheme renders this game practically unplayable without a modern controller. As someone that plays exclusively mouse/keyboard or with an SNES pad, this was a huge disappointment. Keyboard control is wonky and unsuitable. SNES doesn't have enough buttons for all functions, and the game will not allow playing without all functions (even the never used ones) bound, and will not allow bounding some to one device, some to others.Huge disappointment.

												Long story short, its a run of the mill LEGO game with a Marvel sauce. If you played any LEGO game of the same vein before, don't bother picking it up unless you are a rabid Marvel fan. Or in need of a game that is continually trying to hold your hands like a venus flytrap holds insects. If there were any challenge, or even some slight variation in the Spaceballs level of mega-spoofery then if might actually be a game worth more than an hour of your time and a dime of your money. As things stand, sale only, and only if you absolutely must have this kind of game. No actual LEGO building involved, just a yawnfest.			"

												WILL NOT BUY!I played this game through a friends shared library on Steam (a fantastic system that we have so far had no problems with AT ALL)After completing quite a large portion of the game, and succesfully beginning and ending multiple game sessions, I booted the game and to my surprise it asked to confirm installation. I did so, and when the game booted, the option to continue my game was available, however, once I clicked it, I was told no save data could be found.Perplexed, I began the computer-wide search for said files, (I do know what I'm doing) without success. I then proceeded to search the crap out of forums, community hubs and other sources for a solution or suggestion. After much digging and searching, I discovered where my saves SHOULD have been, but were not. No trace. Not even the parent folder.I checked my 9 day old system back-up, only to discover that the file structure was in place, and the saves (albeit from a much earlier session) were there.This does not make me happy, can you see why? Something, somewhere, has decided it had the authorization to delete files from MY computer without my knowledge or say so. It is a bug in the programming, not windows, not steam, and certainly not user error.It hasn't been widely reported, but I'm not the only person this has happened to, and from all I can find, it's not at a certain point in the game, or a certain percentage level of completion, but it has deleted both the saves and the parent folder of the saves on other peoples systems.NEVER, have I had a problem with any LEGO game in the past, but this made me furious. To the degree that I will not purchase this game, ever. I have deleted the shared copy and I willl never play it again, and I will discourage all my friends from supporting it. This is sloppy, the bug hasn't been addressed and considering the money behind the game and the name it's representing, I expect far better.Well done on ruining what could have been another fantastic experience.

												So far the controls feel incredibly clunky and the gameplay is uninteresting. I seriously spent a lot of time trying to figure out a cool application of my hero's power to the first level that I forgot that the only method I was allowed to use was to walk up to the place I was supposed to, tap a button, switch characters, tap another button, and hope while I'm executing this my teammate's AI will be competent enough to cover me from the droves of infinitely spawning enemies trying to hinder my endeavor. It was frustrating and unrewarding to complete every task in the game so far, and the abundance of possible solutions to problems entailed by even the 3 characters I was allowed to briefly play as was neglected for unchallenging and unfun 'slow time events'.

Within the first level I had to reset 6 times because of players getting caught, poorly explained mechanics, and a broken engine. When I finally did beat the level, the game crashed!

												This game is kind of like that really popular kid who always seems cool, but you never really talked to him so you just kind of built your opinion of him off of what you have heard or seen. But once you actually talk to him you find out he is extremely boring and he never shuts up, and he keeps on spouting tons of annoying jokes. But you wanna like him so you keep hanging out with him for a few more weeks, but he seems to keep getting more and more annoying until you just want to hit yourself in the face with a shovel. The game isn't fun			"

												I had no problems playing the demo version of this game, however when i bought this and started the game, it says my video card does not support Shader Model 3.My CPU is Intel Core i5-3330S CPU together NVIDIA GeForce GT 620 with DirectX 11 installed. I feel ripped off. As i've found out ins some forums, the launcher probably used a terrible way of determining what's supported by the card. It probably checked the model against a known list of existing cards (for the time), rather than actually probe the capabilities of said card.			"

												Being a fan of the new Marvel movies as well as enjoying older ones as well I was looking forward to this game but was very dissapointed. The story was fairly predicatable, many of the puzzels weren't so much complicated, just hidden. I found this game extremely irritating to play, both with the keyboard or controller being slow to react. I can understand some of this to add some form of ""realisem"" but this was essessive.			"

												Nice clean graphics, good storyline however very difficult and cumbersome PC controls.  All the characters from the Marvel universe are recognisable complete with amusing one-liners.  Its a very lazy console port that hasnt really been ported well at all.  The mouse has no function and I often found that I was stuck without the keys working as the should or I couldnt work out what key should be pressed.  The view is also very annoying as you cant spin it around so only have the single viewpoint and some things get obscured because of this.  If you really want to play this game then you will need a PC controller.  I bought one and the game became so much better.   It gets a non-recommendation because of the unwieldy PC controls that make the game more or less unplayable without an XBox controller.  This is my first Lego game purchase and it will be the last.

												I've always liked the lego games, but this game lags down to 0 FPS way to much and can become very unplayable. Besides that, the game has horrible Bloom issues and some glitches that force you to restart the missions at the last part of a mission.The game does have a huge selection of characters and does boost improvements to the previous once, however the bug, glitches and low FPS makes me not want to recommend this game.

												I got this game mistakenly thinking that it had multi-player. There is zero option for on-line multi player in any way, including local network. It is only possible to have multiple people playing on one PC. I suppose that I should have researched it beforehand, but I find it very stupid that LEGO games, which are so geared towards co-operative play do not allow for on-line multiplayer. I now regret buying the game because I only bought it as a fun causal game to play with another person who lives far away.			"

												People just think this game is for kids but reality this game is for anyone. They already had a treat of superheros in the DC and moving to Marvel just made Lego games awesome. The navigation was compact mostly for flying superheros. BUT it was really hard to solve the missions if u are a derp. The game is for everyone not just for LEGO fans that know what the are doing. Since its MARVEL it attracts people and buys it. I spend around half an hour trying to figure it out yes there is walkthroughs. AND yes i am very dumb. But call of duty is easy to figure just SHOOOOOOOOOT. I could of used 20 more dollars on guides to be more smarter and books to read.			"

												Horrible.Probably could be an incredibly fun game, but after countless reinstall and even a reformat of the computer... this game freezes for no reason at all.  No other game has this problem on my computer, all my drivers are up to date.  This game takes far too long to load, and does NOT allow you to skip the cutscenes.   Which means after about 10 minutes of loading and watching the intro, we get honestly about 30 seconds of gameplay before it freezes.  I figured it was a video card issue, but this doesn't seem to be the case at all.Horrible... TT shoud never make a game again, clearly they have no idea how.  If you look for similar problems you'll see that this affects PC, as well as consoles.  I don't understand why this hasn't been fixed.  I expect these types of issues from Ubisoft, not from a low rate company! haha0/10!			"

												I enjoyed the early LEGO titles and played them to completion, but their games have been going steadily downhill. Including voice acting took away a lot of the cool creative aspects of their games. This one fails on sheer mechanics. Iron Man's explosives would target, but not blow up the items they were supposed to. Spider Man would hook on to a handle but the spastic mechanism (press K repeatedly until the progress bar fills) wouldn't work. Similarly the Hulk would let go in the middle of a progress bar. This game may work on a different platform, but I couldn't finish the first segment do to shoddy implementation.			"

												The second best Lego game after lord of the rings.  The initial Star Wars games were fun, then came the DC games which were pretty meh, then was Lord of the Rings (original trilogy) which was outstanding.  And this is great.Edit:  after playing a while I have noticed really bad framerate drops, after looking around the web I seen it wasn't my PC, it is doing this on ALL formats, so basically it is a rushed (to get started on Lego Batman 3 I presume) out unpolished game and for that reason I cannot recommend itAnd you have all these cool super heros but spend an awful lot of time on the boring Black Widow and Hawkeye.

												If you've ever wanted to play through some of DC's most classic lineup of superheroes and supervillains, this is the game that you've been waiting for your entire life.The gameplay is fairly standard and similar to other LEGO games, in that you run around mashing the attack button on any object you can see in order to collect studs, in one of the games most striking allegorical moments about the occupation of Palestine and the wars that followed.The story is as follows: When Ego the Living Planet is awakened by the energies of Randy Savage's death, several classic villains such as Anti-Monitor, Time Trapper, and Superboy Prime are sent to Earth to destroy it. However, in an ironic twist, the entire cast of Marvel Zombies has ravaged the planet, causing the supervillains to fight for the rights of mankind. Are the bad guys bad enough dudes to save the world from the once-heroes?There's free roam at the end but it sucks if you don't have a character that can fly, correctly mirroring issues of gender inequality and violations of LGBTQQAA2SPUBBQ members around the world, and I applaud Capcom Studios for looking past their collective cis privledge in order to present a game as emotionally moving as Gone Home by Anita Sarkeesian.Who is bad? Who is good? This and more you'll find in the hood. Play as Big Bird, Cool Spot, and the Six Flags guy in order to bring peace once more.0/10 no sherk			"

It's so fun and hilarious, this one is really good because i like the MARVEL comics and characters, The gameplay is pretty similair to DOOM 3, You run around and solve puzzles and blast demons in the face. I like to  RAN RUUU and there's pretty of that in this game, However there's no ROBLOX feautres in this game. No buying clothes or obby's, I'll give it a solid 7/10 only because of the rage againts the machine soundtrack.			"

												The game is way too easy. In just under an hour you will easily have over 100-200 extra lives. Also in order to play the hero you want, you have to follow a linear storyline unlocking each character one-by-one which may take a really long time for some of the heroes lower on the list.EDIT: I notice that many people disagree with my review but I would like to point out that it is not because I am wrong, but because I have left out some other key detail about this game -- as in, ""despite all of that it is still a good game"". Sure, you might argue that dying and seamlessly respawning on the same screen for a whopping 1,000 out of your millions-of-credits denies you the upgrades you need to buy with those, when the game is already ridiculously easy. I could also see how you might argue that this game is perfect for younger audiences when, actually, you would just rather not play it yourself. This game does not teach eye-hand-coordination or problem-solving skills and being a ""Press Y when it tells you to press Y"" game I would not recommend it to anyone, feel free to comment, thanks.

												I played the first 3 or 4 levels and quickly realized this is basically an interactive movie.  It's just a long series of super simplistic puzzles that you don't figure out so much as you just follow the on screen instructions.  You press B when it says to.  Press X when it says to.  Follow the color queues to know which character to use.  And after every 10 second task you get to watch some more animated events/cutscenes.  Great game for young children.  Nothing here for adults.			"

												Being a big fan of the Lego games, especially after the epic advenure the Lord of the Rings one was, I was super psyched to see my super heroes in a game.Straight to the point, keeping in mind I'm only an hour or two into it, it's been a major let down. The voice acting could have been much better. The voices chosen for each weren't really well picked and don't really fit some of the characters at all. The characters that are portrayed in the newer movies all have that voice people are used to. Lego Lord of the Rings brought all the original cast to re-voice the characters. They should have done the same for this as well seeing as they more than likey would have had the money.The gameplay has been pretty spot on as you would have hoped. Flying around and shooting energy balls with Iron Man, Hulk Smashing your foes with the Hulk, shooting webs with Spiderman are all a blast. Spiderman's web slinging could have been more interactive ( I sitll think the Spiderman 3 game has the best web slinging controls ever) but it IS a kid's game so, no points docked there.What reaaallly gets me the most, is the ""story"". It just doesn't have that Marvel-esque touch that the comics and cartoons had. The story just feels broken and uninteresting. Nothing to get you hyped about playing anyone, just, oh here's some chaos happening, have these 3 particular heroes and deal with it. Another issue, for me personally is I hate Fantastic 4, they're boring, uncreative and just irritating and too much of a portion of the game in the beginning has to deal with them, again that's a personal issue.The biggest irritation, is in all the lego games you had to destroy structures to release blocks to build something to aid you. They always had that ""tell"" that you could just look around and spot it and say ""ya..I bet I have to break that thing"". Here, everything blends in too well, everything looks normal. You will spend more time breaking everything in an area to reveal the blocks to build something than you do spending playing the game for the story. It's almost like they're forcing the ""break everything"" on you.Is it a good game? Probably my least favorite of all of them, which hurts to say because I love Marvel comics. Is it worth the price tag even on sale? Hell no. If it was 10 bucks maybe. At it's current price and Thanksgiving sale, I'd be much happier buying a second copy of Lego Lord of the Rings.			"

												The first, and last lego game I'm buying for the PC. The usual of what you'd expect from a lego game. Riddled with horrific bugs and the usual ""lego game concept"". However the one thing that killed it for me in this game is the races, if you have a PC that barely scrapes what's required, don't bother getting it as you'll never 100% be able to complete the game.The developers of this game are incredibly oblivious to the bugs as well as the races, they're not fun and cause more frustration than they do enjoyment.My final verdict is, stick to buying lego games on gaming consoles, they are just not made for the pc.

												The writing is very very bad.  Constant puns - and horrible ones.  It is clear they were trying for a tone similar to Joss Whedon's Avengers, but decided against hiring a good writer.  The level design is bland, and at times the obstacles are mind-boggling.  Characters that can fly have to blow up 6 foot obstacles before they can proceed through the level?  Lots of invisibile walls, which in my mind always always equates to poor game design and inexperienced developers.  With Marvel behind this, you'd think they would have invested a couple dollars hiring a legitimate development team, one that could come up with a better level design than the weak offerings within.  I bought the game for the setting, and the characters, but it is really a poor offering and disappoints beyond words.  Poor form, LEGO and Marvel.  P.S.  Yes, I understand it was targeted for kids, but when we look at games like Disney Infinity and Skylanders, there's a lot more room for improvement.			"

												An awesome LEGO adaptation of Mighty Marvel Manhattan that you'd lose countless hours just exploring, plus a main story that teams up all your favorite Marvel superheroes against their archenemy supervillains. This is a game that no True Believer in either Marvel or LEGO (or both) dare miss.			"

												One word: Fun. Also don't let the PG-ish rating fool you. It has free-roaming (with fun results, especially in co-op. Like GTA with LEGO), good dialog, and something which you won't believe for a LEGO game: A jumpscare.Overall, I give it a 12/10. Way worth the sale earlier today.			"

												This game is freaking awesome. I started playing the LEGO games on PS2 starting with Star Wars. Everything that game embodies is still in this one. The cool overworld, the incredibly large character selection, the puzzling... puzzles, and etc. Marvel is also my favorite franchise producers, from Spiderman to Ironman to Hulk and the X-men, they're all in this game. The overworld is probably my favorite part because it's almost like LEGO GTA. You can hijack civilian cars and drive them around into light posts and mailboxes, running over civilians (they just fall over), flying jet planes, and finding secrets. You can change into characters you unlocked at any time in the overworld too. I don't understand why I haven't played this game sooner. Something that may throw some people off though, is that this game is voice acted. Most LEGO games I've played make the characters do interpretive movements to let the player know what's happening. Not this one.			"

												Warning for potential buyers: This game requires a controller or gamepad. The keyboard controls are absolutely unacceptably atrocious. They want your right hand to be on HJKL and also hit the arrow keys. That will never happen. Luckily, I had a 360 PC controller, plugged it in, the game automatically recognized it and switched to controller mode, and the controls work beautifully. Play it with a controller!Aside from the initial shock at how immensely bad the keyboard controls were, this game is really fun. If you like LEGO anything, you'll probably like LEGO Marvel. You can play as a vast array of different heroes and even villains, and beat up bad guys. The game really opens up as you progress, allowing free-roam of New York City after a certain point. It plays a lot like other free-roam games, you have a map with objectives and you can do side-stuff along the way, collecting and unlocking as you go. The main plot is the only true drawback for me. It's definitely there, but each mission feels disjointed. There's so much that you have to skip because you haven't unlocked a character yet. I spend more time trying to figure out if a shiny unbreakable object is something I can activate than progressing. Fortunately there are a lot of details from Marvel canon and beyond that the development team added to make even the dull parts amusing. And as always, the gameplay is top notch. LEGO games all feel the same and I like that about them, but they went above and beyond in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes to make each hero play differently. I'm not halfway through the game yet and I've already played as probably 15 different heroes, each with a unique style and skillset. It's just downright fun.			"

												Alright - I'll admit, this game isn't as hard as many games out there. I mean, honestly, I've put half as much time into this as I have Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and I still haven't beaten the story yet in the latter.However, I can tell you for a fact that it is a FUN game. It has surprisingly high-quality voice acting, as well as an original storyline combining pretty much every important Marvel character in history. And a duck. We don't talk about the duck. While it  can take a bit of practice to get the hang of the keyboard targeting programs, it makes up for that with the seeking quality of projectiles, and there is a wide variety of different heroes, villains, and Deadpool you can use to figure out different situations and help different people.Oh, and don't forget - DEADPOOL. Oh god. He's hilarious. The first time I noticed him, I was just fighting Doc Ock in Times Square, and then I looked up. And then I was like 'Oh, look, there's Deadpool in a helicopter videotaping the whole thing - wait what?' He just pops up in the most random of places, and has this innate ability to be hilarious. He's also the narrator in bonus levels, which gets extra hilarity thrown in.But yea. I highly suggest you buy this game.			"

												I was initially disappointed after purchasing two copies of Lego Marvel with the intention of both my husband and I playing together via Steam - co-op is only available via split screen couch co-op which is rather difficult with a keyboard only based game.  I'm sure it's easy enough to set up a controller for use with the game but we both felt that LAN and Online co-op was something the game was severely lacking.With that said, I have throughly enjoyed playing the game solo so far. Each playable character has their own feel and set of special powers and although the majority of the game is smashing up lego bricks and collecting the coins it's therapeutic. In addition some of the puzzles are more challenging than previous Lego games. I look forward to putting more hours into this game and unlocking all the extra characters.			"

												If you are a fan of Marvel then you owe it to yourself to play this game. While I found myself fighting the awkward camera angles and controls at times, the gameplay is very memorable and just plain fun. There also appear to be issues with Steam integration at this time (no achievements) but I'm more focused on getting all the characters unlocked so I can just wander around the city. Would be nice if the developers invested a bit more in the game engine as still plays like the old, old Lego Star Wars games, but it gets the job done. Great for kids as well, although some of the puzzles may be a bit challenging for kids that are low on patience.			"

												Finally, I've managed to reach 100% completion. I normally finish Lego games faster, but the difficulties with the flying  and zipline races took fair a bit of time, because I had to repeat them many times due to the shonky flying controls.The characters, the story and the open world are great. I found 11 side missions great fun, especially Deadpool and his commentary. Puzzles are not too dificult, so people shouldn't have any major problems to finish the story.I would recommend though to finish the story first (all 15 of them) before embarking on exploring NYC. It makes switching between characters easier.			"

												In my opinion this is by far the best Lego game. If you've never played a Lego game before you should know that these games are very lighthearted; childish even. But they're great fun for all ages. You should be a Marvel fan to appreciate everything this game has to offer, and it does have a lot to offer. There's a ridiculous number of Marvel characters, all of whom can be played as. The story is surprisingly good. The length of some sequences can be tiresome, which could have been avoided if the story perspective changed to another superhero for a bit to break the monotony. Definitely play with a gamepad and not a mouse and keyboard.			"

												This is the first lego game I tried, and I found it clever and entertaining at first, but quickly became repetitous. Endless button mashing, and basically repeating the same puzzles and fights over and over with different charters. Seems to be geared towards pre-teens, in that it requires zero instinct and zero problem solving skills.  Way too much emphasis on gathering coins. Way too much button mashing. Unlocking the different Marvel characters is cool. In fact the highlight of the game is the way they gave the characters great personalities and gag lines. Too bad the gameplay was too lame to keep me instred for more than a few hours. A great idea that gets bogged down in unimaginative gameplay.			"

												LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is tremendously enjoyable. It’s overflowing with charm and humour, energised by the sheer amount of love shown for the Marvel universe and the class with which it has been put together. 7/10			"

												I got this game when it was on sale, it was on sale for like 5 or 6 dallors so i couldn't resist to get it. When I got the game I thought it was going to be horrible cause it was a LEGO game, but when i started to play it was pretty good! P.S it's a bit too easy.			"

												Anything with LEGO® in it always brings back the little kid in me. It is a fun game to play, and makes it even better if you have someone else that wants to play with you (LAN). It does not support online multiplayer but it does have LAN multiplayer, all you have to do is share a keyboard. Personal Rating: 05/10			"

												This is the first lego game I tried, and I found it clever and entertaining at first, but quickly became repetitous. Endless button mashing, and basically repeating the same puzzles and fights over and over with different charters. Seems to be geared towards pre-teens, in that it requires zero instinct and zero problem solving skills.  Way too much emphasis on gathering coins. Way too much button mashing. Unlocking the different Marvel characters is cool. In fact the highlight of the game is the way they gave the characters great personalities and gag lines. Too bad the gameplay was too lame to keep me instred for more than a few hours. A great idea that gets bogged down in unimaginative gameplay.			"

												Before I begin this review, I must point out this caveat to you. There are approximately three things in this world that I love above all other things, the first is Lego. I am a Lego collector (specifically super hero Lego at that). The second is comic books and super heroes. Ever since I've been able to use my eyes and hands in unison I've loved the world of super heroes, specifically Marvel. The third is video games.So this game is ticking all three boxes for me. And it is simply brilliant. The main story is a lot of fun, but in reality feels like the prologue to the rest of the game, a quest to collect the myriad different characters (there are some amazing and obscure characters to collect) and complete side missions etc. Literally hours of fun. It also is genuinely funny. I actually found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. In a room. On my own. Laughing. Which is especially amazing as I'm currently being treated for depression. So thanks Lego Marvel Super Heroes. You've not only been a welcome distraction, but have given me some drive and purpose and genuinely had me feeling happy when I've felt anything but.			"

												This game is awesome. The guys at lego really brought their A game to this title. It is surprisingly well rendered, the characters are true to their marvel comics origins, something that several of the movies have failed at (looking at you ""X-men"" movies). The humor is apropriate for the subject matter. And the cast is Ginormous, from the black panther to the punisher, to Dr strange, all of the major players are here. Though i was hoping for some of the more obscure figures like cloak and dagger to be here, if they are i'll revise this when i find them. Anyway, i whole heartedly recommend this to any fan of Lego or Marvel or games in general. I enjoy this game and my kids enjoy it too. Oh, almost forgot, i love the way that split screen play behaves in this game, starting with the standard vertical divide during exploration in manhattan, during campaign play the divide is dynamic from vertical to diagonals and fusing when possible, an innovation i hope to see much more wide spread.

												This was probably one of my favorite LEGO games, not necessarily because of the source material because I was never a Marvel fanatic, but I was after playing this.  There are 15 missions that last 20-30 minutes, they're the standard lego puzzles that require certain abilities to get past.  The story is a standard superheroes vs. villains story but it manages to expand to as many parts of the Marvel Universe so it no 2 levels feel the same.  When not in a mission there is a big open world Manhatten with plenty of side missions and tasks to keep you occupied for hours.  Some of the most fun I have is jumping into New York from the hellicarrier, and boy did they knock the music out of the park.Lastly the best part is all the different characters you can play.  Beyond the standard Avengers, X-men, Spiderman, and Fantastic Four characters their are dozens of others some even more obscure.  You can run around as a LEGO Blade or Punisher, and of course there is Deadpool who pretty much narrates all the non main story parts.  Riding around as Captain Britain in the britmobile was funny as well.  The two DLCs add more characters from the new movies, no updated Falcon though :( .  If you like LEGO games or Marvel this game is definately a must.			"

												This is a fantastic game, well worth the money.  The story was interesting and was epic toward the end levels, the soundtrack was perfect throughout the game, and the cutscenes were funny in true Lego style.  I only completed the main story with a few extras, but for the completionists there is a hell of lot to do, the open city is quite large and freeplay makes replaying levels worthwhile.  If that doesn't convince you to buy it then there's always Lego Coulson!			"

												I was initially disappointed after purchasing two copies of Lego Marvel with the intention of both my husband and I playing together via Steam - co-op is only available via split screen couch co-op which is rather difficult with a keyboard only based game.  I'm sure it's easy enough to set up a controller for use with the game but we both felt that LAN and Online co-op was something the game was severely lacking.With that said, I have throughly enjoyed playing the game solo so far. Each playable character has their own feel and set of special powers and although the majority of the game is smashing up lego bricks and collecting the coins it's therapeutic. In addition some of the puzzles are more challenging than previous Lego games. I look forward to putting more hours into this game and unlocking all the extra characters.			"

												An outstanding Lego game. It has nice graphics and a good, long storyline. I have played other lego games before and have always liked them, but i can say this is the best one so far. There are a lot of characters with their own animations and different kind of actions. You can play many of Marvel's superheroes and villains. The developers have done a good job in making lego objects more on the foreground, as this is what i missed in other lego games. It has given me much more of that lego feeling. There is much interaction with the open world, New York, and levels are well-designed. Compared to other lego games it is a bit harder to play, but not in a way that it isn't fun anymore. It has nice cutscenes, containing complex lego structures. I would highly recommend this to others who like lego games, as it certainly is worth the price.			"

Also, watch out you've done everything you can in each part of a levle before you move on, i didnt and one of the characters got trapped so i had to redo that level to.			"

Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! I might add that i do have two x box controllers though, which i think are essential for a game like this. If you want good fun co op, invest in a couple of controllers and fire this up.			"

												A very accurate representation of a Marvel unieverse in the form of Lego, if you enjoyed the comics and movies for all these characters then you will love this game, there are classic references to the new Marvel movies and classic comic books. The game expands into characters never seen on screen before, play as characters like Iron man, Thor and other Marvel classics. But also expect characters like the Guardians of the galaxy, even Ant man and Squirrel girl! Don't expect too much variation in character powers though, once you get probably half way through the game you've pretty much seen all powers, however do not let this comment dishearten you! There is plenty of content in this game and I've definitely spent a lot of time on this game , both in local co-operative and single player, the controls are unsturdy as they are mainly built for controller, so if you have a controller I definitely recommend using it as I found it easier to use a controller. I rate this game 8/10, fantastic dialogue and writing, gameplay and action. Also Clark Gregg voices Coulson! I guess he is the definitive Coulson!			"

												A fairly impressive game that will engage people of all ages.  A huge open world, tons of unlockable characters and LEGO's quirky humor make this game a rewarding play.  That being said there are some game-breaking bugs specifically in the story-driven missions.  Sometimes the puzzles are less intuitive than may be expected, leaving the player searching for a fair amount of time to find the solution.  Even taking these issues into consideration this game is a fun, super hero/villain driven massive open world surprise that I wholeheartedly recommend.			"

												This game was very fun but had alot of downfalls such as the end boss being very boring and some of the playable charactors powers were not what they are like in the comics , movies and T.V shows. On the other hand it is really fun to play with a friend and the gameplay is strangly addictalbe even though it seems to be quite boring. There are alot of playable charactors nearly all of them are unique alhtough some of the ones you get at the end of the game seem to have simuler abilities from the starter charactors. All around this game has fun mechanics, great with friends and so many charactors you can play as. There may be alot youo can re-play this gam for like all the collectables but it is deffinityly not fun doing this game on your own a second time   unless you have a friend. Over all this game is quite good with a few paticular things it could improve on I would give it a 7/10			"

												Man this game is beast (get it Beast is a super hero from X-MEN). I have not played a LEGO game for quite some time but this brought me right back. I played the demo on PS3 but decided to purchase it on Steam as it was part of a deal. Its awsome the gameplay is fluent and downright cool. There are so many characters to collect there are loads. Theres also a new feature where sometimes you can jump from the S.H.I.E.L.D hellicarrier and land down in the city to start a mission. There are areas that you can explore but its mainly missions. This may put you off but trust me the hellicarrier is massive and will fullfill all your freeroaming needs. If your still not satisfied go play GTA or something go and explore vast worlds full of suprises (Man that does sound good.) but you don't know what your missing!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

A huge cast of characters, a large area to explore (in 3 dimensions), ,hundreds of activities requiring a wide range of skillsets, and the Lego humor that pervades their games make for a sweet experience. The only thing I wish it had was online co-op to make this game perfect. But if you love Lego and you love Mavel, this game is just fantastic.			"

												Extremely fun game with a lot of comical references to everything in the marvel universe. Game feels like it can get repetitive at times, and most puzzles are easily solved as long as you have the right super powers, but the open world of new york, the huge character cast, and the ability to explore some of the most well-known locations in the marvel universe makes this game definitly worth playing. Many have wanted an open world marvel game for years, and while I bet this wasn't what they were expecting, it's well worth the experience.			"

												This and LEGO Batman 2 are by far the best of the LEGO series by TT. The main mission is good fun and once you open up freeplay, you can go back and try and get the all the collectables, which really extends the game time. I love the wide range of characters and also how the developers have adapted their powers to this game. Definitely would recommend this to play with the kids (and alone when they are asleep).			"

Play as some of your favorite Marvel characters like Absorption Man, Polaris, Wizard, um, Mastermind, I guess and, uh, Howard the Duck.  If a full-grown man-child can enjoy this game made for children, then so can you.Pros:- Flying is great- Absorption ManCons:- No Absorption Man-centric storyline.			"

												My son and I have played this game for countless hours.  It is by far, the best Lego game to date.  They actualy voiced the characters this time.  And its not pre recorded audio from a movie either.  The puzzels in the game were easy enough for my 5 year old to figure out, but on occasion needed help.  The humor from the previous lego games is there too.  There is an incredible amount of characters to unlock.  The ability for flying characters to go from the ground, fly around, and go into the sky up to the helicarrier is cool too.  They built an entire city to explore and do things in.  Many actual levels of pre scripted game play is avaible too.  I highly recomend it for a 5 year old and up.  Even as an adult I really enjoyed the game.  If i had more than two thumbs, they would all be up!  My setup is a 4 year old pc with a geforce 460.  Its an older video card and it handles the game on all the highest settings perfectly.  I have a wireless Microsoft controller (is identical to the 360) that the hub it come with allows 4 controllers to connect to.  I use an extra xbox 360 controller to play with it.  From there, I have an HDMI cable running to my home theater system to play the game on a big tv.			"

												Good Game, However I have a few complaints. Way, way too much hand holding. Whenever you are near something and have to use an ability of some sort the narrator will say something like ""You need to use someone with a lot of strength here."" It gets annoying fast and there is no way to turn it off. One other thing the Stan Lee cameo was way over done. True he came up with all this but him saying ""excelsior"" every time you get ""true believer"" both of which are extremely cheesy, takes its toll on my sanity. It may have been cool in the 80's but now...Aside from that it is pretty fun.			"

												If you like Lego and you like Marvel, this is a lovingly-made tribute! It's packed full of characters and scenarios that will charm and delight. The voice cast is good and the script is occasionally very funny.Aside from that, it is Lego game business as usual, unfortunately with one or two glitches and bugs. The New york city hub is too barren and many of the side missions are poor.I liked the game enough to recommend it, but I would rate Lego Batman 2 as a better version of pretty much the same thing (without wishing to start a DC vs Marvel argument!).

												Given that it’s a Lego game and primarily directed at children the predicable plot, the so so script and the inconsistent power of particular heroes (Hulk, magneto ect) is forgiven. Neither good nor bad just meh. Companion AI is absolutely dreadful most of the time, they either stand their doing nothing or get stuck somewhere and constantly die, only during boss battles are they helpful. The voice acting isn’t bad at all but older fans will miss the actors we have come to associate with particular characters such as spiderman, magneto, wolverine ect again its aimed at the younger gen cartoon fan.7/10. Lord of the Rings Lego is a much better in almost all aspects, bar Superheroes combat/boss battles.  "

												Good Game, However I have a few complaints. Way, way too much hand holding. Whenever you are near something and have to use an ability of some sort the narrator will say something like ""You need to use someone with a lot of strength here."" It gets annoying fast and there is no way to turn it off. One other thing the Stan Lee cameo was way over done. True he came up with all this but him saying ""excelsior"" every time you get ""true believer"" both of which are extremely cheesy, takes its toll on my sanity. It may have been cool in the 80's but now...Aside from that it is pretty fun.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the LEGO games. I've played at least 6 and finished them to 100% completion. But this one...I didn't. I beat all the levels, but never felt compelled to keep playing or find all of the hidden items in each level. I like Marvel, I like the Cinematic Universe, but maybe it's the fact that it's a brand new story rather than a retelling of an already familiar one that was getting me down. Basically, the premise is this: your favorite Marvel superheroes together (and villains teaming up), something that the movies could never do with different studios owning the rights to various franchises. The story's not bad, and it has a good mix of humor (they got Tony Stark down, even without RDJ voicing), and it's really fun to see the interactions between supers that you normally don't get to see. The banter between them is fantastic. But as for gameplay? There's nothing groundbreaking with this one, same old same old. The levels are LONG, and even though they have a save feature so you can quit in the middle of the level, it's few and far between, and ithe option will disappear if you activate the save point then don't save. So, yeah, had to redo a few levels because of glitches because I wasn't using the save points and there's no autosave in the middle of a level. There was also another game-breaking glitch where one of the bosses gets stuck in one corner that happened to me TWICE that required restart of the level from the beginning. Annoying.So, if you REALLY love the LEGO games or REALLY love Marvel, you will probably still enjoy it. Otherwise...meh. Go play LEGO Harry Potter or LEGO Star Wars instead, honestly.			"

												Lego games have been getting increasingly more creative and amazing over the years. Games like Lego Star Wars 1, though still amazing, do not compare graphically and combat-wise, with some of these newer games. Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an excellent bland of adventure, action, and open word gaming. It is perfect for kids, though older people may have a hard time remaining pacified with this game. The streets of New York provide an excellent portion of this games open world features, with the ability to travel to islands and different locations all over the place. The character variety is amazing. I believe that Lego Lord of the Rings is the only other Lego game with the same minifigure variety as this game. Lego Marvel Super Heroes exceeds Lego LOTR with the variety of characters powers and abilities. The addition of a character customization station pretty much completes this game. In it (the customizer) you can combine different heroes body parts to give your creation a combination of certain heroes' powers. My younger siblings have made a hybrid spider-man/captain America. It's probably the game's best feature. Lego Marvel Super Heroes is definitely something kids will enjoy. I myself do not play it all that much, but my little sibs do, and they love it. 10/10 another great Lego game!			"

												Lego Marvel Super Heroes has the same awesome qwerky style that all Lego games possess which makes the game fun and enjoyable. This feels more of a developed Lego game as characters have a wide range of abilities and navigating through the levels requires work from every character. However, there are some problems. First, you can clearly see this is designed with controller in mind. You still can’t bind keys with the mouse which is ridiculous. Why can't I attack with left click just like all games do? I also think they made filling the stud meter to 100% way too easy. You used to have to destroy everything, pick up almost every stud to fill it, and that's how it should be. But I’m filling it up most of the time just playing the level normally, not even having to search for purple studs or anything. On the other hand, they made finding the minikits too difficult in my opinion. Anways, this game is still really, really fun and that's why I can recommend it. I'm having lots of fun playing this and it's worth the money.			"

One problem is the panels you have to push in a circle to lift something or open something, they don't always let you stay on. Also unless you don't change the resolution, the final boss won't work. The game has more good parts than bad so over all I'd recommend this game to those who can accept glitches and be patient enough to wait for the updates to fix some more bugs8/10			"

												As always with Lego, this game is a pure delight to play. It has a massive cast of fun and fearsome heros and villans to choose from, a seemingly boring but really quite awesome story, and a massive open world to explore outside of missions, this is probably the best Lego game since Star Wars. It's great fun through and through, but a controller is a MUST, as the keyboard controls are a bit wonky and sort of stupid. Overall a great and enjoyable game that will bring a smile to your face time and time again.5 Stars			"

												What is this game? It's a combination of Lego and Marvel Super Heroes (Obviously). This game was a BLAST to play. Easy controls, a fun story, decent graphics and a very high replayability made this game close to perfect for me. Allow me to detail out to you what makes this game so good:1. The characters. The characters themselves are a blast to play with. Everyone's favorites are here, from Iron Man and Captain America, to Doctor Octopus and Doctor Doom. Every character has their own special ability to help you along in the story quest and side missions.2. The story. I won't spoil for those yet to play. Just know the story is good.3. The graphics. In case you're wondering ""How does Lego affect good graphics?"" Well, the backdrops of New York City are rather spot-on, and the transition from Lego to Non-Lego is practically flawless. 4. The controls. Everything is typical from a Lego game. They barely ever change controls, so if you're a veteran lego player, like me, then you know what to do pretty much instantly. If this is your first Lego game, well, don't worry, you'll get the hang of the controls pretty quick.5. The world itself. It's an open-world Lego version of New York. The buildings put into it, and the effort, shows clearly the moment you just from the Helicarrier. Yes, the Helicarrier is in this game. 6. The voice acting. I'll admit, some voices they chose for characters threw me off. But upon looking up the cast, I was amazed to see Nolan North, Steve Blum and Tara Strong in the cast. Of course, every game has its downsides. Don't worry, this game only has two.1. The camera. The camera angle is odd at times, getting stuck where you don't want it to, and then some parts of the game may be hard to see. However, you can usually fix this by switching to the other character, running back a ways, then switching to the first character.2. The AI. I often had to deal with enemy AI and my follower's AI getting stuck on parts. Sadly, there wasn't really much of a fix for this.So do I recommend this game? Yes, very much so. it has the typical Lego humor (with voice acting), a great story, all the characters we know and love, and so much more! It'll most certainly keep you entertained for hours upon hours, and when you do get bored, just relax and read some of Deadpool's comics! They'll get a chuckle out of you, guaranteed.			"

												If you like the Lego titles you should get this game. It's that simple. It's gorgeous(for Lego) and the custom written voice acting is good. I found the story campaign to be a bit short, finished it in about 12 hours but there are tons of things to unlock and extra levels for when you have enough gold bricks so I know it'll last me. The city is huge and so is the sky.HULK SMASH!			"

												This game is fine if you don't want to bother doing the open world stuff, which is kind of a shame since that's where you get a bunch of the collectables and I found that a little more interesting than the main game. The main storyline is pretty straightforward, there's nothing too notable to talk about. If you've never played a lego game before it may take you a mission or two to figure out the rules, but t's fun.The open world collectathon is where you run into all the problems. Anyone who says the controls are perfect hasn't bothered doing this part. Flying characters can rocket out of control, it's easy to fall through a building, and in general (even in the main story) sometimes you'll get locked onto an AI ally and will proceed to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them instead of the actual enemies. Still, it's not plagued with these problems, and they're more like annoyances than major issues.			"

												Alright - I'll admit, this game isn't as hard as many games out there. I mean, honestly, I've put half as much time into this as I have Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and I still haven't beaten the story yet in the latter.However, I can tell you for a fact that it is a FUN game. It has surprisingly high-quality voice acting, as well as an original storyline combining pretty much every important Marvel character in history. And a duck. We don't talk about the duck. While it  can take a bit of practice to get the hang of the keyboard targeting programs, it makes up for that with the seeking quality of projectiles, and there is a wide variety of different heroes, villains, and Deadpool you can use to figure out different situations and help different people.Oh, and don't forget - DEADPOOL. Oh god. He's hilarious. The first time I noticed him, I was just fighting Doc Ock in Times Square, and then I looked up. And then I was like 'Oh, look, there's Deadpool in a helicopter videotaping the whole thing - wait what?' He just pops up in the most random of places, and has this innate ability to be hilarious. He's also the narrator in bonus levels, which gets extra hilarity thrown in.But yea. I highly suggest you buy this game.			"

												For me this is one of the most fun Lego games to date. As a Marvel fan my opinion would always be biased but my younger family just love it and the open world side of the game means they just happily run around the city causing mayhem. All your favourite characters are here and a couple of recent DLC's added some more. Great voice acting and a healthy dose of humor make this a fun game to play. Bugs have been present from the beginning but some have already been fixed while others have workarounds.			"

The recommend spec to run this is good in a way that low spec pcs should be able to give this a bash.I play this on 2 player with my 6 year old so its great to play in co op or single player. If you love unlocking things there are 177 main things and a number of gold blocks. There is also great cut seens which really help to tell the story. Santa delivered the game to the lad but if wait for the next steam sale it was as low as £12.99  i saw.			"

												If you like Lego and you like Marvel, this is a lovingly-made tribute! It's packed full of characters and scenarios that will charm and delight. The voice cast is good and the script is occasionally very funny.Aside from that, it is Lego game business as usual, unfortunately with one or two glitches and bugs. The New york city hub is too barren and many of the side missions are poor.I liked the game enough to recommend it, but I would rate Lego Batman 2 as a better version of pretty much the same thing (without wishing to start a DC vs Marvel argument!).

												When I came to play this game, I went into it thinking it was just going to be another LEGO game clone. I was actually presently surprised by what I found, as the developers seem to have taken the traditional LEGO game formula and turned it into an open world setting with a metric♥♥♥♥♥ton of content. The one-button combat and puzzles aren't difficult by any stretch of the imagination, but that's never been the point of LEGO games. The point is to collect studs and explore the adorable LEGO microcosm of your favourite franchises. The game has brilliant voice acting which adds tremendously to the comedic aspects of the LEGO formula and running around as a Deadpool minifigure while beating the tar out of HYDRA agents gives comic fans (like myself) a little rush of excitement. Whether you're a Marvel fan or not, I strongly reccomend giving this game a shot.			"

I've finished the story, but I'm not even at 25% of the game yet, and that doesn't count the DLC.			"

As with recent itirations of the lego series, the game environment is now open world outside the levels, with enjoyable unlockable content and mini-games in order to unlock Gold Bricks. The gameplay of levels is unchallenging and repetitative to teenagers and above, but if you can bear that, the wide range of characters, abilities, and open-world gameplay make this the best Lego Game to date.

												As with most LEGO games, this installment of the series provides brilliant casual gameplay and is silly amounts of fun. It also provides players with over 150 characters, which is excluding the alternative suits that can be unlocked for many of the characters. The storyline is fun but short and the only problem that I have found with this game is the voice acting for some of the characters, but that is a personal opinion. However, with the overall quality of the game this problem is barely noticeable and the amount of side missions that can be found around the map help bolster the length of the game considerably. Highly recommend for any LEGO game fans that do not have this game yet.			"

												I have had a lot of fun playing thisa game. The pure number of marvel characters included is impressive, especially since they they inlcuded some of the more obsure characters such as Black Bolt. I have just beaten the main storyline and I know I still have quite a few hours of play left with all the side missions. This is not perfect however, there are times when the game will crash when it really shouldn't (I have the hardware to run gmaes far more demanding on ultra). My only other complaint is some parts of the game begin to feel repetitive, with many of the boss fights going down the exact same way. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game if you love marvel comics and are up for so fun and humorous game play.			"

There is a nice open area to explore and do missions in, as well as borrow cars to drive around or just fly around if you are using a hero that can fly. The storyline felt a bit focused on the Fantastic 4, but does have many other Marvel characters featured throughout. I really love the humour in the game. It is exactly the sort of thing I would expect in a LEGO game. Overall, I really enjoyed the game and my only wish is that LEGO would make a 4 player game sometime soon.

I also have Lego Batman 3 and I prefer this because of the humor and style.  Although Batman 3 has the wide variety of characters and activities, the Marvel version just feels better.  Batman 3 feels forced whereas this feels like watching a well-made Marvel movie; action packed, intriguing story, and enough comedy to make it enjoyable for just about anyone.			"

												Standard LEGO fare with all your favourite characters, stud collecting, mini-kit collecting, gold brick collecting, and character collecting we all know and love from recent games. Standard mechanics and such, with the standard cheesy, pun-filled story we've grown to love from these games.Does require a decent graphics card to run though, sadly. Before my upgrade I got unacceptable framerates (I now have a GTX 960).7-8/10(I think LEGO Jurassic World had more heart)			"

												Extreme fun, family friendly game in which Marvel's mightest heroes assemble in brickform to defend the world from a cabal of supervillians who plan to use cosmic bricks to take over.  Building on and perfecting the formula created back in Lego Star Wars, Lego Marvel is a great mix of action and puzzles as you ultilise the different abilities of Iron Man, Captian America, Wolverine, Spiderman, Hulk and rest of the huge roster of heroes to navigate the story as well as the myriad of side missions scattered around the hubworld of New York City.  Activities include escort quests, racing games and timed puzzles, providing a nice variety to keep things interesting.  There are also character unlocks hidden throughout the city, so exploration is a vital party of the game.As with the other games, the graphics by no means revolutionary but succeed in bringing the world to life, with everyone looking suitably plastic and blocky, while the voice acting is genuinely humourous and adds a lot of charm.  Controls are decent, sticking to the standard layout from the other Lego games, though it is probably best to play with a controller if you have one.  As with the previous games, the fix camera can sometimes be an issue, but never enough to truly hamper the game.  The  running time of the main story mode clocks in at about 12 hours, but there is dozens of more hours of fun to be had once you start exploring, making this game great value for money.As a fun game for the family and a love letter to Marvel's superherous, this game is a winning success. Highly recommended!			"

												I’ve owned this game a few days, and I love it. I’ve played most if not all of the Lego games before. But this is my favorite licenced one, my favourite lego game being either Lego Rock Raiders, or Lego Racers 2. I’m a Marvel fan, I grew up watching X-Men, Spider-Man among other Marvel favourites, so I was expecting to like this game. I love all the little details, the cool animations when the characters transform and the humour is amazing as usual. I’ve enjoyed it so far, more than the Star Wars series of Lego games and I love Star Wars. The open world of Lego Marvel Super Heros just makes it the super hero game that everyones been asking for.			"

												This game has everything you'd expect from a normal Lego themed game ranging from the puzzling levels to the amount of collectables you can find in the game. I somewhat think some aspects of the game didn't need to be in this like flying vehicles as most of the heroes in the game could fly. This game is mostly a collect-a-thon so if this is your thing then this game is for you. This definitely was alot of fun playing none the less!			"

												If you are a fan of Lego games, then you're probably going to buy this game anyway.Of course, this game plays like every other Lego game, and features a crap tonne of unlockable characters among the other wealth of collectables. However, even with sometimes clunky and annoying controls, not to mention sometimes dodgy graphics, this game is still fun to play. I love how there is a huuuuuge amount of characters to unlock, even teaching me about new Marvel characters I have never heard of before. I never even knew there was a Squirrel Girl.... Then again, playing as my favourite superhero, Daredevil, was a lot of fun. Character animations are mostly slick and awesome, level design is creative and the open world aspect makes the game feel big, with lots of things to collect and locations to explore. Simply put, kids will love this, Marvel comic fans will probably enjoy this and Lego game fans will definitely love this well crafted game. The only downsides I have is that a lot of the side missions have awful level design, with me frequently running in circles wondering what the heck to do. Besides that, this game will give fans plenty of hours of fun.			"

												Best Lego game ever!  There is sooo much to do in this game.  I played co-op (which can be difficult at times but if you've played any lego games before in co-op you've already experienced the bad camera angles).  I love the main hub, it gives you the option to do your own thing for a while and is very open.  There are a lot of side missions, I mean A LOT.   The only con in this game is the previously mentioned camera angles in co-op, there are times when I can't even see my toon on the screen.  Either than that, excellent game play and I recommend playing with a friend!			"

												Lego games are pretty universally silly, slapstick, but with a fan's sort of affection to whatever the source material is, and Marvel follows suit. It's a Saturday Morning version of the Marvel Universe (with a definite eye towards the MCU), but it's the sort of Saturday Morning show you keep watching as an adult because it was always solid and didn't dip into the phoning-it-in, patronizing way some such shows do. The roster is solid, and being a fan of Agents of SHIELD I was thoroughly tickled to hear Clark Gregg showiong up as Agent Coulson to give game hints / prompts during play. It doesn't take itself seriously, but given the license it shouldn't. Gameplay is extremely easy with little to no penalty for death, but I still enjoy the ride and hunting for the various secrets and easter eggs. If that sounds good to you, then consider it Recommended.			"

I like that it is free roam around NYC, it has most of the Marvel heros that you know (but not Jessica Jones), its funny, the voices are well done, the levels are pretty cool, and to get 100% complete you will need to put in some serious hours.  The only lego game with more content is Lego star wars complete edition, but I still prefer Marvel because of the free roam factor.  Batman 2 is good too, but roaming lego NYC is cooler than lego Gotham IMHO.			"

												Enjoyable and initially very addicting, if on sale, suggest purchasing is a decent game. Downside, linear storyline and lack of variety in open world content decreases replay value .			"

												Pretty much as soon as I saw this game i wanted to buy it. The huge hub world of manhattan was one of the coolest things I have seen in a lego game and the amount of characters and little quick missions was enormous. As you can see I have a lot of hours playing this game and only about 5 of those are afk hours. (sometimes has a glitch where you quit but still runs) Those hours are put in to get 100% and all achievements. This is by far the largest and most polished lego game I have played. Playing everything from lego star wars 1 to lego pirates. Each game has their special touch that makes them a joy to play but this to me really has it all. The voice acting from lego LOTR is back and in this installment the voice acting is done in a way where it keeps much of the humor you have come to expect from a lego title but still the cutscenes are not quite as creative as lego star wars 1 and 2. Graphically this game looks amazing. Still no crysis 3 but in comparison to older titles this is by far the one that will make you say wow this looks like Manhattan. Bulidings have reflections and shadows and flying through New York or in a huge battle the game never drops below 30 fps (and my machine isnt too powerful). Instead of tying in with a movie this game creates a story of its own. The story is average I would say but the idea really brings all the villans you know and heroes you love together. As with every lego game there is a ton of collectibles and this game is no different. There are 250 gold bricks 11 deadpool red bricks (gotten from secret levels unlocked with gold bricks to get extras, cheats,) 150 minikits. There are also a ton of vehicles and characters, coming in at 115 characters including the different skins( I belive this is the number). This game is a great purchase even at 20 dollars. I think of it as i can buy a $1 app on ios and play it for an hour then throw it away, well i can pay $20 dollars and get 50 hours well ok that is a deal.Pros-------Huge hub world-Tons of characters-tons of collectibles-Good humor-Animations for characters are fantastic-Each character feels unique in combat and in the hub-Graphics are the best yet-Music is amazing-Stan Lee makes a ton of cameos (with a nice suprise if you help Stan all 50 times)-The story is fun and fits in with the marvel universe-Its a lego game of course its good-The hub world feels alive-Controller as always is great to play withCons---------Flying controls are a bit tricky to get a hold of and even after getting to 100% they still are hard-Voice acting takes a bit of the lego imagination out of the game-Spidey move very slow through new york (I always played as a flying character and not spidey :(...)-A few very tricky gold bricks due to a few confusing control schemes.-Keyboard controls are awful.BUY THIS GAME ITS SO GREAT!!!!!!!

												I bought this game on sale for $4.99, because I fell in love with Lego Star Wars II, and always wanted another Lego game. It did not disappoint, with the same level of thinking skills required to get through levels. However, checkpoint saving does not work well, sometimes characters get stuck into death traps, respawning and dying instantly, and the camera is horrible. Trying to select a character with many different ""costumes"" such as Iron Man requires a waiting time, and it would be good if I could cycle it with the arrow keys. However, I still love this game, with the free roam being very well desigined, having races, unlockables and side-missions well spread-out around the city. Despite requiring lots of patience in the free roam, the action in this game is undeniably awesome, and feels like a harmless version of GTA.Can Hulk Smash. 10/10.			"

												Lego Marvel Superheroes is the best Lego game ever. It's the only Lego game that I've felt the need to play around in the open world for reasons other than getting 100%. There are so many character types I didn't expect, like Magnetos ability to do thing telecenetic characters can't. The only two problems are:1. The controls for flying characters suck2. Every character makes a fool out of there self, the only one that isn't different from there normal self is my favourite character, Deadpool9/10			"

												Comparing to other LEGO videogames, the core gameplay remains the same, which is a good thing. But what makes this one of the best LEGO videogames is that it not only provides plenty of MARVEL content, but also adds an open-world environment to have fun between missions, with plenty of content. It almost feels like LEGO Grand Theft Auto. There's a lot of characters, but the story focuses on The Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men and Spider-man, and the main villains. The story is nothing special, but accomplishes it's job. There are also 11 bonus, short missions that allows other characters to show, like Deadpool and Ghost Rider. And there's really a lot to do here to get 100%. My only complain here is, besides the occasional glitches, that the flight controls are a bit rough to use. And there's a decent voice casting and awesome music. If you could only pick one LEGO vidoegame to play, you couldn't be wrong with this one.			"

												First and foremost, let me say this. Out of all the games I purchased and played with my daughters this is the first one they have actually wanted to complete. Not just complete, but they almost found every single secret.What made this game so much fun? Well, the open world enviroment was a huge plus. Imagine GTA with Lego character and super heroes. You don't even have to do the storyline quests in order to have fun in this game! That is saying a lot for replay value. The variety of characters is impressive and because the storyline pulls from all areas of the Marvel universe there is lots of 'what is going to happen next' moments to keep you playing over and over. The comedy value in the game is actually spot on. It strikes the perfect balance between being corny and whimsical yet serious at the right moments.I won't spoil the storyline but frankly, it is simple. However, the characters themselves are what make it enjoyable. That is surprizing considering this is a parody on every Marvel character ever. If you have to pick up a Lego title for your kids then this is a must. Adults will have limited enjoyment from it though. "

I really enjoyed playing around in the open world new york city. There is so much to do and explore!! And the cut scenes are gut splitting hilarius. My fave part of the game by far though was being able to play as LOKI after beating the main story line. I HIGHLY RECOMEND this game to any one who likes marvel or legos.  "

												This game is awesome.You will get more than 50 hours of fun for cheap.There is a lot of playable characters from Marvel, all the ones you might think about are in this game...Well except for some characters from the X-men universe. eg. Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch. I mean event the Deadpool is here, so why so many mutants aren't ? Talking of Deadpool, there are easter eggs about him every 5 minutes and it's kind of stupid. Shiklah, Cable, Rogue and a lot of his allies aren't even in the game, so why insist so much on his presence? I realy like the ""mutant"" part of the Marvel universe so it bothered me a bit.But anyway, this game is realy great. I'm having a lot of fun playing it.However: DON'T buy this game if you don't like BOTH Marvel and Lego. You would miss 90% of the humor and the game would probably♥♥♥♥♥♥you off after 3 hours.			"

												Coming from someone who's really a Marvel fan through the Cinematic Universe, it's awesome to have all the heroes available without such pesky things as licensing rights. The second level for example, features Mr. Fantastic, Captain America, and Spider-Man.LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is a great LEGO game, creating an original plotline requiring the help of all the major Marvel heroes (plus you can unlock some minor ones in side-quests like Ghost Rider and Moon Knight), going against villains like Doctor Octopus, Loki, Doctor Doom, and MODOK. Even when you're not going and re-going through all the levels for minikits (which create a comic book page when completed), you have a huge Manhattan hub world, where you can do side-quests, do vehicle races (note: the Hawkeye's Skycycle and Spider-buggy races don't give out Gold Bricks), and unlock new characters and vehicles (though the number of flying characters, including Iron Man whom you start with, make the air vehicles redundant). I do love the Cloud Rider, it's like a pink and blue light cycle.Also, like the MCU, Stan Lee just has to cameo, so you have to rescue him in every level, plus some 24 more times around Manhattan, and naturally, he's voiced by Stan Lee himself.Great game, whether you're a comic book enthusiast or a casual fan of superheroes. One of the best LEGO games I've played too.			"
