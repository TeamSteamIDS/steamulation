Early Access Review
								The Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased. With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the gamePROS:-Open world sandbox survival done rightWhen I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games. I was wrong, thankfully. In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are. Want to eat but your food reserves are low? Too bad! There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment. The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you. It's like the EPA, but they're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and want to eat you. The cannibals will hound you day and night, and they're crafty little things. They will gang up on you from all sides. Just when you thnk they've left and it's safe to kill that lizard that's been running from you for a week, they come out of nowhere and start beating you down.-The story is actually amazingYou'd think that they would just make occasional tweaks to the AI to make them better at killing you, and that's it. But nope, the developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story (and it makes sense!). There's bits of lore to find everywhere. From caves, to boats, and sometimes just on the ground in select places. The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there. The games ending is just great as well. It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the game, but you know what the awesome part is? The ending is not an easy thing to get to! Why is that? Well I'll address it in my next point.-CavesI have a love hate relationship with caves. Caves are always scary, and it doesn't matter how much I've explored them. I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know I've cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT. There's an eerie feeling about the caves, because they're not just caves; they're breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals. There's noises that you think are cannibles breating, when in reality it's just sounds from the cave itself. Creaking, rocks falling, the occasional maniacle laughter. Oh wait that one is the cannibals, who are likely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that you're invading their home. These caves are also pitch black, did I mention that? you need to bring a torch, or 12. I mean, you really shouldn't go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe. Nah just kidding. You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayers, and you'll probably get eaten just the same. You know what really sucks though? All the best gear (and gear you need to beat the game) is located in the various cave systems.-Co-op modeCo-op is actually really good. You would expect it to be a glitchy, buggy mess (it's mostly not). The game is still terrifying and immersive, but now you're able to play it with friends! The scaries part of co-op isn't the cannibals though. It's guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegic.CONS:-The AI seems to have very poor problem solving skills at timesWhile smacking the occasional turtle and using his remains to collect water, some cannibals might show up to fight you. This isn't a problem when you have traps though! You know what is a problem? The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps. GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled. He then decides that it's an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did. It's not as bad now as it used to be in prior patches, but they still do stupid stuff like this.-Weird ropes sometimes cause death fallsSometimes when using climbing ropes, the game decides that you'd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies. It doesn't happen often, and has only affected me in Co-op games thus far, but it's still a massive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(or legs, as it were).I don't have anything else major that comes to mind. The Forest is an excellent game that, in my opinion, is an absolute steal at $15. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen. It is almost perfect, but missed the margin of perfection by just a hair. If you don't yet own the game, I would encourage you to get it. It's great by yourself and even better with friends.			"

								Journal Entry 1 After crash landing I have gathered all resources at the plane, walked a short distance from the crash and found a nice hill to build fire and setup camp. Journal Entry 2 I went down to the beach and started fishing, found lots of beer bottles in the sand, I even found a tent pitched on the beach... where is everyone?? Journal Entry 3 While setting up camp I saw a group of 3 tribesmen doing a beach patrol in the area where I was fishing, I didn't engage only observed them. Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone. I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter. I'm going to the woods to collect some logs.Journal Entry 4 While heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought. They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors.Journal Entry 5 After observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away. She did not attack... perhaps they are a friendly people after all! Journal Entry 6 I should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe.... I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death). Journal Entry 7 I have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave.... this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon.... Thank you... Endnight games.			"

								WOW!!!Got out of the plane and ran away as quickly as I could(first time I played they attacked the plane like 3 minutes in the game) So I figured they were attracted by the crash. Found a quiet place, I built a shelter and made a fire. Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous. Went to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them. I built one statue with their heads and legs.Later in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away. They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more. I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me. I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way. I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me.I tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me. Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit. I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me. Then went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health. Got cold. I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree. She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me.Finally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey!!! I can see her tities''.I survived 2 days.This game has a lot of bugs, they still have a ton of work to do on this game. But if you are not the kind of person that expect a finished game when you play an early release, you know this game is going to be great. Keep supporting it, make your friends play it and this could be without a doubt the best survival game ever.			"

								This game has oodles of potential. Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals. Makes you feel like a celebrity.Depending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour. Get it now. It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws. Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.. of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.. think of it as hurdles.. But everything looks pretty so that's okay. If you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed.The Forest:Day 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.I awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell ""SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event. Exiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. ♥♥♥♥ yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of♥♥♥♥♥♥and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight. I keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites! Day 2-4:Not only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that♥♥♥♥♥♥I have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.Day 5:Walls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.It's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.on my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now. *TO BE CONTINUED*			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Looks like the reviews that were on top that shouldn't have been are now downvoted. Thank you everyone for supporting good reviews and motivating the few that do so to continue making quality reviews!***THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA. This review and the final game are subject to change**Main Menu & Optionshttp://imgur.com/a/DqypyThe Forest is a unique survival game that pits the player against a bunch of mutants in a forest. Chopping down trees, foraging food and staying warm are just some of the survival aspects that can be found within this game. [4.5/5] Gameplay - For an early access game, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to building. It's interesting to note that every plane crash/new game puts you in a different location, at a different time of hour. I found pleasure in cutting down the trees in the game, as well as carving off the flesh of animals and wearing it as armour. The backpack system is pretty neat, especially how it's laid out. What's interesting is how you can get infected from having blood on your body, and needing to wash it off. I thought that was a pretty neat feature. Stealth actually works if you aren't already seen, and I've snuck up on my fair share of mutants and initiating....[3.5/5] Combat - NO, there are no conventional guns (only a flare gun) and never will be (although bows are something that might be implemented I hope). I can see how that would ruin gameplay. Now that's out of the way, I feel as though this could be improved or at least more forgiving. It takes a considerable amount of hits to kill each one, so it's best to tackle one at a time or run if there's a group. The mutants are pretty aggressive when in close proximity, and god forbit you attack one and more will come. Whether or not this is a feature or a bug is beyond me, but in it's current state I can say it's not as fleshed out as I would have thought. In addition, blocking is not implemented, or if it is I don't know what the controls are because...[3.5/5] Controls - Are not shown anywhere! Yeah this game doesn't hold your hand (which is great, but at the very least provide a control scheme or something!) I checked the options menu as well as the in-game survival guide for instructions but to no avail. Hopefully they do patch this into the game, and I will update the review accordingly. From what I've deduced from button mashing and relying on other games for a template, the controls are pretty accessible. In the future I wouldn't mind rebinding them however. On the forums, I hear of mouse input going awry or latency issues, but I haven't experienced any as of yet so I cannot comment on that. What I can comment on though is the...[4.5/5] AI - Which I might say is very polished. I didn't expect much from the alpha, but everything the developers said about them was true. Sadly I haven't seen any mutants other than the naked female/male and tribes ones, no ""ugly mofos"" as of yet (probably due to a distinct fear of delving into these caverns). They travel in pairs, attack/go toward manmade structures, climb trees (which freaked the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me at first, pardon my French). If you get close, they will aggro and may call for reinforcements. They WILL watch you from afar, they WILL hide in tall grass. And god forbid, you will most certainly die if you don't hide from them. Vulnerability is key, which leads to...[4/5] Immersion - This is a survival horror game. You can survive, and it has spooky elements that makes it a horror game. One minute you're building a base and nightfall comes, the next you hear sounds of leaves crunching around you. Night time really does shine in the sense that you truly feel more alone. What does fail to bring me to more of a heightened experience is the lack of ability to toggle/remove the HUD. I wanted to be able to feel like it was first person, not like Dead Island. Another issue at the moment is clipping through some objects in the world, but that's more focused on the...[4.5/5] Map - It's big, even for the ""little area"" they confine you to in the Alpha. Jesus, I feel like I've only seen 1/3-1/4 of it, because I hear people talking about there being an ocean they're living on but I've hauled my♥♥♥♥♥through the woods only to find berries and potential death from mutants. Map design wise, it really feels like a forest. Extensively, the cave systems are really fleshed out, and light sources work beautifully within. There are bugs in the ground and rocks where you can fall/clip through, but it's not game-breaking unless you are intentionally clipping through them. Especially if you spend your time noticing the...[5/5] Graphics - For a four-person team (2-3 programmers, 1-2 artists), the attention to detail really shines. Day/night, lighting, shadows, even the flora/fauna are amazing. It really goes to show how much effort they've put into it, and how much it will in the long run. Not only this but damn, the...[4.5/5] Audio - Perfectly orchestrated in most areas. I say most because there are some issues such as the intro scene not synchronising with the cinematic. You really have to play for a few hours to not develop anxiety issues, trying to differentiate between mutants footsteps and animals scurrying on the floor. I have to give my applause to Endnight Games for making me yell ""whatthe♥♥♥♥"" at my screen every once in a while. What I DON'T like are the chimes when a tree breaks into chunks of logs, that doesn't feel right. I also believe a bit more ambience might be necessary, whether it's wind or chirping or something else.[NA/5] Developers - I don't want to rate this category as it's not relative to the gameplay or other attributes. EndNight Games have been developing this game for years now, and this release was worth the wait. Deducing from Q&A, feedback and input from developers, you can tell this studio really cares both about the consumer base and the game. I feel as though they are handling complaints and bugs very well, and have already stated bug fixing has commenced, with a patch out very soon! I always purchase early access games for reasons both in receiving continuous content updates to games for fresher experiences, and for determining whether the game will succeed or otherwise. This is one of the fewer rather than latter from what I've gathered.Final verdict: If you were expecting a polished game with little to no bugs and fleshed out AI, you thought wrong. And if you purchased it and complain (read:whine in an entitled sense) about this, you have the right to be ridiculed. The game promises on what it currently delivers, and although the game is riddled with bugs, you get what you pay for, and then some over the course of the game. If you understand what ""early access"" is, and have faith in the developers, I can safely say that $15 now will be a worthy investment (for both parties involved). However, if you don't want to deal with bugs, provide feedback and travel this journey from early access to full release, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Although the game is very much playable, do not feel obliged to give up 15 dollars, because for some people that's a lot, and you want to get value for money from it, which is understandable.I give the game 4.25/5, based on what I think of all the categories combined. I will leave the review in a recommended state because most people are deterred from reading/looking into a game if it has even 1-2 not recommended reviews. This game at least deserves some recognition, don't you?			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore. This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. The AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. Beyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you♥♥♥♥♥♥the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.How the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You’re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.Multiplayer is significantly less “scary” but if you wanted to build massive bases it’s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It’s a lot of fun playing with friends and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn’t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. I know this “review” was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they’ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually.  "

								How many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours? That's right. But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, ""Yeah, its ok i guess,"" hinting at their 10000 hours. Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context. So, I bought this game around v0.03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus. Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0.29. That was when I added 80 hours to my game time.I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect. I have enjoyed every last bit. I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0.31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review.Pros-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion. I mean like 520x420. But that is an extreme.-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer.-The building system is very flexable. There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like.-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game. Ever.-It's fifteen f*cking dollars! FOR ALL OF THIS!?-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added. (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money.)-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, ""Your in big trouble,"" and kicks you from game. That legitimately happened before I wrote this review. Srsly. Give me a reason.-Multitude of collectable items.-Interesting lore, or so I think. There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself. I could be way wrong. Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story.-Devs are fantabulous. Thats not a word.Cons-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired.-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6.7 [Like that pun :3= ?] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, ""This is my lemon!""-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole. So don't rush to get in there.-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item. It is always the same. The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect. The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management. It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones. Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list.-Want an axe for a weapon! No... well, tough luck. Katana is a bit later game so...-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game. The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=Lore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss. These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico. This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula. The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala. The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans. This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep. Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits. As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants. Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared. As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide. As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment. After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of bermuda triangle. In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region. They lost thier son and looked for him. It is assumed he was eaten. The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation. The final parent is gone without trace. The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals. A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake. James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest. The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring.Like this review so others can see and revise my theories. Farewell dear walri.			"

Early Access Review
								This is seriously a real gem. Now, I don't usually like horror games/films/anything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly. That being said, my husband bought this game and I watched him play it. I was scared to death, but the more I watched the more I just couldn't keep my fingers off of it!But to the point. Here are some pros and cons, but keep in mind that it is an alpha game.Pros:- Stunning graphics and environment. I was absolutely blown away, and I still am.- Very real environment with wildlife offering food and crafting materials, nice weather and sound effects and more.- The cannibals are an amazing and unique enemy. A breath of fresh air from zombies (which I am not very fond of). They are clever and tactical as well as primitive, and I am completely terrified of them! They have very smooth, elegant and agile movements, and they can be very sneaky. Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructions!- While the environment is beautiful, you constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundings, whether it's movement in the distance, a shadow, a rustling of leaves or other sounds.- The crafting system is lovely. You can spend a lot of time creating a nice base, and the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added. Custom building can be slightly buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it and add to it.- The game has a creative mode. I've seen a few people requesting this, probably not knowing that it already exists. At the start screen, simply type ""veganmode"" and you will not see any cannibals at all. This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building. You may also type ""vegetarianmode"", if you wish for the cannibals to only be out at night, giving you a breathing space during the day. This is very lovely.- The co-op version is a bunch of fun. It's a great experience to share with your friends - although you must beware that the co-op version is currently very buggy and laggy.- Last but not least it really feels like the developers want to make this a top notch game for the final release. They regularly fix bugs while also adding new content like crafting and new places to explore.Cons:- I mentioned the co-op in pros, but as I also briefly said, it is very very buggy and laggy. Hopefully they will fix it, which I feel confident that they will. Also, you should note that there are currently saving problems with co-op. The host can save the game while in multiplayer, but your co-player won't be able to join the game again after quitting. The host can continue the game in solo mode, but not with friends. This is a shame. I very much hope they will fix this soon. [EDIT: I just managed to re-join a game that my husband had hosted earlier, so maybe it is possible. However, I started back in the airplane each time I rejoined. Either way, I'm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventually.]- Buggy, glitchy, blah blah. It's alpha, it's to be expected. I don't think there are any game breaking bugs or glitches, though. If something is bugged, I haven't experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the game.- Currently you might be running out of content a little quickly. I believe they are working on making more content for the game. The boy from the plane who I believe must be the survivor's son is not currently to be found anywhere as far as I can tell from what I've seen and read. I would think they are working on making it a goal to find and rescue him from the cannibals, which would give the game some more sense of purpose. For now, it's just, scavenge, build, eat, drink, fight - survive. But I enjoy that :)- The map is the same everytime you start a new game (although you crash in different places, and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places). I don't necessarily dislike this, even though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting. However, I do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger. If they don't you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quickly, and then there won't be much exploring left to do. Making the island itself bigger would work, but making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome. I have high hopes, but we'll see what the devs have in store for us. :)- While the developers seem to be doing a magnificent job with regular updates, the game still seems to be far off beta. I am not sure how long we will have to wait. However long it is, though, I am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect. Keep up the good work, devs, you are doing so well!I don't know if I covered everything, but this is all I can think of for now. I may update my review as more additions are made to the game. Overall, The Forest is a keeper. 10/10 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not. I would highly recommend anyone who like survival/sandbox/horror games to buy this game - also during early access. The devs are clearly putting the money to good use, so I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage. In fact, I was very surprised at how cheap it is. It almost feels like I robbed them!Once again. 10/10, Buy it. Now.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: This game is intense and rewarding for smart playstyle, even in Alpha. Great Dev support as well.======I woke in a broken plane, only to scavange what was left because I was hungry and hurt. Popped a few pills and jumped out of the plane's hull before seeing scattered suitcases everywhere. Each one of them seemed locked, but my trusty axe I found made quick work of them. Found tennis balls in a few, didn't know Roger Federer was onboard. Must of been in first class. Being the Natural hunter I was, I beat Lizards and a few bunnies to death with a makeshift club I wrapped in cloth. Skinned them and saved their meat for later. Slapping the freshly carved Lizard's skin on like armor as a sick man I am, I continued to kill its bretheren until I was covered with their protective armor. I dipped myself in a fresh found pool of water near a large tree I couldn't cut. Oddly, I found a makeshift spear inside. Mine. Totally took that♥♥♥♥♥♥ And then I was met with a shriek off in the distance. Wolfs? Cyotes? Roise O'Donald? Either way, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as night started to fall.Fast forward a day, after finding a large cliff side with one walkway from behind me for anything to sneak up, so I decide to build a defensive wall to close it off. I take to the nearby forest with a newly made log sled to transport trees back to my new base. A fire pit and Hunters shelter is made. I stow away rocks and sticks I have in excess there incase I need to build anything else. I light up the fire pit and cook a bunny on it, eating it before I huddled up in my shelter for the night. I woke in the night, only to be met with two sets of beady eyes glistening across my fire pit in the darkness. I pull my axe out in hand, hearing them hiss. Humans? They looked the part, but said nothing to me. One cries out as it dashes for me, I raise the axe and block his advance. I chop the axe into this crazed man, beating him back a few times until he fell to the ground. His friend hissed at me and ran on all fours away into the woods. What the ♥♥♥♥ did I just kill, Smeagol? Fast forward about three more days, I have my rear and front defensive walls built out from the steep cliff side to the oceans waters, only one way in. Its safter to light fires at night now and sleep, since the locals seem afraid of this place. I set out on foot, spear in hand and covered in mud and deer hides to keep me warm. I had to find their village. After evading a few patrols of the locals, I stumbled into three huts and what looks like to be a large den. Looking into said den after ghosting around the town to make sure no one is there, I enter to only find a noose to greet me. And another man hanging. I cut the rope to use to my gains. I quickly pull a stick together with cloth and rope to make me a shortbow. And all those ♥♥♥♥ing feathers, now into arrows. Seriously, I had about two hundred of them. Making a few I test fire the bow. We're good to go. The srieks come back in the distance, I bolt back home. Day... I don't even know. Sun has come and gone so many times now. Traps lingering in the forest just ouside. Effigies planted about fifty yards out from the front of my gates, only to be mimicked the same way by the locals across the way. They want to show their territory. I disobey. Covered in my lizard armor and deer pelts, I stalk upon a patrol not far from my home. I wait until two break off from the group, while I keep my watchful eye on them from the hilltop bushes. Bow in my hand. The two stop near a pool. I pull tension on my bows string, lining up a shot. Release. Arrow pegs the local in the head and drops. His friend panics, only to be met with me, silently springing from the bushes with spear. His limp body drops into the pool of water. I make effigies of their corpses. War rages on and I begin hunting at night. Traps litter segments around the forest closest to my home. I draw them out of hiding with a simple fire. I wait. I watch. They come. Throwing a rock their way grabs their attention, turning towards me. I shoot a arrow at the leader of this five man pack. All hell breaks loose. I slink my way down hill side in the darkness, as they follow close behind. I slip past two traps. One of the locals gets hung up in my noose trap, as two more grouped together and get impaled on my spike trap. Leader and croney is left. I peg the leader two more times with arrows until he drops. Small one begins to run. I draw my bow, having a clear shot. I don't take the shot. I let him run. Let him tell the others that I will not be hunted so easily. In this forest, you either die as the hunted, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hunter.10/10 - Would Crash Again. ---------------------------------------(( Serious number: 9/10 )) Game is in /alpha/ and already this intense. I was thinking 8.5/10, but for the $15 I spent on it? And its only getting better every day with constant updates and helpful feedback from the devs? No. It deserves the 9. And it can only really go up from there. Cannot wait to see final product and additions made.			"

Early Access Review
								Day 1:I've crash landed on a strange island. Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.Day 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.Day 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.Day 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.Day 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.Day 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.Day 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.Day 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.Day 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?Day 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.Day 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.Day 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.Day 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out ""YMCA"". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...Day 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.10/10 would decend into madness again.UPDATE: Day 184: I Currently have a stronghold of death. Rock walls the size of trees. Mountains of bodies connected to effigies. Traps inside every wall. I don't know where these animals are coming from but they seem to be endless. There has to be a source. I've killed more than I can possibly count. More than this island seems to be able to support, yet they keep coming.I found a strange door exploring one of the caves. It has a keycard slot. Maybe I'll find my answers there.Whatever is inside, I'll bet its limbs taste delicious.			"

								The game starts out normal...plane crash, naked guy steals your son, then you are in the woods. But after reading some of the reviews I noticed my playthrough was much different than everyone elses.I started by drinking bottle of...something. Then I noticed it was beer. Walked outside and immediately started to chase a rabbit for food. Ran away. Saw naked woman on beach watching the ocean, thought it was cute, turned around, and another naked woman appears. She pounced on my face and I killed her with my little boy axe. Focused attention on gathering twigs and leaves for a fire and shelter.Night approached and I had a fire and a little shelter on a tiny hill by the beach with a good view of the forest. Started to cook food and build the fire up when a patrol of naked dudes started to walk pass my camp. I crouched, and they walked passed. Shortly after a stray naked dude was walking towards my camp, he liked my fire. As he got closer I noticed flashes of lights coming from the woods and saw a group of naked gangsters running towards my camp, but instead they gang-banged the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the stray naked dude and ate him. I watched in awe until they spotted me and smacked me upside the head with a rock. Woke up in a cave and saw a man sleeping while standing up. Sneaked up behind him with a rock and he instantly turned around and sucker punched me in the dome piece. DAYS SURVIVED = ZERO10/10 would not survive again			"

								Being a mid 20s male who doesn't really get scared of movies or other similar things, I thought this would be the perfect game. Like a grownup Minecraft, but with nice graphics. Boy was I wrong.I'll never forget my first encounter with the cannibal tribe. I was out checking the wonderful graphics, looking for loot, setting up shelter, minding my own business when I heard that scream/laugh... I'll never forget it. I turned and saw him staring at me and for the first time in my life, I was having a miniature heart attack from a video game. I ran to my cabin but was shaking so badly that I couldn't use my mouse to direct my guy to safety. I played for a few more hours then went to bed.That night I had nightmares about the cannibals. Waking up my wife repeatedly (10+ times) after dreaming about them. I see shadows at work and panic briefly. Never has a game affected me in such a way and I would recommend it to anyone.10/10 would get PTSD again.			"

I myself am sick to death of freakin Zombie.  why not Bears, Tigers, or just old fashion bad guys.   Maybe killing fictional zombies in a game is better than killing human characters.  At least give the zombies a sense of humor. All and all I love this game.			"

								Pros:Immersive GameplayHigh Quality GraphicsGreat Crafting SystemRealistic Resource GatheringCons:NoneIt is an alpha game so there are bugs.But I don't care the game is still amazing.About 7 months ago i saw this game on steam. Without realizing it I made a huge mistake, ""I'm not going to buy The Forest.♥♥♥♥♥♥looks lame. I'm going to go play Dayz and Rust"" I said reluctantly. Well as the days went on I kept seeing over and over again in steam store calling to me with a vicious whisper. As I continued on with my regular day after day routine of ignoring that The Forest was even there, I stumpled upon something. It was a User review from another steam player who had played for less than an hour. He stated that ""Who would play a game where you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants every 5 minutes and you can't do anything because of getting attacked by cannibals."" All of the sudden Jason DeRulo's Talk Dirty started playing.(Hate that song btw) Even though all signs in the universe point to purchasing it, I say Nay once again, and then as if god reached down and touched my computer moments later The Forest went on sale. So I said ""ok if I buy this and it sucks i will never buy another OW Survival Horror game again. Now it has been  approximately 1.5 weeks and I am 80 hours and 10 pairs of soiled underwear in and I don't think I could be happier. This game is so AMAZING that even with all the bugs and glitches it is still an amazing game. Awesome graphic quality, highly immersive gameplay, intense atmosphere all the things I look for in a great game. The Dev team should be proud of themselves for they are producing one of the greatest games I have ever played. Good Job And Godspeed to you devs at Endnight.			"

								With over 800hrs of gameplay with The Forest, having played before the island's were really opened up, the mountain area accessable, and before there was a giant hole, I must say this game has come a long way. What I find best about the gam is that the developers are always working on it, even in smaller ways. I have seen many interesting early release games get abandoned by the devs in charge of it, The Forest is not one of them. It has a steep learning curve but that is part of the fun. This game is still in development and has a way to go til it is ""complete"", but I have high hopes for the crew as they continue developing the game.			"

								I felt I could finally write a review after almost a year hiatus to allow The Forest to develope.  Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Crafting system (Somewhat complex & engaging)-Great building system-Multiplayer/Co-op-Great game environment (cave exploration, abandoned campsites, etc.)-Variety of enemies-Hunger/thirst system-Size of game worldCons:-Enemies:  Mutants (cannibals) serve as the antagonists of The Forest.  They are curious, fierce, and unrelenting.  While combat is tough and fun, the occurance of the mutants I feel is too high right now.  I find now you have to hurry even more than in previous versions to establish a fortified base.  Have had to restart several games after being swarmed within the first two days.-Multiplayer:  Another pro that is also a con.  Multiplayer has come a significant way since fall of 2014.  Back then multiplayer was practically unplayable.  Now, multiplayer adventures are fun yet there still exist syncronicity issues with host and client.  Still enjoiyable, but has some kinks to iron out.-General Early Access bits:  Some annoying glitches and crashes still exist, and The Forest still needs to be fully optimized.  Overall, The Forest is a great game to play alone or with others.  A year ago I would not recommend The Forest, but would adivse prospective buyers to wait.  However, the game has made huge hauls and now I do recommend The Forest.8.5/10 as of v0.28			"

								Paranoid Lumberjack Simulator 2015:That being said, I only really recommend this game to be played in co-op. The game gets rather bland for me in single-player mode, and it's all ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles until you or your friend gets their♥♥♥♥♥whooped by some naked guy with a club.I also don't recommend this game for the easily frustrated. When you die, you lose most of your items, and all of that hard work you did gathering and crafting materials are flushed down the drain (like your dreams). And please, don't come in expecting your character to have the strength and endurance of Batman. Because he'll die. Very many times. And his hunger (and hydration) bar depletes faster than that of a Sim.It's not your average hack-and-slash-everything-to-survive game, either. The Forest has implemented impressive and dynamic AI. The cannibals (the primary antagonists) have emotions, morals, religions, etc., and they come from different families and tribes. How one tribe of cannibals react to you will vary from another tribe; some will avoid you out of fear, some will come after you out of anger (for killing members). They change their patterns to accommodate you, and they utilize different strategies and members of their tribe to take you down. It all depends on how you choose to interact with the environment and the AI you encounter.If you're looking for a decent, somewhat stressful survival game without the massive multiplayer feel of Day-Z and Rust, The Forest is for you. The game manages to keep you on your toes without it ever feeling too safe or too easy.Arrive in the forest. Thrive in the forest. Survive the forest.9/10			"

								First impression of the game was terrifying. Me and my friend started a coop game and frantically scrambled for supplies before night time. We were too late. I ran out of energy so we built a bench for me to rest on, as I sat there regaining my stamina, we realized that we were no longer alone. 2 Tribal parties stumbled upon our camp just as night fell. Considering we were so close to their camp, they came to investigate. Terror and regret filled my bones. As the damp rain soaked our skin, we struggled agaisnt the horde. They overran us, and we died. 10/10 for amazing atmosphere/satisfying crafting.			"

""Basically Don't Starve/Rust if it was Rated 18+ Explicit, had stunningly beautiful, realistic visuals and sp00py as ♥♥♥♥.  No joke, this game is genuinely terrifying; especially on your first playthrough in Singleplayer.""  You can turn off the enemies in the game by typing ' veganmode ' upon entering the main menu and turn them back on by typing ' meatmode '. I love survival games and this is probably currently one of the best games of its kind ever made (no exaggeration) - and it's still in development.  Of course there are glitches and bugs here and there (like most open-world sandbox games commonly do), but it doesn't take away the fact that this is such a great, in-depth and intricate game in terms of crafting and exploring, yet simple/straightforward enough that you don't feel overwhelmed and turned off by overly-complicated recipes.You can make your own base (fully customizable), go swimming in the ocean, make a treehouse, hunt animals and acquire pretty neat weapons and special equipment (via super secret locations!) to help aid you and survive the unforgiving climate, ALL WHILE TRYING TO FEND OFF THE BLOODTHIRSTY LOCALS WANTING YOUR HEAD AND SKIN ON A STICK. Note; all of this gets better and way more funnier with people you know (called friends).Graphics: 8.5/10  Fantastically creepy textures and shadow effects, the overall look of the environment will constantly keep you paranoid, whether it be night or day... majestic sunsets and eerie midnight skies are a pleasure to gaze at. Audio: 8.5/10 The sounds in this game is definitely what makes it truly breath-holding and unsettling.  You can hear the cannibals breathing and snickering outside your base, stalking your every move.  The howling wind will send a chill down your spine, the dripping noise of water in caves are unnerving... Gameplay/Mechanics: 8/10 Overall, this game plays out just like any other Survival genre type game out there; some animations may seem clunky at times, but it is to be expected.  The enemies move very erratically and glitchy, whether that is on purpose or not is what makes them so damn creepy. Crafting guide is laid out in a book, where you can look up different things by pressing 'B', but actually creating/upgrading items takes place in your inventory 'I' .  Overall very clear and easy-to-read, says which required materials you'll need. Combat is fairly simple, you can block most of the enemies' attacks by holding right-click, with some boss mobs being an exception, obviously.  Ranged projectile-based weapons have poor physics though, and most are fairly inaccurate. A deserved 8.3/8.5/10 imo! "

								I was waiting to write this as I dislike leaving reviews on unfished games, however I feel I should review this one slightly.In a mass of survival open world crafting games it's hard to stand out.  The Forest barely does this, however there is just something about it that keeps me coming back.  Don't get me wrong here, it doesn't stand too far from most of those games, but in the key areas it does stand out on, are the area that are simply the most important.The key point as to why I am recommending this ---> CONSTANT updates with content and bug fixes.  This is huge for an Early Access game.  It went from being a nifty OKish single player adventure game, to an amzing co-op survival open world game in a mere 6 month span.  Content constantly get's added, AI re-worked(which is interestingly impressive as is), new crafting recipes, parts of the Island reworked are all updates that come out in regular intervals.I won't go into the game details other than that the game is actually very fun to play.  I highly recommend this title, even if you are skirmish about Early Access titles, this one is in a good, fun, playable state to try out and feel as  if you have had a full gaming experience.I would also like to add, make sure you pick up two copies because multiplayer is a must!

								The Forest, first off, is the most stunning looking, graphically intense indie game i have ever seen, it rivals triple-A titles and even beat them, in terms of graphics, animations, and just pure gameplay. The game does its job as a survival horror game, you collect materials such as woods, leafs, stones..etc, and food and water from the remains of the crashed airplane you come from, or by hunting animals (which really feels great killing them, i know I'm a bad person) . the horror aspect of the game is no joke, filled with blood and gore, crazy humanoid primitive creatures out to kill and eat you, and the game doesn't go easy on you, if they're coming after you, you're most likely dead.

			The Forest is a first person open world survival horror game where you can stab fishes and kill rabbits. More info at: http://bit.ly/1psgZJF ~Twitter: http://Twitter.com/KSalue ~TS3IP:...		

The bad about the game that in the begging is really hard to survive as it doesn't give you a chance to make a good shelter for yourself, but that will probably change over time. The baseline is, the game is great and is worth the asking price and more.Will update the review as i play more of itSo far the game plays great, and now they released the save fix, go nuts and buy this game. Just remember though, it's still early access / alpha so there will be bugs and possibily frustrating moments, if you can't hand that then don't buy it, but if you can and will be supportive and report bugs and concerns, tehn buy it.More info here: KSalue[www.ksalue.com] "

								My current favorite amidst the current pile of survival horror open world games.  Tons of potential, and playable with a ceiling right now in single player, but like most of this genre's early access titles, it depends where they go from here.  Seems like a great team is behind this though.They just released multiplayer, which as you can imagine, requires a LOT of adjustment to code.  But you can easily see the potential here once its fully implemented.  For those that are considering this for multiplayer as of Jan 7th 2015:-Players that are not the game's host cannot save their progress (each time the game is launched they will lose all inventory/upgrades)-As the host of my multiplayer instance, I can pull an unlimited amount of logs/sticks/rocks from holders after a save.-loot is not shared (only you can loot what you see on the ground, you cannot give food/items to another player)And some Pros that make this game standout from the rest of the genre:Environment:  The graphics and atmosphere are actually amazing.  The Forest is beautiful and alive during the day, and perfectly creepy and unsettling at night.Balance:While this is preference-based, I appreciated the balance balance between resource gathering, building, hunting, and combat.  The right mix leads to a sensation that you are not only surviving, but constantly building towards thriving.  Its setup perfectly for multiplayer assuming they work out shared items.  (We had 2 players chopping down trees, and 2 running log carts back to the base, and we felt all effecient about it!)Potential:My favorite review of this game is easily ""Bad Parent Simulator 2014"" (c: Barry Scott)  At the beginning of the game, you hazily watch your son being taken from you by a cannibal.  The story ends there at the moment.  All it would take is one good writer to add a rediculous amount of substance to the single-player, and possibly mutliplayer as well.  In conclusion, this team has so much of the difficult aspects of the game complete.  From the graphics, mechanics, overall environment creation, and its easy to see that with just a little more love, at worst, this will be a must-own for the genre, at best, a trendsetter and genre-defining.

								Day 1: Me and two friends look for a suitable place to set up camp. Set up treehouse. Day 2: All is well! We have a few traps and are starting a garden up. Day 3: While hanging out on our balcony we observe two strange creatures run through our camp. Could they be sasquatch?Day 4: Creature entered camp during daylight. Was not sasquatch. We hacked it to death.Day 5: Some strange shrieks were heard in the forest. Perhaps it is some sasquatch mating ritual. Day 6: Found a weird and slightly creepy piece of abstract art on the edge of camp. There must be hippies nearby trying to be friendly. They're so 1968. Day 7: Hippie neighbors came to say hi. Were not really hippies and tried to kill us. We killed them first. They're so 1968 BC. Day 8: Roughly 20 ""hippies"" came to kill us tonight. We had to jump from the treehouse. Kurt broke his legs. Me and Allen ran. I'm sorry Kurt. Day 9: Whilst continuing our trek away from camp Allen and I came across a cave. We thought it was shelter, we thought wrong. Allen was overwhelmed by ""hippies"" and I got away. I'm not sorry Allen. Day 10: I decided I'm going to avenge my dead friends. Excpet Allen, he deserved it. I made myself a bow and some arrows. Oh an a mahoncanay, which means skull crushing club. Every ""hippie"" I see is going to die. Day 11: Blood. So much blood. Day 19: Ok so I've killed just about everyone. I sat down an ate some berries as a reward. I don't feel so good now. On a serious note: This is a fantastic game and the developers constantly  release patches with new content and bug fixes. I can't recommend it enough!			"

								First off this game gets addicting...building and surviving is not easy which makes the game very interesting. This is not a game for the easily scared person. Sounds and things are always happening around you. The A.I. in the game is very good. Here is an example of good game-play. I found myself chopping down wood in forest during day and spotting things moving in distance i decided to ignore it cause it wasn't to close...before you know it a cannibal was directly next to me i stood still hoping it would go away. (BAD IDEA) the freaking thing jumped at me at full speed (Scared the crap outta me) I chose to defend myself and was knocked out by him. woke up to two men dragging me across forest...then woke up in a dark cave next to a rope where i quickly climbed up and found myself running for my base camp at full speed i noticed there where lots of cannibal's quickly running aside me and in distance i did not stop.. i finally made it to base camp and decided to seek revenge. I heard screams near camp on beach so i healed up and made some fire bombs and got my axe. I found 4 of them on Beach burned 2 of them and beat the crap outta the other 2 with my axe. chopped off all their body parts brought it back to camp and stacked their limbs to sticks show my victory! 10/10 cant wait for game to fully be finished.

								Yes, I recommend it... BUT...While I direct this towards you consumers  just about to spend your money on this product, it's also viable feedback for the developers. So, in short: Yes, I recommend it. BUT for the average gamer it's NOT worth picking up at it's current state. The game is in alpha and needs some serious overhauls.Here's why:As it is, one might wonder if the game is made by fat, lazy people. Simply because you have to eat food and drink soda every five minutes in order to have any energy to work and also, not to starve. One could argue, with reason, how the player needing to eat more frequently than one does in real life, fits the sped up daycycle of the game. However, even if a day passes by in 15 minutes or so, the time needed to scavenge and work in order to gather resources and proviants (to set up a camp with a fire to cook food) is proportionally wrong, feels obscure and out of place. In order for all the walking around, working and scavenging to fit the time-format, the inventory cap needs to be increased atleast threefold. There's just no reason why carrying seven sticks two hundred meters should take several in-game hours. A solution would be to slow the daycycle down at least five times, or better yet, include a slider at the 'new game' screen, where one could adjust the speed of time according to personal prefference.Also, I wouldn't really mind those tribesmen showing up this often if it weren't for the fact that I feel completely helpless against an unarmed tribesman, despite having hit him or her three times in the head with an axe. I also wouldn't mind those tribesmen being this extremely dangerous and able to take me out easily, if it weren't for the fact that they show up way too often. Either one of these two extremes is acceptable and could be a niche game-gimmick, but the two of them at once is just terrible. Actually, I preferr none of them, but I suppose some people might, so making this customizable at a new game creation would be a great idea.Personally, I'd appreciate if this island didn't feel like a weird place where time is warped, overpopulated by annoying, overpowered cannibals, and a place where I have to constantly eat and drink in order to be able do do anything for two minutes before the day is over and I still need five more sticks. Imagine if this game included having to take a dump aswell! Needing the bathroom every five minutes is equally realistic...I hope this game comes with a ton of settings to personalize your own experience. I, for one, would love if I could actually have strength and time enough to carry out a days work, then sit down by my newly lit campfire and enjoy my freshly grilled lizard before going to sleep. And if those cannibals didn't show up to kill me this often, perhaps their enhcounters would be a bit more interresting rather than a shallow, obvious and expected, frequent and annoying nuisance, that's being a regular part of every (15 minute) day I get to keep playing.As an additional sidenote: For some reason, the textures of skin, like the skin parts of the body (hands etc.), and the skin of the tribesmen is currently glowing. While this makes your enemies easier to spot in the dark, it also makes it a pain to carry logs and such in the dark because of glowing arms taking up half of the screen. I've tried every setting in the options menu to fix this with no luck. I've never experienced anything like this with any other game so it is most likely a bug that will be sorted out. I somehow doubt that selfillumination like this is part of the gamedesign, judging by the screenshots. Running AMD Radeon HD 7870 and the game runs smoothly otherwise.EDIT: Check mong my uploaded screenshots to see what I'm talking about.

I realize this might have seemed like I'm hating on this, which I'm not. I still stand by my opinions: I recommend it because it has so much potential, but only to people who really are in to these kind of games and wants to try it out anyway. Otherwise, it's a given pass untill the game is done.			"

She charges. I cut her down in front the hanging man. My katana is sharp and she is weak. As she lets out her dying breath, I bring my axe down and tear her apart, head first, legs last. The man shouts and swings at me with his club, panicking. I take the axe to him till he stops screaming. Exhausted from pain, he moans and mumbles. I slowly light a stick with a cloth on and set him on fire. My flame is hot and he is weak. 10/10, would lose track of who's the real evil again.			"

The Forest

By: SABINA




Open world survival horror sandbox. Even in Early Access, The Forest is at the top of its genre. I first played many months ago and the very early stage of the game was evident. But I was intrigued and set it aside, hoping that the devs wouldn't join the growing throng of abandoned or semi-supported titles, and that they would actually live up to the purpose of the Early Access program. Now, easily sinking 100 hours into version .031 in just a couple weeks, I can honestly say that Endnight has been very, very busy. It is an understatement to say that The Forest has come a long way. At this rate, it stands to rival popular AAA titles. ""...deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness” Playing this time around, I was immediately impressed by the graphics and optimization. The options available make it possible to play, and still enjoy, on nearly any pc. And it is stunningly beautiful, so well complimented by the audio, both ambient and situational. This combination, along with some of the smartest AI I've encountered, makes for a worldspace that is among the most immersive I have ever experienced. Immersion...“But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself and, by heavens I tell you, it had gone mad.” 


Cabin in the Mountains

By: SABINA




When you can build and decorate a cozy cabin by a pond and set up a little bench to just sit upon and listen to the frogs chirping in the soft rain of sunset, lulled by the crackling of the campfire... that is immersion par excellence. As you watch the raindrops dimple the surface of the pond, from somewhere in the pitch black of night, beyond the glow of your lanterns, an inhuman scream shatters your idyll... something bellowing from the pits of Hell. Then another, and another, and you realize they are communicating. They are hunting... and they are headed straight for you with lightning speed, raw fury and an insatiable hunger. Hopefully you prepared well for this onslaught. Because it will be unrelenting, horrific, and your new routine almost every night. The things I've had to do to survive... bathed in the blood of butchery. I will never be the same again. There is no going back from this...""He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision--a cry that was no more than a breath: The horror...""

In short, The Forest is Early Access done well. It truly epitomizes the spirit of what EA is all about, and this is worth remarking because we all know that so many do not. The devs maintain a regularly scheduled updating discipline, continuously adding new content, fixing bugs, and optimizing. They listen to the community and actually implement the input. Already on my list of all time favorites, I will easily devote another hundred hours. I am convinced that The Forest will get finished, and that when it does, it will be an exceptional game without rival in its genre. “It was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice.”Tonight I stack their corpses like cordwood on the flaming pyre. I build walls from their bones and stuff their skulls with burning embers. And now, the mad howling I hear piercing the night... is me.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has it's issues, but once they are fixed, this game will be amazing.Quick story: You play as this guy on a plane with a child (maybe yours?) holding onto your arm. Plane crashes, some naked tribal guy takes said child, and you're on your own.Every time you start a new game the plane will be somewhere else so you wont know where you are every time. You start off with the basics, candy, beer, a fire axe, a heart monitor (that you'll never use) and food. You'll have a survival handbook that is very useful, itll tell you what to do as well as give you a way to build things like a fire or a place to sleep, even walls to keep you safe. When you hop off the plane (and taking the fire axe out of Stacy's face) you will either be greeted with sunshine or greeted by 3 naked people about to destroy you together.At this point, if you're lucky, no one will bother you. If you're unlucky however, and the naked tibal people see you and run after you, good luck defending yourself with a fire axe and some snacks (oh and pills). I love the visuals of this game, it's very beautiful. The sunshine, the darkness, all close to realistic. I love the level of darkness at night, it's just enough to hinder vision, but not enough to be annoying. The weather is pretty awesome too, the only problem I have with the weather is the rain, I got tired of this routine:1. You are cold and wet2. Get warm by fire3. Rain stops, ventures out of base/camp4. Rains again 15 seconds later making you run back to camp/base just to get warm5. See step oneOn to the enemies: I hate them. They are annoying, buggy, and overpowered at times. I would be in my camp that is surrounded by big tall walls, and suddenly *INCEPTION MUSIC BWUM*. I would look around and see no one, then suddenly a bunch of them run through the walls and runs right back out. This gets annoying, especially when they warp into your camp and hit you from below your log cabin. When you finally have the balls/girl balls to venture out of your camp/base, you see a single naked woman watching you, then walking up to you, then hits you once taking over half your health (perfect time to look at that heart monitor!!). You swing your axe at them but your attacks are SO slow that she hits you 2 times before your next swing. Other than the things I mentioned, I love the IDEA of the enemies, they watch you, study you, instead of attacking sometimes. I love the idea of stealthing around these naked people or being stalked by them. I know it sounds weird, but these elements are not implimented well in other games, I would love this open-world survival horror game to have a moment where you hear a sound and if you're lucky, you'll see one running away.The food: You have only a few choices on food that I've encountered: Candy bar, fish, rabbits, and plants. I hated that more often than not I'm being forced to stop everything just to eat a bunny. I have trouble getting the fish, they swim too far from where you can stand and fish from, meaning you have to stand and hope they swim close to you and not swim out into the ocean. Don't get me started on the sharks in the ocean, they spawn a safe distance, SOMETIMES, once they spawned right at the edge of the water, you can't go in without being eaten. Honestly the hunting, other than the tech issues, is amazing compaired to other games. To fish (at the moment you must find a sharp spear, can't make it yet) you get a sharp spear and go look for the ocean or a pond. You stand over the fish and stab them, making them stick to your pole. This is amazing, it's small but it's great that you don't just go up to a fish and press ""take"". To hunt (there are only rabbits to hunt and eat at the moment) you either grab your fire axe and start running after them and swinging away, or you make a rabbit trap. The building: I love the fact that you can make yourself a camp and stay safe. When you look at your survival guide, you can build walls, cabins, steps, a tree house, and other things. They keep you safe from those naked people that want to sacrifice your body to the ""Bieber"" they keep seeing in the magazines on planes. I love that if you build a fire, they will come and try to kill you. If I were a tribal naked person and this guy that was in a plane crash made a camp out of 50 logs that are bigger than him in less than 2 days all by himself, I would avoid him completely.The game is in development, so there are some bugs that I've run into, here is a list of a few:-Gets killed by a naked Leelo and I wake up in a cave surrounded by 3 more naked girls and gets pummeled by them almost instantly. This isn't normal, you have a bit more time than that to recover.-End of the level, missing textures, trees in water, a message that says you can't go this way yet, it's not available in this version of the game"". When that happened, I was staving looking for fish in water, and never saw one for miles.-Made a big base with large walls and stuff to keep safe, but a bunch of enemies run straight through it and attack me.-I suddenly start swimming while I was cutting down a tree, I am able to slowly swim off into the sunset above the ground and over the trees. Felt great but it was a game-breaking bug, I can't save and come back, the glitch will still be there.-I walk into a cave, start slowly rising upward, looks like I'm swimming then suddenly dropped from a high place and dies.All in all, I loved this game, it needs a lot of work but if they continue to build it even after the alpha is released, it would turn out to be a outstanding game. I recommend this game because it has potential to be a epic game, if they put love and care into it.Suggestions (keep in mind these are probly added by the time anyone reads this):-I want to make a strong spear, adding a utility knife would make things a lot easier, you can cut the sticks to make a spear-More things to hunt. This is more than likely added very soon.-Don't make caves seperate than the main world. Every time you go into a cave, the world outside isn't there anymore, causing issues with framerate and crashes.-A story. Surviving is it's own reward, but where did that kid go? Did they mistake him for their idol ""Bieber""?-Random events: Imagine this, you are walking in the forest, you hear a sound, you look around but see nothing, then when you turn to look in front of you there's a guy and he grabs your neck or tries to stab you, QTE moment. Or imagine this, you made a base, heavily fortified with big walls. One night you are eating your rabbit with a side of Butterfingers when suddenly you hear some chanting. You look over your wall and see a bunch of naked people with a very large log making their way to your wall, threatening to knock it down. Events like this make the game a LOT more fun and random.I hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading! <3 "

								Basically starts out like the show Lost.  Plane goes down, nobody has seatbelts on because they live dangerous.  Plane snaps in half, but you're such a badass you are the only survivor and you're doing pretty damn well.  A blue electric guy comes and takes the kid next to you while you stare at him, but you stay silent, because Social Darwinism is life and you are going to amount to more than that child would have.  You wonder around hopeless and ravage through people's luggage because when sh** happens, common sense goes out the window.  You run aimlessly with an axe and kill a few monitor lizards because wherever you are, they are abundant.  Soon after, a little bronze person appears and stares at you, naturally you're instinct in unrealistic situations is to kill him.  He hits ya once or twice and you are knocked out because you just 'cant even'.  You wake up in a cave in which an Octo-lizard is giving birth and the babies kill you. Days survived: 010/10 overall.  Would absolutely recommend to everyone			"

Early Access Review
								I always find hard to review a game I adore. I fear not to give enough credit deserved and every word is carefully picked in order to show what the said game is about and why it should be purchased.I will start off by telling why The Forest shines brighter than other survival games. I always found frustrating the neverending material farming in similar titles, days spent chopping, cutting, slashing just to build a very small hut that would get destroyed in a blink of an eye. The Forest is different. While it still takes time to craft something, you don't have to spend an entire day gathering resources. There are many available structures, with many functions (some structures having more than one fuction, as they can be extremely versatile).Another typical feature of a survival game is the how-to-spend-the-night moment. I've always seen that moment as the one where you try to stay safe, where any lurking threat has to be avoided until you get a proper equipment to fight back (if you can fight back at all). In The Forest, with a proper strategy, you can drive away the cannibals (the main enemies) even from the first night. Hoping to have given proper credit to this game so far, I'll now start listing what I personally find extremely splendid about it:  Enemy AI:  The cannibals are extremely intelligent, and their behaviour constantly develops following your gameplay; if you try to avoid them, they will look at you with curiosity, studying your movements without harming you. If you show an aggressive behaviour they will strike with an increasing force, calling for help and attacking your base weakest spots. If you are merciless they may end up fearing you, whereas if you spare some of them, they will respect you, seeing you as a godlike figure.They have multiple strategies as well: they send scouts to check your base and equipment, plan surprise attacks in the day, build different totems around to inform the others (there are lots of totems, each of them with a different purpose) or to summon special enemies (mutants).  Co-Op mode:  This is the real way to play The Forest in my opinion. Grab your friends and start playing together; the voice option (you can communicate with your real voice through an in-game Walkie Talkie) adds up to the immersion, and your voice can actually lure cannibals as they can hear you too. You can also trade items, in case a friend is in need of a particular resource; you can organize turns and roles thanks to this. Building, fighting and surviving with your friends is an incredible experience in The Forest, it's extremely fun and addictive!  The story:  The storyline plays an important role in The Forest, and gives you an exciting purpose to venture the island to find your lost son. As you crawl into the caves, sail the sea or climb the mountains you will find details of what's going on, or what happened before your arrival. There's always something to find, from creepy to disturbingly fun discoveries.  Updates:  I believe that this is the most updated Early Access game every played. There's always a new planned update that adds so many new features and fixes bugs (once you start the game there is a countdown to the next update), and it makes The Forest a title that you cannot stop playing as there will always be something new. A big kudos to the devs for this!  Optimization: Yes, the game is demanding in terms of minimal requirements, however I'd like to highlight the optimization aspect. I run this game on two PCs, a not-so-high-end laptop (which barely meets the minimum specs) and a potato desktop. I can perfectly run on medium settings on the former (without fps drops or stuttering, and on high settings with some small stutter in tense moments of fight), and low settings on the latter (without fps drops) and still looks amazing! You can run The Forest with the setting you like and it will still have a beautiful look.The price of the game should be tempting as well. For that ridiculous sum you get an amazing survival game (I dare to say, the best so far) in constant development, with a dev team that actually listens to player's feedbacks and seems to be more excited than us to work on this project. It's an Early Access game but it already has more content that most of the ""finished"" titles.Grab this game and I am sure you will NOT regret it! "

								Got through to day 9 after a couple of playthroughs, where I had amassed many amazing weapons, limbs & resources, explored caves and created a solid base. It should have been called ""The Island"" when I had finished with it, as there weren't enough trees for it to be classed as a forest any more! Bear Grylls would be proud...Was killed by my own treacherous Raft when we got into an argument about which way was upwards and I shot it with an arrow. He retaliated by dividing by 0 and I received a few fatal ""roundhouse sticks"" to the face; they sent me flying (literally).11/10 would raft again.On a serious note, Some stuff in this game does need work/updating and maybe co-op Support too (but seeing as this is currently still in Early Access Alpha: I'll let it slide).... OOZING WITH POTENTIAL! gg.*UPDATE* Co-op Multiplayer is now released and fully supported, which I think will make this game much more enjoyable! Long live The Forest!!!			"

								Day 42:    I have established several camps around the island. Some are well fortified and if the natives choose to attack on a large scale these locations will surely be the choices for my retreat. I can't decide if they are all part of the same clan or if the ""Shiny Ones"" and the ""Mutations"" are seperate from the others. From what I have seen so far, this group is the only that dwell under ground through out the cave systems. To date, I have never seen the surface group enter the caves. I have witnessed on multiple occasions, openly violent attacks on the ""Dwellers"" from the ""Surfacers"" leading me to believe they are seperate. Of course this is only speculation.     Having the multiple camps has proven a must. This has allowed me to travel to the farthest reaches of the island in search for clues of my son's where abouts. I can only speculate on the accuracy of these findings as well as the location of my son.     From what I have seen thus far. I am holding out hope that he still lives. I have found pieces of his toy figure leading me to think he is leaving clues in hope that I still breathe and am in search of him. He is correct. I will tear down this island from shores to mountains until I have exhausted my options........ Or my life.    I fear to speak of the other things I have seen.  Clearly, as an attempt to ward off either myself or the creatures, from their villages.These surfacers are readily willing to set up effigies of mangled, mutilated, severed body parts of the copses from the crash. I can only hope that for their part, the victims were deceased prior to these savages locating them. From what I can tell, they have not, I'll say that again, They Have Not eaten any human flesh that I know of. However, as for the cave dwellers,......... well let me only say that I have a stronger constitution then I had thought.     It's going dark and I must prepare for the nightly hunting from both the surfacers and the dwellers. They seem to prefer the evening for killing. Make no mistake though, if you find this journal.... If I do not find my son and I am fallen, do not trust the day anymore than the night. They want blood.... for what ever reason. I can hear their calls off in the distance now and the sun has lost its' hold. I must prepare.			"

								As a survival game enthusiast, this one has been on my radar for some time now. Last week, I finally decided to pull the trigger on the purchase as one of my buddies had the game and hadn't touched it in a while; he thought it'd be good fun to hop back on and fool with co-op. One thing turned to another, and now we have our whole teamspeak server on a co-op world playing together. The game is honestly a BLAST to play with the current content in it, and is only readily improving with the quick flow of updates from the devs at Endnight Games. It's a good one to go home, blow down a fatty and just chill and laugh at the hilarious antics that come with this game while at the same time being too afraid to walk down your dark hallway to get to the bathroom after playing. This game gifts you with those little moments of bonding and hilarity; in no other game have I had such a compelling moment as when one of my buddies accidentally pushed a log sled off the ciff and onto the roof of our base, frantically screaming ""LOG SLED ON THE ROOF LOG SLED ON THE ROOF"" as if it were a major event, while the rest of us flew out of the base to investigate the calamity which turns into a channel wide chant of laughter. I'd like to see more enemy types, more craftible items, more light sources, more creatures (meaning neutral animals; snakes, horses, bears bugs etc). Normal mode seems to be too easy, I get the best enjoyment out of hard mode as it is significantly less forgiving, especially in large groups. As time passes by in the game, I find my base draws more and more cannibals towards it, their mechanic is very interesting as they seem to attempt to follow you around. Meaning if you leave your base for X amount of time, the result will be X amount of time in which you will have peace before they begin to seige your base again upon return. My most recent encounter on hard mode had me face to face with eight ""Leader"" class cannibals, and trust me when i say it is a testiment to take down even one of those bad boys. We won't even go into the other creepy beasts in the world, discover them and cry in fear.  The game definitely feels enjoyable for the long haul. It has a bit of a rust-esque grinding/building system. If we're being honest, that mindless grind for resources is one of my favorite aspects of games that fall under this catagory, so I found no issue in spending hours upon hours cutting trees, hauling them back to my base, and repeating. The game definitely feels rewarding as well, If you decide to brave through one of the (8 or 9?) large cave systems with only the measly lighter or plastic flashlight as a light source and primitave weaponry, The game pays for it for you in giving you the ability to collect rare and otherwise impossible to find/craft items; one example being the Modern Axe. I won't spoil anything but fair warning: You may or may not♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants in shear terror upon descending into the depths. The build system is solid and there is only room for improvement. It is exactly how the description of the same states it - you can build pre planned buildings, such as small or large cabins; or you can let your imagination run wild and utilize the custom objects feature and build anything from Squidward Tentacles' house to a scale replica of Rome (almost lol). I personally am in the process of building a base which is hanging off of the edge of a steep cliff on the west/southwestern coast of the map.There are many beautiful spots for you to decide where to hunker down. Overall I have highly enjoyed the time spent on the game so far and I look forward to spending much more time on this game. Development is active and there is even a timer on the main menu that identifies when the next update will come out. Would recommend.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								The Forest is currently an Early Access Survival Horror game. The core concept and execution of the game are excellent thus far. The Developers for this game are very active in the community and regularly release updates. Detailed breakdown:What we know about the Story:The story is in development. This means the whole Story is not there. You cannot ""beat"" the game as is. While exploring the island you will find clues as to what happened to ""Timmy"" (who is assumed to be your son). Parts of his toy, pictures, cave sketches. The game has basically zero handholding and refuses to point you in any direction at all. Most people will never find all the hidden story components. If you do find them, you will learn where ""Timmy"" has been takenGameplay: The game is played in First Person. The core aspects of the game are survival based. Hunger, Thirst, Rest, and Energy all make an appearance. You must hunt for food (or forage, alternatively), drink water, and sleep. So far, the survival aspects are pretty well balanced, and always being improved upon. You are going to establish a ""base"" or camp of sorts. Shelters, fires, walls, traps, gardens, resource management, and food storage all come into play here. There are quite a few creatable structures/devices already, and more are going to be added. Base creation takes time. You must gather resources to build things. Many people feel this is ""grindy"" but I enjoy it a lot. You will find yourself collecting rocks, sticks, logs from trees, leaves, and other objects and transporting them back to your base. This takes time, but seeing your base take shape feels extremely rewarding. Combat is a necessary part of the game. You are stuck on an island populated by cannibal tribes. Hungry cannibal tribes. There is so much to say for the AI in this game. They are already impressive and quirky and only getting better. The cannibals are currently broken into three tribes.Starving/Skinnies.  These cannibals are very thin/lanky, often naked and covered in blood. They are almost always hostile to the player and have even been seen killing and eating fellow cannibals. Often acting as scouts, it is common to see solo skinnies roaming the island. When they find something of interest (deforestation, foreign structures, you) they will often hide and observe for a while. When satisfied, they will run back to their camp and alert fellow cannibals. If they located your base, expect to see patrols coming and going from now on. Skinnies are the weakest of all the cannibals, but they are EXTREMELY fast and agile. It is very easy for skinnies to dodge your attacks and get behind you when in combat. Cannibals. The regular cannibals look like normal humans, with a few skin tones, often covered in dirt or decorations. They usually travel in groups of 2-4. They are not always hostile to the player, but it's always safer to assume they are. If they know your location it's common to see them roaming around the edges of your base. they are slower than skinnies but they usually carry clubs and hit much harder. They are prone to splitting up in combat, flanking and coming from behind the player. Cave Cannibals. Gray skinned aliens, basically. Stronger than regular cannibals but a bit slower. use the same tactics and skills as above. The AI is so awesome. They stalk you, they observe you, leave effigies outside your base (body parts on sticks) to mess with you, ambush you, scare you. You will find yourself fearing them, looking over your shoulder when doing even the simplest things. there are special varieties of mutants deep in the caves, but I'll leave that for you to discover.All in all this game is excellent. The core concept and foundation are very well done. The developers add more and more, and try to stay on top of glitches and bugs. More is being added and the game is only 14.99 on Steam. 10/10 for me, I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.EDIT:I have been playing this Multiplayer with a buddy of mine and it's amazing. This game is 10x better with a friend. We've had so much fun and I recommend anyone who enjoys it to try it with some friends. Beware though, the difficulty is increased for multiplayer. 11/10EDIT 2:I feel I need to take a moment to commend the Devs on this game. For a two man team (now 15-17 man team as the dev pointed out) they put an insane amount of work into this. There is an update timer on the main menu and anytime they go past the scheduled time, they always explain what happened and why. Every time they release an update there is always a hotfix for most of the new bugs the update causes within a day or two. This Dev team is literally a personification of what Early Access should be. They are such a great team and they really take the wishes of the community to heart. You will not regret the purchase, and these guys deserve support. Thank you to the Devs!			"

								Everything I do in The Forest feels like a big deal, so when things get crazy (and they really do) it is pretty mind blowing. I think that the mix of realistic, survival game mechanics and fantasy horror work great together. The Forest pushes you beyond the point of most other games. Which results in an extremely immersive and exhilarating experience. There are points in The Forest where the realistic and more fantastic elements come together beautifully. The developers of The Forest are not messing around, they will surprise you. There are some genuinely talented people working on this game.I have no problems with performance running it at 1080p and 60FPS. This game is beautiful and there is an extensive graphics options menu. The sound design is impressive too and I would recommend that you experience it in 5.1 surround. In addition to the single player experience there is also a co-op mode. I didn’t play this part of the game much but I did try it. Everything worked fine when logging into a game and there seem to be a fair few people online. The developers of The Forest have become known as a dedicated and reliable team. They have done some fantastic work here and continued to add regular improvements. The game is still just an early access title but it’s one of the best games that I’ve ever played. I would highly recommend that you buy and play this game. Let’s give the developers loads of money, so that they can continue producing amazing content.			"

Early Access Review
								(Last update was July 22nd, 2014)If there is one thing I would tell Dean Hall about his Survival game ""DayZ"" is that I don't see the point of surviving when you are just shooting everyone in sight.  When I think of a survival game I think about a band of people coming together to overpower whatever the hell is on the planet and to fight back against it, as well as to survive and get food, and then I would hit him over the head with a sledge hammer and tell him to do his game right.PROS:The Island: When I started it up I was plopped into a jet with a kid next to me, pretty much KOed, then we started divebombing towards the ground and crashed, with some naitive guy coming and taking the child, then me getting up a hour or so later with bruises and cuts, so I grabbed everything and ran outside to see what happened.  Well the plane is cut in half and the back half where I was at is broken to high hell except the body.  I must say that the island looks really nice, and actually looks like a Forest, not just a place I got dropped into and expected to win at.The Cannibals: These guys are creepy, and actually act like a tribe which kind of threw me off, I was chopping some trees down with my little Hatchet, and all of a sudden 3 of them came up to me, I was actually kind of terrified cause I had no clue what they were going to do, so I just stood there and stared, they started to get in closer and closer, so I readied myself for a fight, then they all ran away like they just saw a ghost.  The creepy thing is that they try to surround you and flank your sides which I really didn't think they would do for how early this game is.  Also, has anyone else noticed that the silouette of a bush looks like a human? Keeps scaring me thinking someone is there.A Interactable Environment: If you noticed I said in the last pro ""Chopping some trees"" I wasn't kidding, you can ACTUALLY cut down every tree on the island, which is really cool feature since you can actually chop down bushes for leaves, break suitcases for items, the trees down for logs for your shelter, it's really neat, I didn't think they would go this in depth.Easily find your house: Once you make a hut, log cabin, etc, you'll get a icon on your hud showing you where the house is at, which I admire, that way I can go explore all I want and easily find my way back to the house, cause with me and my Adventurous nature I tend to get lost a lot and that icon is very nice so I can find my way back to my house.Molotovs are OP as hell: Not kidding, a Molly can kill 3-4 of them as soon as the fire touches them.  I was building my hut on the beach since they couldn't flank behind me and had only 1 way to get to me, well a group of 3 came right up to me and I froze again, I was kind of afraid to move cause I had no clue what they would do, then 3-4 more came up behind, first thing that came into my mind was ""F$#k me..."" I looked into my inventory and realized I could make some molly's, so I made a few and started to toss them at the group, 1st molly hit 2 in the first group, the 3rd guy ran back towards the others, I threw a second at the other group and caught 2 more on fire, the 2 that survived ran off.  So if you get cornered, Molotovs are the way out.Missing passangers(?) (Spoiler warning): I realized I was the only one on the plane in the back end, but I figured there were more than just me and a kid, so as I was wondering the island I found a hole near the beach that led to a cave, I figured ""Eh what the heII, I may as well look inside."" I threw up my lighter and walked around, I couldn't see much other than some suitcases and a rusty hatchet, I took the hatchet (Which does more damage than the red little hatchet.) Turned around, and looked up, there was about 30-40 bodies hanging upside down in the cave which scared the s^%t out of me, I realized I found most of the passengers on the trip it would seem...Weaponry: Other than the molly's, you get a hatchet, then later I found the Rusty Hatchet in the cave, I don't know if the Rusty Hatchet does more damage (i'm assuming it does), so you may want to find it.Effigy's: After I had killed some of the members I had dismembered them, and got their bodyparts, I thought ""The f^#k am I supposed to do with these?"" I figured I would make a effigy out of them like the book said, and I Just put it near my house and just kind of left it there, some more naitives came after me there was quite a large group, I didn't have enough cloth for more mollys so I lit the Effigy on fire and they all backed away and ran, I guess the effigys show you aren't to be f**ked with.Inventory system: I really liked this, it organizes things when you open your inventory and show's how much of what you have for what item, like 50 leaves, 10 candy bars, etc, and you can craft items together, like me making the molly's it's just with a beer bottle and a cloth and you are good to go!Performance issue fix: They fixed a lot of performance problems, it does run much better than what it was when it first came out, can't wait till they fix it all though.  Although now it is running much better than it had a few weeks ago or so, so good job on that end, I can even put the shadows on High again, yay.CONS:Map: This is NOT a con, but I just feel like this has to be established, the map isn't fully used and honestly I feel like i've only found about 1/4 of the bloody map itself, so when it becomes a full map i'm gonna get lost to high hell, but I can't wait for that to happen!Draw distance sucks, same with FOV, and FPS: Not trying to sound like a d%#k or anything, but the draw distance is just terrible, litterally, you have to be within 10 feet of cases, rocks, etc. it's rediculous, not to mention the FOV (Field Of View) Is just awful, it's not Call of Juarez: The Cartel bad, but it's pretty bloody close.  Ontop of that even though it's been fixed the FPS is still at a cap of 30, which feels so weird considering with all of the close draw distance, bad FOV, everything, I think it would run MUCH better than what it is.  Thankfully they did some performance tweaks and now it runs smoother, so yay on that end.Drop a Molly on your feet: This annoyed me quite a lot, when you take out a molly, and don't use it, but try to equip something else, he just drops it on his feet, and it scared the s%@t out of me and made me run into the nearest pond, so if you are going to make Molly's then for the love of god only make 1-2 that way if you use it you won't have to worry about dropping it on your feet and run around like a idiot.No Control page: I can't really find the control page, if there is one, to check the controlls, I would like to know what buttons I have to push to do things instead of f**king something up.  I don't mind the fact it DOESN'T tell me, but i'd like to know if there is some buttons that are very useful or that I might need to use at one point or another.WHAT I THINK:This game, for a early alpha game, is REALLY good, props to those 4 people doing this, compared to other people doing survival games like Rust, DayZ, and Nether, these guys know what a survival game is about, they are even going to implement a Co-op at one point to play with friends which I can't wait for.  This game, in it's alpha stage, gets a 8/10, there are some really annoying things but those are gonna get patched out quite quickly now, and it's worth every penny I spent, honestly it's half the cost of DayZ and I feel like i'm getting more.

								The Forest is an experience unlike anything else you will find. In the 40+ hours I have put into it I have yet to be bored. There is always something to do, and there is always a pack of cannibals ready to drag you into their cave and make you their play thing. The Forest is in Alpha and there are bugs, But what you need to understand is unlike Day Z the developers for this game care about you the player and the game they are working so hard to make whole. The Devs actively take what the players say seriously and have continually given us what we want. I am not someone who actively supports Alpha / Beta releases if I have to pay for them, but The Forest deserves all the funding it can get.If there was ever a game to back this is it. 10/10 and only getting better with each patch.

								My First Day in The Forest [UPDATED]     I'm sitting on a plane next to whom I can only assume is my son. I look, to my left, out the window and see clouds. Turbulence, and now the front of the plane has come off. I look back at my son, who is now rocking back in forth in his seat. We hit the ground and my son goes limp. Shortly after, I black out.       I awaken to what I can only assume is some sort of Tribesman picking up my son, and carry him away. I play dead until he leaves. When he does, I get up and notice that I am all of a sudden very hungry, and very thirsty. Amazingly, I find trays of food that seem to be unharmed from the crash. I eat three or four trays and had some soda to wash it down. No time to mourn the loss of my son. I must survive.      I walk to the front of the remaining section of plane. I find a flight attendant with an axe stuck in her chest. I removed it like King Arthur did with Excaliber. I notice I have survival guide on me. After reading through that I begin collecting resources. While bashing luggage open, I spot a light in the near distance. Upon aroaching I see that it is another tribesman, and he is running at me.      My first reaction was to charge with my axe. After a few good hits, the tribesman retreats to a tree and begins to climb. I watch as he jumps from tree to tree, slowly getting closer. He makes it to a tree close to me and pounces down, much like a tiger. I begin frantically swinging my axe, and soon he is on the ground with no pulse. I hit just one more time, and the corpse explodes into limbs and other bits. Night is now falling, I better make shelter.      With my hunters sheltler built to survival guide standards, I make fire with leaves and sticks. With my fire lit, I notice the many animals that run and fly by, even at night. Ballsy birds begin perching atop my shelter. Wielding my axe, I slaughtered all birds who dare cross me. I look back at my fire just in time to see the cutest little bunny running through and setting himself ablaze. I watched as that furry little fireball ran away into the woods. I felt that was as good as a time, as any, to go to bed and rest up for my first full day of survival.[UPDATE]     It is now my second day. I awaken to find three tribesman stading outside my shelter. Two with skulls on sticks as weapons. The third with a torch. Thinking that he is unarmed, I attacked the torch wielding man first. In hindsight, this was not a good idea. I was set a flame just like that furry little bunny I saw last night.     After passing out from the pain, I awaken inside of a very dark cave, with nothing but the lighter I had in my pocket when the plane crashed. I assume that the tribespeople that attacked me earlier brought me here. I look around and find a flare gun. Shortly after, I see another on of these tribespeople in this cave. I shoot him with the flare gun, and it lights up this section of the cave enough for me to see many bodies hanging above me.      I move closer to the tribesman that I had killed. I see a body on the table that looks like it has been disected, like some sort of biology project. Im begining to think that they have plans for me. I better get out of here before its too late.			"

								I have spent the last 4 and a half days reading through ALL of the code, and I mean all 1500+ source files from 19 compiled binaries that came with the Alpha.While the engine, its systems and all the various functions across the entire game show that it is EXTREMELY early in the games development timeline (almost to the point you could say only-just-started). HOWEVER, and this is a really big HOWEVER, hence the caps. The different core functions that create the game (Physics, AI, Crafting, Environment, Survival, Graphics) are impressive in their construction. They have used some of the top add-ins for unity to speed up the games creation and improve the complexity of several core systems, and built on top of that base to create the alpha we are playing now. It is likely the integration of these systems so that they work together in unison is the reason for the initial release delays. Likely the graphical side.The bits we really care about, Items, AI, Crafting, Survival Mechanics and World interaction are all setup in such a way that adding new things, improving current stuff or replacing parts entirely is easy from a coding perspective, thanks to the methods they use to pass information and trigger functions across entities in the game world.Most of what we are experiencing in the Alpha is what I call place-holder code. Simple versions of what the function should do once it has been developed. Just enough code so that the function will not crash the game, or another function if it is called. SO MANY functions do not even have code written for them. They do nothing when or if they are even called.Some areas are of course further developed than others. Building structures and crafting is quite fleshed out fundamentally, the AI is all ready for family based societies and most of the complex roaming and searching code is not being used. Combat is not even their really. being able to collide with things and pass functions calls allows the simplistic fighting and moving we have in the game, and I seriously think this will be replaced entirely.My guess is that the first few patches will be stability and integration patches. These will improve the functions in the areas most reported and further integrate the different add-ins with their own code, and finally customizing those add-ins further to support the game they want to create. Further content, like additional craftables and buildables, and more complex AI (like family society) will probably not come until another patch or two has past. Depending on the assets they have ready now, and the complexity of how those are used in game, we will see a handful of craftables, items or buildings added in any patch, but big content will be later. We are likely to see movement, collision, combat and item interaction improve dramatically in the next two patches, as well as performance increases and general stability.I also assume that the integration of these add ins, and customizing them would be quite complex and time consuming. Working with other peoples code can be time consuming and unpredictable until you are as familiar with that code as you would be your own. These add-ins are not simple little modules, they are advanced highly developed and quite complex systems. As time passes, the dev's will get more and more familiar with the coding of these, and development speed will increase.I found no evidence (in my mind) that suggested any aspect of what they advertised was false or misleading as far as what the game is becoming. In fact the code suggests that the game is going to be a lot more than what we know already. There are some really cool things that just are not used or spoken of at all.			"

								ALPHA REVIEW *SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS TIME GOES ALONG*From the looks of things, the game so far starts you off on an airplane with who appears to be your son, next thing you know hell breaks lose as the plane begins to plunge into a wooded island where he'll be grabbed by a mutant and your job now is to survive and possibly find him, alive or dead.........*Warning* - You wil discover bugs and unfinished material since, this is an alpha gameThe beginning of the game will start you off at a random crash location around a small area around the  island and where as I have found that the first thing you do is NOT want to do is to stick around the airplane because you'll never know what will come find you You'll find so suitcases you can break down, logs and wood you can collect and other varities of items, a survival guide to build traps and shelter, cook food, create explosives, wash yourself from blood, staying warm the cold. Lots more being added.+ Variety of cool stuff to craft, INCLUDING EXPLOSIVES!+ Fun gameplay of trap buildings and base defense. Looks like more stuff will be added+Graphics are looking good for an indie survival game+Good ambience and background noises. Scary at night especially when you don't know what is making those strange sound+Immersive and scary+Hours of fun finding items, crafting, and building however the xploration is limited.-Majority of the areas are closed off you can only explore a limited of space which is still large- just some bugs that needs ironing out, optimization etc, what you expect? ITS PRE ALPHA.- Multiplayer not available yet- Inventory space is limited, you can only carry 2 log at a time to buildd up an 82 log cabin- Interface for backpack could use some work.You can check out footages on twitch/kenutty			"

								This game just ticks all of the boxes for me.Games like Outlast force you to experience all the jumpscares. This goes for most games that belong to the horror genre. The Forest, however, is different. You can go the whole game without encountering any of the mutants and cannibals if you play your cards right. It's only when you let your guard down that you get ♥♥♥♥ed over. Nothing makes you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants quite like seeing the silhouette of a hunting party sprinting across a hill in the distance. I've woken up some mornings and really don't want to leave the safety of my tree house. No other game has given me that gut-wrenching feeling as to date. I feel as if i'm ♥♥♥♥ing playing Minecraft PvP all of again; holding down ""sneak"" for dear life and as not to get spotted. The AI in this game is fantastic. The cannibals will leave you alone for the first few days, watching your every move. As the game progresses they get more and more ballsy. The AI will test you to see how you respond. If you act fearful and run away they will see you as prey and you'll end up with more raiding parties visiting you. However, If you act aggresive then they will retreat only to return with an army that, no matter how powerful you are, you just wont be able to match. Staying neutral with the tribesmen requires maintaining eye contact, holding your ground and showing your strength. Gaining respect from the natives is crucial to your survival. I do have to poke some fun at the audio though. Whilst the atmospheric sounds are ♥♥♥♥ing on point, certain noises are just all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. For example, when fighting a single cannibal it can sound like there are 3 more behind you when in reality there's not. Beating a native to a pulp is incredibly disorientating when screams from the same cannibal move from your left ear to your right ear even though the tribesman hasn't moved. Certain water sounds are also unbearably loud when compared to other ambient effects. Obviously the game is still in alpha and these issues will surely be resolved, but the game already feels incredibly polished already; I've yet to experience any sort of game-breaking bug.I've not played a game that made me giddy inside for quite a while. Therefor I highly reccomend ""The Forest""			"

								Day 1: The plane has crashed and my son has been taken from me. Finding my son is my number one priority but I am shaken up. Just what was that who took him? I take a few moments to collect myself and gather what I can from the plane. I then walk out of the plane only to find what once belonged to my fellow tennis players. All of their suitcases, all over the ground. I take what I can and leave the crash site. I notice night is approaching. I find a small cliff and set up a small shelter with a campfire. Before I get ready to sleep I hear something out in the Forest. Like . . . moment, lots of it. I keep one eye opened while I sleep tonight. Day 2: Morning is here and I am hungry. Outside my camp I found bushes with many berries that I can sustain myself with. After finishing these berries I am ready to start looking for my son. I don't know what is waiting for me out there but for his sake I will be brave. I spend the entire day searching. Hours of searching and nothing. I notice night is approaching and run to my camp. I feel as if I am being followed and do not want to be out here at night. Night is here and I just made it back to my camp. But . . . this night is different. There is a full moon out tonight and I see people. They are just standing there . . . watching . . . waiting . . . They do not get close to my camp tonight but I sleep with one eye open again. Day 3: Mere berries will not sustain me much longer. I am hungry . . . so very hungry . . . However, I cannot let something like hunger bother me. I must find my son. He must be so scared . . . so . . . alone . . . While searching for him I came across a deer in the Forest. Half mad with hunger I pulled out my hatchet, ran up to him and started swinging. I skinned the deer and wear its hide. I return to my camp with its meat and eat like a king tonight. It is good . . . so very good . . . Before I fell asleep I noticed the men in the Forest are here once again. They are getting closer to me each night.  I don't know what they want from me . . . I sleep tonight with both eyes open. Day 4: My son . . . my son . . . it has been days now and I am starting to lose hope. I don't think he could have survived this long on his own. I have not the energy to look for him either. I am tired . . . I am cold . . . I am alone . . . I sleep tonight with both eyes closed. After only getting 2 hours of sleep I wake up in the middle of the night to find 2 men within arms reach staring at me. I slowly reach for my hatchet . . . I grab it and start swinging. A blow to the head drops one of them while the other runs off. I am covered in blood. I do not sleep any more tonight. Day 5: My son is dead. I am sure of it. I will kill everything on this island. I spend the day preparing for what is to come. I hunt down lizards and wear their skin as armor. I drag their bodies to my camp, rip the flesh from their bones, and cook them in the fire. Night is approaching. I see about 7 people in the Forest. They are watching me . . . I do not sleep tonight . . . for I . . . am watching them . . . Day 6: I am ready. I do not need sleep anymore. I spend the day hunting down small groups of these . . . animals . . . I drag their bodies to my base one by one. A stack of bodies lie in front of me. I start hacking away at them. The arms, the legs, the head. Everything can be used. I mount their body parts on sticks to let all know that I am not to be messed with. The smell of blood and human flesh fills the Forest and my camp. Night is approaching. I don't see anyone. I sleep on their torsos tonight.  Day 7: Hungry . . . Need food. I will hunt for food. In the Forest I find small group of men. I run in with hatchet in hand and kill them. All of them. I drag their bodies to base. Stack them up and chop them in to pieces. I cook these pieces and eat them. They are good . .. very very good .. . . Day 8: i am alone. .. i am enraged . .i  hungryy .... . found sleeping man in tent . dragged him to base.. ate him. he was goodDay 9: son, ware r you . son. .. .must be tasty . . . s-son .. . dont enter  … .. the Forest.............Day 10: ……7/7 Would go crazy and eat people again			"

								This game has awakened me. I now know what it feels like to be trapped in a log cabin with only a lizard as a friend. It was peaceful, untill, the ""others"" came for me. They wanted the coco bars I had saved since 1st grade. With an axe in my hand, and a phone in the other (gottta keep up on instagram) I ran out, thinking of an awesome pun as I ran to them. I yelled at the top of my lungs, with all my might.""MAY I AXE YOU A QUESTION""I swang, and swang. My axe, it help up the whole time. Killing, destroying, exploading. My life will never be the same. It was an eye opening experience. I made friends with a shark, who decided it would be okay to bite my leg off. I fell to my doom, on one knee. I woke up in a cave, suraounded by naked people. My survival skillz kicked in, I stood up in greed, on my one leg. I STARTED SCREMING (THIS REVIEW WILL BE IN CAPS FOR NOW ON) I YELLED AT THE TOP OF MY LITTLE BABY LUNGS! I SWANG! AND SCREAMED! ""THIS IS THE FINAL COUNT DOWN!"" I SCREAMED, AND SWANG MY RUSTY PEICE OF CRAP! I KILLED THEM ALL, AND RODE TO SUCCESS AND FAME AND MONEY, ON THIER HEADS!Well, in all honesty, its an awesome game.

								This game has been around for a while now, but since its launch, the developers (praise be upon them) have been working non-stop to make this the game they envision to be the best with the help of the opinion of the community. It has grown into a visual stunning crafting/survival game that is quite unique in its setting compared to other (and countless) early acces survival games. Especially since the announcement that the story ending is upon us, The Forest is nearly ready to become a finished game, and by its gameplay it feels like that too. It is still has some bugs and like I said the story ending is still worked upon, but with the regular updates (once a two weeks, normally) alot of those will be fixed in the next few weeks. I would definitely recommend this game to all that enjoy crafting and survival!			"

								I just purchased this game a few days ago.  While I haven't accrued too many hours yet, I will post a review of my experience so far. I've been very impressed so far with the building system in The Forest.  It reminds me of the system for base construction in Fallout 4 except implemented much better.  Placed structures usually mesh nicely with terrain and allow the user to place them almost anywhere, even on top of one another.  You can mesh walls into towers into supports and other structures well to make a continuous base without ugly gaps or places where objects fail to make good contact with uneven terrain.  I've had a lot of fun just building bases with friends.The atmosphere of the game is also well done.  You start stranded on an uncharted island, awakening after a plane crash.  As you explore the island further, you find all kinds of creepy and tortured corpses of other would-be survivors of the plane wreck.  The island is also inhabited by the cannibals, which are similar in appearance to the Forsworn in Skyrim.  There is also ambiance such as wild animals and nice graphics which make the island feel alive.  Night time is very dark and you're often equipped with a lighter or a torch for visibility.  Construction of permanent lamps for your base that never burn out using skulls of slain cannibals lets you create a very homey feeling base against the darkness of the night.  It gives nice atmosphere and feels like you're stranded in a forbidding forest.  If you really hate the night, you can sleep through it, but I enjoy it.The cannibals are a constant threat against survival and they seem to attack in larger and more powerful groups as you survive longer.  Some of them can even destroy some of your walls and structures.  I like this feature, as it feels like you're making a fort to hold against a siege rather than just purely for decoration.  Some of the more advanced enemy creatures are also really creepy looking and add to the atmosphere of The Forest and its mysterious island.  I have often wondered if these were the results of experimentation carried out on other survivors in some Frankensteinian lab or something below the surface.There's also a lot of areas to explore.  You find interesting and unique things located around the island the game is centered on, and there are caves to explore too.  I haven't gotten very deep into these caves yet.  The game also, while giving a good and large map to explore with many interesting places, provides means for avoiding getting lost.  Player nametags are always visible from any distance.  Your base will show up from any distance with a marker.  Lastly, you can place flags and beacons to mark places of interest.  These features make the game navigable.Control of the game is good.  It comes with a full set of keys to remap and adjusters for mouse sensitivity.  As a left-handed gamer, this was important to me.  There is also a wide array of graphics settings to change that get quite in-depth and customizable.  The game's sound is also good.  It has all the pieces in place to make a game enjoyable, and no major things are lacking in this regard.  It's also relatively bug free, especially given it's still early access.  I would make one word of caution for this game, however.  It is a whole lot more fun with friends, and I'd recommend trying it out as a group instead of solo.  I feel that group play is immensely more fun than solo play.  I haven't tried to meet new friends on the game merely through its avenues, but it may prove difficult to network and create new friends in-game on your own as the options available are either solo play or co-op, which allows people to join the game if you invite them off your steam friends list.I recommend this game if you like survival games or enjoy games where you can build bases.  Both these aspects of The Forest are done very well.			"

								I started up the game thinking it was going to be another DayZ/Rust Survival game clone/wannabe. I was horribly horribly wrong. 1st try: Started up, stayed at the airplane, got snatched up by the enemies, died. 2nd: ran far away from the plane, accidently ran into a patrol of enemies 3rd: found the beach, Started making a hut, Patrol saw the hut and ran into it, I was sleeping.4th: Found a beach, decided to wait and watch for patrol, found the patrol not too far away, but far enough away. Built a camp, survived a few nights while building up the camp, made some traps around the hut, expanded. Chopped down a tree without noticing a patrol nearby. They heard it, noticed the camp, ran at the camp. no one was in it, took the food in my fire and left. One stayed behind. I killed the one, next day hear a screech, ran behind a tree, watched the patrol that was there the night before race into the hut. They found their dead partner, screamed, and immedatly ran out in search of me. Fanned out running in every direction, one came across me behind a tree. I struck, he screeched and alerted his pals. I died taking down four of them. I havent encountered even half of the game yet, in the few hours I played I got immersed, horrified of every sound, and awed at the beauty of the forest and ocean. It's a great game already. Yeah it has it's bugs and problems, but it's an alpha. the important part is it's a great game from the beggining. It can only get better from here.			"

								I think the best review I can give is just a recollection of what happened when i played for the first time (it was co-op)  Day 1: I built a tree house with my friend, we spent the night telling spooky stories whilst starving and freezing to death and whilst some nice tribes people were trying to tell us about the word of Jesus, since at the time or writing sleeping was impossible in co-op  Day 2: We looked at the sunrise as the Jehovahs Witness tribes people wondered off into the distance, me and my friend decided that our tree fort wasn't enough so we started work on an actual fort, We made the blueprints for it and dubbed it the ""FORT OF THE SOULBOUND LEG"", it had a nice ring to it. Day 3: Work on the fort was slow, thus we made a ""log sleigh"" strangely the log seemed to occupy two physical planes at once, ""WE HAVE CRATED A TELEPORTER"" I exclaimed as we used the tele-log to build our fort more quickly and efficiently.  Night 3: A few hundred patrols of Jehovahs witnesses located our base and thought that this is the best time to preach the word of god (it being Christmas and all). Me and my friend fended off the tribes people all night until the framerate dropped to about 5 frames per second due to the many many teeth/legs/arms/heads littering the floor. I then set myself on fire and died. Conclusion: Fun game, just needs a ♥♥♥♥ ton of optimization and bug fixes. It is still in alpha so you get what you pay for. overall 7 effigies out of 10  "

								The Forest isn't your run-of-the-mill early access survival game, not at all. The Forest outshines all of it's competitors, which is ironically amusing considering how dark this gem is. Enjoying this game with a friend or four is some of the most fun I've had playing recent games with pals, attemping to survive the cold, desperate nights with the constant intimidating growls and disheartening squeals of the mutant cannibal audiences gathering to watch your hopeless pantomime fall to pieces is thrilling, wild and funny as hell. When playing alone, that's when you experience the true fear this game does so well to conjure up, and you get a, to be expected, more polished singleplayer experience, so don't feel put-off if you don't have another soul to play with, I'd still highly recommend picking it up. The game is constantly being updated (as of 26/06/2016), with plently of exciting features being added and the very welcome bug fixes that make you forget you're playing an 'uncompleted' game. The enemies themselves, the cannibal hordes and hulking messes of mutated limbs all provide a fun and responsive combat experience, the 'things' you'll face in The Forest are truly disturbing, the half naked, starving, blood-covered cannibal women and the giant, baby-like belly-flopping mutants are nicely varied and each encounter leaves the adrenaline rushing and hands sweating, especially at the beginning of the game when you have nothing to defend your sorry self with but a cloth-covered rock and a walkietalkie. The Forest is a fairly well optimised, gritty and immersive true 'survival' horror experience that is well worth it's asking price, and in a sale? Bonus. Get it, for both a great singleplayer and a hilarious multiplayer experience.			"

								Explored a deep, dark cave until I saw some things that I didn't feel comfortable going near. Climbed back up to discover that it was night. Got 2 shotted by a sneaky mutant. Went back to my corpse to retreive some of my items, found him still standing there. Killed him and cut his head and limbs off. Carried his headless corpse to the closest mutant camp and dropped him there infront of his friends. Walked out while they just stood there and stared at me. Returned to my base and ate his legs.I can definitely see some potential in this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite being an early access game, I picked this up since I've saw a few videos of the gameplay and it seems like something that is exiting to play in its current state, and I sure regret nothing. The gameplay is VERY immersive, GUI is rarely in your way and every point of the game it feels like you're in it. As someone who also likes horror games, this one goes high in my list for that genre, the atmosphere can be very creepy and I've spent many days huddled in my treehouse listening to the screams of cannibals in the distance. The combat is also great and there are many possible tactics you can use to suppress the cannibals. Now there are a few annoying bugs here and there but nothing very game-breaking. The graphics are also INSANELY good for a game made by such a small group of people using the unity engine, it definitely makes the game much more appealing.Overall I'll give the game 8.5837/10			"

								This game should be the new standard set for survival games. The first day begins gathering basic supplies: food, water, sticks, rocks, and setting up a basic shelter. It might even seem peaceful at first. Lonely, but peaceful. Then the cannibals arrive. Its the middle of the night, you wonder why sleeping only lasted through half the night as a leader and others in the night patrol encircle your pitifully undefended camp. This is one of the few games that forces you to flee in that situation, leaving everything behind. But then a new day comes! You harvest lumber, you hunt, and you build to survive. But beware, as your impact on the forest becomes more obvious, the cannibals bully you more and more. Truly a spectacular single player experience, and once more bugs are fixed, the same could be said for online play. The only reason this game isnt a perfect 10/10 is some annoying bugs, but it really does feel like a finished product to me, so final rating: 9/10			"

								Guess it's about time I put my 2 cents in about this game. I'll keep it relatively short whilst trying to do it justice. Do I reccomend this game? Hell Yeah!Sure it's Early Access and there are little buggy things here and there getting worked out, but updates are pretty much every 2 weeks with hot patches daily if necessary. However the enviromental effects are superb and improving all the time. I have 250ish screenshots just because as you are playing the game you just say to yourself ""wow that looks amazingly realistic"" and bang goes your finger to the screenshot button. Although the storyline is still developing there is plenty to keep yourself occupied (it is a sandbox type experience with survival elements). You can experiment with building bases, or if you tire of that you can go walking/exploring/rescource gathering, or diving/swimming/rafting or even caving.  At the same time you must attempt to fight off the hungry/angry natives/cannabals/mutants or wildlife, and maintain your levels of hunger/thirst/heat and health (assuming that you are not disabling this via a cheat code/or you are playing solo and not multiplayer which obviously alters the experiance).As far as graphics go, obviously as I said earlier it's really good, but to further touch on this I have to say that the textures are sharp and clear and believable even when close up, and the effects such as looking in the water (objects move and distort with the motion just like real water) the wind blowing through the trees/grass etc make a truly immersive experiance. And of course the believability is further enhanced by the sounds of animals (incl bird songs at dawn) waterfalls and seaside/ocean sounds and falling leaves/crackling fires, and of course the spooky mutant calls/breathing and muttering noises that'll keep you on your toes ready to run/fight. Of course there are some placeholder effects here and there, but it is Early Access.So what do you have to lose for the current price? You would already get more hours of playtime than loads of fully content complete AAA titles and it's only going to get better. In fact it has the potential to become one of the best survival horror sandbox games ever.I rate 8/10 current, 11/10 expected!P.S. After curiously looking to see what some people give negative reviews for, I would say this...a.) You cannot do bugger all in this game in only a couple of hours, and if you are writing a review from that experiance, you are not qualified.b.) If you have trouble surviving or evading the cannabals or having your buildings destroyed, you need to improve your tactics and not blame the game, 1000's of others seem to manage ok (my current game is at day 37), that is not to say it is totally easy, it is a survival horror after all.....and gameplay balancing/AI etc is still being developed.c.) Glitches or bugs (wtf?) Do you not understand the concept of Early Access? Instead of critically reviewing the game, post your bugs and suggestions on the appropriate forums and help this game become the masterpiece it can be. And you're also moaning about what? $15, yet would pay $80-90 for a supposedly complete title of comparible next gen quality.			"

								Day One: Plane went down in the middle of a forest on a remote island. There were only three survivors: Myself, Anthony, and Josh. We gathered what supplies we could from the wreckage; food, cans, circuit boards, and a nifty axe. After grabbing everything we could carry, we made for the coast. I don't know what direction we went. Eventually we found ourselves on the beach. It started raining and we were all freezing. It was miserable. Night came, we huddled close together against a rocky outcropping, munching on snacks and downing sodas. We weren't the smarted when it came to nutrition.Day Two: The sun came up and warmed our bodies, it was the best feeling in the world! We discovered that we were actually quite good at chopping down trees with our tiny little axes. And the trees conveniently turned themselves into logs once chopped down. We had to chase them, as they tried to roll away very quickly. Even so, we discovered that we could carry TWO giant logs at a time! We put the Mountain from Game of Thrones to shame! And we also discovered that the plane crash gave us wonderful construction skills. We had a large cabin built fit for a ski resort in no time at all. And the most wonderful gift of all: FIRE!Day Three:Found berry bushes, good thing too, our food supplies are dwindling. NOTE: DISCOVERED THAT SAID BERRIES MADE US VOMIT UNCONTROLLABLY AND DID NOT MAKE US FEEL ANY BETTER. We set about looking for more food and fresh water sources. Anthony found a lizard and roasted that sucker over a fire. Tasted terrible but filled us up wonderfully. Josh spent an hour chasing a rabbit, ended up getting lost and we had to go searching. We found him hiding in a hole and screaming that we weren't alone on this island. Anthony and I just figured he was losing his damn mind. We eventually calmed him down and got him back to camp and had some more lizard meat. Still no fresh water though, still living off of sodas. We ended up building a large bonfire with logs and sticks but ultimately failed at lighting it. Oh well...Day Four:Early morning I awoke to find that Anthony was gone. Josh and I gathered a few things and went out searching. It felt like hours before his screams echoed through the forest. We rushed to the source but were intercepted by Anthony breaking through the brush like a mad man, urging us to turn around. We did, he wasn't normally one to overreact. Josh's sarcasm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. ""Now do you believe me?"" He had asked in a smug tone. I was still skeptical. Anthony was shook up bad, claiming he was abducted and taken to a cave full of half eaten humans and full of weird mutated cannibals. Whatever, these two are going nuts. I need to start planning on ways to get rid of them...Day Five:I was wrong! I WAS SO WRONG!!! These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s came from the trees by the dozens! I had a bow with some arrouws but the damn thing was difficult to aim! I used up what I had and switched to my axe. That worked much better. These things are fast though! Josh ended up lobbing Molotovs at them and Anthony smacked them with a skull club he had made. We drove them off but suffered some nasty wounds. They'll be back, and next time we will be ready...Day Six: We weren't ready, halfway through building a defensive wall around the camp they came again. With many, many more. Anthony was taken down at the start, they mobbed him viciously. Josh♥♥♥♥♥♥himself and made for the water. I turned in time to see him devoured by a damn shark. What the hell is wrong with this place?! I am hiding inside the cabin we built, I hear the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s outside. Their screams and grunts will not allow me any sleep. I hope this isn't the end...Day Seven: I'm still alive. The cannibals are still out there, I hear them. Hell I can smell them. I dare not stick my head out the window to look. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!? THEY MATERIALIZED THROUGH THE WALL!!! HEEELLLLLP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Recommend 10/10Would be killed by glitching cannibal again.			"

								The zenith of this game was when I found the Katana.I had chopped down half the forest with my axe, smited many foes with my rock, and lit many mutants ablaze with molotovs and time bombs, but this katana was something else...While wielding this weapon of unholy power, I did my duty and proceeded to slice and dice every mutant I could find. Many fell, and I built monuments to commemorate the slaughter. My killing spree came to an end on a lowly night when I was ganked by a group of about 20 mutants while hunting crocodiles.I regret nothing.			"

								I highly recommend this game! not only is it graphicly stunning but so much attention to detail has been paid to the intricacies within the gameplay. The A.I. is great and has ironicly been the cause of some bad reviews because people simply haven't understood that the natives have so many different character traits and responses to your interaction with them. Sometimes you cause fear, sometimes intrigue, these natives don't act in a singular 'standard' manner. Your interaction with them and the habitat around you all contribute to the circumstances you will find yourself in.Early Access can be a minefield, I know, I have supported quite a few but I would like to point out that the developers of this game are the most hard working and dedicated team I have come across in the Early Access Genre. (If you don't believe me, go and check out their changelog for the last 12 months) As soon as you boot the game it will tell you when the next update is due (on average, every 28 days) and every update consists of a massive list of changes, fixes and tweaks.There is no good reason I can think of not to buy this game if you like the survival genre, it ticks more boxes than any other game of it's type. Even in its early access state it is fantastic!!11/10			"

								Even with this game being in Early Access, I still find it really fantastic and I'm sure you will too if you're a fan of survival horror that's not all about PVP and killing other player/zombies and loot the weapons. This game really focus on surviving and building. It has so much potential and many great things are still being added to the game to make it even more awesome! The developers themselves has been working well with that too, a while ago the game didn't even have multiplayer and now it's already working nicely with steam! There are little bugs here and there but each updates are really promising. I really recommend this game to play with your friends!			"

								Considering that its Alpha stage, its brilliant.The game itself at this stage, is well worth the money....There are many types of animal to prey on, kill, skin and eat/used to craft, so far ive seen lizards, deer, rabbits, fish, turtles, racoons, birds, and boar... of which, can be used to craft/cook....With headhphones on, the game is engaging and spooky, never knowing when you might be being spied upon or spotted by the enemy, the eery noise that alerts you when you've been seen or even if they.re suspicious.... ...some of them sound like 'Lord of The Rings' Smeegle on a bad day, ...sinister giggles... footsteps in the dark... O_____O  ...Sometimes the mustants/cannibals will back off and run away, but sometimes there will be a group of them (and i believe they communicate between groups with distance between them, however it may just be me making it up in my head through in game paranoia)...they will chase you, try to knock you out...to take you to their pitch black, damp and spooky cave, corpses hanging from the ceilings...       -of which you have to (try to) escape,sometimes seemingly impossible-to-navigate cave sections, with only a lighter of which to find your way out with... which occasionally goes out, only to be re lit, to sometimes come face to face withyour captors... ...and they dont give second chances once they've caught you.The lower than expected requirements needed to run it -(considering the amount of things going on/large array of plant and animal diversity and quantity -depending on your graphical option settings-as far as plantlife is concerned), i'd assume this is down to the ability of the developers/game engine... **CAUTION**For your first few hours i'd caution you all that, until you are completely familiar with the workings of the game, you should have been to the toilet before you sit down to play, because-(...and to note,  i'm not usually easily spooked)... -there is something about 'The Forest'- that makes it stand out from others within the same genre...The fluid/ slightly tactical movements made by the mutants,cannibals and animals, with their seemingly non standard boundaries of usual survival/openworld games, alongside the noises created by animals, yourself,the enemy or background noise, the fear of being found in the first few hours...Looking forward to future updates and (minor) bugfixes, well done to the developers.

								Absolutely terrific if you're into early access survival games and an absolutely terrific place to start if you're not. (TL;DR at bottom)While most would say the story mode sets it apart, it's GIGANTIC island environment, or the stunningly intelligent AI, I think what sets this game apart from others is the amount of options you have. This is key for any survival game, yet most miss out on it. With Rust, for example, you can play solo but chances are you wont get anywhere past a 2x2 home before getting raided by a group or another solo player OR you could be in a massive group, build a massive base and be touched by practically no one except other massive groups. The Forest, however, has a plethora of options to choose from: you can live on land and fight off waves of mutants, move from temporary shelter to temporary shelter and hide from the mutants, build a house boat and live on the water, or just go on a rampage and hunt down every last mutant you find(they don't infinitely respawn) to claim the island yours. And the AI is simply the best I've ever seen(if I could buy this game once if it meant one other game gets AI as good or better than this, I would not stop buying this game) They are so unique they practically amplify your options: They don't know you exist when you start, giving you a chance to have different playing styles when encountering them. They are programmed to calculate and strategize, so if one of them sees your house and runs away, just know that your security needs to be amped up. The only things I complain about with the AI are that there are no projectile shooting mutants, which makes living on the water pretty damn OP if you don't have to return to the shore at all. Another thing is that there are tribes of these mutants that do fight each other and I feel that hasn't been used enough. I hope this game does get to the point where you can befriend tribes and rival others in both single player and co-op modes. TL;DR:PROS:-Super intelligent AI(even for early access)-Options and freedom(which most early access games miss out on)-Story mode(it's being worked on but still)CONS-Optimization(pretty much the plague of every early access game. You could  just run it on low memory mode but it looks horrible)-The need/lack of tribe mechanisms(I cannot stress this enough, this would be an amazing feature if you could join tribes, rival them, etc)Final rating 9.8/10 buy this game. If it's on sale DEFINITELY buy it "

								I don't write reviews for no good reason, so if you happen to see this, please take time to read. This my first 8 hour impression of The Forest.I play too many survival games, its the genre of the hour these days it seems. I have problems with survival games... I love them, but they're broken, culturally in most cases and mechanically in others. I've owned The Forest for 6 months now and never put an ounce of time into it. I've played Rust, I've played Landmark, Ark, DayZ (modded well before all this alpha crap started). The list could contiune on for quite some time. I'll be honest, most days I want to go back to the time when Steam asked us to vote on ""Steam Greenlight"" and change my vote... but for The Forest this is not the case. The Forest is well done for an alpha of nearly 6 months, I played by myself, but not co-op yet as I don't expect much from a partially finished game, especially in a multiplayer environment. It seems there is a very interesting story developing underneath all these neat mechanics they have. Crafting is relatively easy and some of the hand-made tools make it challenging at first to figure out what the hell to do. They all seem to work to some extent though. When I played there were 4 types of housing, 4 fires and multiple tools to make, along with other stuff to do, it was enough to keep me busy in single player mode without the cannibals until I had nothing left to build. The game itself is visually stunning - runs great with minimal bugs (FOR AN ALPHA KEEP IN MIND). I expect to see them so I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the time I fell through the world, or the time I ""woke up"" dead. Things I liked:*Trees fall organically, as in - it doesn't just spray you with materials... the tree falls and then explodes into logs *neat!**World looks AMAZEBALLS - even on medium settings it looks nice.*Lighting works, mostly. I expect lighting errors during development, this had... very few in the 8 hours I played. *Focus on Co-op -- from the very little I played against the cannibals... I can tell this game is going for force a cooperative experience rather than shove ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s down your throat like other survival games do. I like that.*The AI.... acts scary... as in, I was followed by a scout, who took great care to hug the bushes... first few times I thought I was seeing things... until I squarely saw him run from bush to bush.. sneaky son of a ♥♥♥♥♥... The combat was... a little bit to get used to at first as it seems the hitboxes might be off -- however its more likely that I just suck at it. Things I didn't like:*Eating and drinking are broken like in EVERY survival game - this game does a far better job of managing it than others, still I find myself wondering how one man goes through 7 lizards in one day... big♥♥♥♥♥lizards, not your garden variety ""Oh how cute its a lizard"" -- I'm talking Bearded dragon status...If it were a normal day, I've have eaten 7 times in 16 hours...*Climbing ropes was... awkward, you can use your lighter but not your weapon (thats odd, I have two hands..)*Explosives useage was... disappointing, dynamite for a piece of rope... c'mon... I assume this will be fixed later.*Fire does not burn nearly as long as ""The Forest"" name would suggest... I'm not asking for the entire place to burn down, but those 3 molotovs certainly would've brought Smokey the Bear out in my neighborhood... He didn't even know it happened here.The devs have obviously put some time and thought into this game, I'd liked to have seen more from 6 months worth of development however when you consider its basically a basement coding operation (2 guys from my understanding) I am quite impressed with what they have to offer. If you're looking for a full survival experience I am confident that when this game releases it will be one of the better versions of that experience, right now I found myself simply wanting more from the experience - more to build, more to do, more to... oh god, whats that?!    ""GET AWAY FROM ME CANNIBALS!!!!!!!"" Did I mention the AI is.... scary good?Although I was able to spend nearly 5 hours exploring the island... just exploring and still had a good time checking out the world they built. Some parts seem a little lifeless still but its obvious they're still fleshing this world out. I'm banking on this game being a 9/10 when it finally releases.			"

Early Access Review
								THE MOST IMMERSIVE GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED(multiplayer thoughts, and update comments at the bottom)I've been gaming for over 30 years and I've never experienced anything quite as special as The Forest is.Very quickly, you're the lone survivor of a plane crash on an unknown island and your task is to find and rescue your kidnapped son - okay, maybe the devs lied about you being the only survivor of that crash.To do this you have to craft, build, explore, defend yourself, and survive long enough to track him down before the local cannibals figure out he's their equivalent of nice juicy veal steak. Yum yum.PROSEnvironment/Atmosphere/Mood- Very nice graphics. The flora of the woodland - from the grass and ferns to the tallest trees, and pretty much everything in between - transports you away to a rustic, lush green island and thoroughly immerses you there.- Truly pitch black conditions at night (apart from when the moon is out) and in caves. THIS is what Skyrim should have been. Navigating at night is difficult and very dangerous. Do you just sleep through the night or press on with your work?- The best caves and cave exploration I've ever seen in a game. The general design for them is great, and you truly do get a sense of clautrophobia that hightens the tension of an already scary game. Some of the caves are very long too so you have to make sure you're thoroughly prepared before you dare disappear into the blackness.- The wind blows through the forest, pushing all the leaves and bushes and creating wonderful rustling sounds all around you. You must experience it to feel how atmospheric it is!- The distant running of underground streams and the dripping of water from the ceiling create a wonderful sense of being deep in an ancient cave. The sound effects are truly great.- I was chasing a raccoon with a spear and it jumped up onto a tree and ran up the trunk to the top. How cool is that? I wasn't expecting that and it surprised me immensely (in a good way).- The best inventory system in a game I've ever seen. All your items are laid out on a sheet of tarp as if you've just emptied out your rucksack onto the ground. You can then place different items in the centre area to try and combine them into new things. This is an excellent crafting system, as you have to experiment to find out what will combine to produce what.- The cannibals make some truly disturbing noises, especially when they're asleep in the caves.Combat- Very satisfying first person combat with melee and ranged weapons, molotovs and even DIY explosives. Everything you could possibly need to get rid of those pesky cannibals.- You can craft and lay traps to capture or kill the cannibals. Just place them on the ground and then sit back to enjoy the view.Survival- Excellent survival experience. You'll have to become very good at chasing fast rabbits if you don't want to starve to death. You'll also need to be looking out permanently for sources of fresh water - I almost died of thirst during my first in-game day. Other factors to take into consideration are the cold and succumbing to illness/infection. Although these last two still appear to be in development at the time of writing.Gameplay- A free building system (similar to that in Rust) that allows you to build pretty much any kind of base you'd like.- You can build an Ewok village in the trees! :D- A survival game with a story and end game scenario quest. Moreover, not just any story; but one you will care about and will want to work towards completing. You will want to survive, adapt, and rescue your kidnapped son.- Lumberjacking is a strangely satisfying and soothing experience.- The devs have meticulously hand-crafted a large island with unique places to discover (No procedural generation here!). You really will have to work to discover quite a few of the hidden things in caves and in amongst the dense foliage above ground.Extra Info- VERY polished for an early access title.- Great value for money at the current asking price. I would have happily paid 2 or 3 times as much - even in its current state.- Very stable for early access. I've experienced only a few minor issues.CONS- It's still only in early access stage :'( - Objects that you can pick up (sticks and rocks for crafting) glow and flash - this truly does break the immersion. Please give us the option to turn this off!- Combat still lags and jerks, and also freezes for a second (this seems to be most obvious when a cannibal jumps at you). This is frustrating because you lose the flow of the fight and you'll have to spin your character around desperately looking for your attacker before they hit you from some completely unsuspected angle.- Occasionally, a cannibal will hit you and you'll go flying 100 feet into the air. The punch won't kill you, but the fall sure will.***Multiplayer Review Update***Personally, I prefer the forest in single player mode, as it gives you that true feeling of isolation on a hostile island. But multiplayer, with up to 8 people, is very enjoyable. It's definitely easier, as you can fight the cannibals together (3 of us took down a group of 5 of them very quickly) and building is much quicker. With extra pairs of hands you can build elaborate structures rather quickly.There are some bugs, however, e.g. sounds and certain textures not working/triggering properly. These seem to occur when your CoOp partners are interacting with the environment and enemies. I think it must be because of some sort of lack of synchronisation between the server and players.I've deliberately kept this part of the review short, sorry, but mulitplayer is definitely recommended. Especially if you have some good friends to run around and hack and slash with :)***10th December 2015 UPDATE***After this latest update your actions in the environment really seem to affect whether the cannibals can find you.I lit a fire (just as an experiment) and then ran away to a safe distance. Sure enough, one minute later I can see an enemy running around my makeshift camp clearly searching for who or what built it.I also started lumberjacking in a remote area - again as an experiment. Five trees later, and one stump destroyed with an explosive, and there were loads of them just flocking to where I'd been working! That put me in a lot of danger, and in the end all I could do was run away to safety, abandoning what could have been my new home.The Forest just keeps getting better and better! :)If you'd like to know more, especially about multiplayer, feel free to leave questions below and I'll get back to you.If you didn't find this helpful, do let me know why - thanks :)			"

								It's a really engaging game you can play at your own pace. For me it's very therapeutic. Chop some wood, gather some rocks. Mix plants to make medicine and make food. Grow seeds.Deforest the area, kill the natives, chop op their bodies and display it with countless effigies, use their bones as a fence, use their skulls as lamps. Really all around very calming game, would definetly reccomend.			"

								The Forest is currently not 100% completed, so it leaves a lot to be desired. There's nothing worse than playing an open world, exploration game and seeing there is an area that is not yet available. The crafting and building aspect of the game is very fun and the learning curve is very quick to figure out. The Cannibals are very realistic and diverse in the way they approach you, and each of them have their own unique way of dealing with you as well. I like the fact that when you do die, you have a chance of waking up in an underground hold, which is either lightly guarded or not at all. But your health is severely reduced along with your hunger pains, but you do keep all of your crafted weapons, medicine, food etc. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but when my health is depleted and have armor left I usually end up alive in one of the underground camps. The ""Calm Mode"" is okay I guess for people that want to use it as a building simulator, but there just isn't enough content to keep me interested or entertained without having the Cannibals as company. You are able to use ""Calm Mode"" as a crutch, so that you can set up your whole camp to a tee; and then use it in regular mode with the Cannibals with a huge advantage, if you wish. The atmosphere and constant weather changes are very nice to look at as well.  So I have mixed feelings about this game. The positives outweigh the negatives for me, but I will say that this game is not for everyone, especially if you crave constant action, or a narrative.			"

								I could write a little story about any number of awesome situations this game will throw at you. But I don't feel like it truely explains what you will be buying.Here is what this game offers:Pretty graphics - The game looks awesome,from watching the sunrise because you finally got a break from the night raiding parties to watching the sun disappear knowing things go bump in the night and every moment inbetween is beautiful. Focused crafting - Everything has a purpose or is planned to have a purpose..even the little things like cutting up a cannibal and showcasing him in your yard will upset his buddies.Active devs - I've never seen another EA project match their dedication. On the home menu, it literally has a countdown timer for the upcoming patch. These devs actually give themselves a deadline so they don't lose focus and they use that time to give meaningful updates and minor changes. They listen to their customers. I've seen them add features, tweak features and remove features based on feedback. Your opinion matters here.True horror - Players have put hundreds of hours into the forest, explored every inch of the island, built a fortress and slayed hundreds of cannibals...yet still refuse to leave their base at night or dive deeper into the caves unless they're stuffed with flares and explosives. There is an element of fear in this game that you never really get used to. Things lurk in the shadows, make unnerving sounds, harass you at night, sneak up on you during the day and drag you into the dark when they win.A story - Son gets nabbed, theres a door in a hole. Right now, the story is still in the works and I expect it will be all the way up to release. but, little things are released here and there that really  make you want more.Building - Matched with a horror atmosphere, this is done really well. You build with wood, sticks and stones. You can lay a blueprint for a pre-built structure or build something unique piece by piece. You can build in the tree tops or out in the ocean..both have their positives and negatives. Building a base will keep out the night but there is no promise of safety as things can still find a way in.Truely, a game I love.			"

The Forest is an amazing sandbox game that is in early access full of mystery and thrill and as the name says you're in a forest.The things that i loved of this game and as others of its kind, is that you have to craft things to survive, since a small building up to a big fortress, find food / fire / water to survive another day.But isn't all, you're not alone here:The story begins when your plane crash and lands in an island, a naked cannibal (or a native from the forest) takes your son and you have to find him (but it's on early access and there is not campaign yet) and you have to survive and defend from the cannibals and the mutants from the forest, finding secrets about what happened in the island and weapons to survive, these are the story points.Now the facts of the game makes it an unique experience, apart from the story:- The craft system is small but good.- There are only a few animals (deers, birds, boars, turtles,etc.) not much as there is in real forests.- The 50% of the time that you spend on this game is chopping trees- You can make your custom buildings- The cannibals / mutants come from nowhere to ruin your day / buildings. You have to combat them- The graphics look quite amazing- And as this game still in Alpha version it has some bugs, but these devs works on it on coming updates quickly. Each update is full of cool thingsThe Forest is one of the best open world / survival games that i have, i'm 100% sure to recommend this game for you if you want to have fun, or get some jumpscareLooking forward to seeing where the game goesIf you have enjoyed this review, please consider to follow our Curator pageThis review was written for : The Panda's Corner "

Early Access Review
								From the time this game was released I did not play it until November 1st for the simple reason I knew it was in early stages of Alpha and had a long road ahead of it. With that said I feel like I have done about everything there is to do in the game after playing it for less than a week when I started.The graphics are astounding, and the ease of blueprints and controls are really a plus for me.The mutants are challenging but it can be EXTREMELY frustrating for a new players in Single Player Mode not knowing what to do. I have come across several people who ""just bought the game"" and they joined co-op to figure out how to simply survive regardless of the mutants.The survival guide gives you very basic information, and up until the last patch I was googling some of the most basic weapons to craft and now they have added the materials needed in the back of the survival guide.Sure pick up some soda, drink some dirty water from a pond, or boil water if you can find the pot - Sure it sounds easy to a veteran player, but for somebody new to this game they are completely oblivious. I will say I am seeing a trend like this with Survival games where the developers want you to figure out things on your own. Either you continously die until you give up or join coop or you survive to see another day.With all that said, the game could really use some major improvements. There are some simple bugs like the log glitch that can be duplicated without using cheats or mods. Theres the log issue where the trees do not generate logs after so long. There are times when a player will go down and is not ""saveable"" or resurrectable. The traps and tree houses do not disappear if the trees are cut down. ""This is recent as they did before the last patch""Players need the motivation to complete missions, explore caves, craft new items, customize their bases. Everything in this game is quite primitive. The most technological item is a bomb or a explosive trap. The bow weapon is very simple. It could easily be upgraded to a compound bow, or you could find an upgraded bow off of a chieftan or a boss.If there is a spawn of an armsy for example there should be an alert that comes across your screen to where everyone can hunt it down and kill it. Then the Armsys only drop certain kinds of materials to craft certains things. (Just a thought)There needs to be locations on the map where players stumble upon different tribes with different technologies. The compound or upgraded bow is a good example. Blowguns, tommahawks, Spiked clubs, slingshots, bone armor, helmets that are craftable out of animal hide or bones.One thing I would be very happy to have craft is....  a SHEILD, SHEILD SHEILDs!!!!! Give us a sheild!The mutants or tribes are distinguishable by their posture, heigth, effigys, and color of their skin. The tribes and buildings need to be more distinguished and unique compared to each other.Some people complain that this game is too easy while others complain that it is too hard. I am an adult and have over 100 hours logged on this game or close to. I will say that by about day 5 the mutants, cannibles, whatever you want to call them easily overwhelm you if you do not have a simple base or unless you are living in a cave.It takes roughly 4-8 hits to kill a mutant while it only takes them 3-4 hits to destroy you. The fire mutants fire damage only takes about 1/8th of your health down which seems like it should take more down if they are burning you for 8 seconds. While if I get touched by a pale mutant im down in about 2 or 3 hits.... So in a nut shell I have to use the traps or hit them from a distance. I really don't think there is close combat in this game unless you have all of your armor or you can burn them OR you have a weapon you can swing fast enough and does enough damage to knock them on their butts. Otherwise they roll over you easily.There needs to be more wild life. Sure boars, deer, sea turtles, tortoises, rabbits, lizards, racoons, crocodiles, squirrels, and fish are great. Lets add some mountain lions that prowl low and can randomly attack you when you least expect it or maybe some coyotes at night that are in packs that are sounding off and cackling arounding you.What happened to the sharks? I have yet to see a shark in the sea. I don't feel threatened at all unless im freezing. Maybe even a prehistoric sea creature in the sea would be amazing.The game doesn't have a leveling aspect. Meaning that you don't have to spend time to unlock blueprints, structures, or craftable items - I REALLY LOVE THIS.With everything said, I can tell you (The Devs) really put alot of time and effort into this game. I am pleased with the product the way it is for $15.00 bucks. I am just hoping that the game is more customizable, and adds a variety of different crafting items... LIKE SHEILDS, house blueprints (like fireplaces) and chimneys, and the tribes need to be more unique and distinguishable.In the current state im not 100% happy with the game, but I know its in Alpha and the Devs have plans. With that said im going to recommend this game to friends which I have already done.Kudos to The Forest Creators and Devs			"

								Day 1:I've crash landed on a strange island. Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.Day 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.Day 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.Day 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.Day 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.Day 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.Day 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.Day 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.Day 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?Day 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.Day 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.Day 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.Day 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out ""YMCA"". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...Day 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.10/10 would decend into madness again.			"

Early Access Review
								I REALLY like this game. It started off with many bugs, but has come a LONG way! The reasons I like this game:1) The AI: The AI is extremely impressive. The natives apparently climb up trees (I say apparently because I have not seen it myself), have hunting parties and scouts, are creepy and it's hard to predict their next move. E.G I encountered a group of 3 natives once, and they ran around me and made some form of a triangular shape around me. I went forward to one of them who backed away. Then I turned to another one who dashed forward, and instead of attacking me like I thought they would, they stopped closer to me, where I then attacked them. This time one of the others came at me from behind and the other made a load roar/shrieking sound alerting their friends of my presence. The hit from behind stunned my character and I was brought down by the natives.2) The Atmosphere: The game produces an eerie atmosphere, especially at night. When I hear a native laughing or screaming it sends me running to my base, or hiding from them wherever I can. Even when there are no natives around, I'm still at the ready, as I never know when I might come across a native hunting party.3) The Graphics: For an indie game the graphics are amazing! The light coming through the leaves is a nice touch. The graphics are stunning for an indie game. End of.4) The Gameplay: Now the most important part of the game. The gameplay. I do like good graphics but when there's good gameplay ,good graphics aren't NEEDED (THIS DOES NOT MEAN EITHER OR. I LIKE BOTH TOGETHER!). The game is a great mix of horror and survival, not making it like a horror game where you find a few cool items and nothing else, but at the same time not making it like a hardcore survival game with some enemies, hardly capable of stopping you. It balances the two just right. It is best to gather resources to build a base, and then look for resources to make more tools to aid my fight against the natives. There are still a few unique tools, that cannot be crafted, but I won't say what they are because you might  want to find out for yourself and get a great feeling when you find them. The natives are powerful, creepy and terrifying. Now scores!The AI: I think they are a great enemy to have in the game, and this is in an alpha build! Some little glitches but overall they're great. 9.5/10The Atmosphere: It's eerie and suits the game perfectly! I like a good atmosphere in a game, and The Forest really deserves a mention for the atmosphere it creates. Obviously co-op is a little less scary, but they can probably find a way to make it a creepy a singleplayer. 9/10The Graphics: The graphics are brilliant for an indie game, but there is room for some improvement. Also playermodels are limited but who really cares what you look like in a game? 8.5/10The Gameplay: The atmosphere and the gameplay work very well together. Obviously some room for improvement. 9/10Overall: I've had so much fun playing The Forest. I will have a lot more fun playing The Forest. The game is a great game overall. It has many elements to it, and will still get better... 9.5/10P.S I don't really write reviews for games, but The Forest definetely deserved one.			"

								$15...... $15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars guys. Who can't scrape together $15 to play one of the single greatest survival games on the market. Not only is the gameplay truely terrifyingly splendid, with cannibal packs roaming the land and evil creatures lurking in the caves. Not only does the storyline grip you, especially at the end, and make you question yourself morally. And not only does this game have the single greatest base building system mechanics I've ever experienced. It's also only $15 dollars. Just buy the game it's the price of a movie in the theaters and will gain you many more hours of entertainment.			"

								There is this problem, games start in alpha, copy someone else's idea and then they have the nerve to charge you almost 30 bucks to help them make the game suck less then it does, that is if they even plan on getting it out of alpha. Lucky for us, The Forest is none of that crap.I have owned this game since it came out, based on a recommendation of a friend, and I do not regret buying this one. The game looks great for starters. The graphics are somewhere in between a Unity game and a AAA title release. The sounds are fine. No music unless you choose to play it with the in game Walkman so it is very immersive. The fact that your enemy is cannibles and not something worn out like zombies or Russians brings new elements to the game. Tons of options to build and craft. Day/night system as well as weather. There is an ultimate goal, but they are adding the story elements as they go so for now it is mostly a sandbox survival game. The best part has to be playing online with your friends and all the silly stuff that can happen like messing around on the walkie-talkie or stepping on a turtle shell and being launched into the air. They even give you updates as to when the next patch is coming so you feel involved in the development (they even listen to your feedback).TL;DR:      Survival crafting game where you fight off cannibles. Still in alpha yet there is high hopes. Tons of fun for single and multiplayer.			"

								V0.52 reviewThe Forest is a survival horror game, in which the player has to survive in an island infested with cannibalistic mutants. The game starts with your character and his son crash landing in a plane. Your son is then taken by the mysterious man in red. The player must use the resources on the island to not only find your son, but survive.  There are many tools available for the player to use, all found in the players best friend; the survival guide. In the pages of the survival guide, players will have access to all kinds of tools and structures. Everything from log cabins, gazebos, walls, catapults, water collector, drying racks, noose traps and even effigies made of human remains can be found in the survival guide. Players can build everything by collecting resources from the island such as rocks, logs, sticks, leaves, turtle shells and even bones. These structures and tools help defend the player against waves of cannibals. The sound of The Forest is atmospheric and scary. Nothing is more terrifying than quietly cutting down a tree and suddenly hearing footsteps running towards you.  The art design and how the island looks and feels work wonders for The Forest. The island feels like a living breathing thing the longer the player is on it. Even the trees have a tendency to look like people. The graphics are not the best, but for an alpha build it fits quite well. The game is littered with bugs but those will be patched out, however the bugs do affect the immersion.  The story of The Forest is slightly hidden, only being revealed when the player finds photographs, drawings or magazines. The story overall, is fantastic, however, not much is official even after the release of the ""ending."" Fan theory's and speculation aside, the backstory remains a mystery, while the main story is fairly straightforward. Overall, The Forest does a lot of things right: The story is rich Genuinely scaryThe multiplayer is solid and funThe building mechanics work well The enemy's have varietyThe enemy AI can be extremely clever Atmospheric Wide variety of tools and weapons Weapons and tool modifications can be applied The Forest does a few things wrong:Extremely buggy Enemy AI can be buggy The ending can be confusing to someCan be slow to start Sometimes difficult when playing alone (more so on hard mode)The Forest is still a work in progress build, that being said, it has come a long way and shows promise. Overall The Forest is a fantastic game, especially with friends. This game, when completed, will be a new peak in survival horror. If you're a fan of the genre, pick it up. It's a great deal of fun alone, and even more enjoyable with friends. The cost of $16.99CND is well worth it.Have a good one. ~Doc "

								This game is pants pee-ingly good, but good luck trying to get your friends to play it with you after watching the trailer (believe me, I've tried).The thing I like most is that there's absolutely no way to avoid the monsters. I've tried swimming to the middle of the lake during the night -- it rained and my character began to get hypothermic. I tried building my shelter on an island -- I kept running out of food and fire tinder and eventually sharks began appearing in the surrounding water and the mutants were waiting for me on the shore. I tried to build my shelter on a mountain -- they got suspicious after I was picking too many blueberries.The AI in this game is incredible. The only way I can manage to escape them is to build a new shelter made of sticks every day, but then the game loses its horror aspect and becomes a scavenging game (not a bad thing, imo).The only downside to this game is that I'm too scared to play it normally. I've tried building a log cabin, but I got a bit chickened out after groups of 4 of them started appearing and their legs multiplied .. so there's that.This is the only game to have scared me other than Amnesia and Exmortis, so needless to say, I am impressed :)10/10 would press 'esc' key again			"

								JUNE 4TH, 2015 UPDATE: The game is very polished at this point with a few bugs here and there. I highly recommend playing it with a friend too although multiplayer can be somewhat laggy sometimes. Fantastic game with great devs who care about the game and haven't let up since release.NOVEMBER 1ST UPDATE: This game is what early access games should be. Since my last update they have piled on gigabites of patches and the game is fully playable and optimised. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games, but beware, do not expect to survive long. This game is hard and if you don't play smart, you will die within the first day. I'd now give the game a 8.5/10.JUNE 16TH UPDATE: The devs for the game just optimised the absolute crap out of this game. I have gone from getting 15 fps on maximum graphics to a steady 50 fps on maximum. Before the game was terribly optimised and would lag, even on the lowest settings, now it feels literally like it looks in the trailer! Fantastic job dev team! You guys are awesome!ORIGINAL RELEASE REVIEW: After playing 10 hours of this game, I can safely say that this is going to be one of the best survival games you could likely ever ask for. It is missing a lot of things and game isn't really stable right now, but this game is going to be amazing, mark my words. If you want to get in early, spend the 15 dollars to help the devs because it's going to be between 30-45 dollars when it is released.If you're after a Minecraft/Rust/DayZ experience with a side of horror, you will enjoy this when it's finished I guarantee.I'd give this game a 7/10 as of the very first release. I've been following the 4 man dev team for The Forest for nearly 2 years now and I honestly expect great things from this game.			"

								WARNING:I'm only recommending this game because of the direction it's going, it's awesome developers, and it's very high promise. PROS:- Very awesome concept, lots of promise, great developers that give great updates about the progress of the game.- Cheap investment with potentially high returns of a $30-$50 game. - Very cool plot, reminds me of Bioshock (even a similar intro sequence) but you're stuck in a forest with a bunch of 28 Days Later style zombies/monsters- Crafting system is easy, awesome, and very useful for when you find a safe place to settle- The gathering/hunting/inventory/survival aspects are all very realistic and fun to do, unlike Rust.- Very gorgeous game for it's level of developmentCONS:- The save feature is atrocious. Had to start over several times and got so annoyed I've stopped playing.- The enemies are very easy to kill, not scary at all, and far and few between. Not at all like the trailer and getting attacked is a rarity. Making setting traps feel useless.- It's basis of survival is very easy to achieve. Took me about 3-4 hours to have a log cabin, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of traps, wood/sticks stockpiled, and a wall all around my area. I think I was attacked maybe twice over the entire time and it was by singular enemies. - Zero objectives. The intro makes it out like you're gonna try and find your child while fending off this enemy horde and trying to survive on this remote island but there's literally nothing to do. I got so bored that I explored the entire island, collected all the pages of my survival book, attacked large mobs of the weird people with only an axe and lived. - Physics are off. I'll walk into a random zombie encampment and the tables and chairs will randomly shoot straight into the air. When I chop down trees the logs explode and I'll have to chase them down. CONCLUSION:If you got the money and the patience, go ahead and buy it; even if you don't plan on installing it for awhile. It's got a lot right going for it. A few bugs that are easy to work out and some difficulty/objective issues to smooth out but other than that it's a great game for being in just alpha. The developers give frequent updates on the game that make it easy to follow even if you don't decide to install it just yet. I feel like my money is actually going toward a great project with this game instead of others I've invested in that turned crap (Rust, Nether, etc.)			"

								I clearly remember when i bought this game, it was back at V 0.06, and i believe the game had just implemented co-op.Like litterally a week before, i remember this beacuse after looking at trailers, and everything ( the game already had me there ) , i wanted to know why thoose 10 percent or whatever, had given this game a bad review. Now alot of times it might be beacuse of a bug, but sometimes you find that one guy inbetween, who actually tells you 100 percent complete review of the game, and even tho he likes it , it still made it to the negative in the end.This game however, only had bad reviews beacuse of people who didnt understand the diffrence between ""Pre-alpha"" and a game like World of Warcraft.enough said, i'm here to tell you about my experience.As i said before, i started playing this game at 0.06, this means that the game was a complete mess.i remember bugs we had like unlimited wood, and the log sled that flew up in the air, but never returned back down again. But that doesn't matter, me and my brother had lots of fun exploiting the game after we had our fun running through the caves.The thing is, even tho the game was so unbelievably glitchy, that at times you wanted to punch a child, the game itself astounded me and my friends.I remember the very first day, i was looking more at the details of the tree and leafs and how my axe was chopping into this tree, almost like it was surgecly removing the tree as it was supposed to irl. ( a bit faster, but if you wanna do it like real life, i suggest you go out and do it, in real life) That same day, my brother asked me do you get damage if the tree falls into your head ? i smiled a bit, and told him sure why not, thinking to myself that a game like this wouldnt do that.But not only have you done this, you have taken my breath away countless times now.I keep relogging every now and then, and read your updates to see what's new, and whenever i see something that i REALLY need to do, i get the crew back and we build, expand and explore !This is propably one of the best well though and well designed games, i've seen in a while.The passion theese guys have for the game is amazing.again and again they take our breath away with survival aspects, not like any other game. Atleticism, custom buildings, ramps and a roof above your head. Constant upgrades to the game that you just can't complain about.Not only do they have what you think should be here, but the research is so good, that they are doing stuff i never even thought about myself. Turtles, use their shield for water collector, Rabbits, use their skin to collect berries,Deer's, well let's make a water pouchI won't spoil to much, but i like that everything that is in the game, is there not only for being watched at, beacuse god the graphics are beautiful, but they also have a purpose.So if you look away from the glitchy buggy stuff, that all of us (gamers), know can and should be in Pre-alpha, let's look at the game and give that some grades. First the graphics :       This is an easy one, the graphics is 10 out of 10, again there is unpolished areas, but the trees beeing cut into, cannibals and the island itself is an absolutely amazing place, it is almost like wonderland, and this game will surpass alot of the other ones out there once it's done. Second the Audio and the mood of the game :       I had to add that beacuse thoose two are one and same, without the other they won't do.Again they've nailed it, from crazy thunder, to water dropping down from the ceiling in caves, or crazy screams throughout the night, this game sets the mood for you, not vice versa.that's another 10 out of 10  Now on this one i was trying to figure out something, beacuse we can't give a game grades on what it has, when it is developing everything it has, so sadly for thoose pessimist out there, this is going to be for how good they are at developing their game. Which After being here for 24 updates i have to say, they'r doing better than H1Z1 and HoTS by far !  So ""The forest"" gets 30/30 ! BUT THAT BEING SAID:This is a game still in development, DON'T expect a fully polished game, where there is no errors or bugs.			"

								Very few games of this type deliver like The Forest has. This has to be one of the few games that can give goosebumps and make me squeal like a little girl, no matter how many hours I put into it.The enemy AI is magnificent. At first you might see a cannibal acting curiously around you; following you around, yet keeping a safe distance. After a little bit they will test you... Maybe hit you once, then run away to see how you react. Another interesting example, is when I encountered a couple of them surrounding a corpse. They seemed to be very protective of it, running in circles around it, as to say ""This is mine. Stay away"". After a little bit of playing around with them to see how they would react, I found myself surrounded by several more and mauled in a territorial dispute. Another awesome feature in the AI is that you can go many days laying low, without them even knowing of your presence, while if one spots you near your base, they will come back later in a larger group to investigate, marking the area with effigies to warn others of your presence.Night time is absolutely terrifying before you establish a solid defensive base.  Even then, while remaining undetected, there are warring tribes fighting amongst themselves throughout the night.Overall, I highly recommend this game. If you are a fan of survival or horror games, you owe it to yourself to check this one out!			"

								The Forest-The Forest houses both the survival and horor genre in a new light. The survival genre is one of my faveorite and The Forest did its self justice. It incorporates crafting systems, fighting, and exploring in such inventive ways. It has many versitile facets that lets the user customize their experience and play. As it goes with open world games this one is great. It lets you chop down almost any tree in the game, hunt a varity of animals (Lizards, Rabits, Fish), and build housing. With the new release of co-op play people can combined survival ideas with friends and pull the game to new heights. The Forest is a game i would recomend highly to anyone who wants a challenge, likes the suvival and horror genre, and anyone who wants to have fun. I Would rate this game 9/10. Despite its many key facts for being a great game there is some room for improvement. I hope for the future release of things such as a customizable character, more buildables, a large map and so on. The Forest is coming up on its beta release and i hope to see many new assets factored into the game and in the future. With time The Forest Will only get beter and better. Great Game!			"

								Very cool game to play with friends and alone, but it's more fun with friends. I built with a friend a cool fort out of logs and it's a lot of fun to cut down any of those dangerous natives who adore cannibalism. The only issue I have with this game is that it has limited customization options (for people who like to create a character themselves rather than being random generated), so far there are only 2 or 3 male models that you randomly spawn as but to be honest I am not really bothered much by it, it just would be a nice feature to have a character creation. The textures are good, the atmosphere is nice and playing coop is fun and rewarding, I can recommend this game to people who see enjoyment in survival games and just want to take a break from generic zombie survival games. The game is similiar to Rust except this one has no griefing.			"

								I can't believe how far this game has come.  The developers are dedicated and it just keeps on getting better.  My pal and I had a blast playing co-op and trying to survive while avoiding or engaging the violent natives.  We had and continue to have a blast.  I can only see a bright future for this survival game and recommend it if you enjoy survival and playing with friends.			"

								The Good (as of v14):- Open World, Semi-Sandbox- Full survival features: thirst, hunger, hypothermia, sleep, infection, etc- In depth crafting: trees can be cut down, plants harvested, animals hunted, weapons ugraded. etc- Homebase: Can build a variety of structures, including a home/fort- Highly intelligent enemy AI- Beautiful Graphics- Addictive and engagingThe Bad:- No crosshair.  This makes aiming with projectile weapons extremely difficult.  This is compounded by the fact that obtaining the materials to craft/find said projectile weapons is time consuming and arduous enough on its own.  So you can imagine the irritation one gets when you think you are throwing a molotov or shooting a bow/fare at the enemy, but instead it veers off in a completely different direction.  Suggested solution:  Have a crosshair appear as soon as a projectile weapon is equiped.  Or, at the very least, allow a crosshair to be toggled on or off in the options menu.- Lack of motivation to keep surviving.  Reason 1, no quests or direction.  There needs to be a driving force behind the survival.  Otherwise once you've built a fort and explored and collected everything (which isnt much) the game is simply, eat - drink - sleep - mess with cannibals - repeat.  Which get boring fast.   Reason 2, very little possible items to find.  There needs to be at least 4 or 5 times more variety of items to find/craft and weapons to be found.  If there is no story to drive me to the play the game, then there needs to be the promise of an abundace of rare, hidden loot to drive me to keep exploring and surviving against the elements and cannibals.  Right now, there is simply a miniscule amount of this.  There are literally only 2 clubs, 3 axes (which are very weak against enemies, oddly enough), a stick, a rock, a weak sauce stick-spear, a molotov, weak-sauce bow, and flare gun.  And the melee weapons all do very similar damage amounts.  Also, like I mentioned before, the projectile weapons are almost impossible to use without a crosshair.- The island is not large enough.  We either need an island about 3 or 4 times larger, or multiple islands/areas we can explore.  Another solution would be to have the island seed be completely randomly generated on each new game.  Not just have the pieces of it be re-arranged each time you start a new game (like it is now).- The cannibals take WAY TOO MANY HITS to kill.  If realism is what they are going for, I shouldn't have to hit a cannibal in the head with a hand axe over 8 times to kill it.  The cannibals should go down with half the hits it currently takes.  Conversely, if it takes me 8 hits to kill an unarmored cannibal with a hand axe, then why does it take a cannibal only 2 or 3 hits with their club (or just 3 or 4 with their bare hands) to kill an unarmored player?  That makes no sense.- There are far too many bugs with the traps you can make.  Particularly the noose trap and birthday trap.  Cannibals who get caught in the noose bug out and spin in giant loops around the map.  And cannibals that get stuck in the birthday trap appear to be dead, but when you reset the trap and try to retrieve the corpse, they either come back to life, or change into a completely different cannibal and start attacking you.  Final thoughts: I completely recommened this game as a low cost early access title.  You'll get a good 10-20 hours out of it until you run out of stuff to do.  However, I cannot justify paying any more for it at the time of its release unless they add much more content and address some of the issues I mentioned.  But, if they do fix what I mentioned, this game has the potential to rival the popularity of Skyrim/Minecraft.			"

								It tastes like chicken.  Well, after a while at least.  How long has it been dearest Margaret?  Today in the woods I found the bracelet I gave you in Nantucket.  I hope you don't mind I had to eat your arm to get it, but we'll get to that in a moment.  After the crash I searched for you everywhere and I did run into...some people.  They proved a bit of a nuisance at first, what with the dragging me through the woods and hanging me upside down in their cave.  How rude, and to think they don't even have a valet.  I'll never get the stains out of my shirt.The first few days were indeed a bit daunting, I'll grant you that Ole Margie.  Covered in blood for one thing, and another, I awoke to find I'd spilt scotch all over my brand new knickers!  Ah well, C'est la vie non?  Anywhoo, I got out of that dreadful plane, of course after relieving it of any useful supplies, and right away found the luggage - yours and mine!  Why, I rather didn't expect to find our bags after a safe landing in Monaco, let alone here in this dreary place.Well, Margo, you know me.  Mummy & Dad didn't pay good money for finishing school for me to be some boorish land-groper, no my dear, right off I set about to a bit of exploriing.  I'd found this trusty axe you see, ah, liberated from the chest of that lovely air waitress, what was her name again?  Oh bother, I can't recall - still the same problems with the old bean eh?So I found this lovely handbook, and in it's pages I found the key to suriving here on this most unusual island.  As I said, the first few nights were indeed a bit terrifying, natives howling in the night, pangs of thirst and hunger gnawing at my stomach, why, one of these primatives actually screamed at me - and naked as the day they were born I tell you!  I gave them the old once over with the trusty axe and they settled right down I tell you that.A few days later and I'd managed to build myself a small walled enclave, I fitted it proper with some traps, a firepit, Margie it was perfectly prehistoric!  I'd eaten most of the energy bars I'd found in the luggage, and gone through most of the pop.  I eyed the booze, but really thirst wasn't my biggest threat, it was the dreadfully low energy from not having had a decent meal.  That savage I, hee, well rather savaged days earlier was a bit ripe, but as I was dragging it across my compound I must have dragged part of its hand through my fire...What a curiously delightful aroma!  Oh Margo, for a Pinot or even a nice tart Bordeaux!  Ahem, a left bank varietal of course my dear, let's not throw all civility away?  Anyway, soon after that my problems were solved!  I hummed and sang as I whacked away - a bit more loin?  Why yes, I do believe so, and is there any of that lovely kidney left?When I finally found your bracelet dear Margaret, I was well on my way to how would you say cannibalinary greatness, so I do hope you don't mind - mixed in with some chicory and a pinch of Aloe, you could swear you were back in Hastings, missing only the bread pudding!I must sign off now dear Margie, it's been lovely talking to your skull and thank you again for sitting so fiercely atop of this stick, it's been fantastic warding off those beastly savages!  Though in truth, the sounds in the forest get louder and closer every day, and I could swear I spotted some large misshapen thing stomping through the underbrush.  Ah well problems for another day - I hear a scream which can only mean my neighbors have come calling again!  As usual, I'll invite them, ahem, for dinner as it were.  They will decline in that awful gutteral way they do but...I'm afraid I'll have to insist.  I'd be crazy not to.(**Seriously perhaps the best survival game there is and I've been playing less than 24 hours.  True anxiety, realisim, fear and triumph!  And really, after a while, you can't tell it isn't Chicken...**)GREAT JOB GUYS, 5 STARS!			"

								This is one of the best survival games out there, no doubt about it. The first time I played this game I spent the first night scared out of my mind surrounded by cannibals trying to eat me! Never been so scared by a game, or movie for that mather. Slowly I learned how to survive the first nights and how to build a quite decent life. This is a beautiful and fun game and all other survival games should learn from it! It got an unique feel to it that is hard to put in words.Over time there has been added alot more features, heck when I first bought this game you could only build a basic shelter and firepit. And the intromovie was just a demonstration with bad graphics and animations. But the developers have really made progress and added alot of content since then! I'm really excited for the future!I have to admit I don't play it very often and when I do it's in short bursts(its been more than the 6.3 hours that steam is showing tho). But everytime I come back to check out the progress I always get positivly surprised!My only question is WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS TOMMY?			"

								(Just a note that this game is still in alpha so alot of this review may become reduntant as the game progresses)Visuals / ProgrammingI've had the Forest for a while now, the first thing I would like to say is that this game looks amazing, the textures are nice (Where the scenery is completed) the animations are nice and it just looks superb, it also seems fairly easy to run as far as I can tell in terms of performance.Now the game may look amazing but unfortunately at times I find the movement a bit dated for want of a better word.  The   hit detection seems to be somewhat lacking on the smaller objects and there is a large ammount of bugs which is to be expected for a game in it's alpha.  At this time the map is not complete and i do admit feels rather small once explored which takes maybe an hour, this would not be so much of an issue for me if they made these areas less accessible ( For example walking into a cave which seems to go on forever only to find it leads nowhere only to find yourself falling through the map.) Apart from this and some rather incomplete structures and tools the creation seems rather fluid so far.MusicThe music is amazing, it really feels like you are there hearing what the player hears, the effects all sound really solid and realistic, and the screams from the Cannibals are just chilling. It makes for some really intense moments.GameplayThe forest is a horror survival game wherein you are crashed on an island inhabited by Cannibles and mutants, the key is to well ...survive. You will have to scavenge around the map for crafting materials where you can then proceed to build a range of shelters, traps and storage Etc. The building system is really nice and the structures look good in environment, (give or take a couple).  There are a variety of supplies and debris from previous inhabitants and the plane crash scattered around the island generally containing crucial items for you. The one thing I dislike about this is the lack of variety, once found there is no challenge to find the items again.  The Cannibals have scattered villages strewn across the island, with totems and effigies marking patrol routes, I personally found the Ai really good in this game, they will circle you; retreat; patrol; and even give the illusion of planning attacks. They are one of the best features of the game and hopefully more will be added to the villages as they are really empty right now and some future developement could prove very interesting.When killed you will be transported to a cave system which can sometimes be infested with Cannibals or mutants which seem to only exist in the caves for now. It's a nice mechanic, like a second chance to escape and survive without losing straightaway, the notion being that after being beaten you were dragged into the Cannibals ""nest"". The only problem I have currently is that the cave systems all look incredibly similar and lots do not have a clear exit. (Which may be interpreted as a part second chance) But personally I found it downright frustrating at times.MulitplayerRecently added was a multiplayer feature, really nice addition but feels badly incomplete, player models look clunky and animation is not done well as of yet. No real objective means that there can be a lack of things to do, and too many players makes the game way too easy. Nice is the fact that a large ammount of players can join a single server, although brought down by the small map size.ConclusionGraphics 8.5/10 - Looks amazing but Areas not complete, or textures too repetitive.Music 8/10 - Really immersive and rich sounds, unfortunately lacks variety after a while.Gameplay 6.5/10  - Very nice Ai , If you build away from the designated patrol areas you simply won't see any cannibals, Some bugs with combat and deathMultiplayer 5/10 - Nice that it has been added, sorely lacking in completion, models are glitchy and look bad, game does not incorporate for different levels of peopleThanks for readingHope it helped, If i missed anything or if you don't agree on anything please feel free to let me know  "

9/10 (Alpha v.0.4.3) ""LOST with a deeper story.""The Forest starts pretty much where LOST started, you crash with your plane & find yourselves alone in a forest. Soon you realize you're on an island in nowhere. Unlike the overestimated tv series, TheForest simply does everything well by letting U decide over your own stranded survival story and not some lazy story writers. Especially for an alpha stage, TheForest offers already a very good amount of craftable&buildable stuff as well as a nice explorable world. The extensive cave system is just great, and you'll get lost easily, if you haven't prepared yourself. And there are no hints, what you might need! Another aspect is the somehow rogue-like system. If you die, you can collect your backpack with all your items in it where you've died - but your todo-list and map will be empty. At this current stage I can definitely  recommend the game - to people who don't bother to get an, yet, unfinished game! You can easily have fun for at least 30+hrs alone or with your friends. Additionally about every 2 weeks, since Sept.2014!!!, a new update comes out - fixes+new stuff. The Forest is a scarry 1st person open world survival horror adventure. For how long can you survive TheForest?Pros:+ great gameplay+ great atmosphere+ great controls=> easy crafting&building+ great coop+ very good graphics+ good sound+ you have to prepare (without hints) to survive+ fair price tag & many features for an Alpha + exemplary what 4 people can achieve!+ no freezes/crashes/lost savegame (for me)+ online 8 player coop + SLI Fix => click=> I will never forget the feeling when I hung down in the cave and opened my eyes, for the first time.Cons:- some mechanics need to be polished   (e.g. adding cloth to a stick to get a torch, every 180sec.)- alpha means unfinished=> actual status click here[survivetheforest.com]Robinson Crusoe[www.imdb.com] meets The Descent[www.imdb.com] - in a game!

								The Forest brings the survival genre into a new light, it's visually beautiful and when night falls you'll struggle to not get on edge.It's currently still in alpha but it does have the potential to become one of the big titles within the genre.Pros:-Graphics are nice.-Map (recently) became quite big.-Tons of caves to explore with ''easter eggs.''-Crafting system is pretty straightforward.Cons:-Glitchy and buggy at times, it is alpha..-Gameplay does get a bit linear after 10+ hours.-No story.>UPDATED<After several more hours of gameplay i'd like to update my review.The game is still in alpha, which goes to show how much the developers are planning to add. They seem to be very dedicated to making the experience as good as possible, glitches are far fewer and there's constantly patches with new content.The co-op system is better now than before, but still needs work. Still a solidly fun game that I constantly revisit. Best survival i've played yet.			"

								The single player is surprisingly polished for an early access game. Even with the limited crafting recipes implemented so far, there is still a lot of creative ways to defend yourself and survive. Exploration is also very rewarding, both in the pretty landscapes you can see and in the rare/useful items you can stumble across. Visually, it is a very nice looking, atmospheric game. The multiplayer is also coming along quite well, although it is still noticably unfinished. Anyway I think the guys making this game deserve some support, and the pricepoint is extremely reasonable.			"

								This despite being alpha/beta, or what ever the term used to describe a game at this point in its development,  is enjoyable. Pros+ Decent sized map, and due to the terrain and foliage, its easy to get lost.+ Regardless of how long you have lived in the game, how much resources you have obtained, groups of enemys will still startle you.+ The number of resources one can obtain and use is massive in number.+ The crafting system is being added too and as is, very pratical in design.(Traps, homes, fires, weapons, ext)+ Wide variety of selection of food, there is more than just chicken.(Deer, fish, lizard, rabit, people, etc)+ The game has a countdown in the main menu that is only there to inform the player of when the next update is.+ The game encourages you to exsplore.+ Graphics are high quality.+ Combat is challenging and fluid.+ Variety of enemys.Negatives- Glichy, glichy, glichy. I could list a wide variety of potential gliches but they are constantly being fixed, and being created; and everyone exsperiences different ones. Some exsperience near none (Like me, thus all reviews are bias as a result)- Enemys, despite being mutated humans, they have a strong resistance to weapons in a way that makes little to no sense.(Large no longer huminode mutants exlcuded, those things are hulks of flesh amd should be a threat)- Some crafted items make littles sense in the real world (Such as the timed bomb, Upgraded spear using bone and not stone)- The canibals will sometimes glich out after hiting traps and permantly be gliched.- It is normaly required for you to start over after each update, this happens (on adverage every ten days)- Animals have no sense of self preservation. (I watched bird after bird fly into my bonfire)- The terrain has a few graphical gliches (Ground is invisible in some places, though very minor in size)- The plane crash (starting area) use to be random, now its not.- Few feet equals death while jumpingTo clarify, this game is still IN DEVELOPMENT and I can't stress that enough. All these negatives and even postives may be made worse or better during the time they work on this. Summary.Worth it, its fun had a good time, still play every now and again.			"

								One of my favourite games. My first playthrough is going well, the natives have seemed to stop coming for me, I think I killed & ate around 40 of them, who needs to set up traps to catch animals when there are PEOPLE who COME TO YOU that you can eat, I enjoy killing them WAY too much. After killing lizards and making stealth armor I realised that stealth armor is op af, I can shadow them back to their camp and then eat them all(I'm so sure i'm playing it wrong but I love it so much anyway). I gave up with chasing animals (except lizards they just accept their fate) they're too quick and so hard to catch, I guess if I used my bow it'd be easier but I prefer just frying up some of the local cuisine anyway. I've spent around 10 hours on one save, just eating people in my massive fort. I forgot I even had a son, who knew eating people would be so much fun?10/10 would become a cannibal again.			"

								This Is a very good game. If you're looking for a good, emmersive storyline, or a quality, finished game, come back later. The game is an alpha, but i've played many alphas, and this is the most hard-working, fastest alpha I HAVE EVER SEEN. This game is much better than rust. If survival games are your type of game, this one is for you. If not, you probably shouldn't buy it right now. There are many bugs and errors and crashes, but this is such a good game that i'm willing to deal with it. It is also addictive for a survival game (imagine that). The game also splashes a little bit of horror in there (that you can choose to keep or take out with no enemies mode) that also keeps the game interesting. With each update, the game gets better and better. 9/10. Totally Reccommend			"

								This game is very tense.  My first try I looted the luggage from the airplane I was on that crashed.  I encountered a primitive that quickly ran off.  I began gathering lumber to try to make a shelter, however, I noticed another primitive.  This made me cautious so I became hyper vigilant, always looking over my shoulder.  The next thing I knew there was some sort of hunting party of primitives chasing after me.  I ran for a while until I found a beach.  Out in the ocean there was a boat.  I was starving so I figured I'd see if maybe there was some food.  What I found were sharks.  They ate me.  My next try I gathered supplies again from the wrecked aircraft and then took off.  I ran for a while until I found a small island out in the middle of a lake.  I set up camp there and painstakingly constructed a shelter while swimming to and fro from the island to the shore to gather lumber.  There's blueberries on the island so that's what I've been eating.  I seem to be outside of the primitives' territory.  For now, I'll stay on Blueberry Island until I figure what I should do next.  However, the clear and present threat of death persists.  It's only a waiting game now...			"

								This game has significantly improved over a year. The game has terrifying moments from both jumpscares and just gritty, stark atmosphere. I can't play this game alone, only co-op. I would never leave camp. They come for you so fast. Small groups at first, but then they learn that you are building and advancing. They start to come in larger groups and mutated versions that will haunt your dreams.Some improvements I wish to see:*Balancing of some of the sounds (sometimes they are too loud and the ones that are too loud can't be heard when they should be audible). *Less AI dumbness of walking into the fire (sometimes its useful, but othertimes you just run around a fire until they eventually touch it and burn). *The bow and arrow is inaccurate and hitboxes on the mutants are difficult to hit when you know you are hitting them. (Add some headshots).*Colors/textures on Effigies and stronger mutants (they look like blobs, still terrifying, but could use some features). *Exploded gibs/limbs are silly random looking polygons of the tone of flesh. *There are random pockets of ""Air"" underwater that you can stand in and it is difficult to traverse when it acts as though you are not underwater until you can magically find the water again.*Some slips of the map where you can fall through, namely, when you go into the Sinkhole on the ledge, you pass the little camp and go to the other end, if you attempt to traverse the ring, you will fall through, thus resulting in the impossible retrieval of your backpack. *Random character skins. *When you pick up the mutants, they change to default model.*When you are bleeding out, the breathing sound fx sounds like a woman (old audio I believe). *The islands seem useless, thus the rafts seem useless. The Islands should have something lol*I hate to say this: I can't wait to see flopping wangs when the nekkid mutants are running at you. It will add to both comedy and horror. I would certainly run in terror. I am better at nitpicking negatives than telling the Pros: but to summarize, it has been one of the best developed games out there. The Inventory is awesome. The graphics are pretty. The world is explorable and there aren't many crashes anymore. The Co-Op works and is fully functional. You can TRADE items now instead of dropping stuff. Caves are terrifying and a unique experience that haven't been introduced successfully by other games yet. It's dark and terrifying. It is unfair and challenging. It is fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I tried to like this game, I really did. I cannot recall the last time I was so excited to purchase a PC title. $15 for this beautiful game? How could I not buy it? 90% rating on Steam? How could I not buy it? Recently added multiplayer mode? How could I not buy it? An open world game with survival and horror elements? That's right up my alley! Unfortunately sometimes we as humans become enamored with items that are hyped and advertised heavily. Often times we might even suffer from buyer's remorse. I'm not going to bash the developers or ""trash this game."" I just want to throw out my honest ideas and feelings about this game. The game really is visually stunning. I can only think of a handful of EA games that can compare. Shader details are good and the attention to detail is extremely impressive. Game mechanics are buttery smooth and make for an enjoyable gameplay experience. Interacting with objects is quite nice and just in general has a realistic feel to it. Optimization (for me anyway) is quite good. I get decent framerate while having the game on max settings. No one is going to dispute the graphics, mechanics or optimization for this game. But can a game thrive simply by giving you solid graphics, mechanics and optimization? Unfortunately for The Forest, it just doesn't have a whole lot more to offer. Crafting and gathering gets repetitive quite fast and the balance of thirst/hunger is just bad. I feel like my player is constantly hungry or thirsty or just doesn't have any stamina left despite eating large quantities of food. The balance of combat is also leaves a lot to be desired. Hitting a mutant can take 10, 11, or 12 times just to kill it. I'm hit 3 or 4 times and I'm dead. It's so unbalanced and needs a whole makeover IMHO. Speaking of mutants, there are just so many of them it gets overly frustrating trying to battle 5 or 6 at a time. It just really takes away from the game knowing you have zero chance of surviving against that many mutants. My biggest problem with the game is that it just lacks content, direction, creativity and variety. This game has been out for just over 18 months and while updates are released, they seem to be for only minor things (bugs and hot fixes). There doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency from the devs for map expansion, character customization, new weapons/tools, missions, enemies, or the like. The game just feels bland, boring and seriously lacking in creativity. That's the most frustrating thing to me. They have this beautiful game but they just don't seem to know what to do next. I've only played for ~3 hours and I'm pretty certain I've done everything there is to do in this game. This shouldn't happen IMHO. Give us more to do, give us customization, give us a sense of purpose, give us more to explore, give us more crafting and base building options. Keep the players more interested and engaged with the game. Adding more content and a reason to keep playing will ultimately make or break this game. I'm not recommending The Forest in its current state, but I would be more than happy to change my tune if and when the ball gets rolling on the creative end of things. I will definitely appreciate the likes. If you disagree with me, please comment and tell me why. I'm an adult and have no problem having civil conversations. I feel like thumbing my review down and explaining why could actually be helpful in the overall development of this game moving forward. Thanks everyone for taking the time to read my review.			"

								The Forest a new horror survival game that in the daytime seems so great and delightful but once it turns night is a creepy game that you struggle to survive in. Although it's still in alpha it gets updates very often and is getting better with every update.Pros:-Graphics are nice.-Map is pretty large now.-Tons of caves and villages to explore.-Crafting system is easy to get.-Creepy atmosphere.Cons:-Bugs like hell, but it is in alpha.-Gameplay gets repetitive after 10 hours.-Not much of a story.

								You are a lumberjack, your flight out of Lumberjack Ville has been shot down by cannibals. It is your duty to deforest the whole countryside, kill the cannibals, and perhaps eat them if you can't be bothered to chase deer or pick berries. There are also caves, full of monsterous things that you sadly cannot eat.			"

								I've been following this game since it got greenlit on Steam. The description sold me and when I bought it and played for the first time, I just knew it'd get better. That's exactly what happened too, this game is fantastic! It's obviously still in alpha stage, but unlike some others, this game actually plays right and has a story added. Anyways, the gameplay is fun. You have your basic survival needs, but this game really nails it. They added a whole new system to rely on and it definitely works. The enemies are pretty advanced, they will stalk you and attack on sight if needed. You will be battled by bigger enemies as you keep killing. Things will get intense, even if you have a full gear going. The basebuilding is fun, you can build some really cool stuff. You can also build beneficial stuff as well that can help you out in numerous ways. Traps to secure your base, or traps to capture food. It all works, stuff may be a little buggy but again, it still works. Multiplayer works good, it was broken when first introduced however it has shaped up pretty nicely since then. I highly recommend this game at the state it's in. If it peaks your interest, don't be afraid to check The Forest out!9/10			"

Well you grab the axe out of that womens stomach and eat all the food on the plane and get going to find your son. First you need to establish a base.

Adventure to a cave, find the place where bones are everywhere. Dodge that guy with 100 arms and there will be a dead person with a keycard. Grab that♥♥♥♥♥♥and get out of there.

								About 5 hours into the game so far, time for a first review (updates will follow) as this game really deserves one :)I read a few reviews and watched several Let's Plays as I was hesitant to buy another Early Access game and being so very used to buying games on sale I felt like the full price of 15€ might be too much... now I must say the very positive reviews were all correct and I would gladly pay full price again! Even FULL price like 50€ or so.Sure, there are still some minor alpha bugs, but I've honestly seen released games (at 50€) that had way more problems! And nothing game breaking here, mostly glitches, lighting or stuff that still has to be added.Pros / What I like/love about The Forest:- Freedom! This really feels like an open world in which YOU decide what to do.- Adventure! Really feels like you're out there, lost in the wilderness, trying to make it through the nights and building shelters, collecting rain water, hunting small animals, exploring, washing off the blood/dirt to avoid infections etc.- Beauty of nature! I didn't expect it at first, but the game looks awesome! Finally we have a ""real"" forest that is dense, thick, populated, immersive, green, overgrown, realistic, scary and dark at night etc.- Gameplay! It's smooth and feels good! Really fun to play and good accessibility!- Coop and Single Player! This game and the terror of being lost and alone may work best at Single Player, but I LOVE to have the option to play with my friends!- Sense of achievement: Making it through the nights and slowly building an encampment, adding your little habitable space to that harsh forest is great fun. Really feels like that's your part of the woods now, your hunting grounds! But still scary at night sometimes! ;)- Immersion! It's like I'm really out there on an adventure in the wilderness. This game must be great with Oculus Rift or sth. similar! :)- Details: You can feel Endnight's love for details when you chop down a tree and it really falls and isn't just added to your inventory or when you open said inventory and your backpack is spread out on a blanket on the ground in front of you etc.Cons: Might become too easy over time? Don't know but it doesn't feel as brutal as other survival games (just played The Long Dark e.g., which isn't nearly as much fun, but way more challenging). For some people this may not be a Con but a Pro, but it feels a bit too easy too get food, potable water, to deal with the cold etc. I'll have to keep an eye on that. On the other hand this increases accessibility and lowers your frustration levels ;)Alright, I'll add more to this review later on. Check it out yourself, it's a great game already with more features being added on a regular basis! Unbelievable that this is done by only 4 people... Very often feels like an AAA-title.Definitely recommended! This is the survival / building / open world game I've been waiting for! :)			"

								Day - 1  I awaken dazzed and bloodied quickly scavenging things around the crash site, i can hear howls and screams getting closer. I grab all i can and run in to the woods, the lanescape is so full of wildlife, but i hear a strange sound to my right so i decide to to investigate. When what evers making the noise comes into sight through the tree line i can see 3 tribesman all crouched in a circle, i choose to push forward to get a better look. I am as close as i can get and i am shocked, the 3 tribesman are EATING SOMEONE. Theres another close to them with a skull mounted on a stick above his head just watching, i think he's the captin. I'd better leave, im in no position to fight 4 men with just a axe.Night has fallen and i have almost contructed a basic shelter, it's starting to rain I should build a fire to cook the meat i've hunted. i continue to chop wood when i hear a new strange sound behind me, I turn instantly to check it out and theres a tribesman just stood there. Watching me, he says nothing he does nothing we stand for about a minute staring at each other locked in this gaze. Suddenly he howls turns and runs, i pick up leaves to wipe my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself).Day - 2 Since i was discovered theres been alot more patrols around my camp it's becoming increasinly hard to gather precious resources, but i press on starting to see if i can start on a cabin when i hear a scream in the distance. It sounds like a womens in trouble, against my better judgement i go to seek out the source of this skin scrawling screech. I heard it again i am getting closer, i come to a clearing and decide to duck down behind the tree's to check the area out. I can see a total of 6 tribesman 4 in a pack and 2 wandering (appeared to be anyway), when all of a sudden i see the captin arch his back and let out a bellowing scream (the same i heard that made me investigate).♥♥♥♥♥♥it's a trap! I turn to escape before i am seen but my fears have already been realised, theres a tribes-woman behind me, god knows how long she was there but as soon as she knows i've seen her she turns and runs. I run in the oposite direction but it's to late, I'm being hunted! I take a breather to eat to recover stamina and i have a quick look to see if their still on my trail but i can't see much. I can see a single light in the distance well out of reach, it's the captin looking for me then all of a sudden i hear a loud THUD. I frantically turn in every direction to see what it was but theres nothing there...HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THEIR IN THE TREE'S3 men drop down around me and instantly signal the captin, theres no more running it's now or never. we all start hacking at each other franticly, i need to drop one before the captin closes in. I manage to kill one and wound another, but before i could finish him a tribes-woman appeared from the bushes to drag him away. I still have two of these ♥♥♥♥ers trying to cave my head in i can't afford to turn my back to chase, I'm about to die, the captin is unscathed and the grunt is so close to death when i knock him down. I instantly raise my axe when (CRUNCH) i am dead.Day - ???I awake in a cave in complete darkness, i use my lighter to check where i am when to my horror i discover i am in some sort of meat gathering chamber. Theres bodies handing from the ceiling everywhere, atleast 40 all dismembered differently. The floor is littered with the body parts of previous victims, How long have they been here? There wasn't many people on the plane, no where near enough for this. I check my inventory and to my supprise i still have all my gear not that i have much that can help. It's to quiet nothing but the sound of water drops, after a quick search i find the exit and a flare gun THIS SHOULD HELP! Ii have to crouch low to leave this cave and follow this route. It's never ending cave expansion after expansion limbs after limbs when will this end! I start to hear a new a very ♥♥♥♥ing freaky sound from the next opening, Luckily theres ambeinent light coming from a pool of water so i switch my light off. I can see something in the distance and it's big, I tread closer at a snails pace around the slight corner to get a better look only to find theres another 2 meteres away.I am unsure if they can see me or let alone at all so i decide to get the ♥♥♥♥ outta dodge and make a dash for the exit, i can see light and i've been going through room after room i have to be close to the surface! I make it to the next section without them noticing but it's not getting any better. the light turned out to be a fire, a fire being used be at least 12 of the grunts and women. Bricks were♥♥♥♥♥♥ I make a dash for the exit (or atleast what appeared to be) OH MY GOD as i run crouch run through the space to escape i notice teeth dangling from strings. I don't have time to look i have to get out and now, as i am escaping i come into more rooms like the last filled with more grunts. it feels like im being chased by the entire tribe and i dare not look back. I finally come to the surface, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥down with rain and pitch black i can use this to my advantage and escape through the tree line stopping for nothing. I escaped with my life for now....10/10 i know this is not a review but i wanted to share my first experience with the game and i am so impressed.£10.99 well spent i look forward to content updates			"

It keeps the game scary without making you want to shut it down and cry. If you are reading this review thinking of purchasing it, do it. It's bloody, gruesome, and amazing.

								*A MUST BUY GAME! This is one of the best survival horror I've ever played! Altho it's still in development but it gets better and better in every patch adding more content, improving the survival horror experience and making it challenging!

								Hi, go buy this game.Pros:-Caring devs-Enjoyable combat, with depth and options, there isn't one best weapon (arguably)-Fun creepy dungeons -Map isnt too big, or too small-Timer for every update!!!-Many unique gameplay mechanics (invnetory, crafting, energy meter, loot, and more)-Very enjoyable in coop and soloCons:-Hackers are common, but managable-content updates come pretty slow-Torches burn out really fast ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

								Let me tell you exactly why you should buy this game.Don't let the fact that it's early access dissuade you from purchasing this gem. Unlike most early access game, the devs work around the clock to find and fix new bugs, review consumer feedback, implement new features into the game, and generally improve the game in each and every update that they release. The major updates are usually released once every month, while smaller updates (bugfixes) are usually released about 2-4 times a month.There is a ton to do in this game. The building takes such a long time, but it's because of this long arduous process that when it's finally done it's all the more rewarding. The buildings look practical; like something that you could, and would actually build in the wilderness.Now on to gameplay. The game feels very relaxing at first. The sound of the forest will build up a false sense of security. It's for this reason that the horror aspect is so effective. When I say horror I mean horror. This game will make you afraid of the night, and when you do finally build that fortress you won't want to leave it. The combat is rough, but it's not impossible to take on 3 mutants and survive leaving all of them dead. With the right tactics you can bring the fight to them. The resource gathering is probably the most unique of any game; very realistic and enthrolling. The inventory system works great too, and you can find everything you have in the first glance. The crafting aspect of the game is simple too, but it feels like something that could be done in real life with the same ingredients.Don't let the system requirements dissuade you either. I play this on my laptop when I'm on vacation. My laptop has 4 GBs of RAM, and no graphics card. I set all the settings on the lowest I can, and still play the game. It doesn't look very good after that, but it's still a fun game to play.In short, this game is fun, arduous, unforgiving, and rewarding. It stands out among the many titles being released these days. It's a shiny diamond in a bed of coal, and it's well worth 15 dollars US. Buy this game. You won't regret it.Just want to add even more to this review. The Dev's are awesome. They've added loads of new content and fixed tons of bugs since the release of this game. It's 100x better now since I upgraded my GPU. It's a truly beautiful game.It's also truly terrifying if you don't build a base. If you want pure horror, just run around in the woods and scavenge for food. Christ, the mutants are probably the scariest thing I've ever encountered. You never quite know when they are there, and you want to stay out of the woods, but you know you need to go in for food/supplies, and that's when they get you. The weakest ones, the starving mutants, are definitely the scariest. They are skinny and bloody, run at you really quickly, and overall just make you crap your pants. Even worse, there are ambient sounds in the woods now that sound like leaves/branches falling, so it's even harder to tell when they are running up behind you. I don't think i've ever been so terrified while playing a game before. It's not even the mutants most of the time, it's the idea that they are lurking behind me.EDIT POST 12/14/2016 UPDATE:LORD BABY JESUS THAT F***NG TWIST			"

								Been playing The Forest off and on since 2014 and can say that the dev's are excelent at providing updates and hotfixes that actually make a difference on the users end.  The forest is more than just a game.  It can easily be a hobby, a tool for production in social media or other avenues, or you can just use it for what it is.  A well crafted application that lets you build and construct what could possibly be a great community (in co-op) with the right people.  Building and crafting are not the only elements to this game as you can also venture off into the underground caves of The Forest in search of your kidnapped son, Timmy.  If you decide to go the story route, trust me, the end game is worth the travel, espeically if you are a sci-fi enthusiast..  If you decide to just sit back, chill, kill some cannables with your buds and build a town..you can do that too and have just as much fun.The Forest is an all around great time and I'll tell ya what..AAA dev's and publishers could sure learn a thing or two from both the developers who created The Forest as well as the game itself.  Life-long replay value and much more.  You won't be dissapointed, and if you are..you have no taste :)			"

								The Forest is still very much in development, so occasionally you will run into some awful bug - recently I was trapped in a cave, for example - but updates are regular and I find the game quite playable even as it is. Disclaimer: I generally play with cheats on - and I love that this is an option! Mostly, I play in Vegan Mode which disables all the cannibals and turns The Forest into a creepy survival game rather than horror survival game. I enjoy exploring the map, building stuff and trying to find enough food and water to live on while avoiding freezing to death. In fact I didn't buy the game until I discovered that it could be played with cheats. However, I do think that there is a lot of the game that I miss out on because of my hypersensitive nerves. There is also Vegetarian Mode which only disables cannibals by day and Ironforest which prevents destruction of your base by cannibals/players.I like that the mutants have their own culture and lives and one day, I swear, I will find the courage to find out more about them. If there was a cheat where I could infiltrate the cannibals and move amongst them without being attacked unless maybe I attacked them first that would just make my day.In the meantime, the map is quite stunning, visually. However, even with the cannibals themselves disabled, the artifacts that they leave around the island can be quite disturbing so I don't recommend to someone who just wants a pretty map and no crawling skin factor. Survival is challenging even without cannibals trying to eat your face. You need to get set up with shelter, fire, food and water pretty quickly. Saving is only possible on a bed (separate from sleeping). If you want to explore you need to make sure that you find a campsite well before dark as you can't carry enough to make a shelter in one go and trying to build at night while freezing and suddenly realising that you can't find any sticks where you are is not so fun. The map is large, but not massive, so after a while you can get bases set up around the map and things are less challenging in that respect. I have never played the multiplayer, but I imagine that it would be a great game to play cooperatively. There are plenty of resources and it's always less scary to have a friend along when mutants are trying to kill and eat you.Somehow, this is one of the game that I play most often, there is just something about it that keeps drawing me back. So, yes, I do recommend it. I only have 40 odd hours on record, so far, but it's one of the few games on my favourites tab, because I know I'll go back there before long even if it's just to see what the developers added in the latest patch.TL;DR It plays well, it looks great and updates are regular. There are cheats. And cannibals.			"

Early Access Review
								Summary: Saying that this game is just a 'good early access' game discredits it to a certain extent. This game has so much content that, if released now, would be a very successful game. It's incredibly fun, with the right amount of horror added in. Not only that, but more content is continually being released by the devs and these are some of the most hard working devs I've seen.Pros and Cons:Pros:-Graphics are spectacular; this could be something that people debate, as it's not the graphics of a newer game. however, this game was in fact released in 2014, and it looks crazy good still today. -Animations are very beautiful; trees falling, mutants jumping at you, climbing ropes, all of these feel and look realistic. -Mechanics are nice for the most part. I like the crafting, fishing, and cutting down trees, and the realistic feel they offer. However, I think that the item carrying system could have a little work. You're limited to carrying about 6 rocks at once and 10 sticks, however I think that if they did a weight system, it'd be way easier. -Smart AI. The enemies will know they're losing when you kill 2/3 of their search party, and the third will flee. If you catch a cannibal in a noose trap, their friends can come and release them. if you leave one injured, another will drag them off. They'll send spies to investigate your base, to find weak spots for future attacks. It's really a spectacular thing to witness, expecially in an early access game. Most games I've played have extremely weak/overpoweringly fake AI, but this AI is extremely realistic.-Co-op. This game is incredibly fun with friends.Cons: -Frustrating building setup; this one is probably the number one issue I've experienced. Floors don't snap together, so they just overlay the other floors or get jagged edges. I'd ask the devs to look at ARK: Survival Evolved's building and sorta make it like that.-Small immersion-breaking bugs. Nothing game breaking, as I haven't had my game crash once, but just small things, like chopping down a tree and having a log fly up in the air. Small things like that.-No world consistency (that I've seen); When you get off the game and get back on later, suitcases fill up again, and trees respawn. I don't know if they will add consistency in the future and what that'll do to game optimization, but it's not all that distracting.TL;DR: Fantastic game for an extremely good price, enjoyable with friends, trustable developers.9/10. Dismembering cannibals never sounded better.			"

								I can't play this game alone; it freaks me out.I play with my buddy after work, we build about 3 log cabins before we decided to build a base right in the middle and make it custom. It's awesome, we make bonfires, cook the locals, slap the locals with decapitated limbs of their fallen brethen, slash-duck-dodge-weave and tackle the locals with a katana like some sort of crazed ninja warrior sent back into time. We have conquered the forest.Woke up after going to sleep to a tree in the middle of our house. Thinking this was some ruse from the locals we decided to chop it. The entire house, the tree and our log carts not even close to the house flew into the air. It was the most insane thing I have ever seen. These locals are using black magic against us, we rebuild away from their cursed spot and decide to use fire to sweep clear the forest. We are currently using our own fire mage magic against them.This game is serious fun! I played it just a little bit here and there over the few months but the last week or so I got my buddy to get it and we play it everyday for a couple of hours now after work. If you're looking for a great survial game without all the annoying grinding and hunting then this is the game for you. Oh I think we both have a son or something like that but we figured he's already gone and its a lost cause. First 24 hours is crucial in a kidnapping and I think we are on day 43 so he is far gone we must move we have each other now this is our home.			"

								A fun thrilling game that I would recommend. The cannibals and mutations really give off a eerie feeling when you encounter them which gives off a strong sense of survival and danger and most importantly vulnerability. You usually cannot just attack a group of enemies without facing dire consequences you have to make the right decisions to stay prepared with items and bring stability to your base.There are some story elements to the game which are not fully completed but the devlopers are updating pretty steadily and so you may eventually have some sort of goal within the game if survival is not enough for you.The building is also fun. You can fairly large structures if you have the resources for it (takes a long time to gather wood and stone) although there is no grid feature to keep buildings and structures aligned and even so you will have to use your eye or some carefull aligning to build something accurately.Overall I recommend the game as there are features yet to come and it is an enjoyable experience werether with friends or alone.

(22.03.2017)This game is great. It has a clear ending and is worth a playthrough right now, though I can see it becoming a lot better in the future. A must play in my opinion, if only to rush through it and get the pay off of the creepy ending chapter. The game is very moody, and I would suggest playing it with a friend.PROS:Very intuitive crafting system that will keep you entertained for hours if you are into that.Stamina, health, thirst and hunger system pretty good. It keeps you in need of being stocked up and actually foraging, but it doesn't limit you too much.Very satisfying and free movement of the character.The fights are fun and can have a strategic element.The story sort of slowly boils a bit in the background until it culminates rather explosively.The atmosphere makes the game very immersive, and a few key moments along the way are really suspenseful and extraordinary. Brings back the same feelings I had initially watching Lost as a teenager.The cave exploration is really cool. There are cool powerups that unlock other areas.Regular updates.The world feels rich and alive.CONS:Bossbattles are few and far between. Easy to avoid more challenging mobs, and the bosses that are there are too easy to kite and take down slowly.The game is overall too easy on the hardest difficulty setting.Needs more content of course, both for crafting and story. The narrative is very mood based, which is good, but the story itself is bland and clichè. Lots of untapped potential there.OVERALL 7,5/10INPUT:Enable fast toggling of markers. The markers were super handy IMO but it really cluttered the UI after a while.Add more wearable gear items like the rabbit shoes.Character customization. Individual story elements for co-op characters.More variation in enemies.More aggressive enemies. Too easy to kite or lead into a body of water.Final boss is a cakewalk.Add a few lines of dialogue scattered inbetween. The idea of suddenly meeting someone who said something intrigued me, but it never happened. There really are no mysterious supporting characters until the very end.Make us have to go after the second plane! This is probably your plan anyways though.Plug all the holes where you can fall through or see through world.Make it easier to remove old human body parts from campfires. They clogged up whenever I tried to make bones.Make building bases more rewarding.Make building defenses a necessity. "

								I used to have a pet turdle named Bob. Bob was my best friend.We ate lizards together, killed cannibals together and survived together.One day my hunger bar got low, and i was outta food.I ate Bob.RiP Real Review I have decided to edit this review one more time, to help you guys to decide on buying this game. Presentation You play as some random man whose plane crashes into some random island which just so happens to be infested with mutant cannibals. The point of this game is to just survive as long as you can in the enviornment around you. Looks really nice for a project like this, plus it was made in Unity.  Gameplay Like I kinda stated above, the point of this game is to survive. In order for you to survive, you must craft shelters, weapons and other stuff to make it easier to live. The current amount of craftable objects may not seem like much, but they will add more over time. You will be constantly hunting for other valuable resources like food and water. You will also be defending yourself from those mutant cannibals that roam around the island. The game ends once you die. The game is still a bit glitchy but still seems pretty good. Other Not much else to say for this one; the sound is fine, the game has a good amount of settings. The last thing you should know about this game is that its in Early Access, the game still gets updated constantly but it may be some time until its done. I can garentee you this game will be done since the consoles have teased this game and every game that is in Early Access (that I know of) that was teased on consoles have been released at some point.  Conclusion A very nice survival game, it may not have a lot of content at the moment but it does look very promising. Updates are released constantly but it will be just a bit more time before this game can be considered offically released.			"

								Survival games have become the hottest genre as of late. It does not matter if you are trying to survive alone against the wilderness, zombies, or other players. Survival will often make you do things you might not. This game is no exception. You are sitting next to a window on an airplane with a little boy holding your arm. You are given little clue as to who you are or who he is before the front of the airplane is ripped off and you are falling fast to the Earth below. Upon landing, you see a native (given the number of body parts on the island, I would say cannibal) take the little boy and leave. As you get up, you have little time to gather what you can scavenge around you before others are sure to come. And come they will.Starting off with only rocks and sticks, I grab a huge rock and began to bust open luggage, managing to find some rations and supplies. As I wandered, I could find other make shift camps but no one around, at least no one I wanted to bother with...yet. After starting a fire to cook a rabbit (seagulls, turtles, and other animals can be killed), nightfall began to set in. I had began to make a shelter but lacked logs to complete it. Then came flashlights waving around in the dark. I was not ready for a confrontation yet so I ran and began to explore. The island I landed on had caves to explore, water all around, another another island nearby with snowcapped mountains. Upon realizing I lacked any means to get logs for my shelter, I doubled back to where the flashlights had been to find my hunters were still near by. Armed with a makeshift spear, I began to attack them, killing two before the lights out.I awoke to a macabre horror. I was trapped in a dark cave, half filled with water, with bodies hanging from the ceiling all around me. With a lighter that constantly had to get lit (water will do that to it), I found a lot more supplies along with an axe, and a few other weapons. I found this helped my struggle quite a bit as I was able to escape underground after awhile, surfacing at last the claustrophobic tunnels.Fresh air and daylight, my new day began with heading back towards my shelter I was trying to build. I had started it on top of a cliff with a giant tree nearby, making it easy for me to find when needed. I learned my new found weapon doubled as a means to chop down trees to help me finish my shelter. Before I could finish, another group of cannibals found me. This time, I did not wake up in a cave. This time, it was the end.With this being an alpha build, it is easy to pass off graphical glitches (water in the game often looks off and broken when in it). I once had a turtle I could not smash with my rock and when viewing my inventory, the turtles image never left my screen, covering up what it was I was trying to see. The game sounded authentic once on the ground but I had hoped for more of a build up leading to the crash (the front of the airplane disappeared without a sound and I never once heard the boy next to me utter a sound). The natives are incredibly quiet and I had expected to be able to hear them once they got close, but this was not the case. Not even when I was attacking them did I hear them utter a grunt. I had one guy I beat on repeatedly and he eventually ran away despite the number of times I impaled him with my spear but the next guy went down with just a few thrusts.The game is very intuitive in that it was easy to learn how to use what was around me very quickly. On screen prompts when seeing berries to eat, supplies to scavenge, or and how to duck were very helpful. Despite not being very good at survival games, I found what I discovered in this game to very enjoyable, even at this early of release. I definitely look forward to seeing what the developers have in store and the game has a handy count down on the main menu to let you know when to expect the next update. And expect I shall. I look forward to my next trip to The Forest as I learn from my mistakes and work on my survival skills(Tip: don't build your shelter too far away from logs you will need to cut down, if you can find an axe that is).

(if you want to avoid it, I recommend to save after every 15minutes and if somebody destorys your base, you can always leave immediately and host server again) But if you meet nice people you can have a lot of fun.• Singleplayer is pretty much same as multiplayer, exept you play it alone(NO $HIT Sherlock) and you don't have to worry about toxic or salty people. There isn't really a story, ok there is BUT basically you have to find Timmy but you can't find Timmy...wierd, isn't it? It's unknown that is he alive or not, all what we know is that:1.

In a list of passengers, found in the game files, there is a passenger called ""Timmy."" sitting next to another called ""James."". It's assumed these passengers are Timmy and James.3.

The Forest is game kind of Horror,Indie,adventure and Tree cutting simulator.In my opinion its good game,but only reason i say its ""good"" instead of ""epic"" ""awesome"" and any others are B U G S.I hate all those freaking glitchy piece of craps but sometimes they make game easier or funnier :D . Lore/StoryLore and whole story are freaking MYSTERIOUS ,_, thats why i give it 10/10~ITS ALL SPOILER!~1.You and your Son are in Plane probably on some Japan / Pacific islands which are not yet discovered or something like that.You and your crew(pasengers) crash in half into Island.Soon ago you discover that you're the only one(and your Son) that survived crash.Whenever you get to Cave's and boat and Snow land proably you'll find grave's and pictures with date ""June 82"" That means June 1982 aka month of incident by incident i mean 2 kids from ""milk picture"" Their parents start looking for them in June and then they discover this place ... and monesters inside of cave ~ You may find some Spiderwalker pics and Virginia's.2.Japanese guys are filmmakers they were inspirated by books so they decide to do film about it ~ ""7 goes to cave one survive"" All died ...We can find them close to Katana cave and inside of katana cave :pI think its enough spoilers for now XD !Gameplay8/10Since very beggining game is telling you to S U R V I V E this is what made me love this game! ~I love to risk my life(and not only mine,ofc inside of game XD) especially when you need to fight alone horde of Mutants ! :DMost time i spend inside of this game is in CO-OP with friends.We discovered everything we could for now and now whenever i go to Solo i miss help with cutting trees,eploring cave's ect ;-;Audio&Soundtracks4/10Soundtrack in main menu is cute ~ and its only why i give it 4,game is missing the damn SOUNDTRACK ! Where is it ?! This is my question m-m.Okay okay i understand there is casette but idc i want real soundtrackGraphics10/10Whole terrain,colors and light are FREAKING B E A U T I F U L <3So my main rating is 8/10 ~ Game is really good i hope they repair glitches and improve gameplay a little bit.As for a EARLY ACCES game its really good !

								Not much time in game yet, still trying to work out some kinks myself especially with saving/loading. But somehow, this game designed by a small team, runs smoother and has greater gameplay then some of the damn major company releases that are failing miserably (Ubisoft AC:UNITY comes to mind...).That being said, if you plan to purchase the game: IT IS ALPHA. This isnt the final product, so keep that in mind. You are basically paying so you can test the game and aid the dev team.System Specs:AMD FX6300 3.5ghz8gb DDR3GeForce 770 OC 2gb1TB WD Black Sata HDDOne thing I will say, is the way the AI works for enemies. Now there are still a few bugs; Cannibals getting stuck on a rock here and there, or blatantly ignoring you until you slap em. But the AI is actually pretty entertaining. Scouting parties will roam around with a flashlight in the dark and actually appear from a distance like survivors. They will roam and look for you if they see a fire. They sometimes leave a person behind that will remain in the area to keep scouting while they move on. And they are F*ckin Vicious lol. If you want to break away from the mindless, boring zombie apocalypse survival games that just launch slow moving easily killed zombies, check this one out.I haven't gotten to build much, but I like that the game provides a mini-survival book with some essentials and guidelines - but also provides the blueprints to enable self-made homes and barriers instead of jus ""Your shack must look like this"". Oh and don't run over your firepit... bad things happen.Graphically, for how intense and detailed the game is, it runs very smooth on high for me. As well as looking MUCH nicer than most of the newer games I played. There is still some glitching with water and such, lightning as well, where it wont exactly sit directly where it should. But it is alpha, I can overlook a tiny part of a lake floating a little above the land... I can't overlook a graphical failure that causes FPS below 10 on a well-built gaming rig.Combat is kinda interesting. The cannibals hurt... so get ready for it if you plan to beat on one... Made the mistake of thinking these would be just like the zombies. Not so much. If you do get beaten by one, enjoy what happens next ;). There isn't much else to say here - Youre not a battle god dual wielding thors hammer, so don't think you can just simply walk around all day/night without worry. The encounters are random, the scouting parties patrol to find you and your camp, and yes - if you keep fires burning... they will start bringing more enemies to take care of you.I like that I cant just punch a tree down, or build huge houses in a matter of moments after punching down said trees. The game will entice you. There isnt a moment you actually feel safe, even after you get into the shelter. Even with a molotov cocktail in your inventory. Since the second I loaded it up, till early this morning when I started again... I always felt out-manned and out-gunned lol.			"

								I bought this game in about August of 2014 (Few months after it launched on steam), back then it was a mess of awesome features but unplayable gameplay. I redownloaded it a few days ago and OMG. Favourite features: Fighting off tribesmen and using parts of their corpses as effergys to intimidate them, then using their bones as armor. You are always on edge and there is a happy bird tweeting away. Well f**k you bird *Homeruns that ♥♥♥♥♥ with a stick* Not sh*ting yourself enough? Well you can visit the depths of hell in a dark cave full of tribesmen. (And worse) *Thud, thud, thud* ""WTF is that"" *tortured soul of the damned growl* *Faster heavy footsteps* And you proceed to lose  control of your bladder. Faming axe? Badass AF.Just get the game.			"

								I suck at introductions, but as this is my first review i want the developers to know, if by the slight chance they would see this, how much i've enjoyed this game through and through. You guys have been one of the very few developers out there with a true vision to create the best product u can with what u have and not run away with the money, HUGE KUDOS for that!!!I've been following the development of this game since months before steam release last year and it was during a time when multiple survival genres were coming out ( Stomping Land to name one, 7 Days to Die another ) and the developers behind 'The Forest' have truly been honest and genuine with how the development has gone. Frequent and good updates that improve the game every so slightly but enough for the everyday gamer like myself to notice a clear difference. I've played as of today roughly 40hrs and enjoyed every minute of it. To first load the game without knowing what the night brings is terrifying and seeing how the world interacts  is brilliant. I've probably spent a total of 10 hrs just walking through ""The Forest"" and just been amazed at how incredible it looks, it's truly one of a kind sensation to see how birds interact with the player and really, how the world interacts with you. This is a must have for any survival genre fans out there as this is by far, the BEST survival out there, and it's still in ALPHA!Best game of my life, hands down. Very much worth the moneyz!!!			"

Early Access Review
Kill a cannibal, chop off his arm, and ♥♥♥♥♥slap his friends all the way to their campsite.I have tried many early access games in my time, and only a few of them are actually worth buying in this stage. The Forest is one of them. It's bizarre, dark, twisted, gory, and haunting. Once you realise the deep trouble you are in, you will not have a moment's chance to relax and take it easy.After a plane crash, your son is abducted by cannibals and you are left nearly dead on the crash site. Your objective is to survive and explore the island to discover where your son is kept and its backstory. That is until you realise you are not alone at all...The game looks beautiful. The island you are in, has forests, lakes, caves and beaches for you to explore. Seems like heaven. Everything is detailed nicely and you can even observe little birds coming to sit on your hand at times. *DISNEY PRINCESS MODE ENGAGED* You will hear waves crashing on rocks, animals rattling leaves, the song of the birds, and many more sounds appropriate for the landscape. It makes you feel immersed like few games.The survival part is a bit classic, but the crafting system is reimagined in an interesting way. You can carry only a small number of resources, while heavy items like wood logs are better transported to your campsite with sleds. You can craft storage areas for rocks, branches etc that will come in handy later. As for the shelters, you got a plethora of huts and cottages to construct in order to escape from rain (you can even make a treehouse!. Then you got traps, walls, etc. Since there's no minimap (or map in general), an icon pops up in your screen indicating where your unfinished constructions are, so you can always find them. However, it could use some extra freedom with building. But I'm willing to look past that.The enemies are interesting to deal with. At first, they will not hunt you down, they will merely observe you from the shadows and the bushes. Then, they will try to investigate you and your constructions, and then they just might hunt you down by attacking your weakest spots in your defences. If one of them escapes, he will rush back to their camp and call for help to your last known spot. They may scout your base for supplies, organise surprise attacks during the day and set up effigies to warn you to stay away. If you manage to handle them properly though, they will respect you and bow before you, thinking you are some kind of god. They operate in a sophisticated scale which is a refreshing feature in survival games. On the downside, due to the game being a bit unfinished, they act goofy at times, like cramping up in places and not be able to move anywhere or running around without purpose. The real way to play this game, however, is coop. Get a friend and join forces to conquer The Forest. There's a built-in voice chat feature which makes things easier when you are not in the same room. And that's some really good thinking. Aside some weird bugs, the game is in a really good playable state and the price is ok, but i still suggest to grab it in a sale. It's worth your time, especially if you are a hardened survival veteran.RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 8.5/10Story: 7/10Unique Factor: Enemy AI: 8.5/10OVERALL: 8/10 "

								Pros:+Breathtaking Graphics+Great Sounds+Great Survival Roots+Interesting Enemies (They themselves are an interesting group)+Interesting Enemy AI (Don't expect full hostility. The tribe doesn't just want to take you down... Not at first anyways)+Natural Fear as Opposed to Forced+Co-Op (Haven't tried it yet, but that's the next step)+A Constant Sense of Urgency+A Clock of When the Next Update isCons that are possibly related to it being in Early Access:-Extreme Lack of Content at this point (There is no story besides the intro cutscene. Currently the only thing to do is to.. survive and explore. I'm hoping for the different optional paths in the story. Such as saving the kid who is probably your son, escaping the island, joining one of the tribes, eliminating the mutants or sealing off the caves and other such things)-Bugs (Nothing gamebreaking for me so far. Some floating rocks, the ability to walk through dead trees and drying racks, but nothing big)-Would greatly benefit from random events! The enemys are great, but as of right now there is no motive to put yourself in the action... I think I stayed up only one night and nothing happened. Would be interesting for a Bermuda Triangle type deal! Electronics stop working in the area, resulting in many plane and boat disappearances... which you can explore and rescue survivors and they become companions(yes/no?) The point is there isn't a whole lot of action yet... (I'm sure they will add content of some sort)-Not many weapons (There are axes, clubs, bows, spears and one katana. You can only craft axes, bows and clubs. The other stuff you have to find. The bow doesn't do anything to mutants, so that leaves axes and clubs, which the club for me is too slow, so really my only option is an axe.)-Death isn't anything to worry about, making the game... not as scary. When you die, the mutants drag you to a cave and conveniently leave you with all your stuff and right by the entrance of the cave. Not only that, but the cave and village above the cave are full of powerful loot (Dynamite and Modern Axes). I've died 3 or 4 times and everytime there were no monsters anywhere so I just grabbed loot and went back home. It is almost rewarding to die. The only way to fully die that I've seen is to die and be taken to the cave and then die again inside the cave... so the creatures don't scare me anymore. (Maybe they haven't finished the death sequence?)-Creatures become much less eerie after getting a pattern. At first it feels like you can't even kill one monster, but really if you set them on fire or knock them to the ground and pound on their head it's pretty simple. Especially since their AI isn't very unique during fights. All they do is stay a small distance and circle you and then when confident they come in and attack. When they attack they do more flailing then anything strategic. Would be nice to see the packs surround you and take you out. One man shouldn't be able to take on two, let alone 3-5. It would be nice if they were dangerous enough to make me want to hide. (Could be fixed with additions to AI)-No destruction of enemy bases (I don't think they are going to add this, but... it would be nice to be able to disable the tribes foothold.Cons?:-I'm kind of on the fence about this one... there are the normal tribesmen and they are beautifully done (except the linear combat), but there are also ""mutants"" that are part of the tribes... they are basically big tanks and me personally... I think it kind of kills the scare factor. It doesn't scare me that a slow, giant made of multiple arms and legs is swinging in my direction. It's kind of creepy that I have to throw three sticks of dynamite to kill him, but other than that... not really. I want enemies that are smarter and faster than I am. The normal tribesmen aren't scary because of their looks or strength. They are scary because there are hundreds of them, they not only want to harm you, but they stalk you... you are their prey. They are hunting you... and they are... well they are supposed to be good at it. I think I'd prefer just the tribe, but the big mutants also have their pros. For instance, in the trailer I saw one break down a whole wall to let the rest of the tribe in... I would've **** my pants... but I haven't seen anything like that happen so.-I'm just being knit-picky here, but seriously what are the chances that not only your plane crashes and you survive, but you land on an island filled with cannibal mutants and find a convenient survival guide and hatchet?-I can't really think of much for cons that aren't just because it's in early access... There is no toggle crouch button!Summary: Great game that is only $15! Right now, I got 8 hours of singleplayer gameplay just from the survival aspects. It is my opinion that when the full game is released, it will be AAA quality. I bet by full release, you will be able to get 10 (If you only do the story, some exploring and basic survival) to 30 hours of gameplay on one playthrough, but this is the type of game that you can be able to play again and each time have a unique experience. (Especially if they add procedural generation)... There is one guy in the reviews who has 400+ hours of gameplay as of now... I think that is a little excessive, but you get the point. "

								The Forest is a game where you are a plane crash survivor, seeing your son get taken away by a mysterious figure. You exit the plane after you wake up fully and see a beautiful forest, light shafts peering through the leaves. You have a survival book, some soda, some protein bars, and an axe you found lodged in the head of an innocent flight attendant in the plane. You need to survive, if you don't you die. (No♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now that i'm done with the summary, let me just say, this game is amazing. Yes, it used to be buggy, but it really has come a long way. I, as well as many of the other backers/buyers of early access are VERY proud of the developers for getting this far in development. They are still actively developing this great game, and I am satisfied.Graphics: 8.9/10 (Very beautiful graphics)UI: 7.5/10 (Pretty solid)Animations: 8/10 (Great)Multiplayer/Co-Op: 6/10 (Good, just wish there were better implemented systems and more character models!)Singleplayer: 10/10 (TERRIFYING)Crafting: 9/10 (Very unique)Enemies/Cannibals: 10/10 (Creepy, Insane, VERY well done)Content Amount: 7.8/10 (Not an insane amount, wish there was a bit more)Map Design/Size: 8/10 (Pretty big and nicely done)Community: 6/10 (Small, quiet, friendly)Overall Rating: 8.4/10 (Very well done, but not finished yet. It's not a triple AAA title by any means, but it is a great game, and deserves this rating and recoginition.Reason I gave this rating is because I generally like this game. I am no fan boy by any means, but have been following the development since the 3rd Quarter of 2014, and I can say the game has come very far! I, as many others do look forward to the further development of this game.How many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are? Between 30-160 (You won't get very much replayability out of the game as of now)Thank you for reading my review. If you would like to see more of my reviews, check out my profile.			"

								You are the sole surivor of an airplane crash on a remote island.  Your fellow passangers, who by judging from the contents of their suitcases were tennis players that were hopped up on prescription drugs.  You obviously were not one of them given how you whine and complain about being cold and wet hungry and thirsty and tired all the time.  It's ironic that you were the one who survived.  The island itself is beautiful and you can choose to live in the snow capped mountains or a tropical beach and it's not without its cast of colorful characters- mainly cannibales in various stages of mutation.  Would I recommend this game absolutley!!! I have almost 200 hours logged in playing.  Given that it's an alpha build you have to be patient with the devlopers its not without its glitches and bugs but unlike other games I have played, the developers are always working on it to fix problems and add new content.  If you like survival games where you have to build cabins, tree houses hunt and fish or explore caves then this is the game for you.  One of the BEST features that is included are the cheat modes- put in by the developers.  If you just want to play as a survivor with no mutants you can.  If you want to play with them just coming out at night you can.  I thought the game was worth the money especially given that is is always evolving			"

								Your plane crashes. You wake up to see a mutant stealing your child. You decide that you must survive, but how does one survive? You follow your first instincts and kill those mutants and dismember their bodies. Sorting the limbs, heads, and torsos into separate piles and creating a ritual of sacraficing the torsos to the cliff gods. The remaining body parts are put on stakes and burned to show the other tribal islanders who's boss. You're not sure if these effigies frighten the tribals or turn them more aggresive, but you disreguard this thought and continue building your glorious meat statues. Some time passes, either hours or years, your sense of time has completely faded because your days consist of only murder, dismemberment, and cutting down trees. One day while you're speaking to yourself about how little you actually know about these mutants and hacking away at one of their necks with your axe you finally cut through it's vertebrae and the head separates from the body and somehow rockets you into the air and off a cliff, killing you instantly.11/10Would turn into a satanic mutant sacraficing maniac again.

								Literally raising the bar for Early Access games everywhere. A stunning example of what a dedicated small team of developers can accomplish. And don't even get me started on the AI, they freaking back off when their outnumbered, that's incredible to me. I think that these guys should do a talk at Bethesda or something.It blends Horror-Stealth-Surival-Resource Base Building-Combat and Exploration seamlessly.A truly unique game, one that cannot be properly experianced without playing it.If you do decide to ever so wisely purchase The Forest, I would suggest some Single Player before trying the Co-Op.Good luck, stay low and for the love of god, use your better judgement. Don't go towards the scary thing. Those things put classics creatures from things like Resident Evil or Silent Hill to shame. They are just pure unadulterated nope incarnate. Don't spoilt it for yerself. ;)			"

								This game...this ♥♥♥♥ing game...You've recovered from the plane crash, and begun gathering supplies.It's getting dark. You've finished gathering enough sticks to keep your fire lit for the night, and you're on your way back to your piecemeal camp, where you lay your head til dawn.......and then you spot him.There's a man, quite clearly insane and probably a cannibal, creeping around outside your camp.Do you attempt to sneak up on him and take him out silently, or simply abandon all of the work you've done so far, taking your chances further afield somewhere within The Forest?A blow to the back of the head makes the decision for you, and you awaken upside-down in a dark cave.Between you and your only chance of life on the surface are a myriad of unknown horrors, dangers, and darkness.You probably won't make it out alive... but if you do, your life will never be the same again, as you wage a one-man guerilla war on an entire tribe of the most devious creatures known to mankind.--------------One of the best developed, most atmospheric and incredibly satisfying survival experiences you'll ever have.The developers add new, somewhat unexpected amounts of additional content every month, as well as constantly addressing performance issues. This is a prima facia case of Early Access being used to it's finest extent.It's tense, it's rewarding, the systems are fantastic and the concepts are brilliant.The graphics are STUNNING, and the survival mechanics are the best available in the genre to date.I can't WAIT to see the finished product, but it's worth twice the price it sells for already!

								Frequent Updates, Great Game Play. I've been in and out of The Forest with many other games, but I always come back it's a great staple to have in your libary.I've enjoyed watching the game progress through alpha and it's constantly got better and added reasons to ""start over"" regardless of how big and amazing your base is.I would recomend this game for anyone, as it appeals to so many different types of Gamers.Well Done Endnight Games.

								I have had this game since it was first released. Didn't play it long because there were so many issues. But every time I come back to this game to see how things have progressed, I am always impressed. Interms of game play improvements and optimizations this dev team seem to care about their players experience. The new sound effects like wind through the trees makes this a truely immersive exeperience. The only thing I'd really like to see now, is the storyline progress more. But this game is a lot of fun single player and 10x the fun coop.As a fellow Unity developer as well. This is definitley the best looking game I've seen on the engine and is enspiring.			"

								This game is fantastic. I actually have no complaints about it so i'll list the pro's.- Devs who care/updates often- the difficulty increases as you get further in. The game wasn't hard at all until they started adding new cannibal types and hard mode. I'm on day 73 and if i'm alone i can easily die to a group of cannibals and a mutant. - the building mechanics are good and it's not easy to build, but not incredibly grindy either. - has a complete story - multiplayer is a blessing to this game, and fun to play with friends- rabbit breeding. - caves are spooky and there are a few jump scares.. ♥♥♥♥ing bats - you can live on a boat, or an island and peace the ♥♥♥♥ out away from cannibals if you wanted to xd- creative mode unlocked once you complete the game Actually i do have 1 complaint. there are actual lanters in the game that we cant take and put in our bases :( same thing with the head lamps the cannibals sometimes have. feelsbadman. overall, really solid game and 100% worth picking it up.

								I'm not one who writes reviews, but this game definitely earned one.The whole story may seem cliche. But it's beautiful and expansion of freedom makes it very interesting. Although it's just one map, it could be very interesting if it was open world-like or randomly generated terrain. Im not implying that it needs to be like that. Bu the game already has it's own freedom and limits. Now, about the horror. It genuinely had my friends and I screaming and questioning the giant baby-like monster and the four legged creature with like, twelve arms. The sounds and audio is crisp. But the only few things I had trouble with was the sources of food and the building. It's hard and time consuming but it's worth it.I like the game. 10/10.Sorry Timmy but it looks like I finally have my own place without a nagging wife.			"

 Let's do an assessment of each mode:  Single Player: Whilst you play the game alone, you start to have much more nervous tendancies, this encourages The Forest's type of gameplay. Everytime you try to collect materials, try to explore, or even try to gather food, your nerves are stretched and stressed. This is mostly knowing that there could just be that large group of cannibals nearby, who are more than willing to gnaw on your ankles. I highly reccomend doing the single player before going into the multiplayer, as it has a much more survivalist horror feel to it, a feel that almost every other Early Access Game i've played attempted but in the end failed to achieve. Multiplayer The Multiplayer is fantastic, although that is mostly due to how much you need to expose yourself in order to gather the most basic of items, players can fully take advantage of this, and become much more of a threat than any cannibals could achieve. Although if you are working together with other players on the multiplayer, you will likely power through the game, something which is a huge issue right now with a lack of content for the 'endgame'. Don't be disheartened however, as so far the game even in multiplayer can keep it's horror-survivalist tones. Additional Thoughts Although this is in early access, we need a lot more content, this game has the current capabilities to become a very great game, however, that does not gaurantee it will become that.  Same as with every other Early Access. I do really hope the Devs work hard on this game, giving us more content, hopefully even allowing the game to be modded. Such content introducing things as this will create a very good game.Graphics - The current graphics of the game are very beautiful, the skybox and rain effects are much better than i've seen in most 'AAA Titles'. Although there is some unecesary blurred textures in some areas this is an Early Access so these hopefully will be fixed. Sound and Ambient - The sound and ambience within this game will not help to calm you, surroundings will react to you being nearby, animals will run over sticks and through bushes when your gathering, making you worried of what may be around. This adds to the theme of the game greatly.TLDR:Single player is gud but need some sort of endgame Multiplayer is gud but needs more of a challenge for multiple playersNeeds Mod support!The more content that is released, the more I will enjoy this game, and I currently highly reccomend it.

								As i started to play this game i was like ""mweh just another survival game"" but then♥♥♥♥♥♥just got real. I nearly craped my pants when i went into my first cave. This game has everything. I personally dont see any point where this game could be considered bad. This game is outstanding. Its the first survival game where i had the feeling that i was rly in danger and that i need to survive. The AI is strong and can be a real pain but not in the♥♥♥♥♥..more in your hearth because of 3 supermutants going nuts on your base and hitting trees and walls like it were dominos. Its perfect for players who rly want to dig into a real survival feeling and the creative mode provides you the possibility to let your creative flow out. Always nice when you are just finishing the decorations of your base...chopping of some heads here and some legs there and BAM ANOTHER 3 SUPER MUTANTS IN YOUR BASE ♥♥♥♥ING YOU UP. Yeah. That is this game man. I cant rly say anything negative about this game except for the short story and that i want more.. oh and i rly like that this game is so bloody.Facts- Good and demanding AI- Building system works good and looks nice- The game has a rly nice feel when you play it...its just like everything fits together if you know what i mean- Ongoing Updates that keep this game fresh and exciting- Nice multiplayer (its perfect for you and some friends dude, i swear)- Pretty bloodyI can only give a thumbs up. This game is the best survival game released so far. Definitly better than Arc ( <- overrated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and i hope that this game will get more fans and the publishers will get some money to spend it on some ♥♥♥♥♥es. They deserve it.			"

								This game has some great graphics, the setting is amazing, it is easily able to induce some anxiety and really give you a run for your life. The sounds are amazing they are pitched perfect and give me the creeps when I'm waiting it out during the night and the creatures are crazy xD The leg thing gets me every time I see it, the only issues I've ever run into are the following,1. The Mutants Glitch run through the water and back out, even in the deep end where even the player is suppose to be swimming. 2. Multi Player where your have a friend on the boat and if they go into the inventory they glitch off and can slide off the boat.3. If you make it far enough to get on ""Betsy"" Which is the boat in the water some feet away, If you load back in sometimes, at least if you are the second player and not the host. The boat is filled with water making your player swim. 4. You can also see ""Fish"" Swimming through Betsy and kill them with your spear which really if you need the food isn't a bad thing!These are just the few things I noticed on the game. I know it's still in Beta [ or whatever it is before Alpha release] but the game is quite amazing, So far I've traveled to the colder region where the snow is. My friends and I are setting up a camp and diving more into the world, it's great and a large area to explore. The enemies can become quite over whelming when they swarm you in a group of 5/7 but if you have a decent set of people your good but its a great game for survival, building and fighting off cannibals.

I was sitting in the corner, an innoncent plane survivor eating his chocolate snack. All of a sudden, we saw him. A 5 legged spider monster thing coming at us.

								If you're looking for a game where you just want to keep ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself out if sheer terror The Forest is not for you.But, if you're looking for a very realistic, hardcore, survival-horror game that looks absolutely gorgeous, even in alpha, The Forest is what you're looking for.While you won't♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself because of any jump scares or most of the other elements of horror games, The Forest has its own brand of horror. During the day you will be able to see pretty well, but so many things around you look like the cannibalistic mutants that hunt you down. The whole time, even during the day, your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is clenched so hard you could cut through steel. Eventually after two hours of playing it becomes so exhausted you aren't able to hold your♥♥♥♥♥♥in anymore and then you start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself. Then somehow it gets worse at night because you can't see anything past your campfire. You will want to punch a baby right in the face from all the anxiety it gives you.Also the deer can become submarines and go underwater so that's pretty cool.Overall, 9/10, would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by mutant cannibals again.

								Though still being developed, and not without some bugs and slight graphical glitches here and there, The Forest is very good at what it is. The tribal A.I. is fascinating from afar. Few games have ever captured an A.I. that tries to spy on you but covers up the fact. When you catch them unaware, just remember that they can do the same to you. The first night that I realized a guy was 15 feet from my camp, watching me in the dark, was an expericance like none other. Not without flaws but still a welcome entry into the survival games genre, and with some excellent crafting and in-game guides.			"

								#HonestReviews - For ""The Forest (2014)"". [NO SPOILERS]Overall Rating: 8.6 Excellent!Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Audio: 9/10Content: 7/10Multiplayer: 8/10Price: 10/10---------------------------GRAPHICS - 9/10:---------------------------The graphics for this game in my opinion is outstanding for the genre and game type it's specifically refering to. In everygame, there is always room for improvement, but for my understanding I think the graphics on this game are just fantastic. Everything works togethwer well.----------------------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY & PERFORMANCE - 9/10:----------------------------------------------------------The gameplay in this game works really well, it's smooth and fairly optimized, however, I am running 2 GTX 1080s Superclocked, so other's performance may vary. But overall, the performace is fine. The overall gameplay is amazing and has a lot to offer.-------------------AUDIO- 9/10:-------------------The audio in this game likie most games are good. It's just what you'd expect it to be, realistic, and just pure amazingness!--------------------------CONTENT - 7/10:--------------------------For the content of this game I am not as happy with as everything else. The game at this current stage is in Alpha and I expect to see more content released in the near future, however, the game has been in Alpha for quite a while which is disappointing - Like some games that have Alpha for over 4-5 years and release small fixes and patches every few months. This game however as far as I have seen release patches every 2 weeks.The story of this game and end game looks to be unfinished and has been improving since it's early release of the game. I hope to see improvement here too. In my opinion, at this stage it felt a bit 'rushed' to me when I completed the game.It seems that after you've played a few hours of the game that there is not much else to do after building a base and completing the game. Playing Solo can be a bit boring and repetitive as you constantly knock down trees for hours to get the required materials you need in order to complete the things you make.The building in the game is amazing though, simple and easy to use, but you are limited to what you can build as in my opinion again, the lack of items is annoying; it seems like there is not much to build other than a house, walls around it and some light source, of course; you have your decorations etc, but I feel this is a BIG area that needs to be improved.---------------------------------MULTIPLAYER - 9/10:---------------------------------The multiplayer on this game works really well, however, you may experience some bugs and glitches. In addition, there are mods for the game that people can easily abuse and use to ruin games and the fun that people have. The multiplayer works really well and smooth compared to other games like this, I think this game has a great multiplayer setup.The devs have worked hard in fixes loads of issues with multiplayer and single player. But I've ntoiced the differences and I can tell you the game is just getting better and better.Note: At the time of this Review... The devs are currently working on getting dedicated servers for the game which I think will be even better although it's amazing as it is. ---------------------PRICE- 10/10:---------------------All I can say is the price is good for what the game has to offer. This may change in the future though.---------------------Overall, you should buy this game if you like Survival Horror Building games. The game seems to be improving rapidly, so expect more fun!Thanks for reading,#HonestReview by Lewis2014.Notes: If you woul like more detailed honest reviews on this or any other games I have, please contact me.---------------------			"

								To Long; Wont Read: This game is an 8.5/10 from me, with a great potential of one day being a solid 10/10. IT feels like a survival game that you actually have to work to survive.  Would recomend to a freind. This is my second review ever on a video game (Rust Legacy), I have been using Steam for multiple years. With that being said, a game has to be bloody amazing for me to take the time to sit down and right a review. I had my doubts about purchasing this game, after having watched multiple youtube video's it seemed like the game was not has hard or ""scary"" as a few videos had made it out to be. The graphics looked nice, but it looked like a.. as a previous review called it: ""Lumberjack Simulator""After recieving some Christmas money, I deceided to take the plunge and get it. No Regrets.I described this game to a buddy last night, and I think my description was pretty accurate:""Imagine being on an island with a bunch of cannibals that have never seen technology before, have their own system of rules, and outnumber you severely. That's what playing this ""Game"" is. The AI in this game acts exactly as I would expect a civilization within those parameters (right word for that I believe) to act... And some of the most beautiful scenery/graphical detail that I have seen in a video game in a long time.""It should be important to note here, that I dont do Alpha games often, this is only the third I have ever done, and the first that I have enjoyed that FELT like an Alpha. There are some clear bugs in this game, none that are what I would call game breaking - that I have encountered - but some clear bugs none the less. Co-Op is a bit wonky, but its fairly new to the game, and should be hashed out within the next few patches.What I enjoyed most about this game is that it actually FEELS like survival. Rust was (is (Legacy Rust)) great but it didnt FEEL like a survival game, once you get a small base established, there really wasnt much that could threaten you save for other players, getting a base established wasnt that hard, and although occasionaly things went wrong, they never really felt like a struggle. In The Forest, from the moment you step off the plane it FEELS like you really have your work cut out for you. The scenery is beautifal in that Tropical Rainforest kind of way, the wild life feels a bit.. how to describe this.. not out of place, but automated, but it doesnt really detract from the greatness of the situation. And then you encounter the first Native. Its an odd moment, and one that I have never had the same outcome to. How you act, greatly sets the pace of the game, I wont ruin the reactions to you, but will give you something to think about. Actions have consequences that you will feel the vibrations from for your entire playthrough. From what I understand the developer seems to play their cards close to their chest, but has been reliable thusfar in patching the game and providing new content updates. It seems like (from what I have heard) that they dont always get the job done 100% the first time, but they DO follow through and correct any wrongs. In my opinion thats a great sign, no one expects a small team to deliver an A+ on every patch, but when faults are discovered, they deserve to be (and are) corrected. I mentioned previously in the review that a few video's on youtube have made this out to be an incredibly scary game, but I dont believe the viewer really gets an understanding of that without being in the game themselves. The game is not scary, and I dont think it intends to be. With that being said, the game DOES have a large amount of.. ( I sat here for a few minutes trying to put a word to the feeling you - I - get when playing this game, because I am unable to do so, I will describe the time when I get this feeling) The feeling is the same one you get when your watching a horror movie that ISNT scarry, but is full of jump scares. The feeling when you know that something is getting ready to leap out at you, there is no suprise about it coming, you just dont know when its going to happen. That feeling is present in a large portion of this game, and it does it very well. EDIT: Suspenseful.. that would have been a good word for this (lol)I compared this title to the only other title in the same or similar genre that I have played and enjoyed (Rust) even though their are vasts differences between the two. With that being said, I expect to spend just as many hours having fun with this game as I have had with Rust Legacy. (800 hours at the time of writing)Just in case you were wondering about performance- My Specs: Playing with everything maxed out I never noticed a drop in framerates or any other visual performance issue (although the terrain sometimes has issues with Boulders/Cliffs from what I can tell, Animals sometimes have no collision with them)GTX 7602- 120GB SSD (which this game is installed on)1 TB HDD 2x4 GB Ram 1600hzMSI 970A-G46 MoboPro's:Survival game that feels like its a survival gameAmazing AINo set strategy, different outcomes based on different actionsLarge amount of craftable items that have clear benefits/purposeJust enough in game support (like the crafting manual) where you arent totally lost, but can still experement with things yourself.Con's:No ability to draw or create a map (from what I have found so far) so getting the layout has been doable, but difficult.No hostile animals (from what I have found) other than sharksHas enough bugs that you remain aware that the game still needs work, nothing that makes it unplayable (imo) but enough that immersion is sometimes broken.Things I would like to see in the future: Better Rafts/Houseboats3rd Person (Im torn on this one, I think 3rd person would be awesome, but it might break the Fear Factor)Better Bow (the Bow is really strong, but wildly inaccurate, would rather it be a tool to use where the hitting factor is determined by Skill, not RNG. (or maybe it is and I am just really bad with it)Better realisim on wildlife			"

								The Forest is a great survival/horror Game!This Game is about you and your journey to find your son, who got kidnappedfrom a Tribe of really mad natives. Also Cannibals are on your Butt and try to eat your legs!The Building-System is pretty good eventough there are bugs here and there,but thats not a Problem because the Game is constantly getting updated.The Developers even did the feature to show the exact time when the Update is coming out.This can be seen on the bottom left corner of the menu ingame.The Game is still in early acces so if bugs or glitches happen, the developers will fix it soon!So all in all this is a Great Survival game and is worth a try.In my opinion its one of my favourite survivalgame, because it's a survival game we have not seen yet.If you take DayZ, H1Z1, Rust or any other survival game then you will see its not that hard, but in this game it's different! You are constantly focused and ready to react quick, because the natives are on you and watch you!The Co-op mode is a lot of Fun!But you should play it with friends and not play on an online server, the other players can annoy some times.In multiplayer there are some bugs, but those are not critical.The Story isn't really there yet. It's still in development.Everyone who is interested in a good survival game has to try! :D			"

								From having only played an hour so far, I would say that this game has a lot of potential. Many features in the game are quite simplistic, such as the crafting menu and your player's inventory. There's almost no hassle when using them, and you won't get confused. The only bad thing about the crafting is that once you place a blueprint down, you can't remove it to build somewhere else (at least I haven't found a way to yet).The atmospheric tone of the game is excellent. It's very dark and creepy, especially if you venture into the cave systems. The lighting is well done, both inside the caves and outside, and the sounds are simply brilliant. The mutants/tribesmen--whatever they actually are--add a more ominous element to the game, and they work surprisingly well early on in the game's stage.If you're a fan of survival games, The Forest is definitely for you. You can get a spear and use it to go fishing, or just run around with it attacking things like a madman. Aside from fish, I've only seen lizards and rabbits so far as a food source, as well as energy bars. There are quite a few bugs that I've noticed while playing, but that is to be expected in alpha. Certain objects, namely some rocks and containers, have no mass and you can walk straight through them. Some tools, such as the second axe you find in the game, can be replicated repeatedly. I had amassed a large stack of them at my camp by accident while switching to other tools. I wouldn't worry too much about the bugs right now. The development team of this game seems very promising, and I have the utmost faith that they will fix them to the best of their abilities.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to any survival or horror fanatic.

								 My thoughts on ""The Forest""After making a few videos on it and Clocking some Hours And spending what I had left on it I have a few things to say.Yes you should buy it, you don't need to buy it, but you should. It is perfect for survival junkies and slates the special Itch I've been having for these types of games. The gameplay, though a bit clunky when you encounter a glitch, is still very responsive, and evey swing with your weapon has a very real weight to it. Every encounter with the mutants are usually jarring especially when they sneak up on you, Props to the developers that made it so chopping down a tree can be a tense click session so you can get the supplies and get the hell outa there. The AI is a bit clunky and it gets a bit weird, But when it works it's a good scare when the Tribals come to eat your lovely manflesh.After a Few recordings I truly see how beautiful this game can get and graphically it is lovely, but you might need a beefy Graphics card and processor to run it at max.The blood feature is also a good nod to show that you also need to keep good hygene and keep from getting mucked up with blood can get a wound infected, and the gathering of food is rather nice, Spearing fish and skinning rabbits and lizard to get armor and keeping yourself well fed. The Stealth is rather responsive, hiding behind trees and ducking behind rocks to keep your location unknown you your visitors is good, and I find it interesting that the tribals Will actively watch over their territory, sending patrols out that can locate your camp, and will at times wait in the trees for you to return.The Forest it's self is a enemy to you, you can easily get lost and end up stumbling upon Hungry Tribals, or just loosing your barrings in General. But of course there are some hiccups, at times you can pick up items but they end up deleting out of your inventory, The inventory system could also use a fix so I'm not panicing trying wo switch to my axe when ambushed at the pond.What I want, Coop, and some better tools and weapons, and a Gilly suit would do nice for the stealth.Those and some more building options like Tree houses or Hidden homesBut besides that the game is worth your time, and 15 bucks is a good asking price for this Rather lovely game.So give it a chance and let yourself get lost in this True Survival Horror.

								Horror Lumberjack Simulator 2015Try 1 -I spawn, i go to break open some luggage, gollum kills me. I wake up in the caves. I spend around an hour finding the exit. I finally climb out of the caves on a rope ladder and come out into this shed looking thing. I walk around, stretching my legs from the cramped caves. I fall back into the hole, only to die.Try 2 -I spawn again, only this time, Im on the beach. I decide to take a different approach. I quickly build a hunting shelter. I spend the night in the shelter huddling by my fire that got eventually put out by the rain. The next day, I directly go to build a small raft. I finally build it only to find out that it lacks a sail. After a really quick search, I realize that it hasnt been implemented yet. I decide to push the raft along and find a more suitable beach for life. I dock my raft in a little pond of invisible water right by the shore. I immediately place a large house. It requires 82 logs. I slave away until night time lumberjacking my hands off. After I put the last log I had into the house, I still had 12 logs left to collect. Then it dawned on me. I had no shelter made. I hastily put together a ramshackle standing fire and huddled by it as the natives gathered closer. Eventually the fire died as did I. By now, I was just so done. I just ran out of the caves and got killed by a native right as I came out. I turned off my computer. I just sat there, looking at a black, empty screen.10/10 would die again			"

								in this show, you're set in alternate universe of ""Home Improvement"", where Tim Allen and Richard Karn (in co-op) crash land on a forest island during a vacation between seasons of ""Tool Time"". The primary goal of the game is to quickly ignore your kidnapped child and set about building tree houses and gazebos. to build your gazebos and cabin mansions, you need to deforest roughly 2/3rds of the forest to acquire enough logs. This is proven easy, however, since the plane crash has rendered both Tim and Richard the ability to chop down trees and run with logs at record speeds.As well as extremely inefficient carpentary, Tim and Richard have taken cues from Martha Stewart, and you're given the ability to decorate your weapons with teeth, or make festive human effigies that spruce up the now tree-devoid camp site. you can also decorate yourself in raw lizard skin and deer hides.your main adversary in the game are the birds. songbirds will swarm you like angry bees, and seagulls will fly out of your mouth from time to time. a proven method to deal with the birds is to surround yourself with a fire, which will burst the offending birds into flames, or simply standing next to a fire will suffice. Birds do not sleep.all in all a good game.			"

								Such a great game! Sure it has its bugs because well it is an alpha after all, but it is sooo much fun to play! Its hard to write about the pros and cons for this game as it is only alpha. The Forest features its own unique style of building and crafting as well a horde of enemies. Enemies are passive until provoked or become too curious per say... You can leave 'em alone, kill 'em, or chop 'em up and eat them! I appreciate that the game has a co-op feature as an alpha build and in my time playing with friends it has been a delightful experience of horror survival fun. The game looks good and runs well with the exception of fps drops that sometimes happen when entering caves and getting launched because of the bugginess of the log carts & logs. Not sure what solo survival is like, but I can say co-op with friends is really fun. The story is rather interesting and I would like to see what the devs do to expand upon the story and its elements, and yeah this game is beatable with its own ending. Beat the game in normal mode and unlock the game's experimental hardmode with tougher enemies. All in all, I would definitely recommend buying (even in its early access state), and playing this game.10/10 "

								Day 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.I awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell ""SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE ♥♥♥♥"" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event. Exiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. ♥♥♥♥ yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of ♥♥♥♥ and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight. I keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites! Day 2-4:Not only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that ♥♥♥♥.I have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.Day 5:Walls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.It's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.on my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now.  "

YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



For those who want what i think of the game then keep reading!I started off in the forest crashing in the plane, my son next to me. This ended up after the crash with one of the cannibals appearing infront of me with my child.He runs away and you are alone, other than a few rabbits.So i pick up my axe and get ready to chop some tree's, i chop away and the whole tree come tumbling down, showering the floor with logs. I then check out my survival guide and am told to build a shlelter, i select it and get ready place it, to which i get attacked from behind and dragged into a cave.I open my eyes to see nothing but dead people and heads on sticks, it's dark, i'm lost and creeped out!The forest is so far a wonderfully creepy game, i wouldn't say a horror game in the sense you will be scared (at least for me).However you will constantly be on your toes, wondering what each and every noise is. You will be building your house and see people suddenly around you climbing the trees.The atmosphere is superb.The graphics are very nice too, considering this is an indie game in alpha i am VERY impressed. The sounds are a little bat at times, when the plane crashes it doesn't feel like there was much going on. The child is just sitting there not making a noise and so was i. Although this is most likely and alpha thing and there will be more when the game is more complete.Overall i would say even now in an alpha state this game is very muhc worth it's price as it captures what it is trying to do so well. Not to mention it will only get better and better, to which i assure you all this game will be extremely good when complete.If you like to be scared, if you like to survive then pick this up!			"

								My friend and I load into game. We spend 10 minutes throwing tennis balls at eachother. It's getting late, let's get serious. We set down the foundation for a cabin and start collecting logs. We complete it the next morning after making a poorly made tent to sleep the night away. We're both starving. I suggest hunting Bambi. The land is rich with wildlife. The first deer I approach runs off at around 50 mph straight off a cliff, leading into the ocean... The second runs in circles, taunting me, it knows how exausted I am. It's confident in it's abilities, but I however am not. We spend the rest of the day hunting, but to no avail. I suggest a new approach. I have one bottle of liquor. I make a molotov. Things get intense. We approach a deer, we're in a bit of a rush, ""this is murder"" I said.  My friend replied saying it was what we had to do to survive. I feel my throat getting dry. I grip the molotov, I take a breath... I throw it at the deer. The bottle crashes against the deer, hitting it in the head. The deer stops, dazed, and runs away. My friend and I stare at eachother in silence. I forgot to light the molotov.Thus ends our first play of Forest. "

Early Access Review
								This game is pure innovative genius! It sucks you in from the start with a realistic plane crash, a mysterious island, and some weird naked dude who likes to sneak up on me while I'm chopping down trees. I decided to kill him...not the best idea I've ever had, as later that night while  I was snuggled up by my campfire, his buddies decided to show up. Now I understand this game is in alpha, but holy hell it's fantastic. The bad guys are fast moving, calculative creeps who won't give up. You can interact fully with the environment around you, and pretty much build an epic survival compound. Sure, there are bugs, but not many that I've seen. The worst of it is there's a bloody table that seems to haunt my camp. It has a life of its own as it floats around and crashes into my house. No problem! everything else so far seems to be working fine. So Jump in, immerse yourself and see how long you can survive. I think I've made it to about day 10 right now, and my fortress in impenetrable. I hope...			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of the few early access games that I have faith in.The Forest is more than just a game for me, after visiting Yellowstone National Park in upstate Wyoming, I could really compare the seemingly cold-ish forest environment to The Forest because the devs in my opinion have changed so much since v0.01 to make it FEEL like you're in the forest. They work with graphics and just amazing sound. The environment feels so natural that I don't want to even be interupted when playing this game, because it's THAT GOOD!Starting from the beginning plane crash, the 1 minute-or-so intro is better than my 48 hours on DayZ, and is more interesting. On top of that the devs nailed the in-flight ambience, me just recently flying on a two hour plane to Chicago it was something to truly compare. When the plane splits into thirds the sounds of seperation deeply add to the immersion, I'm already wrapped into the game before even playing this thriller. On the surface, the atmosphere and environment is very well-done. I especially like stepping out for heavy winds blowing through the forest. At night the sound of cannibals screaming in the distance can also put one to a shiver. Cave environments are even more scary. The devs did so by adding fantastic ambience sounds and lots, and lots, of props that I won't spoil here. Also, the reason that this is the only early-access game I have faith in, is because the devs, number one, let you know when the next update is, and they have a suggestion thread which they RESPOND to! This way, you can look forward to the next update and really see what the devs are doing, and how the work well. I actually think my grandkids would be able to play a sequel to a sequel, to a sequel, etc. Because the development rate and consistency is so good. The devs have a LOT OF POTENTIAL HERE! DON'T RUIN IT!You may not like this, but the amount of content in this game, the amount of fun I've had in my -so far- 21 hours, is worthy of at least a 30$ game if not 40$. By realease, if the devs don't screw up you could be looking at a 50$ game. This game could be like Alien: Isolation, I say this because they've gotten a base for sound, environment, and horror. They just need to do more.I rate this game, as of this state, an 11/10, especially for being a trusty early-access. WITH CO-OP! Another pro!Truly a fantastic experience and I expect myself to continue to play it for a long time.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm impressed by the stunning visuals and depth of crafting, the sound blows me away and the overall feel of the game is superb. Even in early access this game performs better than most AAA games for more than half the price. Pair this with the fact the development team continues to update this product with new features, fix issues and keep the community up to date every step of the way it really just goes to show how we've barely seen this game scratch the surface of what it can deliver. About the gameThe game sees you as the main protagonist that was on a flight that crash-landed on a mysterious island occupied by cannibals. You have to scavenge supplies in order to survive, you then have to make basic shelter in order to start your journey of surviving in this hostile environment. Once you have constructed your initial camp you can then start gathering supplies to create more complex traps and equipment, this is a must if you want to find the rest of the plane passengers and most important of all, your son. The combination of eerie music, stunning visuals, great crafting system and the fact you have terrifying groups of cannibals hunting you down makes this game a real adrenaline ride.			"

								Been a while since I've felt so much tension and horror from a game. I despise EA games, but the active development and the presentation of this game is done right. Survival isn't absurdly overdone, crafting is nice and smooth as building is, and the atmosphere of just everything in this game is done right. I also may state this is one of the prettiest games I've seen, and that's saying something, because there are hardly any Unity games that don't even remotely come close to this.You might get comforable playing co-op (even then, I still got scared), but playing alone is a whole different story. True horror. It can get severely buggy in some areas, but I'm hoping the dev team will take care of this.			"

								The survival/crafting genre has been milked to hell and back the past couple of years, with the quality of such games being more inconsistant than Robbaz's uploading schedule. This game however... PHWOAR!The graphics are glorious, utilising lighting and particle effects to compensate for the slightly subpar textures, yet it runs like a dream. There's not much else to say, it's so damn gorgeous. The gameplay? Surprisingly polished! Everything works just about perfectly, nothing is too stiff or dysfunctional. I may have uh, ricoched into the air a couple of times, but none resulted in my slow and PAINFUL demise. I did fall through the floor at one point, and these clipping issues are something I'm sure the devs will iron out over time. It's difficult to remember the game's in alpha.Everything is fun to do, and it's difficult to become tired of the tens of buildables within the survival book. Playing with my friends in this game was the greatest experience I've had in a long time. Add this to the fact that the devs are adding and tweaking content regularly, The Forest is simply a glorious buy. 9/10, would accidently step on fire again. (Oh and stock up on cloth) "

Worth the price and can easily become one of your top played games and hopefully your freinds too.

								Since the inclusion of Peaceful mode I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring the forest without worrying about getting one hit killed by a random cannibal. I love the atmosphere in both modes and I honestly cannot wait for each new update to arrive. I hope the game never gets finished.....don't misunderstand me though, I don't mean the developers should fail, I mean that there is infinite potential for updates and new tasks and items to be added. so to the developers I ask only this - Please never be done with this and keep releasing new things for us all to yearn for.

								The Forest is a survival horror game that actually does survival horror right, from the sound to how everything looks, Thats why I instantly fell in love with The Forest, the immersion. If you have ever played the Silent Hill series, you would know of how good a job it makes you feel like you're alone, but not ALONE. And that is what seperates The Forest from the rest of the ""zombie"" survival ""horror"" games, it gets rid of the generic zombie foe that you don't mind putting a couple rounds into and gives you a native cannibalistic tribe that may make you think before taking them out incase one of them gets away and alerts the rest of the tribe.This game is legitimately scary, from your first sighting of the tribe searching the plane wreck to the first time you get knocked out and dragged to their cave. It's purely atmospheric horror and It doesn't just rely on cheap scare tactics like jump-scares and loud noises like other survival horror games.Now on to the survival aspect of The Forest, I personally think this part was really well done, it actually makes you adapt and survive! From not being able to eat raw meat and actually having to put it onto the fire and wait for it to cook so you don't burn it, to simply how the tree cutting animations are and finding berries that are not poisonous to eat.At the moment it's pretty buggy. But what do you expect from a pre-alpha? I'm really looking forward to seeing what Endnight games can do with The Forest in the future. This game would easily be Game Of The Year for me, normally I wouldn't even fathom choosing a game like this for GOTY, but The Forest is just perfect to me, and can definitely see this being one of my all time favorites.

								Hands down one of the best Survival games out there and it's constantly being updated. I've put money towards a few of these alpha games. The only one that really feels like it has gotten better is The Forest (Rust somehow got worse in my opinion.)From collecting resources to make a safe home, to cooking food, collecting water, and finally taking the fight to the cannibals, the only thing this game doesn't allow is eating the cannibals for eating your friends. I'm eagerly looking forward to further updates, areas, and whatever else they may add to this thrilling game.			"

								A friend of mine bought this on Early Access. I, myself, was a bit skeptical of buying games that are still in development, but after watching my friend, I was sold on the game. This game is brimming with potential and it's only in pre-Alpha. I cannot even imagine what the finished product will look like.This game is sure to pull you in with the atmosphere it creates, the gameplay, graphics and sound effects it presents. With this game, you'll end up spending hours constructing your perfect fort, hunting animals and killing cannibals. And the fact, that it gets updated with new features, about every month, is sure to maintain your confidence in this project, if not bolster it. More than worth the money I paid.			"

								The Forest gives you some starter survival help in the form of ever-replenishing suitcases filled with snacks, but besides that, leaves you bloodied and alone to live or die, by your own will and cunning.Before you perfect the art of surviving this world, or even learn how to chop a tree down properly,  night and mutants arrive to test your defenses and your nerves. You get hungry and thirsty in painfully realistic intervals. ""Oh I'm famished again, let me just pick this delicious looking mushroom..."" Game Over, you made it 1 days!Once you get the hang of it though, the stark, real-yet-unreal presence  of The Forest itself begins to take over as the main character, for which you are at best a temporary witness. Perhaps it's a kind of pergatory, or another dimension, but whatever this land is, it is also unquestionably beautiful.Build a ringfort, or the ultimate tree-house, or some other way of staying warm and safe from the ever-curious and ever-hungry mutants (they really like the airplane snacks, and you happen to have eaten nothing but said airplane snacks for a week).No matter what you build, or where you go, or what you kill or call into being, the most compelling piece of this game is that you remain alone, in a fetchingly hostile place, which drives you toward answers that are as yet unknowable. Whatever the metaphoric weight of all this might mean, simply taken as a work of art, it doesn't get more lovingly rendered than this game, which makes one believe that this small team is capable of even greater things.9/10			"

								I dont normally do any reviews of any game, because i simply dont care, but, when you encounter certain games that you really enjoy you feel compelled to do soThe forest its a really interesting survival with excellent graphics, ambient, theme and mostly environment, it feels so unique and wonderful the place itself, you eventually feel like you are inside of the islandThe only thing that i would add to the game its more objectives, more things to do around, or for example, that depending of how many days you have survived you start getting waves and waves of mutants, it should get harder to survivee and MOST OF ALL, what i would like to see its a hardcore mode on mutiplayer that if you die or anyone dies 2 times, you permanently die or at least are unable to spawn until 1 day or something like that, because the fact that you simply respawn on the plane takes away the danger element and the vulnerability of the game, you dont really fear dying since you know you just respawn and thats it.Make it more challenging and to horribly fear death and losing everything, a game that once everyone dies, the save game erase itself, there must always be 1 survivor to make your friends re spawn in some hours again, i know the concept seems hard to understand but all i want its to really fear the forest and surviving, and not just harvest wood until i get bored of building stuff.Keep up the good work and let me know about your thoughs of a hardcore mode			"

								I remember getting this game so long ago, maybe even when it was first available. Playing it now, shows how far this game has gotten. It is freaking awesome. SO many new things are added in because it is constantly being updated. I first played alone, I think it was only singleplayer when it first came out. However, this is not the way to play the game. YOU MUST PLAY WITH YO FRIENDS. The memories and trials that you all will survive through is irreplaceable. Why is it so fun to put body parts on a stick and make traps with your friends? I don't understand it. Anyway, the amount of new craftable crap is amazing compared to when it first came out. You can entertain yourself just by building your settlement. When do don't feel like doing that, you can go explore, which always brings up someting interesting. All in all, it is a very great game at a very modest price. I salute the devs, this is how you make a survival game.			"

								Well, I've officially played enough of this game that I feel like I can give a solid reveiw (and a TL;DR version). I played this game a lot on a friend's computer, and logged in over sixty hours before I bought it myself. So, with over 100 total hours of play between single and multiplayer, I have to say -  I love this game, and I cannot play it enough.TL;DR,Pros >Get to survive a plane crash>Fight hordes of savages with some of the best AI I've come across>Option to stay peaceful and coexist with said savages>Cannibalism>Sick crafting action>Mad raft drifts>Frequent updates with countdown to next update >Dope Spelunking>Horror is 11/10 levels of Nope>You can lumberjack down the whole The Forest like it's Pioneer Simulator 2015 Elite Edition>Looks better than Crysis 2>Mad survival simulation; you have to keep warm, dry, clean, hydrated and well fed. Good luck.>Close enough to reality that you'll never want to go to Vancouver Island (the island looks like its in BC, to clarify)Cons>Occasionally an update will be bumped back a day or two>Official wiki is poorly maintained>Game loses it's sheeit when you're hosting a large game>Can't viciously murder Canadian Geese>...This game is fraking amazing - I really love survival horror games, and this game was the first game to give a great balance for both. I have never been truly unsettled by a vidya as much as I have The Forest. No spoilers, but there is a great and unexpected amount of body horror and truly unsettling caves. the crafting and building in this game are great, and as of version 0.18b they have both been incredibly fluid. There are frequent updates that add great new content, and every new update has cemented my love of the game. Oh, and it's fraking gorgeous. Like, for real dood - it looks better than Skyrim and a big chunk of other AAA games.And the freedom dood - you can completely avoid conflict (a new breed of stealth) or hunt down every single other person on the island and murder (and cannibalize) them. Wanna live on a lake? Make a houseboat. Wanna live in the woods? Make a log cabin, or a treehouse. Explore the mountains and caves, looks for signs of other survivors... or just chill out and farm. The fact that there is such a small dev team that are so involved and hard at work is impressive, and as a Canadian I am astounded that they're based in British Columbia (it's great to see Canadian Content that isn't amateur as frak).I can't recommend this game enough - it's like an HD First person version of Don't Starve,but way more indepth and a lot more realistic.11/10, the greatest video game to come out of Canada (including GTA III and Mass Effect, yes).

								This game is amazing. It is so realistic made forest. You begin on the plane with your son and suddently your plane crashes to island with mutants and canninbals. The canninbal takes the child and your goal is to save him, but as you begin to explore and survive you begin to face the mutants, canninbals, weather changes...You can built an awesome bases around the crashed plane, on forest, on mountains, on beach and even in caves (BEWARE: Each time you save or spawn there, the mutants an canninbals will spawn too. If you build your base right between where canninbals have camps, then expect to have attacks, they will come everytime). Also making traps against canninbals is sweet idea, so you can protect yourself against them and finished them with normal or modern axe.I gaved three copies to my friends and we created a lot of bases and traps but theres more to explore :3Yes the game is in alpha stage, so expect some funny or weird bugs for example like: - Throwing TNT on the ground around 5 trees and suddently 10 more trees fall down but in the end you get a lot of logs,- Canninbals no clipping through trap when the trap isnt activated, (FIXED)- When you chop down the tree, few logs launch into air high,- Spider Mutant or Armsy Mutant destroys one part of your base but can accidently destroy other side of your base somehow. (FIXED)- Trying to hit canninbals while they just stand and you somehow get hitted once or twice. (FIXED)Me and my friends are enjoying this game so much because its fun and open world and exploring so much new things.And in every update this game gets better and better.If you love forest and exploring on adventure to find and built stuff, you should get this game right now :DKeep it up developers, you did an amazing job on this game.EDIT: So after 500 hours I have made the most amazing bases, my friends who played it, gived up at 60 hours ingame but I continued and I will until I can. The new updates since this review came were awesome and they fixed a lot of bugs. And the canninbals are getting smarter by each update :)			"

Early Access Review
								I came back to The Forest after leaving it alone for some time and was extremely happily surprised to see how much it's been updated. I thought to myself, ""This is going to be great! I loved this game when it first came out, and now, I'm going to love it more!"", I was right in thinking that, but there is a darker side to this tale.At first, everything was smooth. I did my usual method of surviving by first off, looting everything I could from the crashed plane and the luggage around it. Then I did some recon, working out if there were any cannibal camps nearby and locating a good spot for my own camp site. I found a good spot, near the beach so there was fish nearby and also the abandoned boat. I was lucky that I came across some rope so soon, so I set up some molotov tripwires around my camp, built a fire pit and a sleeping point.All was good, I was avoiding the cannibals just fine. I was spotting them off in the distance every now and then while I was hunting for food, but they never seemed to come too close to my camp. At least, until one day.I was skimming along the beach, killing lizards for their skin and meat, and as I made my way back to my camp, I heard a blood chilling god awful screech. imagine a pig cross bred with a cat that had just been stabbed by a blade covered in lemon juice, that's the kind of scream it was. Saying it made me jump would be an extremely light way to put it!And of course, I soon found what made the scream. Near my camp, sitting on a rock and just studying my home was a cannibal scout leader. I could tell since he was decorated with arms galore! At this point, a staring contest began. We both just watched each other, and I can't lie, I was terrified that he was going to attack. But then I realized something! He was alone. I made sure, looking around carefully to see if there was any others. There wasn't, so I made the first move! I struck him, whacking him with my hand made axe until he was lying on the ground in agony, breathing heavily. Then, I took out a rock, stood over him and cracked his skull in until he was dead.Doing this, I did feel a bit sick since I had just caved in a living things face with a rock, but I was safe. He hadn't alerted other cannibals to my campsite, so I felt relaxed at least. In case this happened again though, I cut up the cannibals body, taking his head and sticking it on a spike as a warning to any others that may come across my camp. I figured that should ward them off if any come too close again.I think I made a huge mistake... That night, I was sleeping, my characters sanity having gone down a little from when I cut up that corpse. But as I rested, expecting to wake up the following morning, I was stunned to find myself waking up inthe middle of the night. ""What the... Why isn't the sun up?!"" is what I first said. And then I remembered.You can't sleep if there's an enemy nearby...When I realized this, I dropped a brick in my underwear... The first thing I did was crouch, staying in some bushes right near my bed, looking around constantly. What was worse, the only light was the moon, since lighting a fire at night is one BAD idea if there's something nearby. I knew I couldn't do anything to draw attention, and I knew something was out there.I was constantly looking around, hearing twigs snapping, bushes rustling, things moving all around my camp, all the time I was just constantly whispering, ""What the fu*k?!"" over and over. Every now and then, I could see a glance of something moving around the trees. My blood pressure must of been crazy high at this point, but it was about to get a lot higher...Out of no where, like something from a nightmare, another monstrous scream rang out! It was so sudden and so terrifying that I actually screamed myself. Not like a man, either. I screamed like a little girl and yanked my headphones off, shaking my head going ""No, no, no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope!"" I closed my eyes, breathing and panting heavily, my hands were shaking on my keyboard and mouse...Whatever kind of cannibal was out there, it was close. That I knew. And the worst part was, I couldn't sleep until it was gone. So... I put my headphones back on, determined to be as brave as I could and I statyed where I was, hidden in some bushes, shaking like a nervous wreck as I looked around constantly in a panicked state. You have no idea how terrifying it is to have no light, everything around you completely darkened, making it so hard to see any little thing, and all the time, you hear things moving around you and you have no idea if it was a raccoon or something that could kill you...I don't know how long it took, but when the sun finally came up, I breathed a sigh of relief and gave thanks to the gods as my panting finally stopped. I was covered in sweat! Still shaking! And I looked around my camp, making whatever was out there in the night was gone. It was, so I saved my game and quit to windows until I'm next feeling brave enough to venture into The Forest.As a man in my 20's and a huge fan of horror, having loved the genre for over 10 years, I'm used to all sorts of things and this isn't a boast when I say this, but I am extremely hard to scare.However, this game, The Forest? It's the first thing in years to make me sream like a little girl. Impressive!10/10 would make my underwear brown again.And I'm so buying this game when it comes out on PS4 as well!			"

								Terryfying when the music starts playing and you have no idea where are the cannibals. But very satisfying when you kill them with your upgraded axe. Then this game starts to make you feel like you're an actual person in the game and vow for revenge onto the cannibals. It also gives you the real feeling when you explore in caves instead of RPG like where you don't feel anything when you do. Overall I gotta say it's a great game and developers keep up with the updates not to dissapoint us. 10/10			"

								NO SPOILERS! The Forest is a pretty good game, especially for early access (alpha). Playing with friends, adventuring together, chopping trees and fighting enemies made this game very satisfying to play. The game ran very well with a few fps drops when going into caves but other than that well optimized. The story was very well worth it imho, specualtion occurred a lot between myself and friends each time we found a piece of story. Will definitely play this game again when it is (if it is) fully released.			"

								The entire reason I began PC Gaming was because of DayZ. Well that game is horrible compared to The Forest, and it makes up for the disappointment DayZ gave me. My friend and I play this game a good amount together and when you think you've seen it all, this game has even more to throw at you. Pros:- Fight Cannibals with Cannibalism- Crafting System- Dynamic Weather- You'll get Sp00ked- Player has the Choice to End the Game- Custom Housing- Treetop Communities are Possible- Burn People Alive with a Flare Gun- Jumping into a Giant Sinkhole and losing everything - or nothingCons:- Hunting a Deer makes you feel like a Monster when you kill it (It Cries)- Alligators/Crocodiles are Scarier than Sharks- Dynamite Explosion is a 5/10- The 4-8 legged 16 armed creatures will be in your nightmares (but the final boss is wayyyyy worse)- Sharks spawn on the beach in Multiplayer (You Can't Hunt Them)Overrall this is a great game for any PC gamer			"

								Crazy fun game. I started playing 3 days ago. I was playing co-op with 2 other friends. On our 1st play through we built a pretty large base with double high stone walls surrounding our buildings and a pond on top of a cliff near the sea. We also had a small retaining wall further out from our base. As our base grew larger and we cut down more tress and we attracted more cannibals. On the 4th night it was pure chaos. We were hit by multiple raiding parties and than some of the larger mutants appeared and starting wrecking our base. The attack went all night and we eventually died to the mutants. We re-spawned but the mutants would not leave the vicinity.After that crazy battle we decided to start a new co-op game as we felt we learned a lot from the 1st experience. Words can not describe how creepy this game can get. I always play videos game in the a darken room. This game, I always have the lights on.  Some of the sounds you can hear out in the forest at night are bone chilling. The Devs did a great job creating an intense and scary atmosphere in this game.9.5/10			"

 I don't get why people buy DayZ or Rust to then just hate, as both are still in early access and stuff, when they can get The Forest in Early Access too and actually enjoy a good game. Don't mind my playtime, I have this game since version 0.00 when you would die just from jumping with fall damage or by simply killing someone and then getting FUS RO DAH out of the map. This game got so much better since its release that is just unbelievable. The graphics are so stunning specially the ligthing. I just don't like the fact of not having a little map just to know moreless where I am, or the fact of my logs just dissapearing for no reason, but seriously it is a super fun game. I only play it for like 1 - 2 hours when it gets updated and it is always more fun then last time.Fully recommend it, 9.2 - ""Boat house still doesn't work since freaking 0.00"" - IGN "

Resolution: 1920x1080Average framerate:40-60fps Max settings (Bloom off), 50-60+FPS Medium settings.Graphics settings: High-Max SettingsAverage framerate: 50-60FPSInput device used: Mouse and Keyboard.**Note** Put Terrain setting on High(Parallax Occlusion) even if you're running at low or medium settings. The terrain looks much, much more realistic while barely affecting performance and framerate. I bought this game last year and recently started playing it again. I actually just bought a copy for my brother so that we could play coop. Let me just start by saying that this is a mixed review, though I will be giving it a thumbs up because it's improved tremendously since last May. Pros: -The Cannibal AI seem to be much more intelligent and unpredictable than the last time I played. They chase you on all fours very quickly, seem to get used to burning effigies, and always seem to thwarth your plans at remaining safe.-There seems to be a few more animals and the crafting system is a little more polished.-The graphics and graphical options and presets are much more diverse. -The addition of co-op is amazing. Though it definitely needs more work, after playing for a few hours with my brother we came to the conclusion that the devs must put more focus on this aspect of the game. What I'd like to see in coop gameplay:-Sharing and giving items between players.-When hosting a game, the player I invited always spawns back to the plane after they die. I load at my last save point, see player 2 flash quickly, and they then reappear at the plane. -When a player puts meat on the drying rack, I don't see it. He doesn't see my meat. There is also a bug when we both make a log sleigh or carry cannibal bodies: They are invisible. -A bunkbed system in which the two players fall asleep at the same time. The lack of sleep in co-op is sort of unrealistic. I'd say maybe have it so that each player has to press a key within 5 seconds so that they can all fall asleep simultaneously and wake up at the same time.-When I host a game, I see a wild boar, but the other player sees a deer. This doesn't break the game, but it's quite a funny bug.-Knives. It's almost weird that they're not included in the game. They could be used to improve and/or upgrade tools and also as a weapon.-We aren't 100% certain of this, but we're pretty sure the cannibal/mutants seem to be less frequent and perhaps ""dumbed down"" in coop? - Rechargeable Crank flashlight?I am aware that the game is still in Early Access, but I will mention this: The developers are listening to the community and are actively working on the game. They have a very detailed list of their fixes on their website and I will say with confidence that this is probably the best early access title I've played, especially for the price that it's selling for.

The positive thing is in-game you always strive to improve. A trial and error game, which keeps you hooked. As they are adding more new stuff and updates, more content will be availabe which will increase the time spent on this game. Building your base, trying to live a sustainable life as a lone survivor surrounded by cannibals. The ideas behind the game are great and hopefully it will only get better. It can also get a bit scary.			"

								This game is amazing. Normally, I would not prefer horror games, but since a lot of the game is survival based and there is a co-op mode, I feel the game is balanced and really fun to play with friends. There are jump scares here and there with the mutants and cannibals, but not to many. The graphics are really good in my opinion, and add to the game (although I am forced to play on all low graphics because of my low performance computer). The game is still is alpha stage as well and it is already this great, so that is a good sign for the future. I appriciate the effort the developers put in by adding the sound of leaves falling/rustling, and birds chirping, as it adds a sense of peace to the game. -also- The voice acting for the cannibals and mutants is on point 👌.

								Dear diary, I've been stuck in The Forest for atleast 1½ week now. I've been eating berries and bars I found next to dead people. I wish I could find a rabbit or two. I just realized how to kill fish, but the frogs are still immortal and can't be killed. I belive it's magic.I met a naked, dirty man in the forest few nights ago. Most likely high on drugs cause he ran back into the forest again and after that I havn't seen a single soul.Apart from that I've been building and crafting like crazy, got nothing else to do around here. The boat I made was a waste of calories though. I think I need to spend more time figuring out how to craft more powerfull items, and I really hope I can make some powerful, magical armor soon because I'm always cold and wet from the rain. A ranged weapon would be handy aswell, since I only do crap damage that not even the frogs can feel.Love you, Mum and Dad!			"

								This game is the survival game I wanted for so long. I've played unturned and H1Z1 and rust... but none of them come close to this game. When it comes to survival games, I am not a fan of the ""everyone is my enemy"" mindset that people have in rust. I understand that not everyone will be friendly.... but not everyone should be toxic either. I simply could not get immersed into the aforementioned games. Now the forest, oh man. It's you (and your friends if you wish) against some scary AI. You'll always be checking your back and sometimes you'll be glad you did. The gameplay is simply fantastic.The graphics of this game are pretty outstanding as well. Everything looks nice and is realistic enough to make you feel like you're in the game. The weather is what really helps this though. There is a day/night cycle, and it can randomly rain with a storm. You'll just really appreciate the graphics and audio of this game. Overall, I have no complaints at all. There will be a bug here and there (mainly in coop) but nothing that make me want to uninstall the game. I would say this EA game has been done right and I would've happily paid more that $10 for it. Def worth buying if you want a survival game that doesn't include a community of toxic players.			"

								I never write reviews. However I feel this game needs one.I may only be four hours in but I'm hooked. Pros -  * Visually stunning. * Good crafting system. * Immersive. * Multi player.Cons -  * A dedicated server would be nice so friends can play it whilst I'm sleeping. * A few lag spikes, normally in combat (however this game is still alpha so I'm not that fussed). * Modding would be amazing in the game, but again it's alpha and there is more than enough to do :) Really looking forward to the evolution of this game!

								First off there may be two reasons for you not to buy this game right now. The first one being it's Alpha and has PLENTY of bugs which can really ruin the immersion and excitement you get during your first playthrough and in my opinion that's a pretty big deal considering this game has every element it needs to be the best (Horror) Survival game of the year. Secondly you MUST have a good computer to run this game or it will be 15 dollars down the drain, If you can't run Rust then forget about getting this game as of now and start investing in one that can run this future Masterpiece of a game.When I first started playing this game I felt a rush of excitement and fear as I did when I played Minecraft for the first time, (These games are very different but have a similiar concept, to survive and craft) This game is intense already to say the least, but again the fact it's in Alpha and has many bugs can ruin that. If you want the best experience for this game when you first play I suggest waiting a few weeksIf you want to help support the developers of this and be a part of the games journey to it's finished product then buy this, you won't regret it.Gotta give this game a 8/10Things to keep in mind when you're actually playing this:1. Use the Axe to break open suitcases, good loot and food in there2. Take advantage of the stealth mechanic and listen for the noises Cannibals make, you'll probably know it when you hear it3. If you are killed by cannibals and taken to their cave, YOU MUST get the flare gun inside the room you wake up in, don't leave it without it because you'll most likely need it to escape and it has plenty of ammo4. And above all, have funHappy hunting			"

								After the massive sellout directionless flop that was Minecraft survival mode, which spawned an uncountable number of voxel survival clones, came the wave of zombie survival games of which there was an equal number with a disappointing lack of variety. The survival genre needed something fresh. Something that was survival, without the endless additions of survival mechanics, but with enough elements remaining that the game remained fun and challenging. Something that had the wonder and danger of exploration, with the terror of creatures in the night, without taking itself too seriously or not seriously at all. And something without zombies, but something that could instill just as many fears and nightmares if not more.Enter: The ForestIt's worth noting that The Forest was the first game on Steam to really start the ""stranded survival"" genre,  and there are many games out there currently ""inspired"" by its formula including Stranded Deep, Salt, Savage Lands, Better Late Than Dead, and more.All alround, this is a fun early-access game that is worth putting down dollars on.Granted I still run into the occassional bug, but that is the nature of early access. What is good about this early access game though is that the developer is EXTREMELY active with making bug fixes along with adding new improvements, they are constantly listening and interacting with suggestions and feedback from the community, and most important of all is that they are taking whatever time is necessary to make sure this game is well crafted before they try to push it forward into further stages of release. The care and quality really shows, and I really look forward to seeing its continued progress.That was all just a review of the game as it stands in the market of games however, so let me touch on the actual playing of the game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's a lot of fun, and has a very different feel compared to a lot of survival games. As a gamer who is also getting older and has more and more responsibilities in life, I find that the mechanics of the gameplay also balance really well with what time I can lend to play it. That is, it has numerous survival elements which keep the game interesting and challenging, while not requiring anything you could call grinding. The atmosphere and environment of this game is really well crafted too, and the effects of lights and shadows really add a lot to the experience, I especially like the feature that your characters eyes need time to adjust to different intensities (or absence) of light to see well.The cannibals you survive amongst in the game also offer a good challenge, and a serious change of pace from most other survival games where you practically end up being invincible against ridiculous odds. In this game fighting one on one requires focus, and getting outnumbered in a fight can quickly lead to a scenario where your best option is to RUN. The cannibals aren't the only threat though, as every day you will need to come up with a way to get food, fresh water, stay warm from cold nights and rainstorms, and watch out for dangerous animals. As you start getting into the rhythm of things you begin building up your goods, and can start taking the fight to the natives. Let them know you're not to be trifled with by butchering the limbs from a fallen foe, and skewering them on a burning stake as a warning to the rest. Some times this will backfire though and the cannibals will return with a raiding party to wreck your camp, forcing you to flee from everything you worked so hard for unless you can fight well enough to defend it. If you want to return the favor, you can venture deep into the caves where the cannibals live and discover why they are harvesting all the bodies from the plane wreckage...DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNCo-op is also great because you can use your friends as cannibal bait! :DI'm hoping in the near future the dev. will have a deliberate FFA/PVP mode, where players can paint themselves to group up in rival tribes, and to native on one another.This game is already fantastic, and it's only going to keep getting better.

								I've been really interested in the open-world survival genre, and purchased a few of the popular early release games. I tried a lot of the ones that focus on MMO-type gameplay, and quicky became bored with them. I can only walk around for so long starving to simply get shot by some guy with a cowboy hat as soon as he sees me.I finally decided to try out the The Forest, and it's the first one of the genre that I've been thoroughly impressed by. With an indie team of 3 devs, the game has a surprisingly polished look and feel. It creates the creepy atmosphere it's going for perfectly. I'm writing this review after my first night of playing, and I've only played co-op so far, so I can strongly recommend playing with a friend (but I'm sure playing alone would be just as satisfying and probably more creepy).I already have come to love the building system. Rather than punching trees endlessly, you design out your building initially and it shows you what resources you need to collect to complete the structure. You then go out to find those resources. It's amazing how much more immersive the game is when the tree actually falls and you carry a few logs back at a time to your shelter-in-progress.Had a great time after my first few hours, and I can't wait to get a little more confident to explore the more dangerous parts of the forest.

Starts slicing up canibals left and right, gets rushed by six of them instantly downed, gets revived by friend, pops some tylenol.. all that pain i was feeling went away and im left with a mild headache.Day 33 or so: Ventures into another cave, gets a better axe. friend hits a rock, one piece of the rock hits me and im forever falling underneath the map.

								Day 1: I've crashed on some godforsaken island. Woke up covered in blood, brink of starvation and barely alive. I made it to my feet and looted the plane for goods. Nothing much, couple meals and some soda. Even found some booze which I've kept for later. Staggered outside to the site of a picturesque forest full of wildlife. I borrowed an axe from a stewardess who didn't look like she'd be needing it, and started hacking open some luggage. Didn't find much, some cloth and some granola bars. I headed out and ended up at a coast, which I followed for a while. Found some cargo containers with some circuit boards and a bunch of asprin. I took it all. Went further down and found a crashed Yacht, so I'm thinking this is somewhere in the ♥♥♥♥in' Bermuda triangle. Found some flares on that, and some rope. Headed inland but got lost, ended up at some small village with triangular buildings. Lots of dead people...some I recognized from my flight. Found a better axe buried in a tree, and more soda than I'll ever need in my life, as well as some dynamite. Headed in I think a northerly direction, found another village. Managed to kill a couple rabbits and lizards, made a small pouch for berries and glued some leaves onto the lizard skin and wore it for camo. I literally ran into some savage on accident. It ran away, laughing. Shaken, I kept heading down the hill and found some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who looked like someone had run a sword through him. I took it. Katana, very nice. Kept heading that direction and found a small pond with a tent next to it. Found a cooking pot and a spear. It was getting dark and I was hungry and thirsty, so I quickly made a small shelter out of sticks and leaves as well as a tiny fire, got some water out of the pond and boiled it, drank that and cooked my rabbits. Put out the fire and slept through the night.Day 2: Woke up early and got out of there. Walked for a long time and got lost a bunch. Ran into another savage. He rushed me, so I sliced him with the katana, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was just a diversion as two more jumped me from behind. I managed to take all three down but I was hurting pretty bad, so I took some asprin and that cleared it up. Kept going and ended up back at the guy who'd been run through. Noticed there was a cave behind him, so I started going through it. I haven't been using my lighter at all, even though I explored about half of last night. Hard as hell to see but I didn't want to attract any attention. In the cave, I only used my lighter when I couldn't tell where I was going, or to check for side passages. I found a fork in the road and went left, and found another fork. Went left again and found four human heads on the ground, still decaying. Past that was some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a Bible and a crucifix in his hand. Head looked to have been eaten off, possibly while he was still alive. Dead end past that. Headed back and was greeted with a wooden wall, with a skull hanging over it, a candle in each eye. Unnerved, I cut down the wall and found another one. Cut that one down and there was a massive open chasm past that. I heard some very loud footsteps, like a giant was walking around. To my left I saw two...things. The light was bad, but they looked like two massive pillars of flesh with about ten arms apiece. Keeping in my scream was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I scrambled past them and found a climbing rope, and descended. It was very wet down here, and I was doing my best not to slip and drown. Kept going and there was another, even bigger chasm. I took one step inside and the most terrifying sound I've ever heard in my life pierced my ears. It sounded like babies crying, but it was too high pitched, too...alien. I stumbled inside and saw big tents in one corner, which was where the crying was coming from. I crouched down and went over, and sure enough there were deformed babies twitching and crying on the rock floor, a humanoid standing over them, hunched, apparently asleep. Surrounding them in a ring were big rocks, one of which I was hiding behind, and on those wooden crates. I cut one open but nothing was inside. I quickly moved away, but to my horror the babies lunged at me. I cut them down, whimpering, trying not to make any noise to awake anything in here. I ran as fast as I could away from them, flicking my lighter on to guide the way. I went down a passage that ended in a rope. I quickly grabbed on and climbed up, hoping this was the exit. It ended much too soon, and I pulled myself up and sprinted down the passage. To my utter terror, it ENDED. There was nothing, just a blank wall and a skull with a candle in it. I slowly turned back, towards the sounds of piercing baby cries and the wind passing through the damp, cold cave. I sank to the ground in defeat, and await death.			"

								There are a lot of developers out there who intentionally keep their games in what I like to call 'development limbo' and add one update every so often because they make more money by doing so (Yandere Dev is a fine example). However, the developers of the Forest aren't like that. They listen to feedback and continuously fix bugs and add whole new areas to explore in their updates. These developers truly care about their audience. I've spent many hours in the game messing around with my friends and we've had so much fun. If you're considering playing this alone, I'd personally not recommend it because it takes too long to do anything. However, playing with your friends is a blast. We all love playing this game and look forward to the updates. If the developers are reading this - thanks for your hard work!			"

The cabin is built, no tribes people seen outside of the woods we are taking down at alarming speeds. They grow some balls and make first contact, no blood shed, then more show up, I refuse to allow them to know where we live, a kill them to the last. Its time to build the wall; we do so. We face a spider human hybird thing, it killed my friend, and I burned it for 10 mintues as it ruined our wall. The wall just got 2 rows bigger.			"

								The Forest is one of the many survival games you will find in early access. But in my opinion this is not one of the terrible ones. It has constant updates making the game better all the time, for example co-op just came out! But this is not only a survival game, it’s also horror. When you explore them caves for the first time with your little lighter that keeps going off you will be scared. Really scared.  Enemies The enemies are not zombies. Yes, you heard a survival game with NO zombies! This has mutants. The mutants are very well made and will take different approaches towards you, for example one mutant on its own tends to run off. It will then come back with its friends. They also attack in turns a lot. One will attack then pull back and another will try to hit you. They climb trees to ambush you and will also try to flank you. In the deepest caves you will find the really terrifying ones. These ones are proper mutants. SurvivalYou will need to eat, drink, keep your energy up, keep your health up and build a shelter. You will also be defending yourself against mutants while doing all of that. To survive you need to hunt, fish, scavenge camps, chop trees and fight.  You will need to hunt and fish to eat and keep your energy and health up. You will need to scavenge camps for items you can craft and also for food. You will need to chop trees to build a shelter, create traps, and more. You will need to fight so you don’t die. EnvironmentThe environment is amazing! From the forest its self with the high trees to the sandy beaches scattered with camps.  No matter where you are, you won’t feel safe. You will need to use the environment to help you survive.  The forest has the trees you need for the camp. Around the beaches you will find more rocks. In the caves you will find better equipment. Just remember the caves are home to the mutants. Co-op!I’ve played co-op with one friend, and in my opinion it made the game much better. It does make the game easier but it feels much better knowing you have a friend watching your back while you make a shelter. Right now co-op is full of bugs but I’m sure they will disappear one by one as the developers improve the game. I hope you enjoyed reading this review as I did enjoy writing it!  "

								It is worth noting that I have been highly anticipating the release of 'The Forest' alpha since the release of the initial trailer.Having played the game for a short period of time, I can already tell just how well the team has married the immersion and fun-factor. The game is pretty damned terrifying already. One minute, I'm spearing fish in a crystal clear pond without a care in the world and next I hear an array of strange animal sounds. As the rain begins to fall, I direct my attention to the source of the noise and spot a patrolling party of around 10 tribal figures in the distance. However they seem unaware of my presence and march away into the overgrowth. Around a minute later, after I begin picking up essentials from the corpses strewn around a camp located right next to my own, the cannibals burst out of the foliage ahead of me, chasing me down, surrounding me and eventually killing me.It's worth noting that the AI and animations in this game are significantly better than I expected they would be. One of the cannibals darted ahead of me from the side, abruptly skidding to a halt and preventing my escape while another realistically hopped from tree bark to tree bark above.In regards to the crafting and resource gathering, I haven't experimented too much but it seems fairly straightforward and that's not a bad thing at all. Approaching and hacking down a small plant will provide you with branches and leaves and hacking down an entire tree will provide you with logs to carry which you can store in a log holder if you've crafted one. Creating a fire and shelter are essential and the fact that you have to apply leaves to the fire to keep it going adds to the realism. Overall, the crafting is fairly immersive and skinning an animal and then picking the meat up and directly applying it to the fire all seem pretty damned seamless.The lighting seems quite advanced as well and the cavern segments remind me of the film, 'The Descent' in a good way, with the ambient sounds of water drops, stalactites, stalagmites, water reflections and numerous crystal groups. All this being said, the game is in early alpha state and there are quite a few bugs which is to be expected during this stage, wherein the player can clip through certain objects and swapping equipped items can sometimes result in weird overlapping objects but overall, I believe that this game is easily worth the price tag and I eagerly look forward to the development in the future.

								The forest is a really fun survival game, and it's probably my favourite survival game to this day. I had a lot of fun playing with a group of friends and exploring the world.Pros:• Cool ending• Exciting and well made caves to explore.• Rebreather, the rebreather was cool and it was really fun exploring underwater cave systems.• Fun building mechanics.Cons:• Can be pretty glitchy at times, especially with logs as they can sometimes fling you up into the air. I found a really cool glitch spot under a river where I can build a base, have a campfire and eveything I need, and the cannibals can't get to me.I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who really like survival games, or just wants a survial game they can play with friends.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)			"

To The Forest,You've grown so much...I was there for you when you called everything rocks...I was there for you when you gave me no head (which put a dent in our relationship..),When there were only 2 seats instead of 3 on the airplane.You've changed, and I like it a lot. Some things I love, Like how you now have a calm mode (type veganmode in the main menu), How you never leave me without head, how you can finally name things correctly and even added new things like deer, turtles, racoons, tree houses, traps, and so much more! I love how gorgeous you are. Your graphics make me groan. I love how you now let me invite friends and we all play with you. I also like how you now have kick...butt music that pumps me for killing the natives even though they completely destroy my a$$ in...2 or 3 hits. You do have some things i'd like for you to change. The sharks are to b*tchy.We should be able to kill the b*stards. There's hoards of birds that swarm when I create fire (Maybe it's just because it's so hot.). I dont like the naked people that visit me at 3am and stare whilst making subtle groans and gurgles. OkaymaybeIlikeitalittle... Anyway, I'm proud of how much you've matured, and how much you're continuing to grow! Keep perfecting yourself and stay beautiful!-Love, Me- "

								You wake up and just try to survive in a forest infested with cannibals. It's challenging as you have to worry about your health/hunger/thirst, make a place to sleep in to save the game, also make sure you're safe from cannibals as they are hard to kill on your own and they can be in packs. There are minor bugs in the game but that's to be expected since its in early access right now.The fluid co-op gameplay makes for some of the most hilarious and scariest moments that my friends have ever had together (there are not many survival horror with  games you can play with your friend). The world is huge and beautiful, a lot of crafting options, many ways to survive - I'm really surprised that this game was made by a small studio.. A unique experience, I highly recommend. PLAY THIS GAME!Great job to the developer :DEdit: Now you can finish the story!			"

Still has longer to go until all the content in, but this is one of the three foremost examples of a good pre-release program I can think of (others being Minecraft and Don't Starve).I'm not going to go on about the gameplay - standard survival stuff, but first person. A lot of fun, in my opinion, though I kind of like the zen experience of staying on the overworld and avoiding cannibals while I live a quiet version of Castaway. Has a lot of promise, and a lot of current content if you enjoy building and hunting and general survival stuff.			"

								I really want to recommend this game but, the more time it passes, the more I fear this game will eventually just be abandoned or it's resources are going to run dry and the developers will just give up, there are updates in schedule, yes, but they update so little each time, and most of it are bugfixes or minor add ons to established mechanics, the kind of patches you'd get from an already stablished game just balancing.The game has been on early access state for years, it doesn't seem to be reaching beta anytime soon at the pace they are going, and at the pace they move, the engine is just gonna run obsolete, or someone will take the concept from them and make a real game out of it, or you will crash in an actual plane and land in a real island with cannibals in it, chances are favoring you against this game ever being finished.PD: The game is fun, but is so short you explore everything in a couple hours and get bored of every event in about the same time.

								The Forest is a great start out survival horror game. Stuck on an island with crazed cannibals hunting you down, you must survive in the primitive sense. Kill or be killed. The developers have thought about this quite well, ensuring tension but also allowing the player enough time to source survival stuff (wood for fires, fish for food, etc) to create their own journey. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it so far, and though it is limited due to it's early access nature, I certainly think this game has large potential. Crafting items, buidling your own safe-haven and fighting to the death the creatures that lurk on the island is by far a true survival experience. This game reminds me very much of ""Lord of the Flies"" book, which is not a bad thing. Obviously being an Alpha version of a game, it is going to have errors, problems and long load times, but that is what you expect. The graphics is well done, especially the weather pattern and day/night system. A day feels like a day and a night feels like a night. They are long, drawn out experiences, giving the player the true sense of being stranded on this island. I cannot wait for them to make this game complete and there is talk of co-op, which would add a new layer to the game. I dare you to go and explore the dark caves and find out the truth beneath this beautiful island world. It is not 100% polished, nor is it a popular 'genre' of gaming, but to me, this is a fun, sometimes challenging and most importantly a real experience. No flash graphics, no big story lines, just a basic concept of SURVIVE or DIE. I will give this a 4 out of 5 Beers. Cheers - Frost			"

								Early Access Review, 04/19/2015I do not by any means consider myself an expert on The forest, but so far my experience has been a blast! I have played this game multiplayer with my brother, cousin, and a few friends, and have (somewhat scantily) Followed the development of the game. The Ambience is skillfully done, the artwork looks amazing, and the gameplay, while still being in early access, is still enjoyable. I have been dinking around in this game off and on for the past few months, and have seen a HUGE improvement in the entire system, with the addition of new recipes, new mobs, new entities, better systems, etc... I know that a lot of Early Access games have turned out to be huge disappointments, but so far, this game has been meeting, if not exceeding Expectations. Developers, you should be proud of yourselves, for the progress you have been making, and while I don't know how much that means to you, I'd like to think that it means a lot coming from me. This game will probably turn out to be something absolutely amazing, and I think that the developers have a great game going on. I definately reccomend this game, and do not regret buying it while it is still in Early Access.			"

								This is an early access review based on version 0.08. I'll keep updating this post once new versions are released.Pros:--- Great concept! It is really nice to see where this is going and to have a settlement with many buildings / objects is just great. As there are no objectives we are free to do whatever we wish to do. The game requires some getting used to but I like where this is going. --- The forest itself looks gorgeous thanks to the Unity engine. The tribesmen show some great A.I. - most notable for me so far was when one of them was just injured and his friend took him away before I could perform a coup de grace. At this point this is overshadowed by the strange behaviour they show from time to time but the direction they are going is commendable.--- Lots of things to build and to craft. And the number will (hopefully) increase greatly as the DIY / Survival guide the player utilises has a lot of empty / blurry pages.Cons:--- Some only noticeable once you reload the game. Either some or all the already chopped up trees simply reappear. Also, I do not mind being able to find a huge quantity of sticks and rocks but they spawn at my settlement regularly. This  is an issue in the sense that it makes gameplay much easier.--- Some objects are floating a bit and placement of walls can be difficult at times. I ""installed"" a wall with door and due to the surface not entirely being flat the door glitched out and started moving constantly. --- Building rafts is not possible? I crafted one and it shot me into the air. The view was great and I survived the landing but the raft disappeared afterwards. It was pretty annoying.--- Still lots of things to complete. There are a lot of animals - deer, raccoons, turtles - but beside killing them the player cannot really do anything else.--- Clipping is possible close to cliffs / hills. I can easily get under some huge rocks that surround my settlement to access it more easily. They are, however, meant to completely protect me from one side.--- While the AI can show progress there are some strange behaviour patterns I have yet to understand. Overall, The Forest is a great survival game and I look forward to the new updates. I really want to see this in its entirety. While not having any specific objectives / quests I want to see the option to save the protagonist's child and it would be nice to receive some guidelines from time to time as to where you are supposed to go to find some good stuff. For instance, a map could be useful.			"

								My personal thoughts on this extraordinary indie game:As the lone survivor of a passenger jet crash, you find yourself in a mysterious forest battling to stay alive against a society of cannibalistic mutants. Build, explore, survive in this terrifying first person survival horror simulator.Welcome to The Island. A Indie survival-horror game, and a pretty one too! You will find yourself easily immersed in The Forest's world, a world crafted with much care and dedication. Animations are greatly done, while the simple act of chopping down a tree can be a fun experience, since visuals are splendid in this game. But this isn't everything this game has to offer, we have a pretty big island full with stuff to see, from cannibal camps, tortured survivor, abandoned camps and caves. Gameplay wise we have a few factors and mechanics, you need to gather,hunt for food, build a shelter, build fire places to light up during the night, hide indoors when it rains and many, many others. The cannibals are nicely designed, and you will find yourself interested in their background since they aren't your standard ""zombies"" unlike the other thousand of games with the same setting. The crafting part of the game is still basic, limited at the moment to crafting molotovs, small hunting cabins or large cabins, a small raft, a few traps and some more stuff. I will update the review once new features will be added to the game, so far I give it a personal rating of 8/10, due to the AI being a bit repetitive, lack of story (other than the plane crash, nothing more is explained or introduced) and the fact that the crafting system needs a whole lot more improvement over it. Anyways, if you're into survival games, this is a must buy for you. The developers are working with mind and soul on this project, and you will not be dissapointed.			"

								I understand that I don't have many hours on record at the time of this writing... that's because I had played a cracked version to test it out before I made the $15 plunge to support the developers.But holy mother of god... Very rarely has a game ever made me stay up well past midnight and far into the early morning, without feeling tired in the slightest. And let me tell you, The Forest is one of those rare gems. The multiplayer aspect is phenomenal, and I highly recommend playing this with at least one other person. Not only will it help with fighting off the hordes of cannibals that just don't seem to understand that they're going to die, but there's quite a lot of laughs to be had.- CONS -Still in early-access. But I can't complain, it's an ""indie"" title.It's a bit buggy, but again... it's still being developed, that's too be expected.???Cannibal somehow walked right through the door of my house. ♥♥♥♥ you, cannibal.- PROS -Lots to do!Perfect lumberjack simulator.Cannibal-killer simulator.Simulator.The ambiance and sound effects really help to keep up the immersion.Like having creepy♥♥♥♥♥monstrosities hanging in the trees and watching you? Good. Get used to it.10/10 would get slammed into sinkhole by a cannibal again.			"

								I enjoy this game a lot. The scenary is beautiful, and it is a well made game. There are times when I do not want to play with the cannibals so I just type in ""veganmode"" at the home screen and it is the same game just with the cannibals taken away. I enjoy playing on this game mode when I like to just walk around the forest and enjoy the sights and sounds, but when I want some suspense I type in ""meatmode"" at the title screen to change it back to the normal game mode. It is good for people that love survival games, and I highly recommend it. However, I would suggest finding the axes and weapons that are hidden throughout the map because they do make cutting trees and fighting cannibals easier. I hope everyone enjoys the game as much as I do. :)			"

			The Forest First Look and Gameplay. The Forest is an open world survival horror game for PC. Stranded on a forest you have to craft, build, explore and survive.		

Ran out of the plane and rushed to kill the tribe men to get ""my son"". Died 10 secs after ahahThe game looks amazing for an early access. The crafting is, so far, excellent and I'm genuinely scared of the idea of getting back in those caves to save the child. With Co-Op this game can only be even better.			"

								So for a not completed game, the Forest is pretty awesome. First PlaythroughCrash land in a forest, build a fire, vainly try to feed fire, build a shelter. Shelter gets built and there's my friendly neighbor dropping by. So I do the sensible thing and hit him with an axe, he knocks me out and drags me to a cave where I'm killed by weird Octo Mutants.Second PlaythroughVainly try to build a bonfire on a small island, slowly die from hunger until nightfalls and I'm massacred by the enemy.Third Playthrough (Co-Op!)Join some random players much, much better than me in building a camp, they mainly build, I chase flaming rabbits. Daytime comes and they go into the cave, I'm at the camp until the cannibal crew arrives, where I promptly haul♥♥♥♥♥straight to the cave to meet my pro players. I am once again killed by OctoMutants. All in all, great game, good creepy atmosphere especially on singleplayer and the co-op's a nice touch. Still a but off feeling at times, especially with chopping down trees but I definitely recommend! "

								a surprisingly good game... nice graphics (Unity Engine!) an outstanding smart enemy AI: the Engine will spawn more enemies and enemy types per ingame day as a bonus to the normal cannibal/mutant/tribal people enemies. --- they will not attack you when they are not starving! you can try a coexistence and stay hidden for a long time. UNTIL you begin to harvest the forest. those woods are holy for them. ressources are respawning very fast and there are a few story-secrets, hidden OP weapons and hidden settlements of those tribal people out there in a big map.Player buildings are great and can be expanded to a real Fortress. there is a pro and a contra to this game: no tutorial at all. (which makes the first run impossible!) ...but crafting is more intuitive like this. (there is a forest crafting wiki) The player has to find out most recipes by just combining and trying. This brings immersion to crafting and makes you proud of your new upgraded spear or your personally crafted bow! (if you try it without the wiki of course.)enemies are weak overall... blocking is not op and will harm the player for 10-20% of unblocked dmg. BUT the AI hits like a truck. you can take 3-4 attacks from a normal guy and it is over. GREAT! this makes combat easy but also very rewarding! (the enemy movement is really weird and will make every fight unique!) there is no endgame! there is just an atmosphere of fear and terror for lets say 20 cool hours. if you want to build your fortress in hell. this is your game. hold out forever! ...maybe give up your fortress, lay fire and flee on your boat... maybe you will find a cave and live there... just to find out it is THEIR CAVE! :) If they can get you 2 times at zero HP, they will cook and eat you half alive! you got only 2 lives. dynamite, molotovs, a bow, spears, axes, katanas, lizard-skin-underpants for armor... a crown of leaves to be the stealthed bow sniper... or just be the naked axemurderer who invades them, hanging the heads of their leaders in the middle of their settlement. BECOME THE LEGEND! paint your face with mud and await them! Pure Freedom in Unity 5 Beauty!...or hide like me every day in a different cave after you saw what they did to your friends and how powerful their magic is. 10/10 --- Naked♥♥♥♥♥♥Demons trying to eat you and your friends in multiplayer in an excellent immersive sound and graphic atmosphere while your sanity meter reaches zero and nobody out there in ours or in their world knows what the effects of this meter are!

								I like this game, but it needs some work. By buying this game you should take into consideration you're purchasing a 'Beta' version, you won't get a completed game (yet) and there will be bugs.The BasicsHaving that said I really do enjoy this game, it's difficult, but not impossible, it's challenging, but never too unfair, surely there is quite a few bugs to be polished out of the way but that's why it's in beta. The idea is simple, gather some wood, craft some better tools, survive the night. It's more difficult than it sounds though and you will be facing numerous challenges; hypothermia, hunger, fatigue and of course cannibals.The GameplayGameplay wise this game needs some fixing, there's a few bugs when chopping down trees or mashing enemies in the face with a club fashioned out of a stick and someone's skull, not all hits will register and it can become a bit frustrating. Once you've learned to deal with these little things the game is pretty polished.It's pretty easy to get a nice structure going, and it won't be long until you have yourself a nice base, just don't forget to make a fire.With the new added in co-op feature this game becomes a LOT more enjoyable, it's double the fun when you're running around with some friends collectively hacking limbs off cannibals, and I think it's a great addition to the game. In fact, just the fun you could have in the co-op is probably worth buying this game.The GraphicsThis game looks pretty, the shadow bugs present in previous versions (your character having hollowed out eyes and neck in your shadow) are now fixed and I can't really think of any way to complain about the graphics in this game, it's imply outstanding. The world feels alive and immersive.To Summarize+ Great gameplay.+ Co-Op is a blast!+ World feels immersive, with attention to detail.+ It's a challenge, but not unfair.- Minor bugs.Thank you for reading :D "

You can kill cannibals, pigs, bunnies, birds, Sharks, crocodiles, Donald Trump, fish, lizards, turtles, spiders, trees, plants, and potato mutants.This game has fulfilled the void that Skyrim gave me, in Skyrim I was limited to the number of people I could slaughter. The Forest has no invincible people. Literally nothing can live if you choose to, this poor island is at the mercy of you and your axe. This game is essentially 9/11 on an abandoned island, only you're the terrorist.			"

								I currently have been playing this game since V 0.6. (Nearly 600 hrs invested.) This is perhaps one of the most professional programmers I have ever seen during an Alpha release, regularly updated with large updates and hot fixes. The Devs actually do read over player input and if they see it usuable in game they will implement it ( aka, now has a pause ability). A real good community of users in multiplayer. The Game: The game has some very unique and refreshing ideas for a Survival/Horror game. It has multiple game modes from no canibals to an all out fight or die. Lots of exploration space to locate what you think will be a ""safe"" camp location. But who are you kidding, there are no ""safe"" camping sites, not for long anyways. Plenty of supplies and food and water. The building system is still a bit ganky, but it is still being worked on and changed. The atmosphere is gorgeous now that they have changed over to Unity. You choose how you want to play. Do you want to live off the land or do you want to build a small camp or a huge fortress for you and your online friends to battle the canibals. It's entirely up to you to decide if you will become a canibal by eating the canibals or if you will remain human by just eating berries and mushrroms. Just remember to keep warm and drink plenty of water and always, no matter what keep plenty of food and water on hand.I strongly recommend this game to all survival and horror game fans! No stupid planned jump scares, only real jumping out of your seat scares! Well worth the simple $15.00 usd!			"

Early Access Review
								To me,  The Forest  gets horror right.Just not so much in multiplayer. Normally I'm not a huge fan of these types of games. The kind where they throw you into a world and say, ""You have just one objective... Survive!!"" That's like saying, ""Hey, we don't really have an end goal for you. Just muck about in the world until you're bored."" This is purely subjective, but having an open world to freely romp around in without an objective isn't enjoyable for me. I need to have something I'm working toward otherwise my efforts to get a cool base, weapon, etc. seem in vain. On personal preference alone,  The Forest  would be hard for me to recommend without being structured the way that it is. The world itself doesn’t have a whole lot to do. The game is based around you venturing into different cave systems and finding specific items such as a rock climbing pick to progress. This is both good and bad. What I like about this is that it puts you in the sense of, “I just crashed on this island. What the hell do I do?” And while you know you ultimately have to find Timmy, it doesn’t hold your hand in the direction to go. Once you’ve seen it, it’s fairly easy to deduce the location that probably leads to him, but the game doesn’t help with the steps leading up to having access to that. Now the bad side to this is exactly that. There are times you’ll come across a section of cave and it will add a note to your book saying you won’t be able to continue until you find a way to overcome the obstacle that impedes you. This can lead to a frustrating amount of backtracking, remembering where you have and haven’t been, and where you should be looking next. All while balancing health, hunger, thirst, and not getting killed and losing your stuff while trying to find what to do. Again, this is stuff that is fitting for the setting of the game. If you’re some guy lost on an island with caves & cannibals, you may very well not know where to go or what to do. It kind of becomes a balance between being immersive and what is most fun for the player. Obviously, you can just look up what to do online (like my group eventually had to do for a bit), but devs can’t assume players will do this when designing their game. In terms of horror, the game relies on atmosphere over jump scares. Not to say the games doesn't have any, however, the jump scares are more situational rather than scripted. What I mean by this is that you're more likely to be scared by a screaming cannibal that snuck up on you than you are because walking through a specific doorway had something leap out via programming. The thing I found scariest was seeing the cannibals wandering around in the distance, especially when they  know you're there and are scouting your camp. While having little in terms of defences and weaponry, there's something eerie about knowing you probably wouldn't win a fight, should they engage. Hearing screams in the middle of the night (or day even) is unsettling. Pair that with the fact that you can barely see anything at night, and you're probably not going to want to venture out far. This ambiance is sort of diminished when playing with friends. If you play with the kind of people who are always laughing about something in the game (I’m guilty as well), it's a bit hard to be scared. When I first started the game, I could not really care less about saving Timmy. As someone who was playing this with a group of the aforementioned kind of friends, Timmy essentially became a running joke. But as things went on, something grew in our hearts that made us want to save our little boy. This ragtag team of dads would give anything to see our collective son smile once more and make us another awful drawing.Honestly, though: he's a plot device. There's really no way to get the player to care about Timmy without shoehorning some sort of lame introductory story in. This isn't really a complaint. I'm not asking for that, and I don't think it’s at all necessary. What I'm getting at is that there is a point to him. The game tells more of a story in its environment, clues, and subtleties opposed to trying to force poorly done character depth onto you. I don't want to spoil anything as I was lucky enough to go into the ending blind, which I think was my favourite moment in the game. I don't mean the ""ending"" ending, but when you get to the end of the final cave. Try and avoid spoiling it for yourself if you can. Personally, I think it's well worth it to discover on your own or with your group.Technically speaking the game is relatively smooth, but a big buggy. It's early access so this is to be expected. I don't recall any game-breaking bugs, and there weren't even any recurring issues that I can pinpoint. Generally, there may be some problems with things not working correctly, getting stuck, and rarely having enemies act weird (as in casually walking around your base without acknowledging you, not the fact that they're naked and wearing CDs). It’s kind of stuff that will gradually be worked out closer to the full release.One issue I had was the enemy difficult. Now I’m not sure if this was amped up because I was playing co-op, but the mutant enemies seemed far too tough for a game that is almost entirely based around melee. One in particular was those big chunky, chargin' fellas (Cowboys I think?). It had happened on a couple separate occasions where I would get hit and knocked down by one of those, and he would continuously stomp on me. Each stomp would re-knock me down so I was pretty much stuck like that until I died. Ranged attacks are probably a more suggestible tactic, but regardless of your approach you shouldn’t get stuck in a loop until death if you’re hit once.My other issue is more of a suggestion rather than a complaint. I feel there needs to be a greater variety of items, mostly in the mid to rare range. There were too many times when I thought I had stumbled upon something cool and it turned out to just have a boatload of circuit boards which I was already full on. Now the problem is the game physically shows the entire contents of your inventory when you have your bag open. While this is neat and helpful to see, it doesn’t really leave a lot of room for new items to be added. Consumables are the most used form of item in the game so more permanent upgrades might be cool.It should be noted that the devs are pretty frequently releasing updates. That’s always great to see in this age of games, considering the business model of many other companies. It’s also great that the entire story/main objective/whatever you want to call it can be completed in the current build, but they keep adding content to make that journey have more depth and be more enjoyable along the way. From what I can tell the devs also actively listen to bug reports and seem to have a slew of fixes with each patch. Having a countdown as to when the next patch will be released is also very admirable. Love the consistency. Like always, I didn’t expect to write this much, but I did. Summary below.TLDR;  The Forest  is an atmospheric horror survival game which can be genuinely unsettling. It has an actual ending, which is a huge plus. Multiplayer, while not nearly as creepy, is a lot of fun in its own right. The fundamentals of the game can be both immersive and/or frustrating depending on your outlook. Devs are constantly improving and adding to the game. If it looks like something you’d enjoy, I think it’d be good to pick up on a sale.I was originally going to include a video with this review, but unfortunately my hard drive failed with all the footage on it. Instead, please enjoy this video of me cutting down a tree and having it land on our house that my friend captured.

								Great game w/ lots of promise. After 500 + hrs I have few problems with the continuity of game play. For someone looking for a nice mix of survival/crafting, this is the best i've seen. I myself am sick to death of freakin Zombie. why not Bears, Tigers, or just old fashion bad guys. Maybe killing fictional zombies in a game is better than killing human characters. At least give the zombies a sense of humor. All and all I love this game. *,*			"

								I've played this game since it intially came out and this is by far the best survival game ever! I'm always on the edge of my seat playing while trying to keep away from the cannibals for the longest possible time until I can build my camp. I am always impressed by the updates the team makes as well as the building content. IF you want a game that keeps you on the edge of your seat and always coming back to play again and again, this is the game for you :DWell worth the money, you def wont be let down.			"

								Okay so this game started off as a ""crap I bought another Pre alpha game"" That being said the Devs have worked really hard at improving it and have turned it intoquiet i Psychological game. after the first few nights of running from the cannibals and trying to gather all of the known sticks in the universe you get established finally. And then you go to war with the cannibals.... I do not know if the devs meant for it to happen but it seems the cannibals are getting smarter and adjusting to individual playstyle. I love this game it is hard and creepy at times. 10/10			"

								I really do love this game so far but...Once you finally build your camp and what not, there really isn't much else to do besides kill canibals. I do realise that the game is in early alpha and I respect that. I really hope the ""end game"" choice with in the final product is really worth the wait. But for better things... Can't wait for COOP, I'm glad the dev's are not making this a PVP game because then it would be just another dayz-alike game in the end.Overall, for being made on the unity engine the game just looks really beatiful (I haven't seen many game on unity that look as good as this). The light shafts through the trees really do make the enviroments feel more alive around you.Gameplay is pretty solid so far (Besides the bugs. Buy hey, it is in alpha) and the crafting system is pretty simple enough. Only thing I don't understand is, the protagonist is smart enough to make a bomb out of computer chips and coins. But can't make a simple bow and arrow? I do hope they add a bow. Then it would be awesome!*UPDATE* They have added a bow, YAY!7/10 Bought this game for my mates B' Day as well and he is loving it!(I will be editing the review as the game gets updated)			"

								6/5/2016:Since getting a new computer, I now get 60+ FPS on the High preset, with AA to the max. -----------RUNS AT 30-40 FPS ON MY LAPPY:CPU: AMD A10-5750mGPU: Radeon HD 8650G 768mbRAM: 8 gigs OS: Win10EDIT: Now runs at around 30-40 fps because of OC and various heating fixes.*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ***scroll to bottom for nonspoilers I love this game so far. Everything has been amazing; the graphics, audio (mood, etc), weather is really cool, and there is just so much more. When I found out that the trees fall down, I was astounded! Never have I ever played a game with physics like this.GAMEPLAY:Also, on to the gameplay, the way everything works is great. Everything has a purpose; turtle shells, deerskin, rabbit fur, and even body parts (LOL!). It's weird how one can use someone's leg to kill another person, but IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!AUDIO:The audio in ""El Forest"" is decent. Well, not even decent, more like superb! Like the gameplay, every noise, sound, water drip has a meaning. The night sounds really set the mood, alike the day sounds. night is spoopy, day is happy (ish) . All in all, if you like nighttime sounds and have that one app on your smartphone that puts you to sleep, then you're gonna love this.WEATHER AND CYCLES:Weather is one of those lesser used things. Now, it may be confusing to implement, but in this game it's just great. When it rains you get cold and wet and at night you get cold, at day you start to warm up. I'm not entirely sure if the thunderstorms can zap trees, but it really sets the mood when they occur.GRAPHICS:All I have to say about this is that the developers have paid a lot of attention to detail. Next time you hop into a game (or when you get the game), take a look at all the textures and scenery. THEY WILL ASTOUND YOU!Anyways, aside from the biggies, it's a great game. It's very enjoyable, and they have coop! Who doesn't like that? Now, it does have it's bugs (disappearing logs, to name one), but it's a very enjoyable experience nonetheless.I just bought this game during the sale, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the $14.99. Unlike most early access titles, the devs pay attention to what needs to be done.*** NON SPOILER SECTION ***tl;drGraphics, Audio, Gameplay, basically everything about this game is great. When you experience ""El Forest,"" you will see the work that was put into this masterpiece.			"

Yet I still bought it, along with my friends, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥we had one heck of a time. Three things that have kept me playing and playing. 1, Even thoguht it isn't last forever, the building mechanics are a favorite of mine, very customizable. 2, The survival mechanics, the need for sustainable food, water, and not being maimed by the AI (cannibls and some wildlife). and 3(my favorite), the exploration of caves and above-ground. It's just so amazing that the same game can be rewarding in finished your base, and heart pumping when your being chased my a mutant in a small cave running toward the crawl exit. It's a beautiful game that I will never abondon, I do not reccomend the single player for the very light-hearted, multiplayer succesfuly keeps, but lowers the exitment and horror. 100/10 In my book			"

								Fantastic survival game.Three modes to play in, one without the cannibals, one where they only appear at night and the normal mode where they roam free.The building possibilities are great, I have made several different structures. Around trees, against stone walls, around small lakes. Many things to craft and make your survival a bit easier. Medicine, weapons, energy drinks, molotov cocktails, bombs.Fire seems to be the best weapon against them. Burning sticks, axe or a molotov kills them instantly. If a group attacks it might be wise to flee as the cannibals have a powerful punch in their fists.Patiently waiting for new updates			"

								First of all my plane crash lands in the middle of god knows where. Some Hippy takes the boy I acquired pre-flight and runs off with the little swine. I paid good money for that child!Next I decide I better make the most out of the experience and pick up some of the islands finest sticks and stones. I come across a small settlement of tents by the waters-edge.Hoping to avoid an invitation to one of their terrible music festivals, I scattered on and set up a small shelter and fire further down the line. However just as one might expect, the fire attracted more Hippies.They watched me in confusion for some time, obviously never having seen a person next to a fire without a guitar before. More of them arrived and began getting aggressive. They must have misplaced their marijuana, and immediately painted the blame on the outsider. Clearly simple conversation was too advanced for these dirty, naked, smelly rascals.I awoke in a cave, joined by a good deal of deceased individuals who clearly staged a mass suicide after having given up on humanity, and not enjoying the taste of their rather strange smelling brownies. Armed with my new friend, Jibbly Jabb the lighter, I made my way out of the cave and back towards my camp, which was only a short distance away.I lasted another 2 minutes back at camp before I was unfairly and unexpectedly pummelled to death by Boob-Hippy and Winkie-Doodle.Despite the natives' lack of clothing and proper etiquette, I thoroughly enjoyed my romp in this land and anxiously await my triumphant and vengeful return.

								The Forest is an Early Access game and that means the game still has errors and bugs. I have already played this game for several hours and can say that the game makes addictive. The crafting already offers a multitude of possibilities. The graphic is nice. In multiplayer, it is just fun, to build a camp in the forest but be always careful, because there are at least a few cannibals and mutants out there in the woods and they want to kill and eat you. Also, the exploration of caves and finding useful things is always interesting. The story provides an interesting approach. The development is currently in the version 0.22 and the game is already great. The game would be complete at version 1.0. The developer provides constantly updates all 2 weeks.			"

								They acctually update this, no joke, an early access game with updates. Most early access games are just cash grabs that get abandoned the moment they are put on steam, this is getting updates and fairly often. The game is challenging but fair, the graphics are occasionally buggy but when they aren't bugging out they look excelent, the gameplay (when not buggy) is fairly realistic, it's possible to survive indefinatly on the island but not easy. The ai is sometimes buggy (it's the nature of early access) but usally works well and better then some AAA games. While it needs work it is getting it, each update is noticeable. I would say 8/10 right now, as it gets more updates that should get better.			"

								There's not many games today that offer a real challenge. Even fewer that make you genuinely afraid of the enemy to the point that hearing their call ring through the air puts you on instant alert and sends you straight into fight or flight mode. The Forest does all this and more. The preset build options are excellent and can quickly allow you to build up a safe place to store weapons and supplies but the custom build options take that to a whole new level. At my current progress in my most recent save I've built a platform at the opening to the plane fueselage with a log cabin, fire pit and I am currently in the process of putting walls around it, once done I intend to build ramps up and around a tree so I can place a tree house near the top for a good vantage point. The challenge in the game is to be able to do all that while avoiding enemies, catching or finding food to eat and locating or creating safe water sources to drink. The game has an excellent feature where by typing 'veganmode' at the games main screen you can turn off the enemies, build a base, go back to the main menu and type 'meatmode' to turn the enemies back on, reloading your savegame and you can use your newly built base as a starting point to go exploring but beware, the more days you stay alive, the more difficult and aggressive the enemy become.

								It’s finally here. We’ve all been so excited about it, and it finally releases.But before you drop your hard earned money on it, know a few things. At the current time, you are unable to save. You play until you can’t play anymore, and then restart your game the next time. It doesn’t matter how far you get. Saving just doesn’t work right now. To me that is a huge part of the game considering it is a survival game, and you need to be able to save considering the expense of resources some of the crafting takes.So purchase it at your own risk. It’s a fun game so far, but once saving is fixed, and some of the bugs are sorted it will be even better.EDITS AS OF JUNE 17, 2014Saving is now here! Bugs have been reduced, and overall the game feels a bit better at performance. Also, sharks have joined the plethora of creatures you can stumble upon!			"

								Edit :This is the first game that I have been searching every clues for Lore after a long time on Dark Souls. I own a lot to The Forest specially about my writting skills (For a french canadian)I have survived and witness what this forest has to offer : This 8 arms head mutant & the double body on the store page is not the only thing that will question your sanity... There are legends about ''Worse"" deep below and I met it twice.There are legends about differents Savages & Mutant colorsThere are legends about ""Taming"" these savages : I saw two kneeling and one sitting in my campThere are legends about the location of Timmy (In the mountain or Deep inside the Sinkhole)This game is a simple mystery that nobody knows so far but playing more will make you understand somethingsThe entire ""Cave"" is a living Hell On Earth Nightmare that probably none would even get out of there Sane & Normal.There also a story to discovers before you arrived but still confusing (I cannot tell who got burried where from the 2 parents but I've located their son Z****  I believe) Same thing for the film maker camp : Some corpse are hidden in the caves while A lot of your plane crash passanger were just Tennis Players. I have also witness some Miners, A religion group, A couple hiking, A Failed Hara-Kiri Japanese... But no Kid. All these things that you will find, explore, discovers or Encouters has something to do on How this place became what is it...			"

								This game provides a lot of fun. I assume at some point it's going to get stale, but as of my 10 hours playing, it's a lot of fun. At first, there was a lot of horror involved. It was freaky when a cannibal spots you because you know you're probs going to lose even 1v1, but as the game goes on, you learn more, you find more, and you explore more, so the 1v1 becomes not so bad. That creepy dessonant piano chord they play everytime they spot you still puts me on my toes, but even the cave exploring has become less scary, but still very exciting. The one thing that kills some scare factor is the fact that this is PRE-alpha, so there's a lot of bugs, and some of those bugs make it a bit... tedious. I didn't buy the game at first because it was single player only, and I knew I wasn't going to be playing it long by myself, but with friends, it's a lot of fun. Combat is good, but it's not great because of the bugs. I never see my molotov cocktails light any of those nasty creatures on fire. Sometimes the guys lag out or whatever, and you'll get hit 3 times, and suddenly you need to run back to your new log cabin to pop some meds; sometimes it's also a bit awkward with the ax swinging as well, and you're kind of hoping that you hit the bad guy, rather than using any kind of skill to kill. Building to me is a lot of fun. I never played Minecraft, but my friends used to, and I'd compare it in a way to that. High graphics horror minecraft yes? The log trekking isn't the most fun, but they added a lot of stuff to help with that. Another bug would be that ones' log sled dissapears for one person, but the one person can see it, and place and pick up logs from it. THIS GAME IS A PRE-ALPHA, no one should be expecting this to be perfect by any means, but the rate that the developers are improving it is wonderful. The Day z guys have been doing that for years, and the game is still in alpha. These guys actually set a timer for when the next update gets out, and they're making progress. All in all, if you're hesitate because of the horror part, make sure you have a friend to play with, and it becomes epic. Otherwise, what's $15 stopping you from buying this masterpeice? It has a lot of bugs, but is still a ton of fun despite that.			"

								I bloody love this game and have had it since its original release back in 0.01. In this game you can take your creativity to the next level due to such the wide variety of things available within the survival book/building book. I've made multiple saves now making things from fortresses to nice cabins. Of course this game does have its flaws but this is obviously expected due to it being in early access. Heres my personal list of pros and cons of the game.Pros:Building - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this feature is great as this can be used for simple survival, decoration and to save you from the nasty cannibals.Combat - This has changed ALOT over the updates but I would say the enemy AI is now considered 'intelligent' which makes the combat fair and fun.Multiplayer - I love how this has changed since its original release it's now playable and really fun to play this game with friends and family however there are cons to this.Exploration - It's really great to explore round this island with its great landmarks such as the boat, the numerous caves and the anchor.Cons:Multiplayer - There a few bad aspects to the multiplayer such as when something new that is major is released to the game it always is put onto singleplayer before they master its functionality for multiplayer.Exploration - This does lack quite a bit as fun as it is we still have to deal with such a small enviroment also there update for the extra world space was beyond disapointing due to the broken caves and barely any new cool structures which include missing colliders in the mountain.I hope this review helps you decide whether to purchase this game but ultimately I... RECOMMEND this game. "

								Having played several other similar games (Stranded Deep, Subnautica, Rising World, ARK, Life is Feudal, Long Dark, and of course Minecraft), I'm a sucker for this genre.I saw this game about a year ago and was tempted then, but it seemed too early. Moreover, all the screenshots made it seem like this would be a very dark (literally no sunshine) game. I just recently got it, and I'm very impressed and first want to say this game is not just a night-time scary game like the pictures & intro movie suggest. Sure, it has all that, but it also has a whole world of daylight, sunshine, and good visibility.Gameplay is beautiful and smooth for me, with lots to explore and a good deal of customization available in terms of building your base. As I mentioned, I've played several similar titles where you build a base, and I think The Forest does a really good job in terms of allowing you to place custom shapes, as well as place blueprints to visualize things before actually building. I was quite impressed by the ability to place a custom floorplan, and then automatically have walls placed around it, with the ability to toggle window/door/full wall in each section. Really well done.Multiplayer/Co-op works great, too, but could use a little refining. I haven't found a good mechanism for hosting a dedicated server, which is somewhat limiting. There's also some ""instancing"" issues, for lack of a better word, where some players' clients will display certain objects, like Native effigies, but other players cannot see them. This seems limited to just a couple of nuanced items. Apart from that, co-op gameplay was quite smooth; no other syncing issues or crashes (although we only have 3 people in our game).All in all, I'd highly recommend this game. Even if you're not into the Horror genre and find yourself thinking ""Man, I wish Stranded Deep, Subnautica, Long Dark, etc were multiplayer""... this is a good buy.			"

								Massive potential for this game! As of now, it is great to play by yourself as well with friends in a sort of casual manner. I think there could be variation to your character's attacks along with increasing AI tactics and difficulty. Don't get me wrong, the enemies are quite smart. They will walk on patrols alone and in teams plus they will even run away to get their friends! The scenery is beautiful and the sound effects are as frightening as they are pleasing at times (play and you'll see what I mean). If you want a little more terror, you'll find it in...dark places. The creature designs and sound effects are great and I hope they introduce more. If you like survival games, I really believe you'll enjoy this one. I'd like to add that right now the community is pretty cool. I've made more friends playing this game than any other which I believe is due to the well managed AI.			"

								Keep in mind, this game is still in early access at this point, so there are bugs that need to be worked out; However, when compared to other survival games such as Rust, The Forest, offers suspense, a storyline, and beautiful graphical landscapes, from an ocean and beach setting, to cliffs, mountains and obviously a Forest. The natives who attack you have startled me many times, which makes it a creepy and fun experience to play in the dark. There is so much potential for this game, I can't wait to see where they go with it in the future. At this stage I would still recommend it and if they continue to add content, and improve upon the bugs, this may very well be one of the go-to survival games out there.			"

								I wont go into detail as other people have mentioned most things. The detail and graphics are really good, the only dowside is the game can lag/delay and sometimes stall. However with a little tweaking it can be very playable.The crafting is well thought out, and along with the survival book it gives you a good idea what you can do and with what. The locals are interesting and can flank you too, the AI is not bad. Once you get a base sorted and you've built yourself a few traps and a tree house things start to get better and you can take it a bit easier and not worry about them.I can't wait for further improvements and I have to say this is one of the better survival games. Kind of reminds me of lost ;-)			"

								""As the lone survivor of a passenger jet crash, you find yourself in a mysterious forest battling to stay alive against a society of cannibalistic mutants. Build, explore, survive in this terrifying first person survival horror simulator.""This description is spot on, and despite it being Early Access, it delivers on each front. The atmosphere is great, textures and animations CAN be good, and the small interactions with the wildlife are interesting. As far as I can see, the game has potential to be a contender with any and all AAA titles, AS LONG as the developers continue with this trend. In the current state of the game, it is VERY buggy, and is essentially BAREBONES. It can still provide an enjoyable experience, but DO NOT be surprised at cannibals running in reverse at you, or even trees continually falling for what seems to be an eternity. DO NOT let this dishearten you, it's simply a matter of time and effort, and it is clear they're more than willing to put in the effort. This post will be updated as soon as I can, and I'll attempt to do it after each major update to the game. (12/27/14)			"

								The game itself feels really nice to play, and for me it is very stable.The graphics are already nicely done for an Alpha game so atm they are doing update work on the game itself.Alot of updates are being puched out and even small hotfixes every few days from people who report their bugs. I myself havent seen such active developers in a while that dont just abandon a game when they have cashed in.The gameplay itself will be expanded alot. in a way that u can form tribes with AI, visit funerals, attack other  clans, help friendly clans killenemy clans, clans help againsts beasts, new weapons, new armor, new overall building, new traps, new items , animal interaction.breeding, the more animals etc u kill the harder it gets later on. (see it as reallife where respawn takes a long time) and much much more, so yea ive got very high hopes of this game.If you like survival games i can higly recommend it			"

								SO GREAT!                           i rate it 8/10 i haven't played that much of solo but i play with a few mates in coop and that is a lot of fun! the first night when 5 people are all in a small log cabin screaming to everyone to keep the door closed, thats the best.i've explored all the caves in the coop world and i throughly enjoy it. its hard to find everything and its rewarding when you do. also it is the biggest mission to try and get out some of the caves! especially the katana cave.i do hope once the full-full game launches the map will be A LOT bigger, its not small now but i feel for continuity purposes i think the map should be bigger. maybe even other islands that you could explore and find new loot or new inhabitants, that would be so cool!i love the building mechanics, so nice to build what you want.the game is not easy in coop, the mutants are scary and they take a long time to kill them if you dont know how, but thas the best part, 1 v 1 a super mutant with a bow and arrow or a katana and jumping to escape his attacks, so great!my only concern is the map size, i really hope it becomes much bigger because this game can be the best survival game i've played but the map needs to be bigger so i can keep playing for a long time!i love the fact that there are finite amount of turtles and stuff on the island and that you can wipe out a species, that mechanic is super neat!great game, would reccomend			"

								I started on a plane. All was fine, but then some crazy stuff happened and the plane crashed in some random forest. I grab a axe that was sticked at someone's body in front of me and then i started chopping down some trees to make a shelter.  A bunny showed up and i axed him too.I build a shelter and then i notice some naked dickless dudes jumping from the trees and watching me while i was building my shelter and campfire.  I keep doing my things, and then suddently, the naked dickless dude just jumped in front of me.I showed him how my axe was sharpened and he runned away.Then, a bunch of naked feminists ♥♥♥♥♥es started rushing at my direction and then slapped me in the face. I drop myself on the ground and when i wake i'm on some kind of bugged cave with some people sticked on the walls.  I somehow found the way out, but then more naked dickless dudes start rushing at me. I blowed then with my axe (literally) just like if i had some super powers. Then the guy i just blowed off drops a leg. I take it and start using it as a new favorite weapon.On my way back to the camp, i found a stick with a head on it. I keep walking to the camp, but the naked feminist ♥♥♥♥♥es was still there. They kill me again and then a red screen shows up with a message saying that i survived 5 days.Conclusion:This game is awesome!For now it lack a multiplayer mode and it still have a lot of bugs (like falling from the map), but there is a lot more to come with the updates.Recomended!

								Hello,first of all i want to congrats the Developers for this awesome Idea of a Survival Game.I want to name some points of personal expression and my idea of a better solution. My mainlanguage is not English,so i hope you can excuse my mistakes. I will shortly notice the main theme and a longer explanation of ""WHY"".1. Lower the Difficulty OR Make it adjustable.WHY: I am experienced with survival games and it took me quite some time to figure out how to survive. I can imagine that beginners might even give this game up before they've even started to enjoy it. It started with the predators which you can easily 1o1, but in a group they are superior and if you don't have better weapons than your beginner axe, you are pretty much dead. Again and Again.2. Items reset when i load my saved game.(BUG)EXPLANATION: As this is the alpha, bugs are being expected and i'm totally assure of that. However, when i loaded my saved game, all collected things in my inventory were gone. Only the leaves and the Axe from the Airplane were left. My Buildings were all there, but my whole Inventory was gone, which resulted in a fast death. ||||| This bug makes this game UNENJOYABLE from the moment it appears. This was the point where i stopped playing (which shoud be understandable if you farm hours for something from which you know, it will reset anyways after you logout) so you better fix this fast. |||||3. A Change in ""Saving the Game"" OR/AND the ability to pause your game while being in the Menue.WHY: Currently you can only save the game by sleeping in your shelter, however if there is some kind of an emergency or people just want to leave the game fast, make a break or something like that the only possibility would be the shelter, but what if this shelter is being camped by a Crowd of Predators which you can't fight at the moment? Then you are FORCED to stay ingame until you solve this somehow. If you could just save the game instantly by going into the Menue and even create a pause while doing so, you would make the game a lot more comfortable for all players.These are my 3 Points and i hope the Developers get to read them.Number 2 is my minor Problem since i really found my addiction to this game but in an unplayable state.Despite these rather negative Aspects which shall be fixed soon, this game provided me an uncomparable experience and i'm looking forward on playing it again once the minor bugs are gone. I recommend it.Greetings			"

								This game is excellent, the visuals are genuinely fantastic and not as hardware demanding as you might think. The developers keep the updates contstantly rolling out with the date of the next update shown clearly on the main menu.Definetly one of the better survival games on steam, albeit also one of the scarier ones too. The bad guys are truly terrifying at first when they turn up to way you up as your scouring the wreckage of a plane crash and you have no idea of where you are or where to go.The online co-op mode is a fun mode too with everybody somehow agreeing to build a fortress together of everybodys design.Somebody once knocked down my newly built tree house down by cutting down the tree! Grrr!I highly rate this game and its still in alpha phase. I can't want until the next update, or the next, or the next...			"

								This game is crazy. It really gives you the survival trip. I've just bought the game and I've finished it. Days Survived 1. Let me tell you about my experience. Entered the game. Crashed with the plane. Smashed and looted a few luggage cases.Chopped a few trees to make a small shelter. Made a fire and went to sleep. Woke up in the morning. Explored a bit the environment. Found a small village with a cave. Entered the cave.Got down a few levels by some ropes.Started to die of thirst. Some weird dude caught me in the cave and hanged me upside down. Escaped after recovering. Went again very happy outside.The sun was shinning so nice and everything looked so bright.On my way to the shelter, found some ♥♥♥♥ing zombies. Chased by zombies a few miles.Died. I'm gonna try again! Love this game.			"

								When this game gets fully released then everyone can finally see its FULL potential!I love the aspect of survival horror and it's great to see how much content is put into creating your own base. Co-op is very fun and I hope they eventually add multiple servers which you can connect to globally. The cannibals are scary as ever and provide a more than welcomed challenge for multiple people in your party.Consistent updates and thriving devs will continue to make this game a success compared to many other forgotten survival games.Overall the Forest is a great game and I recommend it to everyone!9/10 would let my son get kidnapped again			"

Note: I'd like to give a special thanks to the developers at Endnight Games for providing me with a key.I've been following The Forest for a while now, and it was the most wanted game on my wish list.  I first found TF through a Youtuber (Vintagebeef) who frequently plays it.  TF is very interesting in that it's not your typical survival/open world game.  Instead, you crash land on an island, and the entire game is simply trying to build yourself a home/base and survive.  The cannibals, which are your primary threat, are human-shaped creatures that will try to kill you.  I don't actually know if they are considered zombies or if they are still alive, but I assume they are dead.  When you're not fighting them, you're cutting down trees, gathering sticks and various other ingredients for crafting.Speaking of, the crafting is really helpful and well done.  In TF, you have an instruction booklet that shows you all the things you can make, your tasks that you need to do for survival, and various other little things.  When you select an item to make, you're given an outline to place down somewhere.  Once this is placed, you'll see a task list that shows how much of something you need for whatever you want to make.  This is a very nice feature, as we don't have to keep going back into the book to read.  You can also rotate the items before you place them, a detail that is greatly needed in most games.TF somewhat has a story.  When you start a new profile, it opens with you being on a plane with your son, and the plane crashes.  When you awake, one of the cannibals comes in and takes your son, leaving you alive.  After this the gameplay begins.  If you die, the cannibals drag you back to their cave, and that is where the story ends (for now).  I don't believe there is a fully developed story yet for TF, just those two scenes.  I could be wrong.  My complaint with the story is that it's inconsistent.  During the gameplay, these cannibals always charge and attack us even if we ignore them.  Yet, after this plane crash, one shows up and takes my child and leaves me alive?  That doesn't make sense to me.  One of the best things about TF is that it never ends unless you die.  As long as you manage to live, you can keep playing over and over again.  There are different things for you to do in game, but there's a severe lack of variety.  You can make a town if you want (RIP trees....seriously, log cabins take SO MUCH WOOD!), you can make a nice little base, and/or you can make a boat house.  You can do whatever you please!The developers were paying close attention to detail.  If you eat certain kind of berries, you get hurt.  If you kill a cannibal and get blood all over you, it has to be washed off or you get an infection.  If you drink booze, you get drunk.  Those are just some of the many thorough details that the developers added.  In a lot of games we see lately, there may be little detail, or none at all.  To see Endnight Games putting this much work and detail into TF warms my heart.On the topic of detail, the graphics are stunning!  There are times I've just stood there staring out at the sky, or staring at the trees.  When the wind blows, the leaves blow, and when you watch them, you can see every detail of the tree blowing with the wind.  This is amazing!  You really get that realism experience, especially at night when it's pitch black and you can't see.  Talk about scary!  My very first night I huddled by my fire and kept doing 360s to watch all my angles.  I admit, that first night I was scared.  Every little sound made me turn and look to see if it was a cannibal.  I've never had this experience in a game before.TF has been in alpha for a long time now. I'm very glad that they are taking their time and giving us updates, but it feels like it may be in alpha forever.  It's not really hurting TF to be in alpha given the gameplay and everything is there, but it is concerning how long it has been in alpha.  My worry is that they may drag out the alpha for as long as humanely possible.   As fun as TF is, it will get to a point where it's getting stale, and there needs to be fresh content, maybe a map expansion.  You can only do the same exact thing so many things before you just say ""I'm done.""If you're ever too frightened by the cannibals, get a buddy and hop in multiplayer!  Yep, TF has multiplayer, which makes it so much more fun.  From what I played, the multiplayer is pretty stable, and there was hardly any lag.  If that doesn't help your fear, go back into single player and turn off the creatures!Overall, The Forest is an extremely fun game that has potential to be one of the best of its genre.As a final note, I didn't want to list this as a positive or a negative, but as mentioned, the opening story doesn't make much sense right now.  Given this is still in alpha, I won't hold this against the developers, as I'm sure eventually it will be explained.Positives: Beautiful graphics Attention to detail Endless playability Great job of instilling fear and panic of the cannibals, especially at night Active, friendly developers Ability to turn off cannibals and make it purely about surviving the wilderness Decent options to craft/build Active wildlife, some of whom may attack you More adult oriented due to nudity and gore Open worldNegatives: Alpha that has lasted longer than most early access titles After so many hours, TF can get boring due to the lack of contentFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.

								Alpha v0.01 review.Good:-Great graphics.-Interesting plot.-Unique crafting.-Potential for engaging survival environment and gameplayNeutral:-The A.I has potential, but behaves inconsistently. I’ve had cannibals walk right up to me and just hang out, maybe they are    just misunderstood? Bad:-Game performance degrades over time. -Missing collision on some objects (various trees)-Unlimited ammo glitch-Pick up a single tennis ball, throw 3?-Dead cannibal bodies explode into perfectly sliced pieces when attacked and sometimes launch you into space-Monsters despawn, and vanish entirely-Fire pits 'eat' fish-Fire pits stop working entirely-Other A.I Issues, Walking underwater, clippingPersonal Issues:-Objects that you can interact with in a survival game shouldn't glow bright white from 100m away (logs, etc.)-Beautiful map environment, but small compared to other survival games on the marketPersonal verdict:-If you have extra cash and want to support the developers, buy it-If you want a game to play and enjoy, you need to wait, don't buy this yet, it will likely spoil the game for future enjoyment.I’m aware it’s pre-alpha, I paid $15.00 for it, and I’m still rating it as followsGreat start, lots of potential, however, “The Forest” has plenty to finish before the general public will accept it. 2/10.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: Read All below for fun time. :)To start with, I thought this would be one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ survival games which forever stuck in early access *cough cough Dayz"" yeah, I shouldn't compare that♥♥♥♥♥♥to this one hell of a game.Key points:Graphics ""such wow"" can run it on high easily (not on MP)The overall idea of it is pretty simple, and makes sense.The User Interface for Health, Stamina and Hunger are simple and easy to use and understand.Crafting in your inventory, wow just wow, amazing, ""the possibilities are endless"".Aswell as the simple and easy to use Survival Guide, with instructions on survivng and building with 3D Blueprints.Storage of all the things you need in life is possible, dried meat, stored food, drinks, meds, logs, sticks and stones and weapons.Key items and crafting items spawn in the same spot every time, the OP Katana and then grinding the respawning animals for food and the suitcases oh god the suitcases. Oh wait the collectables my favourite, more on that later.Singleplayer:With the sole survivor of the plane crash ""that you know of"" you black out after you see one of the ""natives, pick up and take away your son, your mission if you chose to accept it, is to Survive and Thrive? Explore get more equipment and crafting materials.While its dark it is spooky in some sense due to the dark ""no♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and the whooping and screaming of the natives, there is a silly cheaty way though, you can sleep through the night and reload saves since there are no autosaves. While the ""Natives""-Cannibal Mutant ♥♥♥♥ers-are around in the daylight it is not as troubling since you can see them and most likely in the day time you most likely got the equipment to hold off.Multiplayer:Well while still in Alpha this game copes, only problem is the occasional ""every 30 mins"" save and re log on a server hosted with 8/8 of us running around, etc etc V-SYNC FML.Anyway it is much more fun with friends since you can screw around and still get stuff done, since there is two of you(or more) its great. I've done like 5 hours straight (apart from V-Syncing).Some iffy points its always the same tactic, build an alpine treehouse near the Spawn point (plane crash) then a defensive wall, some stick'n'stone spiky protector and then traps, GG you win you are safe., have fun exploring. Caves though or even the just out in the dark together is great together, Gotta Go Deeper to find the Joke nevermind, goign cave diving miles underground with a party of you never alone, pls no. While spooky you have banter and explore and find new things, if theres 5 of you easy tactic two with katanas out, two with torches to light the way and the other well bomb carry for the well you got to see them to believe it.Its just great, I don't really know what to say.PLOT/Spoilers maybe?: Ta da with only having 20 hours under my belt so far, pun intended (John Cena is ma name while typing this).You Crash on this Island but ""Forest"" first off no idea why the plane would explode, then you pass out, wake up theres a red dude maybe covered in blood who picks up your son walks off, then you pass out.These are ""Natives"" I would say uncontacted, but then you explore, you find Film Crew and Camping tents, were you the only survivor or not? With the only evidence of carcasses, effigys or did they become the ""natives"" Collectables of images and cassette players, some images dating ""82"" so is this set on real life, I doubt.Okay okay, the ""natives"" lets call them ""mutant cannibals"" cave dwellers, naked people who run around and have no genitals. There are different types I'd say normal, but no, its not normal, you got super fast ones who run on all fours, brutes, giant ♥♥♥♥er multiarmed weird♥♥♥♥♥things, crawling mutant babies and a spider ♥♥♥♥♥, I don't even know if thats all of them.Anywho why they only attack with there arms adn the occasional ""club""(ain't seen any use one) they neglect ranged attacks, rocks or bow, please what sort of Civilisation is this?Also Giant ""♥♥♥♥♥Hole"" in middle of map, just go look at it seriously, its not human made I hope, so its something to do with the background/story/plot.I don't know why I even typed this review I wasted like half an hour I could of used to play this game, it keeps me up at night, due to the fact I think I'm addicted and that it sometimes horrifies  me.Alright thats enough, I'm off Please Rate review etc. :)			"

Early Access Review
								The ForestUPDATE 21.1.2017This game has get pretty big updates since I last played this. Now that the main story is almost complete and more and more features have been added, all I can say is that this game is really, really good. So much to do etc. now. I can still recommend this to every one who likes to build things and explore.As the (lone) survivor of a passenger jet crash, you find yourself in a mysterious forest battling to stay alive against a society of cannibalistic mutants. Build, explore, survive in this terrifying first person survival horror simulator.You are in airplane with random passengers and your son. Plane crashes and creepy cannibal covered in red paint steals your son. Then you start to collect all kinds of things to help you survive. You find some drawings that your son drew. Then you will have to find some tools etc. You can go explore cavesetc. At some point you can go to big cave where your son may be, but this will come in future updates.Game itself:The game has all kind of things to offer. It's pretty easy to learn too. It took like 20 minutes for me to learn all the basic things, but you will learn more and more new things when they add new things to this game in the future.  You have a survival book that has all the basic crafting recepies. Other crafting recepies like bow are easy to learn. You can find all kind of tools and ""guns"" too. You have to gather resouces like chop trees down and collect rocks etc. and then build your own village or almost anything you want. Hunting down animals with weapons is also a thing here. You can find weapons in caves and by crafting them by yourself. You have to eat and drink to stay alive. And like in real life you cant eat rotten meat or poisoned water, so you have to be carefull with those too. There is animals like deers, sharks, tortoises and rabbits. You can also craft armor with things you can get by killing animals and cannibals. There are different kind of cannibals like ""super mutants"" and ""baby mutants"" as I like to call them and they really are scary. Normal cannibals are also pretty scary but not as scary as other mutants. Mutants are also pretty hard to kill. You can get different drops from them when they are killed.Like in real life you have to eat, rest and drink. This game has a bar for health and energy. This also has ""bar"" for hunger and thirstily, so you have to eat and drink to get energy for survival. This also has bar for armor that can be crafted.Playing the game yourself in single player is really scary at first when you have nothing but your basic axe that can be found in the start of the game. You have to start looking for stuff as fast as possible after the crash so you will have enough time to make a shelter for first night of survival. The game will make the cannibals harder night after night for you when you proceed in the game, at least thats how I have seen my single player so far. When playing in single player you will have things to do for a long time. Exploring the caves alone is really scary thing and bit hard at first, but you will spend a lot of time in them trying to find all the special weapons and tools.Playing with friends is really fun. Doing the things this game has to offer with friends is much more fun and more effective. You can make bases and so on so much faster with friends. It's also less scrary when playing with many people. The gameplay works great when playing single player, no lag for me at all. Sometimes when playing multiplayer and if the host has bad internet you can see some lag and missing stuff. I have not seen other problems while playing this. Ofc when this is early access game you will see some little bugs and so on but it's not that bad to be honest.Well to summarise my review this is simple and easy game to play. You can spend hours playing this and you will allways have something to do, at least thats how I see this game. It's not bad at all to spend 15 euros for this. If you like playing sandbox games that include surviving and building things, this is a game for you. My grade for this game is 9/10			"

								I'm an extremely large fan of survival games and by far this game has taken the cake for one of the best I've ever played. The game is visually stunning and is one of a couple games that has good looking water. You start playing and take in all the beautiful scenery and then start your fight for survival agains canibalistic mutants. I laughed when the first thing I saw was a settlement with canibals who didn't look to happy to see me.For those who want some other ways to play the game, here are some code you can enter in the main menu of the game:(1) vegetarianmode (Canibals only come out at night)(2) theironforest (Makes all buildings indestructable)(3) veganmode (Disables canibal spawning entirely)This game has a great gameplay experience for all players new or experienced. Also, for a safer way to play, build a treehouse. It's much safer then building on the ground.Overall a bloody awesome game.10/10 would make a very big effigy of body parts again.			"

								I bought this game a long time ago, it was suggested to me by a friend.I played a couple of hours and kind of put it away in a coset, thinking it was never going to be very good.Last week I downloaded it again this week and I am agonized due to the Halt in the story they suddenly threw in here.the story makes it so much moe than just a sandbox horror survival because that got old very quickly. adding a story has given you a reason to move instead of just setting up somewhere and making yourself invincible in a little fort that they cant touch.The progress is slow and it's,,, difficult to know what to do without some sort of guide but its worth it and i can't wait for the next update!solid 8.5/10the map is goreous, the threat is real, the gameplay is simple and clear the story is concerning to say the least.it only loses points for me because its a little hardware heavy for my computer and the inventory is a bit of a mess, its a little hard to see things around the edges. the inventory could do with an overhaul tbh but other than that, it's an awesome game!

								A lumberjack simulator right after a plane crash simulator that gets spookier as time advances and more lumber jacking you do. There is cannibals in game that dont know you are on the island and you want to keep it that way so they wont storm in and raid your base like stink on♥♥♥♥♥♥(relations with the cannibals and nature are pretty advanced). There is alot of crafting and building if your into that sort of thing (can get complicated, intricate and interesting).Alot of Spelunking with all kinds of atrocities down under in the caves,  more cannibals, ugly ♥♥♥♥ing uber mutants with lots of legs or arms , someone called the cowman is downthere i dont know about but is said to be related to the boogieman slashie slash bughuul. Game is updated every 12 something odd days so new content or things are added so pretty good on the updates there.Story? ahh plane crashed ahhh you ummm are the only survivor so far i think besides your son timmy i think; that gets kidnapped and ""MAYBE"" is dead and you have to go find him but ♥♥♥♥ that little ♥♥♥♥er i forgot all about him 20 minutes in building a fortress, farming food and fighting off the cannibals/mutants on the island.yeh i like this game.Would find the knuckle head outta 10/ but bow and arrow tho			"

								To start of I'd like to say It's got a recommendation because of the potential this game has.With that I would Like to add that if you are short on cash and looking for a game to play, I would pick up another game. Why? Simply because The Forest is In it's Alpha state, and with thathas a ton of bugs and flaws. It's barely playable in this state. so I would suggest you to buy it in a later state.As for the game itself, not including the bugs,The Forest is a game with lots of potential, and I'm sure the developers will build towards the expectations.The Graphics are great, especially for an indie game. The enemies excist of cannibals, Mutants and wildlife.Crafting in The Forest has been kept simple, and for that I hope there will be improvements, more crafting options and more crafting materials, wich on that part I'm sure will come.What I love about the game is that there are patrols roaming around the island, giving you the feeling your never safe, and always watched. this mechanic is really well done. The cannibals also climb in trees, so you have to be constantly on your toes if you want to survive in this horror survival.The story:The Game starts you off in a plane with your son. unfortunately the plane crashes and you and your son are one of the few survivors of the crash. when you come to your sences you see a man walking up to your son, taking him with him. leaving you falling back to black out again. when you wake up later, wounded and dehydrated in the plane wreck, you start off with some handy supplies such as your backpack, Lighter and a axe found in a stewardesses body. you find out that you have little time to look around the plane wreck and you'll have to start gathering resources and build a shelter to save and rest in, and a fire to stay warm at and cook food.Tips and Tricks:Always be careful picking a location for your shelter since the cannibals patrol the island. If you 'Die' in the game the first time you will be taken to one of the cannibals caves, with them probably assuming you were dead. but beware, if you Die a second time you will really be dead, and you WILL have to start all over again.You are a really buff man, and you can carry 2 logs at a time!There are suitcases lying around the plane wreck and some boat wrecks. they can be opened by hitting them with your axe.Press 'I' to open your inventory, and press 'B' to open up your survival guide.Do NOT let the cannibals flank you. if you encounter a group of cannibals, I would advise you to run and hide. if fighting is inevitable, keep an eye out for all the enemies. they WILL charge at you from behind. If they find your camp and they are attacking you, try to mak them run in the campfire, this way they will be weak enough to take out.BEWARE: some cannibal corpses are known to explode when you hit them.This was my review of The Forest. I would rate it a solid 8/10 when the bugs are fixed, and if they add more features to the game I will reconsider this.			"

I'm sure he will take care of the boy.He definitely won't be tapping him.I'm sure of it.Anyway...Break the luggages with mah axe. I got me 5 wristwatches, booze and chocolate bars.And some meds. Kill few lizards.Find a camp, which I thought was abandoned.Build a fire. 2 dudes come to (now) my camp and stare at me for a while. Then they attack. Kill them both, put the head of the other one on a stick. Find out the second dude didn't actually die. He's barely alive though.Teabag him for a while. Proceed to finish him off by hitting him in the genitals.*WHAM*The dude stands up.K.Kill him with a strike to the neck.Night comes.A new dude shows up. He runs past me to the cannibal-shack I'm taking shelter from the rain from. Hits it few times with his club.K.He's now my pal.Fire's going out, put some more there.THE♥♥♥♥WASTHAT!?Some naked Gollum is looking at me from the shadows.It seems to stay away from the fire.Seek protection from my half-naked pal who has a vendetta against the camp-shaft.He's just standing there scared. Seeks shelter in me.We both back to the end of the shack.There's more Gollums now.About 10.One of them charges at me, and then the rest come.I try to fend them off.No avail.I pass out.I open my eyes to see two halfnaked dudes carry me.HOORAH!

								One of the things I truly love about this game is the atmosphere, you will see the cannibals walking around and hunting and minding their own business constantly, and it always puts me on edge. crafting takes some creativity and survival is realistic to a point I have never seen in any game (and that is coming from someone who goes camping with nothing but a knife and tent). If I can give a couple pieces of advice, craft the bow as quickly as possible, makes hunting and fighting way easier (you will still die). have no less than 3 fires and 3 effigies surrounding your camp at all times. if you encounter cannibals and you are not yet rambo, run away and hide in your cabin. if you do all of this you may survive for 3 days.ps. I've seen aerosol cans in some of the luggage, hoping future updates allow me to pick these up and turn them into grenades, or flamethrowers.			"

								The Forest is definetly one of my favourite games despite it only being 0.12 Alpha as I'm currently writing this review. The gameplay feels fluid and not clunky to me. The video settings I feel are ample for the game and I can only imagine the options getting more in depth. I feel like there is a huge amount of potential within this game and I can see it being a big contender when finally finished and polished up.Moving more into the game itself, you will see a lot of bugs because it'a an alpha although there are a few which will require you to reload the save but fortunately I haven't had that happen enough to me that I have complained. The A.I in the game suprise me each time I load back into singleplayer or even multiplayer, although the atmosphere completely changes on multiplayer as the isolation factor of being stuck in a forest/island alone with no idea of what could be hiding in the tree trunks above you or following you at a respectable distance. After the initial ""settling in"" you might find yourself running out of things after establishing a defendable base and eco-system within it. Saying that there is a nice cave system with a definetly fear element (Atleast to me, personally) once you go deep down into them, regardless if on multiplayer or singleplayer, you will find yourself letting out a noise or two or possibly some bodily fluids. After doing the exploration of The Forest/Island you sort of run out of things to do really.Wrapping up my review, The graphics on the game are stunning even on the lowest settings, The gameplay feels fluid and fun although turning bland near the end of the initial setup, could do with more things to do which I'm anticipating.

								Since its release to alpha it was made aparent this game and the people behind it are somthing rare and special. The forest is a sp/coop survival game placed in a remote enviornment. A survivor of a plane crash you must come to your senses, no guns no gimiks just you a crafted axe and a forest filled with canabals er mutants as they like to be called. A lil more realistic than rust this is no 7 days to die game. The lighting and gfx are moving in an exciting direction. As is the dev of the game.   Endnight games has blown the bar right off the hangers here. Consistant updates (literally, i mean these guys put the counter on thier game menu) and meet the timeline without fail or immeadiate communication. The steam community is being managed in a manor that should become codex for ea games. The game itsself is a awesome example of care and skill. A great base with wip that not only is fun to use but allows for player input. The work being done here is beyond my highest expectations of this nature and after a long time of consistant performance this games quality and ability cannot be contested by even the big names out there..... in fact all big names out there are hard pressed to keep up with the level of skill being displayed here.Anyways. as I usally do i warn : if you dont know how to deal with beta games please wait. If your a gamer like me i recomend this one and actually ask you to come help us with this one. It has great potensional and the devs really desurve the help and effort.			"

								Pretty graphics. The sounds are very intense too and, at times, very realistic.  To the point where my cats are looking around the room for things that are not actually there. It has great juxtaposition between the pretty daytime scenery and the scary, half-naked cannibals that hunt you down in the pitch-black darkness.  Obviously there are numerous bugs until it's finished since it's still in Alpha, but I love the overall feel of this game.  A true survival game in my opinion.			"

								GREAT AWSOME GAME. STILL A LITTLE BUGGY BUT the saving works fine, you can build whatever you want,whenever you want, wherever you want. Maybe I would like it to have more things to craft. You can only craft a few things like an axe, molotov, bomb, headbomb, stealth armor, bow and arrow, paintings(only three of them). The main point of the game is to find your son. I do believe that's where they're heading. I found a little boys toy that seems like a key object which I can use for crafting. PROs:-great great graphics. Lightning effects are EXTREME.-Open World.-Survival horror-multiplayer!-Up to 8 players.-You can build as many houses as you want.-Savings are not lost upon 2 death.-EFFIGIEES!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWSOME. GO AWAY SATAN! GO AWAY!CONs: -Since an update... everytime you find the  plane survivors deadbodies it doesn't counts them anymore. It seems they took that out.That was very helpful because since you don't know what the hell you are supposed to do, that feature somehow hint me that I must find all the bodies to find my son/kid that was beside me on the airplane. The one THEY took.-Traps don't work. THEY step into them and it doesn't kills them or do something to them.-BOW and ARROW. you cannot aim. What I mean is that there isn't any sight for the cross or any aimpoint or something to help you aim.-Since they make it harder ""the bird on the hand"" thing its kinda difficult to get some feathers for the arrows. Suggestions:-Body counter-Objectives besides surviving... Don't know, once you find some camp, spy them and follow them.-Aimsight for the arrow.-Fast Travel between safe houses.(Only the cabin, so it won't be THAT easy to travel to ""important"" places within the game so fast.)-More animal traps.-More animal variety in general-Complete the crafting guide already.-Gun/Flaregun crafting. If you are able to craft a bomb why not a gun? a wood gun maybe? :D-When killing the rabbit, make some trasition effects not the rabbit meat on the floor without doing anything.-stealth armor or  mud are not effective at all for hiding. Only hiding behind trees or bushes.-Include LADDERS so you can build tall houses or another tall building.-Which leads to more building crafting. Not only shelters.-Some kind of Delta Wing, mini plane, car to move within the woods.-Tree hiding/ Climbing-Tree houses-Stone Cabins-Shovel and sand to make glassBesides the suggestions and stuff(Its all because I survived over a 100 days or so in the game and Im bored waiting for something new to build/craft/kill XD) I totally recommend this one NOW. Since it has tons of fun and you won't be scared until you hear/see your first one. THEY are fast. You'll see "

Early Access Review
								First off, I have to admit something very important: this game scares the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. This has been the first game in a long time that actually made me scare quit in sheer panic, and I will provide some scenarios later.If you like survival + needs management, crafting/building, horror, exploration, and death, then give this game a try - I think you will really enjoy it; or even really enjoy hating it for scaring/killing you so much, but also making you come back for more.As an early access game, this has easily been one of the most impressive alphas I have ever played. The aesthetics are fantastic, and, if you can run it, you will be in for a very nice treat the first time you gaze out on the ocean from within a forest of dense trees and foliage. The music and sounds are very subtle, and a very faint scary-movie-like-noise will warn you when enemies are nearby (crazy story later on).The controls are easy to familiarize yourself with - there are many button prompts as seen in the Dead Island games (ex: key bind ""e"" hovering over lootable items). At times, however, the controls may not be as responsive, and you may often find yourself repeatedly trying to pick up items on the ground (the key is to make sure you can see the button prompt; try walking around it and panning the mouse around until you get it). The learning curve is moderate to difficult if you aren't used to open-world survival games - you really have to balance securing your shelter/food and watching out for the enemy. You WILL die many times during your initial playthroughs - do not be alarmed, just take a deep breath and learn from each experience.As the sole survivor of a brutal airplane crash on an island inhabited by cannibals, your first task will be to immediately loot the inside of the airplane and the immediate surroundings (you can use your axe to break open luggages). Be quick, as the crash site is randomized and so are enemy patrols - you could have several minutes to just one or two. A good thing to do is to loot the inside, run to the nearest collection of bushes, and hide. Wait until you see the cannibals (they will most likely come to investigate). When they leave, loot the outside, then find a place to establish your base.You have to manage your needs, primarily hunger and energy. To do this, you can eat some of the candy bars you looted from the airplane wreck to satisfy your hunger. You can drink some cans of sodapop to regain energy, or go to sleep. Note that sleeping in any form of shelter is currently the only way to save.The inventory management is really cool - you can see all your items laid out on a blanket when you go to your inventory. From here, information on each item is given, and you have the option of crafting items. One such item (very useful against enemy mobs, especially in the beginning when you are weak) is a molotov cocktail, made by combining one bottle of alcohol with one piece of cloth. Another thing I really like about this game is the fluidity of gameplay - when you are looking at your inventory or have pressed ESC, the game is actually still progressing - so you could close your inventory only to see group of cannibals ruunning toward you.Combat can get very difficult, but the latest patch allowing you to block with the fire axe (starting weapon) has made this element less of a suicide. I have been one-hit killed a number of times, thrown forcefully into a tree, and I am unsure whether this is part of the game or a glitch. The AI is amazing! The personalities and tendencies of each cannibal can vary - some will cry over the death of their allies, others will bow before you, and many will pull and drag a downed ally away from you. Females seem to be the most aggressive, however, almost all cannibals will become extra aggressive during the night. Enemies will do different things when they encounter you - some will just watch you curiously, others will wait for reinforcements, and others might even run away.The developers are very active, with times given right in the menu of how long before the next build is released. There is a peaceful game mode, with no cannibals to worry about - this can be useful for helping you get your bearings on the game mechanics.Story time!So there I was, using my axe to open the luggages littered a good distance from the airplane crash. I had scouted and waited for enemy patrols, but saw no one. Since I was trying to open the luggages as quickly as possible, I had been looking down the entire time. I heard the faintest noise, but thought nothing of it. A few minutes later, I hear it again, so I look up (see nothing) and turn around. No sudden music, just a group of 3 cannibals staring at me curiously. I shouted ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥"" in the psychology lab of my school. I rarely shout during horror games.Rage quit story!It was the dead of night.I had been a short distance from my camp chopping down some wood to build my cabin, when I noticed a group of 4 cannibals (one holding a torch) walking toward my camp. I immediately backpedal further into the forest to hide, almost running to a separate duo, one of which had a flashlight fixed to a pole attached to his back (like a lantern banner). I panic and backpedal some more before they spot me, but the lantern-man's ally sees me and rushes to engage.We trade attacks and I am seeing red. I risk a glance to my left and spot the lantern-man rushing toward me. The fighting had caught the attention of the foursome at my camp, and I see them begin walking toward me. It is at this point where my assailant decided to climb up the closest tree.I nope'd right out of there. If you are a survival, horror, open-world, and/or crafting junkie, then get this game and give it a try.Recommend, and be prepared to die and get scared!			"

								Day 1: I realise my plane has crashed, my son is gone, but ♥♥♥♥ him. It's time for an adventure. Later: I start building shelter, for the cannibals, so they can't find me.Day 2: Had a good night, only one cannibal patrol, so I'm good. Made a better axe, using a stick and a rock. It's faster slightly. Later: Killed a couple of attacking Cannibals in self defence. Day 3/4/5/6: I made a better base on the beach, with a head thingy to scare away some cannibals. It's kind of working. I hopeLater: Saw multiple patrols. One ran towards me and I wiped them out. BIGGER SCARING AWAY THINGY.Day 7/8: I'm heading for a cannibal camp. I remember seeing it in the woods. I'm making a small shelter for the night. Later: No one in sight. Day 9: I attacked a camp, killing almost everyone, took some stuff, then got attacked and knocked out by a female cannibal on a tree. I find my self in a cave. WAIT. DON'T KILL ME!! ---Extract Ends Here--- For the real review, that was my gameplay experiance, it was FUN, trust me. The game is suspenseful and requires you to use the most of your equipment and strategies to survive the says and nights, from dying of either natural or being eaten by a crazed foreign cannibal. The graphics are beautiful, especially for an indie game. I haven't got much more to say really. Pros + Beautiful Graphics + Suspenseful Gameplay+ Fun combat + Easy to use Backpack+ Doesn't leave anything unused. Cons - Can be buggy, but I won't let this affect the score since it's EA - A bit of a clunky AI. - Could be more easier to use Crafting system, and it should be able to show you recipes. Overall: This game mixes Survival and Action into a hasteful battle between life and death. As you scour from the beaches to the forest, you are never safe. Be careful, out there, since I think this game is a MUST-BUY 9/10			"

								Only 5 hours in and I think I can give a pretty good review for this.First of... Immersion.I think the gaming experience in this is amazing!The Hunger! The Thirst! How eating doesn't heal you (That much)!I find this to be an amazing experience so far.At first I thought ""man, I'm weak as heck, I died in like one hit"". And then I forgot to save after quitting later.Then I came back and I was like, ""Oh, I can block"", which totally made fighting easier.And also, upgradable tools. Now even though it kind of sounds ridiculous, I like it. Feathers make your axe faster, and teeth make it more damaging. Also, those items can be applied to your weapons using tree sap! Pretty good.Secondly... Horror.Now I'm not sure if anyone would consider this horror, but I really like the whole ""Dark and Alone"" atmosphere. Real spooky guys. Its totally dark.. No flashlight? Well then you're screwed :DIts near pitch black at night and you can't really see much. And that's really cool, personally, I like the dark atmoshere in games. Totally dark and then out of nowhere.. HEY LOOK A PERSON.Its pretty logical that cannibals like that would come out at night for hunting. The only hard part is staying alive without a fire to drive them off. You better light it before you sleep!Also you get the occasional day scouts..And Finally... Survival.Now I'm not going to go into detail because it would be nice for people to try for themselves.But the components of the survival consist of Thirst, Hunger, Cleanliness, and Health.Which each seem equally balanced at the time. Totally legitimate.Anyways, the devs did a great job, and I love this great game.If anyone is in for some good survival, get this, you won't regret it.But hey, don't take it from me, try it for yourself!

								7/10This review takes into account that the game is still in alpha, and subsequently it is pretty buggy including some bugs which may deter people to begin with, for example after saving the game and then leaving the game, and then re-launching i am no longer able to load the game (a copy of the save is non existent), and a few rendering bugs but nothing to get worried about, the only real problem ive had with the game itself so far was the game being more of a choir than an actual enjoyable experience, the enemies are unrealistically hard to kill, you can die from falling a meter or two and the animations are a tad buggy. But this can be forgiven, the graphics are pretty sweet, and the game runs fairly smoothly, considering the forest is only in alpha, the prospects of the game are very promising, i have no doubt that these improvements/tweaks will be made in the forseeable future and the game will develop into an enjoyable and fun experience.

								It is a Open world survival game.In Forest, the player must survive on a forested island after a plane crash during which mutants are seen taking the player's son away. The player survives by creating shelter, weapons, and other survival tools. Inhabiting the island, along with various woodland creatures, are a tribe of nocturnal, cannibalistic mutants who dwell in deep caves beneath the island. While they are not necessarily always hostile to the player, their usual behavior is aggressive, especially during the night..It has best graphics within 900mb.Thanks			"

								I can't recommend this game enough. If you're a fan of survival games such as Unturned and Minecraft, the chances are you'll really enjoy this game. I've so far only managed to set up a small campfire, a rabbit trap and a place to sleep and save my game. Wandering off generally leads to me being assaulted by mutants and dragged off to a cave. The Forest also features frequent updates which have a countdown in the main menu of the game, which seems to be a minimum of an update every 2 weeks. There's also talk of adding co-op to the game which I'm extremely excited for.While I think the game is great, I really can't recommend buying it unless you've got a great gaming PC as it's not very optimized at this stage in development.

								Crashed in plane, forgot within 2.2 seconds I had a child with me.Went chopping trees.Found a nice spot by some water.  Built a tree house.Chopped a lot more trees to build a tall platform to jump on.  Couldn't reach it, fell into campfire where I was cooking lizard meat and caught on fire.Gathered sticks to build a log sled.  Used log sled.Log sled glitched and got stuck to me.Horrifying cannibal tribesman came to my treehouse and watched me flailing about with the log sled stuck on me.  Managed to spook it with my glitchy flailing.Climbed into my treehouse with log sled bouncing around.  Tried to jump onto platform.  Log sled glitch sent me flying 50 feet in the air.Knocked unconscious, woke up in horrifying cannibal tribesman cave with log sled still stuck on me.  Tried to sneak out, log sled flailed around making noise.  Horrifying cannibal tribesmen killed me.10/10 would sled again			"

 This review is for The Forest v0.12. Game Grade:  AShorthand Review:  Survival is not easily achieved.  The Forest will put your survival skills to the test in a frist person experience you will never forget.Detailed Review:I personally recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a realistic survival based game.  The developers of The Forest really show true dedication to the game by their consistent efforts in updating and taking suggestions.  The Forest has different modes you can play which increase the replay value significantly.  With high graphic quality, you are really put into the action at every moment of the game.  For an in Alpha build game, the game play is shockingly smooth and highly entertaining.To start off, I think anyone who has played around with a few early access games has been greatly disappointed with developers who just don't keep up with the game.  With The Forest, there is a very active community with truly dedicated developers.  Updates are released quite frequently ranging from once a week to once every three weeks.  In the updates, you can expect fixes to bugs and new content.  This new content always adds a whole new level of entertainment to the game.  If you feel that you are getting bored with The Forest, then just wait a week or two and you will have a blast with the newly added materials.  The developers truly lure you back into the game each update which allows you to get the most out of your money.Anyone who has played survival games knows that the game is only as good as its replay value.  With The Forest, the replay value is very high.  One reason goes back to what I had said earlier.  The developers are always adding more content.  Not only that but you can play in two different game modes.  The first game mode involves fighting the classic and merciless cannibals which are always trying to take a bite out of you.  Messed up right?  Not as messed as their effigies but I'll keep to my word and keep specific aspects of the game a mystery (unless you have watched it on youtube).  Another way you can play is without the cannibals.  This adds more realism to the game but be aware that playing this mode may get boring after a while.  This mode can be enabled by typing veganmode in the main menu screen (there is no text box to type it in).  I would like to add that The Forest has made a multiplayer aspect to the game which can handle 8 people (recommended max).  With this said, I hope replay value won't be on your mind when you buy the game.The last point I'm going to make about the game are the graphics.  The graphics in The Forest are outstanding.  This truly throws you into full survival mode with this addition to realism.  Don't worry however, the graphics can be lowered sufficiently to meet the needs of slower and older computers.  Laptops are even given a recommended mode so your graphics shouldn't be an issue.   Visual effects may be glitched at times, and as said before, bugs are to be expected.  The bugs will not take away from the game play and are normally fixed in the next update.Overall, I highly recommend The Forest to anyone who enjoys survival based games.  Check out my profile for screenshots of the game.  I hope that you found this review helpful.  If you didn't, I am truly sorry that you spent your time read this.  However, I'm sure this will give you some idea of what you will see in the game.  Feedback is always wanted so if you want to know anything else or think anything should be added, just post a comment.  Again, I hope this has helped you with your decision on buying the game.			"

								If you are looking for a game with an ending, do'n try this. It is a great open-world game, so no ending or plot (at this point). You crashed, you are there... explore, build, eat, drink, fight. No machineguns, no enegery shields, no lightsabers, no world-map with prefined waypoint. Even though there are online maps, you still have to search. Sticks, trees & stones mainly. An axe, simple bow you can make. You are lost, get used to it.Great game!

								The Forest is one of those rare gems, a survival game that actually makes you fight to survive. From the moment you leave the plane crash you are being hunted, yet you do not know it yet. As you leave the plane you have a sense of calm, that you are a lone surviver of a massive crash that should have killed you. Congrats, yet now you have crazed mutant cannibals after you and they do not hold back. What is that you just heard in the trees? Probably a bunch of mutants that want to eat your skin for lunch. There are quite a few things to do so far even though the game is in 0.01 Alpha. You can craft shelter, make fire pits, craft traps to protect yourself, and even make an effigy to ward off they mutants after killing them and harvesting their limbs. Only fair right? Also the game is graphically stunning, with tons of animal life to feast on and tons of trees to chop down. Also the caves are stunning and beautiful yet terrifying to go through with just your lighter.Yet at the same time since it is in Alpha there are quite a few bugs. As of this review you cannot save, so make sure you have a full play through and not invest too much time getting a large camp ready. Also there is a dupe bug that will sometimes cause you to spawn a ton of items around you that you have in your hand. Also sometimes the mutants will not stop coming, and have had up to 50 of them attacking me, which was nuts and fun at the same time. My MOTO score:Graphics: 9/10Gameplay 7/10Story: 8/10 (Story is what you make it to be, so please do not fight me on this score. You are a survivor of a plane crash, the rest is up to you.)			"

								Seriously love the whole survival-exploration theme. Obviously in early stages of development but definitely worth playing, and I'm sure great things can be expected of this game upon full release.Died several times before actually getting anywhere. Mainly by walking into my own campfire. Needless to say, after mutant-proofing my camp; placing deadfall traps, effegies, walls, fires, and two logs away from completing my cabin...upon waking in the middle of the night my camp was plagued by floating mid-air-mutants, which I assumed to be dead. Shooting them with a bow proved only one thing.They weren't.			"

								Loving this game so far, can't wait to see more from this developer. Here's my lets play and full impressions of the game. 


YouTube™ Video: The Forest - Lets Play / Impressions! 

			Views: 222		

			In this Let's Play we pick up a game that was green lit on steam a long time ago and has finally been released in alpha!		

The Forest offers a visually immersive survival experience, with the addition of co-op it would become a staple for survival horrors. The AI are incredibly intelligent and frightening at the same time. There is great attention to detail within the game instead of just a large landscape without any character. Majestic mountains and secret oasis's can be found around the island. There are so many things to find in this game that it makes it worth getting simply for the exploration. This is the first game that I have found in open alpha that hasn't disappointed me, with the exception of contagion. The game is obviously not finished, but it is poised to become an absolutely great game if the little bugs can be fixed. The game is ENTIRELY playable at this point however, I highly recommend purchasing it before the price goes up.			"

								This game is fun and has some good graphics. However, it can get abit boring but they are starting to roll out multiplayer. Multiplayer co-op is in it's first stages, but there is progress. The community is lively and the devs are very co-operative and are always working on updates. So wait a month, maybe two, but i suggest you buy it one day.			"

								I threw a tennis ball at a tree and a lizard fell out.14/10Serious Review ------This game is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥ing spooky. Whenever a mutant starts to stalk you, you will hear a sudden, but quiet piano key. Turn around, and there is a group of them behind you. Stay calm, and back away. The survival aspect of this game is pretty good too. If you are wet and there is no fire, you will freeze to death. A lot of bugs that I found, were fixed with the first update. I fully support this game.			"

								Shortly:The game is amazing, don't mind that it is in Early Access, it's pretty decent, without that MANY bugs.Coop is extremely fun and challenging after you build a decent base, it gets flooded with mutants and what not.			"

								So with the recent update... I've had a bit of fun.Explored around the map looking at the new stuff. Found a gigantic hole in the ground, built a house near it.Sadly, you couldn't jump or see into the whole without having to run and jump off a cliff to get the slightest look at it.Personally, this hole has potential. You could spark up a controversy or it could have some crazy theories behind it. Add some stuff to this massive crater. So far this is my theory...Theory time with /10.So far I've noticed on the plane (when I started a new game on release of the new update) the son had a new drawing. You may ask, what drawing /10? It was a drawing of aliens. As I started exploring I come across this gigantic, hole/crater/volcano, who knows? I looked around and what not but the hole was odly shaped, in a perfect circle. I later on died in my own fire as I got dragged into one of the new caves. I found a drawing that I could pick up. I equipped it and lit my lighter as I looked at the drawing. Looked like a UFO or some sort of spaceship. As soon as I looked at for a few seconds a group of mutants started yelling, I turn to see multiple mutants come around the corner and attack me. Could there be aliens..?			"

								The game is aboslutely stunning, the surroundings around you are so beautiful.Nearly everything in the map of the game is interactive, such as realistic cutting simulations, etc; cutting a tree down will require you to move around the tree, and have you swing your axe at it at a mostly realistic times for the tree to be able to be successfully cut.The game also gives you a feature to not die insantly, instead, get kidnapped to the cannibals cave, we're you can find more items, and weaponary, giving you a better chance of surviving on the island.There are bugs, but that's not a suprise, as this is a public alpha, there are some bugs, such as the constructed tents not able to save the game, the game may sometimes crash, and interacting with other things throughout the map. In the future, this will likely to become fixed, but as for now, it's a really good game that can be enjoyed for the older groups.			"

								The Forest… It just has a menacing undertone to it. It seems anything you apply the noun of the location it seems to give it a type of pristineness, whether admerason or melevilance. The Forest lands on the latter.    The game experience is rather well put together in its current state (pre alpha). But where to start..    The graphics are are ok, to me the shadows will be the focus when in the woods trying to gather resources. The shadows are done well so far, the shadows move with the sun, diminish in the morning and thicken at sun set. I am sure these shadows will be your worst enemy out there in the future updates since this is where those crazy man eaters are hiding, so keep an eye out.Some of the graphics will seem dated in its current form but they do not take away from the horror/suspense.     The sound effects are quality so far, some need improvement. Right now there is a warning song played when an enemy sees you and changes when they enter attack mode. I wish they made more noise when walking and make sounds themselves. I think the music is a good way to know something is watching you but I would prefer to be able to hear them walking, breathing or talking in order to spot these guys but not yet (this kind of takes away the immersion effect). The rest of the sound effects work for the game, from chopping trees down, swimming, walking and jumping, The atmosphere also benefit from the sound design from rainfall to bird songs all give a good level of immersion to the game.     The Animations and models are basic right now. Swing hatchet at randomly chosen native trying to kill you (one of only 4 I see) , repeat. Now there are stronger enemies but they too also only share a few different models. With that said these models (or lack of) do not take away from the game play at all, the models are terrifying in any situation. The firee light and animations are also done well and the light from the fire does get blocked from an object and creates their own shadows. But don't get too close to your fire pit/fire pole or you will be burned. But these also burn the enemies and wildlife too. So place some fires around camp and they help fend off those bad guys.    Overall the game is quite fun so far, tho a bit repetitive on building and crafting (as of now) there are only a few diff buildings you can make and walls to help protect you more will come I am sure, but after a few hours of play you will have built all buildings/traps that you have. So the main question is do you wait for the actual release or is it good enough to play and buy now?? I say buy it!! You will not disapointed in this survival horror game. With updates coming out almost once a month the content coming will keep you interested in the game. Each new start also creates a new starting location or new map (not sure on this part) but each start is a new place so far. Buy it be safe and get to chopping trees!! Its your only hope to survive; BUILD!~n00bz~  rating scale:Graphics (pre alpha) 6/10 Sound/music: 7/10Gameplay: 9/10Replay value: 8/10Glitchiness (not factored in overall): 5/10 (just weird stuff happens at random times)Creep Factor: 7/10Overall pre-alpha:  7.4      Passover or Buy: Buy  "

Early Access Review
								My recommendation comes with a degree of trepidation, as I will explain over the course of my review. I am hoping to give a good and fair critique of the game, in its current state, not what it will be or its potential. As this review is meant to tell buyers about my experience and what they are buying now, as that is very important. Warning there might be some spoilers or what people might consider them in the play throughs so read with care. If you want to just see my break down just skip past them. With that little intro done let me get down to business:First Impression/play through [30~40mins]: OMG it is beautiful, I will say that at first glance when I opened it up I was impressed by the level of detail in everything. The characters were well done, the vibe the forest gives off is perfect, and there is just enough little details that it really makes you feel like you could be in this place. When I had watched the videos of it, I was a bit skeptical of it saying actual play graphics as I have seen that claim in AAA and indies titles with then graphics that are no where near what they said, but this was.At this point I had watched a few videos so I knew the basics of how soon the mutants started to show up after you grab the axe so I took a moment to look around. Though I didn't know that the map was always the same, that only the spawn point and time of day changed, found that out in my second play through. So I quickly gathered the supplies and ran off towards the beach and found the boat, not before I had to hide from a pack of the mutants that were near by. This is was a heart pounding little experience as one mutant looked at me as I hide, before the leader kept going and he was forced to follow along. It was a great little moment, and was one of the best in my first play throughs.After raiding the boat for supplies and finding the spear near by I traveled along the coast looking for a place to call home. About this time I ran across a village and a path to the mountain area, which seems like it will be added later, and avoid another patrol as night began to set in. I quickly made a shelter on a hill and hide/turned off the fire when a group came by. Unfortunately this is about the time in my first play through I ran into the bugs, which broke my great experience with the game.I hid on the hill only to step to far back and begin a glitched slide down the hill, slowly I might add, where I could press ""S"" to slowly stop and walk in place on the hill. After night came and went on this hill I began my slow slide down again and hit the ground slowly, where upon I died and was captured. Which to say the least was a bit upsetting, but I know it is an alpha and bugs are to be expected like this. I then wake up in the cave, a bit freaked out and go to leave, yet alas I fell through the world. Here ends the tale of my first play through.Second Play Through [70~80mins]:After the first play through I decided to give it another go right a way, since I had so much fun and now a bit of experience. This time I started near the start of the day on a very tall hill and immediately went down it, after collect supplies, to see if I should make a base here. Where upon I see the cockpit of the plane right near by, I had a lucky spawn, and managed to pick up the flare gun about 3~4mins after leaving the plane. About this time I also found the surface village of the mutants, with the creepy music, dead people, and lots of tennis balls... They must have a thing for them or something is all I got to say on that.I then feeling full of myself with the flare gun decided to wait and beat these fools at their own game, after raiding the suitcases and making 10 molis as well. I waited for an entire day just kinda of sitting there, running around, and even waited at night and only 3 guys came by, who were easily killed with the infinite glitching flare gun. A small let down to say the least, yet I decided to move on to greener pastures and actually make a home of my own.Moving a distance from their base I found a high cliff boarding the water and knew this is where my home had to be. The view was great, I had a night big tree, and half of my was protected by the environment. So I make my house and the bigger fire for protection as night falls again and I see small lights over a small bump in the land ahead. Luckily I hadn't started the fire and ducked behind a rock as two mutants walked by. This would mark the last time I ever saw them in this play through at about 15~20mins in.After this point I went about setting up traps, learning more about how the game worked, which I don't get farms and took me forever to figure out cooking. It took me so long to get cooking, despite catching rabbits and putting them on the long fire I almost starved. My poor guy in a fit of hunger decided he was going to eat the mutants and thus ran to their base, after eating some mushrooms, and burst into it flares a blazing only to find... no one, again. Though the utter disappointment of this and his hunger finally taught him how to cook as on his return he built a small fire, placed a rabbit, and lit it for 10 secs and the rabbit was done!This is also the point were the game became unplayable as the birds never despawned and what had started as one or two had become a legion of 30 birds hovering around my camp. How I wasn't seen from the birds alone remained a mystery either way he knew it was no longer safe and was time to hunt them down again! He hunted down their cave, despite of the massive lag, popping trees, and motion blur becoming so bad the game turned into green mush, yet still he found it. After beating down the door, navigating the cave that spawned objects 5 feet in front of him, he died in a rock that spawned on him.----The Breakdown----Gameplay [6.5/10]:I am giving it a 6.5 compared to finished games I have played. Compared to other alphas I would say it is a solid 9, far exceeding many of the ones I have played. Graphics [9/10] start -> [0/10] after 80 mins:Okay so the graphics start out great, but then due to a memory leak, them being unoptimized, or some other issue they degrade to a zero, as the game becomes utterly unplayable.Audio [8.5/10]:The sound is perfect and the ambient noises are beautifully chilling and suspenseful. The music for the most part starts fluidly and ends fluidly, aside from the one at the main base which starts nice, but ends abruptly after a certain distance.Ambiance/Immersion [7.5]:The game is great at drawing you in with the audio and graphics, it really makes the forest come alive. I thoroughly enjoyed it, only the bugs and other minor issues really served to break it, which hopefully will be fixed.Controls [6.5/10]:It would also be nice to have some dialog explain it as opposed to me just pushing every button on my keyboard the first time to figure it all out. Maybe have it in the guide after you learn it. So the guide can be used to store actions and things we know?Map [6/10]:Currently I would give the map a 6 out of 10 as I learned it fairly quickly and due to its size. It isn't too big which is nice, but due to the fact that everything is the same learning where to go in the first 10 mins becomes easy.AI [7.5/10]:The AI is amazingly well done, they are smart, stare at you, and have their own little behaviors which you can study and learn. It is a great feeling to dodge them, watch them try to find you if they think they saw you, and generally outwit them. Summery:Overall again I would recommend this game, if you want to help make it better, and enjoy it for what it is. On a personal note I do have problems with the whole early access thing. As you can never be quite sure what you are getting, if it will be finished, or the fact that most are over priced. To me this game was worth my $15.00 and I am glad to support and can't wait to see where it leads!			"

								I have never had so many mini heart attacks in a game before! When I first bought this game I did not expect to enjoy it so freaking much. It was all safe and good at first, just collecting a bunch of food and medicine etc., and me being so focused to hit the luggage right, I hear a creepy laugh and footsteps right behind me and I turn around fast and i jumped when I saw this creepy cannibal staring at me (felt like a staring contest for a minute there xD).At first I thought that they weren't so bad during the day, but boy I was wrong. If you're alone and alot of them surround you, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! xD It's hillarious playing with your friends though. We love throwing tennis balls at eachother and poking eachother with sticks XD. Had alot of fun trying to kill this spider/octopus like creature. Dying, being revived, friend dying too, both dead, wake up in the plane, run for our stuff, run around more and scream, the creature kills us again, waking up, burning that motherforker to death finally! xDOverall, it's a really great game! You will have alot of spots to explore, creatures that will make you scream, the map is huge so you'll never get bored. I recommend it to everyone, cause it comes with the whole package: survival, scary, alot of fun. 10/10 ♥P.S.: If you don't want to get motion sickness, make sure your motion blur is deactivated and lower your mouse sensitivity!

								THE BEST HORROR SURVIVAL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!! 10/10I will break my review down into pros and cons.. starting with cons which is nothingCons: Why is this game in Alpha? It literally seems perfect to me as far as optimization and content, Pros:Music- not much music, but the menu theme and when cannibals are close really sets the moodGraphics- very nice graphics, simple yet appealing, 60+ frames all the time. i'm running a GTX 770 with VSync enabled. Without Vysnc I literally run 200+ FPS, but I prefer my GPU to be stable and not overwork itself which is why I leave VSync on.Gameplay- Outstanding, The crafting system is perfect compared to other survival games. This game doesnt require a billion materials to make anything. you can make anything you want at your fingertips pretty much. Also suprisingly to me the story is good.. just a plane crash on a deserted island with cannibal/skinwalkers on it. The cannibals can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times and they can be very ♥♥♥♥ing scary.. like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. I've played Outlast and other horror games.. but the cannibals in this game can be very terrifying (mainly in their numbers and how they appear so randomly).**NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS**When you first start playing this game.. get away from the plane crash ASAP. The faster you get away from the plane and toward the beach the better, So far I have started a new game 5 times to test some things and i found that the beach is the best spot and the quicker you get away from the plane crash, the more time you have to build your base up.

								Even though this game has many bugs, it is still a very playable and enjoyable game. I'm really excited for the new patch that is coming out, I cannot wait to see what fixes they do and what they add.Here are a few things to know about the game before you purchase it:-This game is in Alpha, which means that it is not even remotely close to being finished.-There are many bugs, especially in co-op mode. It is still playable, especially if you're patient enough.-You can only have ONE save right now. If you start a new game and save and you had a game going previously, you will lose your other save.-There are terrain bugs that will make it hard to do certain things (ie trees that are growing out of large rocks can be impossible to chop down)-The sunlight is obnoxiously bright at times and will make it a lot harder to see anything because it darkens anything around it if you're facing it (I'm hoping they fix this eventually because it can be a real pain)-This game is totally worth buying. It has nothing but potential to be an amazing game.			"

								This game is so amazing. I cant be expected to give in detail, all the awesome and hilarious things you can do in this game. Theres ""mutants""(A.K.A savages) on the island. They are AI'd really well, and are believeable as well as creepy. Graphics are GREAT! The building kicks♥♥♥♥♥as well, sure it takes some time to learn; But soon you'll be building 2nd story houses out of cool and weird geographical formations ect. The crafting is cool and very unique as well. BUT over all this game is FUNNNN. Co-op Makes this game 2x as good with a friend. The island is huge and has tons of hidden locations as well a sights to be seen. This game is still in developement but always gets an update every month. Its capability to run at this state in time(this alpha 0.22 patch) is great. Some people dont like to play alpha games for many reasons, but there isnt any for this game. It WORKS. Unlike a ton of other alpha games, this game is almost ready to be fully released. WAY better of a game to than Stranded Deep.  11/10 Recommended			"

								Do you like chopping down trees and collecting leaves from bushes? Do you like carrying up to five rocks at any given time? Do you often wish you could chop a monitor lizard with an axe and wear its shimmering hide? Do you want to be surrounded by groups of native mutant tribesman that stare at you threateningly before rushing you with makeshift weapons and ultimately drag your unconscious body away? Do you wish you could wake up in a dark cave surrounded by the corpses of fellow non-natives with only a Bic lighter to light your way out of an intricate system of tunnels with deadly drops hidden in the dark? Do you like mutant tribesman climbing trees to spy on you after you've escaped their cave, all while you grill rabbit in a rainstorm near a hastily made leaf leanto? Do you often dream of taking revenge on previously mentioned mutant-tribesman-kidnap-voyeurs and ripping them limb from limb with your monitor lizard axe before posting their severed heads, arms, and legs on pikes to decorate your campsite in a show of glorious bloodlust victory? If you answered yes to these questions, you should play the Forest, because you can do all of those things. You can also stab fish with spears: the way a real man goes fishing.			"

								The Forest is gorgeous for being in alpha stage. It is one of the things that initially attracted me to this game besides a promising storyline for single player. Lately, the community is demanding a lot with co-op gameplay so it seems like each time the devs release an update the majority of it is dealing with co-op. I'm not complaining, I like playing with others but I would also like to see some major things being done with single player and building and crafting. Right now there is a limited amount of things to do as far as crafting and building and exploring and once you've done everything there's nothing really left to do but get creative and build a bigger, more elaborate base. I hope to see them open the map, add more things to craft and build, basically add more things to do, objectives, storyline, creepier caves, more monsters, etc. I'm really looking forward to the finished product. I've never gotten excited about a game like I am about this one.			"

								One of the best games I have ever played. Constantly being upgraded and evolving. Beautiful graphics. Overall this game is on another level from all other survival games. The greatest thing about this game is it's use of the dark. When it's dark it is really dark. You can't see your hand infront of your face. This is usually followed by a scream in the distance as they come for you.I cannot over-sell it. This game is truly beautiful and terrifying.I found that the game started to stagnate for a short while, but then I realized it was because I was too afraid to explore. This game can be so terrifying you don't want to leave you base. You just want to stay alive. You won't. Once you get better you will for some solid stretches of time, but eventually they find you. Save often. Once you get over your fear of venturing out into the world, and grow a pair enough to start going down into the caves the game really comes to life...and the real terror begins. This game is amazing.Sadly my game has somehow glitched this time not allowing me to pick up the rebreather. I can find it and pick it up, but it will not enter my inventory. I have survived nearly 80 days and built multipe large encampments. This rebreather issue limits where I can go so I will likely have to start over.Here is the thing...this game is so good I don't really mind. As you learn in the game and explore your working knowledge improves so much your survival skills increase. You build smarter. You farm resources more efficiently. You become a better killer. No mutants will stop me. I will rule this island. This game is worth every penny.			"

								The forest...I waited for this game to play for a while, because on release it was a little buggy and the game has come a very long way since then. So on that note, let's get this done quickly!Graphics: The graphics are very very good, push it to the max and enjoy some very nice detailing and meshing with a great atmosphere. It also plays super smooth. Audio: The audio is very well presented offering some real in depth feeling from the forest or the crazy people's. Controls: Super easy to get ahold and master, seriously no complaint at all, pickup and go. Game: You crash land on the nicest plane crash ever, seriously watch it and it feels and looks so relaxing just a little bumpy... There is a few crazy people who are dangerous and thankfully the game has coop so you can play with friends and save it, so you both can return another time which is cool. Sadly you can build a fort super quick and survive, but the game does not have much things to actually build though it seems. My friend and I built a big fort in under an hour and ran out of things to do because we built it all... Can be done very fast with two, so we set off on the hunt for the locals to kill, they are crazy and some are hard to defeat. DO NOT VENTURE IN CAVES ALONE, some advice because creates lurk and are hard as hell Devils. There is other things to do, go hunting, exploring (then getting lost easy so set a base marker is best way) and doing a few other bits and bobs but otherwise building is limited to barely any. I love survival games, so added the great details, coop and beautiful surrounds and nice feature then this game is a win. Would I recommend? Yes in seconds.			"

								Journal Entry 1 After the plane crash happened, I awoke to see a weird tribal man while bearly conscious. After awakening again I decided to put my serious cap on. I quickly looted everything from the plane. I jumped out of the plane and started gathering all the resources I could. After a few minutes I went straight into the forest.Journal Entry 2 I found a large rock wall face, ""perfect!"" I exclaimed to myself. I logged some trees down and made a small hut to sleep in. After I had finished I had something catch the corner of my eye and pretty far off I saw three sprinting bodys quickly vaninshing through the trees. I quickly hatched a plan. Journal Entry 3  I went off closer to where they were and made a small fire. I ate some rabbit tasted very good. I made note to myself there was a small pond I could maybe gather fish from later. I had gathered some rabbits and lizard skin preparing for the worst. I quickly ran back to my small hut which could still see the fire and after a few minutes of watching my plan had succeeded.Journal Entry 4 They had all gathered around the fire. I took this chance to go around and on top of the rock wall to get a better look at them. After getting to the top and walking for a little. I realized I was to high up and the trees were blocking my ability to see them. I thought maybe I could get closer and see them looking down the hill. Journal Entry 5 It's dark I thought to myself, and maybe I should go back. But then I saw what looked like to be a flashlight aiming up towards me blocked by a couple trees. I panicked and ran down the hill away from the light source, towards the fire I had made recently. I heard multiple screeches right behind me along with the light aiming at me. Journal Entry 6 I had just made it to the fire, I got behind it. They were screaming and hollering at me a few meters away, scared of fire are we? I started getting extremely confident and started getting closer to the three of them. They started trying to make me run by running at me then stopping. I wasn't falling for it, they surrounded me, I didn't care I stared at the middle one which I assume was the chieftain.Journal Entry 7 I watched him lunge toward me, keeping my clam, I sidestepped and smashed my axe across his face blood splattering all over my arms. I retreated behind the fire and laughed as the Chief full of rage, full on sprinted towards me and stepped in the fire and caught on fire. He started hollering, with his allies just watching me. Journal Entry 8The Chieftan collaspsed presumably dead. I had inadvertently gained more confindence and charged at the other male and swung my axe into him. Making him stagger backwards at the same time the female lunged at me but missed, I took this chance to run back behind the fire. I got behind the fire just in time to see him running at me with rage. Journal Entry 9He stumbled into the fire and caught fire, after he dropped to the ground. The female made a loud screech and sprinted away from me. I saw a flashlight beam in the opposite direction of where the female went. With my newfound technique of killing them, I boldly went towards the light beam with my bloody axe.Journal Entry 10I had easily gotten their attention and started sprinting back towards the fire. Only to see the female who had ran off brought back friends. I could feel my confidence depleteing. I got to the fire and was surrounded by three groups of three and maybe that female that ran off, I could not tell when there is nine of them surrounding me. Journal Entry 11In my mind I was smashing the panic button repeatedly, but was able to calm myself a little by forcing myself to breath slower and deeper. I was running around the fire to ""try"" avoiding them to hit me in the back, which was sort of working but also making myself dizzy. Journal Entry 12They all started getting bold and started to close down on me, as the adrealine flowed through me, all the sound drowned out and I started lashing out randomly with my axe while running around the fire in circles not touching it once astoundingly. I was smashing faces left and right while getting hit a few times. A couple of them fell in the fire, I think I had killed a few with my axe. Journal Entry 13I think there was only a couple left, I still felt great. But all of a sudden I got hit and blacked out.I awoke in a cave with my head hurting, I luckily still had my lighter for light and gathered everything down here. I had ate some snacks and rested a little bit. I started up the cave and took a turn and found some weird books and candles. Journal Entry 14I kept going down the cave and found a mutant monstrosity that was absoutly revolting with mutilated bodys put together.It seemed to not notice my presence and I got right next to it. I was stricken with curosity and went in front of it. I'm not sure if it ever made a noise, but that was the last of my vison.10/10Al			"

								Almost two hours in the game and I absolutely love it. You start off on a crashed jet plane filled with sodas, rags and food. As you proceed towards the exit of the plane you pick up a hatchet that was stabbed in a flight attendent's chest. While you are outside there's luggages that are locked but you can break them open with your hatchet and there's also rabbits and lizards which can be used as a food source later on. But make your decisions quick and get the hell out of there because the mutants will ambush you and scare the hell out of you and kidnap you (what they did to me). Assuming that you got out of the area alive, you have to find a place you find fit for shelter (I prefer the coast because you can see your surroundings better). Your survival book is a HUGE help, look through it in order to build fires to cook your food and keep you warm. But be careful cause they're watching! Only cons are the bugs, the bugs are noticeable as soon as you start playing. I'm not going into specifics cause there are too many bugs to name one by one. But then again it is a Pre-Alpha Build so you can't quite judge it yet.Overall, this game is an amazing survival/horror game. It's definitely worth the price. I see lots of potential and I expect this game to be huge once it's finished. Completely recommend to anyone who loves a good survival game!			"

								An alpha game that is already worth the money it costs, with excellent features, devs that regularly update the game (one update every 15 to 25 days) and who listen to the players and teh community.The bugs at this version 0.14 are not too many or too gamebreaking, and quite tolerable, plus they usually get fixed in one or two updates time, while a larger gamebreaking bug IF one occurs (rarely) gets fixed with a hotfix in 2-3 days.The gameplay is awesome, with the only thing thats puts you off (just a little bit) is the many trees you have to chop down, but only if you are the creative huge base - building player. The enemies are pretty smart, give you a natural feeling with the way they act (travelling at packs, checking out noises they hear, women freak out if a patrol/family member dies etc.)Caves provide extra horror, with stronger mutant enemies that can kill in one blow, while offering prety good loot to gather (cassetes, booze even a flare gun), making the player to go cautiously tempted by the loot inside but fearing for his life on the other hand.The structures and the building are pretty diverse, with new things added almost every update, the crafting is also very nice.Overall a very enjoyable game, very much worth the money it costs, definitely worth getting.

Early Access Review
								The Forest is a great sandbox survival horror although it is still very much a work in progress. I have reviewed this for it's current state of play, regardless of being an early access/alpha title.Survival - Starting with nothing but an axe you have to explore the island in order to scavenge materials, forage for food and medicine, hunt for food and animal skins and find a means of collecting clean drinking water. But beware, this island is inhabited by very aggressive mutant cannibals who pray to the natures of the forest and become very hostile as you ravage it. Right now it is very easy to survive the island with food and water being abundant and easy to acquire but the developers are slowly increasing this difficulty for the recently added hard mode.Crafting - You can build a selection of structures and contraptions to help you create a base camp, including water collectors, sleds for easy transport of construction materials, wall defenses, traps, rafts, houseboats and more. You can craft a variety of primative weapons like spears, a club, stone axe and bow as well as armors made from animal skins or even your enemies bones. There are also make shift weapons that you can create out of more modern technology that you scavenge across the island like molotov cocktails, bombs and sticky bombs. Every crafting recipie is instantly accessible to you and materials are easily found, so you will quickly craft most of the things you need throughout the game.Building - Housing is completely customisable with custom foundations, walls and roofing although there is the option to place pre-built blueprints for smaller cabins, tree houses, temporary shelters, tall platforms, gazebos and more which can be used in creative ways to modify your base. Custom housing materials consist only of wooden logs though stick, stone and bone walls and fences can also be used to customise buildings a little further. Although there isn't any real purpose to creating large bases, it is there as an option for people to satisfy thier creativity.Caves - Caves are visually stunning yet dark and suspenseful areas to explore, you will find story related objectives here as well as useful weapons and survival items that can only found within the caves. Some caves must be explored before others in order to acquire the items needed to progress. Caves are not very threatening in the current state of the game though and only 2 items found in the cave are really necessary for survival purposes.Combat - The enemies in the game are mutant cannibals and some distorted horrors like a mutant with multiple sets of arms or a spider like female. Combat is very basic in the current stage of development but is balanced enough to create a good threat on hard mode to the single player. The game lacks any appropriate difficulty adjustments for multiple players though, so games with 3+ players may find the combat difficulty becomes quite easy. Enemies don't progressively get harder and harder throughout the entire game, so once you reach a certain point the game difficulty will stop increasing.Sieges - There really isn't any variety to defending your base against enemy attacks. Enemies are not unique in the way they assault your base and simply bash against your walls or gates as you pluck them off with arrows or lead them out into the open and fight them away from your walls as once distorted enemies are in your walls your base can quickly lose important foundations which can cause an entire base to collapse losing many hours of work and leaving no way of accurately restoring the fallen sections. Most destroyed sections must be rebuilt from scratch, leaving no blueprint behind for easy and accurate reconstruction.Diet and exercise - The game has an interesting way of increasing your characters stats through weight, diet and exercise. It is quite complicated and not very well explained in the game but I have written a guide on the way it all works and how to get the most gain from it. I strongly suggest reading up on this before your stats go too far negative and it becomes very hard to recover them.Things I enjoy about this game:Beautiful graphics and very atmospheric through sound.Primitive survival combining only items that you can scavenge.Attempts to take a realistic approach, where fun permits.A very tense and suspenseful experience at first due to the horror elements.Hard mode is being worked on right now (Thankfully because normal mode is extremely easy).Things I dislike about this game:Surviving is far too easy. Food and water is abundant and only raw and cooked meats will actually spoil.Health recovery items are instant, which promotes 'chugging' during combat to instantly fill your health.Only 2 spawned loot items are actually needed for optimal survival and construction across the island. The items are both unguarded and always spawn in the same location which makes them too easy to acquire leaving nothing worth searching for.No interesting base siege mechanics. Enemies simply bash on your walls and gates until they get inside.All distorted horror enemies essientially act like the same type of enemy, with minimal difference in attacks.No appropriate difficulty adjustments for multiple players.AI pathfinding and inability to traverse water leaves enemies generally unable to get to the player if the player chooses, removing any threat from the game.Hunting is easy and as simple as running up to the animals and giving them 1 accurate poke with your spear. Rabbits, lizards, raccoons and animals of similar size can be killed by throwing a stone at them (which comes with an aiming reticle, unlike throwing the spear which is supposedly meant for hunting). Animals don't get spooked by sound and only flee once the player has ran right up to them.Caves are not utilized much apart from for story. They are mostly bare of enemies, lacking the enemy spawns and patrols that you get outside of caves.Cannibal villages exist but are empty, lacking any cannibal life or activity. They only increase patrol spawns in the area.No dedicated servers.No anti-cheat to stop people entering your game with cheat mods.If you intend on buying this for the gaming experience without the intent of helping the development progress and/or bug reporting, I would suggest avoiding the title until it reaches beta stage. If you want more on the survival, combat and progression side of the game as opposed to just being able to construct creative bases, wait it out also.It's a fun game, I do like it, but too many features are missing right now to recommend it.

Early Access Review
								I don't buy early access games often but in case of The Forest I've made an exception. The idea behind the game is truly great and it's partially (since it's still in alpha stage) well executed. I should also mention the development team which provides patches with bug fixes and upgrades restless every month.But despite their effort, the game is still under heavy construction which leads often to crashes, FPS drops and countless WTF moments. I'm sure that in the further development, the creators would be able to bring more sophisticated game experience, but in the current stage I can recommend it only to people willing to participate in an alpha test on their own risk.P.S. - The latest patch 0.06 completely removed presence of the first cannibals so I spent few days fighting the tribe of naked women. Please balance this.Also, the thing that pisses me off most is the endless count of tennis balls in the game. WHY? I'm spending hours trying to get rid of them, cause they're absolutely useless. Please, development team, reduce the number of them! "

								So you purchase a plane ticket to go to Aruba to have a good time. You purchase your tickets on a cheap airline in order to save money because you are a cheapskate. When you get seated on the plane the stewardist seats an annoying 5 year old next to you. He screams kicks and bothers the heck out of you for 3 hours until you hit intense turbulence. The airplane crashes. A mutant takes the kid and you rejoice as you are free from the little demon. It is that moment that it hits you, you left your sink on at home. At that moment you decide its time to put on your big man pants and try to get off the island you crashed on.			"

								My plane went down and it appears as if I'm the only survivor... I had a child. Forget his name already. He may still be alive. Some naked guy took him. Not my problem. I've rummaged through all of the luggage and managed to find this pen and paper. I guess I'll keep a journal. Day 1 - Some more crazy naked people scared the living jesus out of me, I started to build a shelter in a nice little spot, but had to abandon it. I heard terrifying sounds and bolted. Did not look back. I ran until I couldn't run anymore. I've come to a beach with a few cargo containers kicking around. Looks like a good spot. Tonnes of stuff to loot, including what looks like an old campsite... but the tents are still up. Nobody else is around. Half built my crappy little shelter, got a fire going and put some delicious lizard on it to cook up. Going to go grab some logs before the sun comes up. Day 2 - I was out of camp a little longer than expected... I had my two logs up on my shoulder and was nearing my camp when something caught my eye, some shadows moving IN my campsite. I dropped my logs and got out my axe, and started running towards it. The two shadows left as quickly as they had come. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s took my cooked lizard. (Or I left it on the fire too long) either way. I was not a happy camper. I finally managed to build my hunting shelter though. I see a log cabin in the book... going for that next because why not. Day 3 - I was out cutting down trees when I heard a terrible sound behind me. Two naked guys were there staring at me. Judging me. Hating me. I ran. Screw the logs. I did find a sweet skull on the ground while running though. Grabbed it. Got back and made a skull club. They didn't follow me. That day. Tonight they came up on my camp again. I SWEAR it is the same two stalking me this whole time. I've named them. One is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the other is Jimmy. Jimmy got too close... I didn't mean to I swear... but I had to bash his skull in. Jimmy ran off... Day 4 - Dear god. There is definitely more than two this time... Six? Maybe seven.... They're all out there around my camp. Running around all crazy like.... It's time to make a stand. (The journal seems to stop there) 11/10   Such a fun game! And in early access? Definitely worth the 20ish$			"

								I have played many of hours of The Forest so its about time I did a review for the game. The Forest is a Alpha game at this current time I have been playing and following since Alpha 0.01. The games updates are always so fun to see, its almost like playing a new game every update I love that about it.The game has a different style of building compared to most games making it innovative. the AI of the cannibals can be so funny and scary at times making for a good mix. Being a Alpha game it will have bugs but the Developers always fix as many as possible each and every update. Probably the best part about the game is the ability to just jump in and PLAY no inventory sorting or thing that slow down the gameplay like that.This was the first ""real"" PC game I played (I use to be only a console gamer) and I had no problem figuring out the controls and such was very easy to learn and play.

If the devs invest on the variety of crafting, buildings and little things you might do on game apart of the mutants, and with a good story, it may give you long hours of entertainment.

YouTube™ Video: The Forest: Early Impressions 

			Views: 421		

			The Forest: Early Impressions Recorded on V0.01 We take a look at ""The Forest"" the latest in survival horror available on steam's Early Access.		

Above is my video impressions of the gameThe forest is an early access that is full of promise. The game looks great for such an early stage, with realistic visuals, and a large open world. Though it's enjoyable even at this point of the development cycle, it still has some rough edges to smooth over. The game's survival is really about exploring than any thing else at the moment. If you expect a fully complete and polished game, you might want to wait for future updates. But if you're willing to buy into potential, the Forest is full of that (and hungry hungry cannibals.Pros:- Great looking graphics- Awesome ""wood chopping"" effects- Almost all foliage is intractable / destructible- Large open world to discover- Freaky mutated cannibals are freakyCons:- Still feels incomplete- Wood falling effect a bit wonky- Not much Narrative in current version			"

								If you are looking for a complete, brutal survival game, you sir, are looking in the wrong place. Dont get me wrong, this is not a horrible game that isn't worth your money. If you're a fan of early access games, and you don't mind waiting for the next update (which comes rather fast with this development team), this is worth the time and money spent. This is a game that is progressing, bit by bit, and will easily shape in to a great, semi-realistic survival experience. This game is totally worth playing, though i only recommend this to people who enjoy watching a game make progress.			"

								Innocently went about my business...built a fire, a hunting shelter, ate a few mushrooms. Brief encounters with natives that ended in simple staring contests left me feeling empowered. Started work on a cabin, all was well. But then..... disaster. Hostile natives came at me from all directions, even the trees. As I fended them off with my trusty axe I could feel the strain of combat taking its toll on my body, but I had gone this far and there were only two natives left. I could do this. I could claim this land as my own. They had taken my child and kidnapped me to show me their horrific ways. No more. I would eradicate this evil from my home. I turned to swing my axe. I was met by a club to the arm, I had miscalculated their speed! I staggered back, my armor gone. The native came in for another attack, this time to my chest. I braced for impact. His club hit me with unimaginable power. I felt my chest cave in and my skin burn as I was catapulted at supersonic speeds above the forest in which I had crashed. And then, just as the plane that had brought me here had, I crash landed on the other side of the map.10/10 would be catapulted again.			"

								Despite its cannibals, The Forest delivers a survival experience that feels more real than many other similar games.

It's largely playable currently, but you might want to wait a bit for the creators fix some bugs and glitches.			"

								This game is lovely. The crafting system is deep and satisfying. The atmosphere is forboding, and when it choses, The Forest can be legit scary. The devs seem like good eggs - the game receives very regular updates, issues and bugs are quickly addressed, and improvements always exceed expectations. I could details some of the frustrations I have had, over my hours with The Forest, but the vast majority were already addressed by the developers in recent patches. In particular, the recent graphical overhaul is substantial and welcome improvement to presentation. Spearing fish is neat. Chopping down trees is weirdly satisfying. The mutants are hella f'd up.There's really only one problem with The Forest, as I see it - the game is still in Early Access, and will be for the foreseeable future - so I have to avoid putting in too many hours, so that the final build feels somewhat fresh.tl;dr - game is good, devs seem good, you should buy.

Early Access Review
								A very mysterious and immersive game that is very different to other bog-standard survival titles out there. Don't boggle about it being an early access game, which normally have bad reputations.It's an adventure which you can either contest alone, or with some friends.It can be scary when you play alone though. Being alone at night in a forest full of cannibals and monstrosities, while hearing disturbing sounds in the distance still sends chills down my spine.Building is one of the most realistic I've seen in games. It requires realistic amounts of materials, for example a woodhouse constisting of 80 logs, really requires 80 logs to build. The survival aspect, as in eating and drinking, is not annoying nor difficult. It just adds to the immersion of the game.The combat is standard, not too clunky but also not very complex. You run to your enemy and swing your axe at them.The missing crosshair while shooting a bow bothered me in the beginning. But I got used to it and probably find it better now not having it there, adding another difficulty in combat.The AI is the interesting part of this game. The cannibals don't act like usual monsters, just running towards you while attacking. They feel like they have their own personality. When they spot you they stand still, looking confused as who you are. They act passive and run around you until they realize what danger you are (or how good your flesh smells). They help their injured allies and always scavange around the island in groups. Their behaviour makes you realize that they are just inhabitants of the island, holding together to protect their property.If you are looking for an unique experience with beautiful and optimized graphics, I definitely recommend The Forest.

I managed to find two trays of food however, which some ♥♥♥♥ing way, did not exit the aircraft upon splitting in two. I exited the white, shiny aircraft to be greeted by Sharnisha's captors and got ♥♥♥♥ed up by their stones attatched to sticks. Day 2: I woke up in a strange cave upon which was very dark. When I flicked on my light, I was startled by many hanging bodies and limbs. I walked around the dimly light cave until falling under the earth where limbs were seperated into a vortex of the unknown, and then there was darkness... and a red screen saying I survived 2 days.

								This game runs perfectly on my geforce 740 M laptop. It is brilliantly optimised. It is gorgeus , the graphics are stunning, the   sound of the wind, the trees, the water everything makes you feel like it is real. Then there are the canibals and the mutants: an unbelivably smart Ai that will freeze your heart in terror, wherever you are, you are always tense about being attacked. Sure, there isn't much content atm, but considering the effort that was put into it so far makes me very optimistic that this will become an amazing game in its final form. I was not one to enjoy survival games before, I can safely say that it was The Forest that got me hooked. Now it's all I look for lol.			"

								Three goes I gave this game, and each and every time I was at least entertained.  On my first attempt, I was struck by ungodly lag. After witnessing a child being taken away, I awoke to find myself on a plane. I chowed down on everything I could find on the plane and set out to find a tree to conquer.Twas then that I stumbled upon a tribe of happy locals, ready and willing to show about the island on a wonderful and exciting running tour, which ended in my falling over a cliff edge. It was in that time that I noticed just how nice the graphics are.The locals must have noted my fall, as they took me to an underground dwelling where they had tied up all of the other passengers on the plane, probably to keep them from getting sick from the water on the cave floor.Soon after I died, as it was too dark to see where I was going. The light I thought was the exit was a friendly local who beat me back to safety.I lasted 2 days.Attempt number 2 went a little better. I found an axe and set out to take down a tree again, but the lords of clipping failed me and I fell over another cliff. See attempt one for details.Attempt number 3;I was wise to the locals by this point. After devouring the plane, taking the axe and heading towards the best looking water I could find, I landed upon a beach. There was a dead local who I put to rest by blowing him apart, a tent with a stick I used to stab things, and plenty of beer.I found a tree to conquer, but the locals must have come back for their friend, as they were waiting for me. I immediately hit legs, hoping they had not noticed me. I was not being chased so I imagined I was fine.I found a boat and thought it would be a great place to hide, as these friendly locals did not seem to have a swimming school set up anywhere.Night fell and all was peaceful, but I was definitely wrong about the swimming lessons. The locals swam out to assist me off the boat, but I refused and ran as fast as possible after exiting the boat.It began raining as I reached safety, and I was told that I needed to start a fire. I had all of the things I needed but leaves, so I promptly froze to death in a small, premade hut that I think belonged to a local.All in all, hard but fun. I enjoyed the tense feeling right the way through and look forward to future editions of the game.			"

Early Access Review
								A very mysterious and immersive game that is very different to other bog-standard survival titles out there. Don't boggle about it being an early access game, which normally have bad reputations.It's an adventure which you can either contest alone, or with some friends.It can be scary when you play alone though. Being alone at night in a forest full of cannibals and monstrosities, while hearing disturbing sounds in the distance still sends chills down my spine.Building is one of the most realistic I've seen in games. It requires realistic amounts of materials, for example a woodhouse constisting of 80 logs, really requires 80 logs to build. The survival aspect, as in eating and drinking, is not annoying nor difficult. It just adds to the immersion of the game.The combat is standard, not too clunky but also not very complex. You run to your enemy and swing your axe at them.The missing crosshair while shooting a bow bothered me in the beginning. But I got used to it and probably find it better now not having it there, adding another difficulty in combat.The AI is the interesting part of this game. The cannibals don't act like usual monsters, just running towards you while attacking. They feel like they have their own personality. When they spot you they stand still, looking confused as who you are. They act passive and run around you until they realize what danger you are (or how good your flesh smells). They help their injured allies and always scavange around the island in groups. Their behaviour makes you realize that they are just inhabitants of the island, holding together to protect their property.If you are looking for an unique experience with beautiful and optimized graphics, I definitely recommend The Forest.

								I have played many of hours of The Forest so its about time I did a review for the game. The Forest is a Alpha game at this current time I have been playing and following since Alpha 0.01. The games updates are always so fun to see, its almost like playing a new game every update I love that about it.The game has a different style of building compared to most games making it innovative. the AI of the cannibals can be so funny and scary at times making for a good mix. Being a Alpha game it will have bugs but the Developers always fix as many as possible each and every update. Probably the best part about the game is the ability to just jump in and PLAY no inventory sorting or thing that slow down the gameplay like that.This was the first ""real"" PC game I played (I use to be only a console gamer) and I had no problem figuring out the controls and such was very easy to learn and play. Reminds me of my childhood playing in the woods building forts and exploring the unknown I will always hold this game close to my heart for these reasons.10/10 For the Alpha have and would recommend			"

								This game is great, really great. The survival aspects of the game are amazing, having to consider cold, heat, food, water. Everything you in reality would have to keep in mind when surviving. It's pretty realistic (if you ofcourse don't count the cannibals trying to come at you and drag you off.)I can really reccomend this game, especially if you plan on playing it with a friend. They put in a few things in the game about a patch or two ago where you can now basically ""trade"" food/drinks/meds. Which makes working together a LOT easier. Playing in groups is great, and building bases surrounded by walls. Farms, traps, breed rabbits (Which I haven't seen working properly yet, but they are still develloping the game.)There are some sound errors here and there, but they don't occur that often. They work hard to fix the bugs as fast as they possibly can and add in more items to use in game. All in all it's a lot of fun with it's hard and scary moments.EDIT:When playing multiplayer (which I do a lot)As a host, my co-player doesn't deal with thirst or cold. At all. I don't know if Devs have said anything about this. Or if any information on this at all is available.EDIT2:Birds still land and rest mid-air. Friggen hilarius.			"

								WARNING: ALPHA REVIEW!!Well, from what I've played of this game so far it shows a lot of promise for an early access title. It is by no means complete at this point, but what it has right now is quite good. The AI is functional and can be downright unnerving at times. I've encountered several situations where the enemies would just climb trees and watch me, rather than trying to fight me. After about an hour of playtime, you start to realize the kinks and bugs with the game and enemies no longer become a problem once you know how to deal with them. There isn't a whole lot to do yet, and in just a few hours you can pretty much accomplish everything there is and not have much left to do other than occaisonally collect food.As of right now, this game is definitely worth buying so that you can influence it's growth and development and help shape it into a better game for everyone.8/10			"

								Considering buying this? Well, here's why I think you should.The Forest is an Open World survival game where It's You vs Cannibals & Nature. You must scavenge for food, water, and supplies. Gather as much wood, sticks, rocks, and anything else you can find before night comes. During the night your primary goal is to survive the waves of cannibals, without dying. Pretty simple objectives. You can choose to play online, join forces with your friends (or strangers), and build massive bases and fight off the waves of cannibals. Or you can choose to play solo and face all the challenges alone, which in my eyes, is alot harder & more challenging. Playing with online is an amazing feature because It alows you and your friends to co-op and try to survive together. You guys can discuss base plans and survival tactics, and you can fight along side them, making you a virtually impossible team to stop. It's awesome, I recommend playing with friends HIGHLY. Also, I've met some great friends just by joining random servers, which is also where you can get some great help. Building is completely custom. You can build anything, anywhere. The Graphics are great, the world is absolutely beautiful, and the goal is plain and simple: Survive.With all this being said, the game is only gonna get better, considering that it is still in early alpha. So if you aren't Intrigued yet, then I don't know what else will work.Graphics 9/10Gameplay: 10/10AI: 7/10Online: 9/10OVERALL: 9/10I hope this has helped your decision!			"

								Upated as of v0.03    Well the game is coming along, although a bit slow.  Overall, they have addressed a few issues that people ahve had, while adding more stuff.  Obviously they cant't address every issue because this is alpha and they should worry about critical issues, and just adding stuff without breaking anything too badly.   For now, they have made a peaceful mode, which is great for those wanting something a bit tamer.   They are slowly adding more things to build, visuals are tweaked, and new things are added in the game itself.  However, there are still some issues with it that are annoying as hell, but are not THAT important.  The only thing Im worried about, is the length between updates.  I wouldnt mind shorter waits for small updates, while waiting longer for larger ones.   But time will tell.   I still look forward to this, but it will take some time before things are anywhere near completeEDIT:  as of  april 2017, this game has improved on a lot of things while adding a solid amount of things to do in the game.  While it is still a WIP and the updates are slow, they are working at improving the game and are doing a good job at it.  A full story is added as well, and a creative mode is added too.  However, this game is better played together with someone since farming items takes a while and co-op is just, better peroid.    Performance-wise, its still demanding but can be tweaked in a lot of ways.			"

Even with a few crash/bug issues I give this game 10/10. I so hope they add even more craftables items and do so with out messing up the feel and play of the game, I also hope they add more stuff to do and explore inside snow part of island and the ability to add things to inventory slot 1- 10. I WANT MORE!!!! DLC, patshes , free or paid IDC. Base building is fun and mutants are relentless. This is the mondern day Robinson Crusoe Game I have been waiting for.. If you liked the show LOST you will love this game. When I first got the game I built a base and messed around alittle and I thought I will prob play this game a few hrs and be done with it then a friend asked me if I had been in the caves yet....

								Great Game my friends and I have played together co-op is amazing along with graphics. We started off with a small tree house and transformed it to a massivse fortress you can build amazing houses with tree bridges and large towers, boats (even though they are being worked on). Still many designs and ways to costomize along with many deadly unique traps and the hack and slash with cannibals. Chopping off heads and lighting them on fire. A quite large map and still growing, many caves (which are the best and make the game 5x harder) my expirence with the cave was exciting and had me scared every corner I turned.

								The game graphics are absolutely beautiful, there's no doubt about that! Probably one of the most visually pleasing titles I have seen in a long while. The game conecpt is rather exciting as well, pushing aside your normal zombie/supernatural survival type experiences. Also, one must keep in mind, there are no 12yo KOSer's running around becuase its a single player experience... for now. When they do plan on implementing multiplayer, it will be co-op based. I can also rest assured that the multiplayer will be localaly hosted, so you can pick who you want to play with.Overall, even with the bugs that are present, this is an exciting title. One I have been waiting for, for quite a long while. As the devs continue to push out content and updates and get past the alpha stage, I won't be surprised if this title is entered as a ""Game of the Year"". 10/10			"

								I've not played this game for long, and this is taking into account that the game is in it's early stages but holy moly. It's so much fun, especially with friends. The game is extremely immersive to the point where when you actually get back to your home after exploring, it feels like getting back home after a day out. It builds a huge amount of tension when exploring caves or dark areas and geniune fear when you hear the screams of the enemies. It's been a long time since a game has made me excited to come home and play and The Forest currently fills that role. This being early access this is a sign of a top quality finished product (when it is finished) and a sure sign that the developers are fully invested in creating the best game they can make. You'll never know how much you like The Forest until you actually play it and it is well worth the current asking price (£10.99 in it's current state). The multiplayer although needing some tweaks (plenty of time, early access afterall) is the most fun I've had on a game in years and the in-game voice feature of using a walkie-talkie to communicate with your friends all over the map is a great idea. Don't review games often, this probably makes no sense but damn, The Forest is good and is only going to get better.			"

								This game has HUGE potential to become something great.While it is Alpha and has some serious issues and perhaps even experience-breaking problems, it is very polished, the graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is quite stellar. Perhaps even matching the level of DayZ.But not the security of DayZ.You see, you DO have weapons in The Forest. But these weapons are nothing but sticks and stones, which don't break your bones, but are a somewhat usable weapon. But you will never stand a chance against the mutants. You don't have conventional guns that headshot mutants and make you more secure. Nothing like that. Instead, you have to sneak around them to increase survivability to a big extent. Bringing it to the enemy will only cause you more problems than it is necessary.Shelters and evverything are built by scavenging the world, which has lots of variety and interactivity. You can chop down nearly anything, from plants, to big trees, to mutants. It only adds to the fun factor.If you get caught, the game's survival horror genre comes into play. You are kidnapped into a server of caves, which are the mutants' hold-out and home. Your only way out is running around with a horridly-low-on-fuel BIC lighter. If you manage to make it out, good job, you can return to your house and recuperate, but fatality is quite likely in a lot of cases, so good luck.All-in-all, very nice game, but since it is Alpha, it has bugs, and it is not very recommendable unless you are prepared to face with them.9/10			"

								 A very nice survival game with horror and extensive crafting/building. Even though it has been in alpha for quite some time, it receives frequent and transparent updates. The developers seem to interact and listen with the community quite well, which is fairly rare for an early access game.  Like all survival games, it has the potential to become tedious after a few hours. I suspect the developers are working to combat this by adding more objectives, like rescuing other survivors. Overall I can recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival-horror genre, building/crafting games, or unique co-op experiences.			"

								This game perfectly encapsulates the horror effects of culture and movies like""Cannibal Holocaust"". Only difference is there is no narrative.... Well, not much aside from your plane crashing and your kid getting taken away from you. The encounters are perfect, since it's not the same kind of thing every time. Cannibals vary(ohhhhh boy..), and their reactions to seeing you can differ greatly, too. A lot of this depends on the players actions and activities. For instance: if you kill every cannibal you see, eventually you'll cross paths with some that are better equipped(mentally) to recognize you for the 'one that got away'. I lasted 9 days my first game. Building and setting up was easy. Keeping my wits about me and maintaining high environmental awareness, was not. It was stressful and terrifying at moments. Sighting one feral cannibal is enough to send you skimpering back to your camp for the remainder of the day. ""Did he see me? Is he going to get more friends?"" Probably....    My one and only tip: Never assume you can predict the behaviour of the tribesmen. They will ♥♥♥♥ you up when you least suspect it.			"

								The Forest is intruiging as soon as you find yourself in what's left of the plane. I like the fact a lot of things, location of the crash and items you find are procedurally generated. Most importantly the environment is lush with forest, plant life, and it feels as though it's living. Once you come in contact with the mutants, everything changes. You become more aware of your surroundings, and even paranoid. Fishing, hunting, crafting, logging, farming, building, exploring, surviving. That's what this game is about. My first play through I got captured, only had my lighter (I had no idea how to use my flashlight at the time) and didn't make it out of the cave. I got spotted and killed. My second play through I became more comfortable with crafting and building the structures. I started on a log cabin which needs 82 logs to complete. About halfway through building I was beaten and taken to another cave. This time I used my flashlight and made my way out of the cave, I came to a wooden wall, beat it down with my axe, and the sun beat on my face and shone in my eyes. I didn't recognize where I was. I was devastated. I was fourty two logs into my eighty two log cabin and had no idea how to get back to it. As I searched for my camp I ran across ""previous survivors"" camps. Everyone was dead. At last I made it to my camp on the beach, and finished my log cabin and set a fire inside to keep warm and out of the rain. The last thing I did before retiring for the evening was look around for mutant body pieces to make an effigy. As I was returning to my camp I crouched, seeing three mutants off in the distance building their own effigies next to my camp as a warning. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

								Honestly i love this game. I bought it maybe 1-2 months ago and played it maybe 30 mins, maybe even more and i went to refund it but i had been declined because i owned the game too long. After being declined i decided to give it a go and started playing for real and started building things. Just today i have played this game for 5 hours, it is so addictive and fun. There was one bug that was a huge inconvenience and made me finally take a break. I built a custom wall but everytime i went to go chop more logs, id come back to find one or two sections missing from my wall. Other than that, it has been the best game ive played in a while and i have already recommended it to my friends and my brother with constant pestering for him to get it. 10/10 would play againAlso i think there needs to be more explanation on the traps because i went to set one but didnt understand how it works, so now i have a useless trap sitting right next to my house. Doesnt worry much it just makes my place look 'ugly' so to speak or more messy in a way.			"

								The game is brilliant!While the bugs are frequent and the game crashes often (in my case once per hour) it was still a blast to play. I rarely write reviews but this game sure as hell deserves one!The map is simple to navigate and the UI is very intuitive (within seconds i knew what i was doing and how).The game ennemies are very well balanced in a way where they will only be a threat while traveling in a group.This game shows great promise and has already pleased me.I'd write more but honestly, you guys should experience it. This game is indeed a gem.			"

								The Forest is well exactly that.   This is not going to be your average stroll through the woods though.   You will have to be quick on your feet as well as be smart about how what and where you build and the locals do not take kindly to imprompt to visitors.  Yes its got a ways to go but the game is coming along nicely and I will really be happy if and when multiplayer is added.  This alpha gets a thumbs up from me.   After many wrong choices trying to out smart the locals I am happy to say I have now survived 30+ days with out using any of the items on the plane or being captured and taken into the cave by force.  I am now slowly exploring the cave and have 2 secure fortifications.   Good luck and enjoy you will be putting some hours into this game.   :)I continue to be impressed with the game as they updates and patches flesh out the game and make it that much more fun especially with multiplayer.   Keep up the great work this game is a keeper so get it if you do not all ready have it.   Sage  o7			"

I know you see alot of EA games here on steam but this is definitely a really good one. I spent a couple of hours persuading a buddy to get it instead of spending money on a free to play game. **Side note chop trees in a direction away from your house so it does not fall on your house and exlpode. This will save you alot of time feeling stupid**			"

There are many things, which can be implemented (Tree house, more animals, co-op mode, mode without cannibals etc.) I´ve been waiting for this game so long and that price is worth it. Guys don´t even think about not buying this it is really worth it. Yeah there is many glitches and bugs, but even though it´s great game...GREAT GAME ;) Keep up the good work devs :3			"

								Was building a log cabin when I was attacked by the locals. I thought they would offer to let me borrow their tools when one of them attacked me. With my trusty hatchet I killed him in self defense. Horrified in the terrible act I performed I cut off his head and made a trophy and stuck it in front of my future home. The friend of the man I murdered in self defense saw what I did and tried to claim revenge for what she witnessed. As she ran at me, she in turn ran into the burning effigy and burned to death. Understanding that she was trying to help her deceased friend I placed the trophy of her head next to her buddy. Every time I see them together I smile. I like to think that they're an the after life holding hands and picking flowers, and that they have forgiven me as their death was one of confusion and tragedy.			"

								Unlike many other early access games, this has great detail already in there and a frame rate that is good. However like many other early access games, this is full of glitches. My favourite examples are the exploding body glitch where if you try cut up a dead cannibal body you get flung in the air like you're being rocket propelled and die, the ground disappearing act where you fall through the ground and end up somehow swimming under the ground with the trees sprouting up around you, and the roundhouse kick where the canniballs kick you and you whiz over the entire map and into the sea on the other side of the island.Now you may be thinking, well hang on you're saying bad things about it when you're meant to be reccomending it?This is true, and so I just want you to know that despite the problems, it is a great game which keeps you on edge constantly and really incorporates you into the game. Overall I do recommend this game as it is very detailed and has surprises at every corner keeping you enthralled. And personally I find some of the glitches quite amusing. If however you dont want any glitches, then I highly recommend you wait for all the updates (which do help a lot) to take place, and then it will in my opinion be a perfect game.			"

								The  Forest is the best sandbox survivor I've ever played. I wish I had gotten my hands on it sooner. The combat is fluid and responsive. From my experience in most other survivor genre games, the combat animations and mechanics are clunky, lackluster and usually down-right laughable. The Forest pays special attention to polish, making sure that immersion is never sacrificed. Animations and impacts are all very tangible and rewarding. The audio is great too. Lots of variety in this department, and there's a casual increase in the amount of sinister sound effects that you hear throughout The Forest as the nights carry on and you expand your marooned empire. The enemies are tough and will hunt you down until they knock you unconcious and drag you down to the caves below the surface, effectively into the mouth of hell. You must then fight your way back out in the pitch black armed with only your melee weapon and a lighter.It's worth every dollar of the fifteen asked for it during early access.Bought it yesterday and have already spent 12+ hours on it.. i've gotten lost in The Forest  "

								The forest its a really interesting first person horror survival with excellent graphics, ambient, theme and mostly environment, it feels so unique and wonderful the place itself, you eventually feel like you are inside of the island1. You start off on a plane with your son, and you crash land on a suspicious island fulled with life and other creppy creatures. The first couple of hours you will be terrified tryng to hide from the cannibals and trying to find a safe spot to bulid camp. 2. Bulding. For an early access game it comes will alot of stuff to bulid with. You want to start buliding a little house and walls to keep yourself safe. Also you can bulid rain collectors to drink and set up traps to kill rabbits lizards.  Pros-The way the open world is-All the types of cannibals from normal looking to down right the creepiest most ugly thing i've seen.-All the bulding and customizable options for your character and your house.-You can buld traps to kill the cannibals and for a source of food.-When you get captured by the cannibals and you have to escape their turf avoiding them being stealthy, it give you that tingling felling in your balls you know.-Each time you start a new game everything can change, the plane doesn't crash in the same spot and the cannibals can attack you right off the start.Cons-The cannibals AI can sometimes be really bad to the point I stop playing for a while.-Also when you make a house I don't know if it's my game but the door laggs and it won't open or I get stuck in it.But those are the only cons I have with the game. So I give this game a 10/10 does a 10 mean it's great no there are bugs that will make you mad. Sould you buy this game? HELL YES buy the game now. It can only get better and better :] "

								Its an alpha and that currently shows quite prominently thus far. However, disregarding its current development status I was pleasantly surprised to see the game still holds its own. Its fun, really fun for the first few minutes before you're taken by storm from the islands inhabitants. You're gathering firewood, collecting game to roast on an open fire and building a shelter for the night. Well sonny you aint spending the night in that tent if this is the first time you're playing. While I was constructing my necessities I saw in the distant way a patrol of these cannibals I have never encountered, because of watching certain videos on youtube about this game I knew stealth was an option so I crouched down and watched them go by. My heart was racing, my hands were shaking and I was finding myself still crouching as I continued on my merry way. Before long I saw another cannibal, I had already encountered this one as I remembered the destinct construct on its back. I had come to realise this was the tribe leader, as soon as I faced it, he ran away and climbed a tree. Not a few more seconds after that, a female of the tribe steadily approached me uncaring to the axe I was weilding. Mate her♥♥♥♥♥♥were proper nice, voluptuous and shapely and them nipples on her were perfectly placed. I slowly walked to her before she lunged back, thinking back I swear I saw her almost uncovered minge. While taking a second to recover from my sudden shock, she also recovered of her own and took long strides with her long, curvy legs. Jumping at me she prepared her hands for the grab. Time went by slowly as I felt her delicious, mangled mouth comming on to my arm. For a moment we were connected, but she was in me with her long, hard teeth. Then my bloodfilled meat was in her willing, hungry mouth.  After this painful exchange my character feld dizzy and went for a bloody nap like the♥♥♥♥♥♥he is.But yeah the games pretty buggy, expect to fall through the ground or suddenly die for no good reason. 8/8 though.

								I've been playing this since v0.01 and i have to say that I love the improvements to the game. There was a few annoying bugs that i've had to deal with, but nothing major. I'm very satisfied with this game! I hope that it will go beyond Alpha. This is a very promising game. I just wish there was more to do in the game. Is there a story behind it... besides being in a plane crash? Where did the little boy go? Did the monsters kill him? That's what I'm left wondering the whole time. I see there are extra tabs on the Book Menu. Will those soon be released as well? :-) This game is great, also i love that there is ""The Calm Forest"" option. My kids play this as well, so it makes it easy for them to play without getting slaughtered by those .....cannibals! <3 <3 Keep up the great work!!			"

								Finally, after getting my hands on The Forest I can say I see promise in this game. This game has alot of bugs! So be warned before you buy this game. While playing this game can be fun it can also be frustrating at times. I have a lot of good moments and WTF moments but the WTF moments which can be fixed with some updates and time. My first day trying to survive was fun, I got off my crashed plane and found a beach where I would make home. During the day I made a fire and hut. Once night hit I decided to sleep. Sleeping is very helpful as it fills your stamina and saves the game for you. Once I woke up I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when three tribes people were standing on the beach looking at me. Once I got up and pulled out my little hatchet I was ready to fight only to see them run off into the forest. Now I was scared and didnt know what to do. This was a very cool moment that almost no games offer these days. The next day I upgraded my base adding a wall and traps. When night hit I decided to stay up and see what would happen. As I was sitting there I looked into the forest and saw a light. The more I watched I could see that it was tribes people. They finally reached the beach and wanted to fight. So I went hatchets blazing....lol... my trap was useless as they didn't step on it but still cool I could make one. I fought them and the kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I feel like they need to balance the damage the tribes people take, as for I didn't kill a single one. When you go up against 3 or more tribes people your prolly gonna die. When I died I thought the game was over well it wasn't. I woke up in a cave covered in blood and could see anything. I pulled out me lighter and looked around and found meds, flaregun and a better hatchet. I had to find my way out of the cave. Once I did that I went back to my base. Luckly they added a base marker so you know where to go or I would have been screwed. On my way back I fell off a mountain and died. Some way to die after that adventure. Lesson learned about running through thick brush. Overall this game is fun I would pick it up for $15. Below Ill post some of the bugs I encountered. I give this game a 7/10!! I hope you enjoy my review of The Forest. Review Done on 6/8/14 Bugs1.Lost my inventory2.Nobody spawned including (animals and tribes people)3.When you make a new camp you cant sleep there ( 1 camp per save) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!4.Cant fill wood storage. It only allowed my to put 1 log in it5.Framerate drops and game is unplayable6.Walk though tents and trees			"

								Very interesting and different. Fitting to the survival/zombie like genre of the now. I enjoy the crafting most of all. Hunting needs some work. Bow and arrow aiming, speed tectonics, movement over rocks, down trees, very glitchy but hey its the beta so all that should come soon. But over all very exciting! Very hard without a friend no doubt. The A.I. seems tactical, i like! Hard and easy to be backed in the corner, fun. I havent gone Cave dwelling just yet but i have had most of the basic buildings up and its quite the adventure thus far. Keep it coming, stoked to see whats coming!!!!! Ideas: More, bigger land animals, more wrecks and shipswreck material, water involvement, mountain caves and wrecks, radio towers, weather/space station/governement abandoned structure; More weapons, more crafts, blueprints or books like the basic one which was very well put together and instructive, maybe allow for structures created by others to be come blueprints for all, bigger bonfire effects, more traps for sure. Love the basic hard work atmosphere, i wouldnt recommend powered weapons like chainsaws and such the old school keeps it rare in its genre. Awesome and yes i recommend it! Friends play together and 2 ormore will never g wrong. Also, share food! lol.			"

								So here i was. Me ansd my lovely son Winifred were taking a trip to see my mother in Albequerque when all of the sudden the front of the plane comes disatached from the rest, thank the Gods no one else was on board. I was suffering from hunger as i got my fat self up off the ground to find that the only other person on the plane had a hatchet buried deep into her chest which i had no problem removing. I picked up more booze that could possibly fit into my designer jeans. As I began to journey about 5 feet into the woods i thought i heard footsteps and the screams of humans being dismantled in the distant. I soon found a beach where i could cook and rest for the night. While i had my nice little hut set up i began to see apperitions of humans in the distance but i thought nothing of it being in such a strange place, when suddenly i was attacked from behind by a group of canibalistic justin beiber fans. I assume they wanted to share my fish and didnt know how to speak my english language. I awoke in a dark cave where i quickly see my shadow cascading along the long floor,i didnt have a head but that didnt seem to affect me one bit. I found a hatchet and a flare gun by somehow picking up and throwing down again i had unlimited ammo for said falre gun. I eventually found my way out of the cave and began to adapt quickly to my surroundings. I built a nice log cabin with walls for protection and even a fire to keep me warm at night. One day as i was chopping down a tree, a log seemed to have glitched through time and space when it counteracts with where i was standing and shoots me HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH into the air.DEADI didnt think anything of because it thought i could reload where i was at in my game when i found that the load bar was unclickable. So all that work, killing innocent justin beiber fans, chopping down trees and the mass extension of the rabit population led me to nothing.I definatly recomend this game because the women are naked16/10			"

								Amazing survival horror game!In this game you'll start by flying around in a plane and then boom, you've crashed. When you wake up you'll have to find food, find water and build a shelter and even a fire. Without these you will die for sure. There are people living on this island that you've crashed on and they will attack and I've found that they're very strong. They will kill you with a few punches but hitting them with an axe will do very little. One of the things that makes this game so fun is that it's single player and you don't go around getting killed by a more experienced player. Currently this game has little to no bugs that I've found but there's room for improvement on the animal AI.The graphics on this game are amazing but will require a decent computer to max out, but this game looks beautiful assuming you can max it out. This game feels very beta and not alpha, the animations are very well done and the game has a very high level of detail to lots of things.9/10 I'd recommend this to any friend and have already.Currently loving this game 5 hours still counting			"

								~The First Encounter~Surviving a plane crash isn't so easy once i woke up what i saw was rows of seats and a few food trays,I decide to get out as soon as i came to I found an axe,The axe was hacked into a persons chest,I decide to grab it and start getting some wood and some food to try to survive,I decide to head north and i found a perfect area a little beach area,I look around and i see a  silhouette staring right at me,The silhouette starts to run at me so i run,I saw a boat in the ocean so i swimmed as fast as i could to the boat,i felt safe for a bit and saw a few other silhouettes they ran,""huh they didn't see me"",I thought,So i decide to get off the boat to get some food since i'm starving,To my surprise the thing that chased me was still alive and ran straight towards me and punched me clear to the sky,i blacked out.~Summary~So aside from a few glitches the game is wonderful a true survival horror it gives you the feeling of being scared and hunted by these tribe people,This game is worth every penny and can't wait for it to be finished.

								NOTE: I've so far have played versions Alpha 0.01 - 0.03.  Despite the many bugs and glitches this game currently faces in these stages, it's one of the best legitimate survival horror games I've ever played.  You can do so many things that I have dreamt of to be in a video game.  Things like : Stabbing fish with sticks and collectig them for food, trapping crazy cannibals in noose traps, chopping trees down... they actually come down... for once... in a damn video game C: .  Anyways, in all honesty, don't get the game YET, the saving is still a bit sketchy so forth with the other bugs.  Apparently they will also be adding a form of coop. hopefully it supports up to around 8 friends, if this happens, then it will be a true horrifying fun experience to have, especially with friends.  This game is what Rust should have been.  As a result, I rate the game in these current Alpha stages 4.5/10 , although when they update and patch it up, I expect that 4.5 to jump to an 11!  -P.S.  If you guys don't add coop, I will burn The Forest to the ground...    Tally Ho! C: "

								I bought the game 2 weeks after went into early access. I had a break from the game for a few months and tried it again and here's my review for the game since then:This game is progressing pretty fast. They have quite large updates every two weeks or so. One of the best developing teams in early access I've seen when it comes down to actual content releases and fixes. You can actually see a timer in-game referring to the next incoming update and they are really accurate.Before I stopped playing for a few months the game felt a little clumsy and not really responsive. The visuals were great but I had the feeling I had lots of framedrops and performance wasn't how it could be. A few months later (Last week) I gave it a try again and I was stunned how much the game had been improved since then. Game-play AND performance have been improved drastically. I have nearly to zero dramedrops now and I can actually play on 50-60 fps with a medium range computer (Nvidia 670gtx, Intel-i7 2600k 2,4ghz overclockeded to 3.4ghz).As for the price, it is really low in my opinion. I know several games out there which are a lot more expensive and have less updates, fixes, less potential and look far worse than this game. The game still has a long way to go but it is very promising as I see it now.			"

								I made a huge mistake.....Barely making it out of a plane crash, got a good sturdy axe and some random items, I run out to find a good spot for a camp, and come close to a cave, with two cannibals standing outside, and my first thought was ""Day one, 2 min into the game, I have an axe, they got nothing.... KILL KILL KILL"".... And well, I really must compliment the AI in this game, they are alot smarter than the usual game enemy, so here is how it went: I walk up to the first to test its reaction to me, and it screams at me, meanwhile Cannibal 2 runs off, and I think ""cowardly little git""... Well, feeling confident, I run towards cannibal one swinging my axe wildly while screaming something about his mothers size, and the bugger runs like hell, but now, cannibal two, who I thought fled, had surrounded me and was hitting me from behind ripping me apart rather quickly... They didnt even bother dragging me back to their cave, just outright killed me.Well, restarted the game and decided that the hide and seek approach was much better, is at day 7 now, and have a small well defended camp with 15+ traps around, and now, let me tell you something more about the enemy AI in this game, I was sure that i could just make enough traps to be safe, but first time I had a cannibal chasing me and ran behind a trap, thinking that he would run into it, I was dissapointed to see that he stopped 2 meters in front of the trap, looked around it a bit, and ran around it instead, I might have yelled at him at that point... Later on one cannibal ran quiclky through my camp, set off 4 traps by kicking them or whatnot, and proceeded to chase me...This game is not for the easily scared, the cannnibals and mutants are creepy like hell and will surprise you again and again, but in the way that you want to play more, want to see how you can fool them, NEED to have some sort of revenge (**COUGH COUGH** molotov coctail **COUGH COUGH**)Most annoying thing early on was actually finding a turtle shell, I just couldnt find a cannibal free beach, but apart from that, staying warm, hydrated and fed will be main issues, as those will affect your performance in a fight (slower axe swing and low stamina for runnung away, and trust me, you will need to run more than once )Still a few ingame bugs, but nothing that prevents you from playing the game, the ones ive discovered are:1) Still some rocks/cliffs that you will fall through.2) Made a treehouse, and the tree animation went away, so now its an airhouse basically.3) At one point I shot a deer with 6 arrows and it ran off, not sure if they are mutants too?? lol.But all in all, awesome game, would recommend!Oh, and piece of advice, save your game alot, you never know when you will be ripped apart next ;) "

								The amount of survival games we've gotten over these past few years is staggering , vast majority of which turned out to be complete utter garbage even after 2 or 3 years of development.The Forest i'd say is one of the few that turned out good over the years and had actually made good meaningful progress, this and the lone dark are probably the  two only survival games of these types I'd recommend checking out.On my first day i pretty much played the game for 11 hours straight with my bf and we couldn't stop, honestly apart from some janky boat/raft physics we experienced, the game almost feels fully finished  yet it still says it's in alpha 0.52, heck the game even has a full on ending now, so it's not just surviving an x amount of days till' yo get bored or die, you do have an objective, one which is rather difficult and will take time to do unless you just  look up youtube guides but  that removes the fun and surprise of exploring the world and its  horrifyingly scary dark a** caves.Probably the bigest reason i'm loving it is because it's a survival game where the enviroment is actually dangerous and f*cking scary as hell to the player, unlike most of these types of games where the enviroment is usually just a minor annoyance while other players are the main thing to fight always, and that's thanks to the game being focused on Co-op/solo play. So yeah no PVP at all, either play solo or co-operate with other players, granted I'd never recommend joining random lobbies, my strong suggestion is to try and get a friend to play it with you but if you can't, rather stick to solo play instead of dealing with strangers online.Visualy the game looks fantastic with some really gorgeous looking lighting effects and foliage that reacts to everything in the world, everytime the wind blows strong and i see and hear the trees leaning and cracking above me it just sends a chill down my spine. It also runs pretty well on my mid-range system that has a now old 760 GTX 2GB, usually sticking around the 40 to 60 fps marks on High visuals quality with pretty much all the bells and whistles [part from SSAO] turned on in a 1080p resolution.One more thing, something i mentioned earlier but want to say it again ; The game is scary as hell during a lot of moments and i love it, this is the first survival game where i genuinly got pi** a** scared due to the excelent atomsphere,sound design and just general unsetling moments it can have as you explore some areas. It pretty much enters full on survival horror and it's bloody fantastick.If you love survival games, you'll love it, if you also love horror, you'll love it even more. This is the 2nd survival game in early acces which I'd say is actually worth your time and money. It's cheaper then vast majority of its competitors that usually cost 20 euros or more and can it drop as low as just 10 euros during sales. This game beats DayZ's,Rust's,Ark's and many others a** in my opinion. I'd also recommend looking into the Long Dark which is the other survival game i mentioned that I'd wholeheartedly recommend checking out.			"

								Finally, after getting my hands on The Forest I can say I see promise in this game. This game has alot of bugs! So be warned before you buy this game. While playing this game can be fun it can also be frustrating at times. I have a lot of good moments and WTF moments but the WTF moments which can be fixed with some updates and time. My first day trying to survive was fun, I got off my crashed plane and found a beach where I would make home. During the day I made a fire and hut. Once night hit I decided to sleep. Sleeping is very helpful as it fills your stamina and saves the game for you. Once I woke up I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when three tribes people were standing on the beach looking at me. Once I got up and pulled out my little hatchet I was ready to fight only to see them run off into the forest. Now I was scared and didnt know what to do. This was a very cool moment that almost no games offer these days. The next day I upgraded my base adding a wall and traps. When night hit I decided to stay up and see what would happen. As I was sitting there I looked into the forest and saw a light. The more I watched I could see that it was tribes people. They finally reached the beach and wanted to fight. So I went hatchets blazing....lol... my trap was useless as they didn't step on it but still cool I could make one. I fought them and the kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I feel like they need to balance the damage the tribes people take, as for I didn't kill a single one. When you go up against 3 or more tribes people your prolly gonna die. When I died I thought the game was over well it wasn't. I woke up in a cave covered in blood and could see anything. I pulled out me lighter and looked around and found meds, flaregun and a better hatchet. I had to find my way out of the cave. Once I did that I went back to my base. Luckly they added a base marker so you know where to go or I would have been screwed. On my way back I fell off a mountain and died. Some way to die after that adventure. Lesson learned about running through thick brush. Overall this game is fun I would pick it up for $15. Below Ill post some of the bugs I encountered. I give this game a 7/10!! I hope you enjoy my review of The Forest. Review Done on 6/8/14 Bugs1.Lost my inventory2.Nobody spawned including (animals and tribes people)3.When you make a new camp you cant sleep there ( 1 camp per save) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!4.Cant fill wood storage. It only allowed my to put 1 log in it5.Framerate drops and game is unplayable6.Walk though tents and trees			"

								Where to start, this games intro lets the player really feel the fear. The survival aspect is really demanding from being tired, hungry, hurt, cold and wet, and being able to construct shelters. The islands inhabitants just really blow your mind on the ai scripting they will stalk you hunt you and re-group when they are hurt. They are by no means lazy they will run climb and come from every which way. graphics the game is smooth and beautiful it is what i would expect from something similar to the cry engine games which power games like far cry and crysis. the detail is beautiful and impressive from the vegitation to the wildlife you can hunt.There is the ability to co-op with your friends which i have not tried due to the fact there is no server search currently but co-op is done by using there ip and yours to create a lobyy(simple and elegant.).There are a few problems at the moment with the game but remember this is an alpha build.  Water is very simply implimented with water layers meaning you can see to the bottom and the edges of water are usually grassy no river system implimented. Sometimes with tree platforms you can build the trees will disapear and leave you just a floating platform. The bow is a nice addition but i would like to see a bigger better bow eventually with more power and maybe an aimer. I would highly recomend this game its only 14.95 with the xmas sale and its better then most xbox one titles i play to date.			"

I could even give myself a headache thinking of something funny and witty to say.But the fact that I bought it 12 hours ago and at the time of writing have 11.4 hours on record should say it all. Now, I'm busy booting up The Forest and can't wait to play it so shut up, stop reading and go buy the best survival/horror/RPG currently in existence.			"

								The Forest is an amazing game with amazing graphics and just an awesome experience, in this survival/horror game you are the father of a son who doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ when a plane is crashing and frankly, neither do you, but thats beside the point because your son is a ♥♥♥♥ing alien, anyways. You crash land on a cannibalistic island with your brand new unconscious so-- oh okay, yeah, well it seems like you have to go save your son.Now that you're on the island its time for you to save your son, woah, wait! Not yet, I was joking. You need to get ready, prepare and make shelter, weapons and food all the essentials.But the biggest question is, 'Do you reccomend this game, Jordan?', and yes, I highly reccomend this game, get it as soon as possible because it is generously cheap at the moment, the price will most likely be raised when there is more things in-game as it is a seriously early game. That's just an assumption though, so go save up £10.99 or whatever it is now and get it because it is brilliant.			"

								This game features some amazing gameplay! The singleplayer is good but could ofcourse improve. As the devs mention in the section ""Development roadmap"" They will be making the game graphics better aswell as improving the ""running"" of the game. I like the game and can't stop playing.There are some things that I think should be quite high on the dev priority list though. I am not a software developer but I think that the bugs in multiplayer should be fixed. First and formost the bug where you can play a game with your friend, both of you save in your shelter by pushing the C key and the you exit the server. When you come back in only the host will have kept his/her things like axes and food. The other thing that isn't really a glitch but a feature that would increase the gamplay experience is the ability to destroy or tear apart your buildings after you've started building or finished the build. My friends and I have realized that not being able to demolish your built stuff can be gamebreaking and make the gameplay less fun. Last but not least i would like to ask the developers to make it possible to share items with your friends in multiplayer (cop-op mode). This would make the gameplay more immersive and make the game a lot better. I hope the developers will take notice of these things and add them into the game although that is just my wish and I do understand if the developers want to chose another path for the game.To sum it up. I like the game and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to play a scary game alone or with your friends. There are a few bugs and some features missing (according to me) that i hope the developers will fix/add to the game.I give this game a 8/10 because of the things listed aboveKind regards, Your fellow gamer			"

								we have been playing this with several people on a lanparty now.And we all really like this game so FAR!We are really sad about the no-save part so far but we know it will come into the game.Although we found a few things wich need to be looked at:- The game starts lagging after you play it for a long timein one world- While chopping tree you hve to aim we came to notice. At where you can swing. But even then it doesnt always chop the whole tree down from one point. - Maybe a more realistic falling of the tree. Like if you chop form on side. It comes crashing down in that way.- Las tthing about the tree we noticed. some logs bug very hard when the fall down. the spin around and get bugged up high in the air. Or just roll through the rocks and other trees. but im sure this will be fixed too!!- We had a shelter. And apart from 1 guy who was scouting, we didnt see any other creep lurking at us. I guess we had the best spot?- And the explosives dont work.- After a few days and when we killed alot of cannibals there werent any left. Went through the whole map, caves and everythingAnd i few things that would be awesome if added:More animals to hunt.Bows.Other weapons.Achievements or kind of quests like finding all the passengers (wich is in it now)Respawn of canniballsMaybe something to tame like a wolf or something! :DBUT, we really love this game and cant wait for a patch or update on it!!!

This game has a lot of promise. I can see the direction it can go and hopefully will go.[/b]As for the current product:The game remains unplayable for me. I cannot seem to last more than one night alive. The enemies are too erratic and there is no real way to ward them off. Sometimes they sit there watching you just as if you were a test subject in their fantasy world. Sometimes they see you and freak the hell out that you are in their territory or maybe just because you exist, and begin to bum rush you from every angle. When this happens, just surrender you are going to lose unless it is 1 VS 2. Then, you may have a chance.Pros:Great graphicsVery fun to kill animalsPretty cool constructions, and trapsEasy to just pick up and play with the use of the survival bookCons:Enemies are too erraticItems bug outCertain areas of the map are just scenery and not actual map (eg. falling through hills and mountains into water)Can't pause the gameMotion blur is too intense even with it turned off. It makes me feel sick playing on a 70 inch.The caves are a bit too dark to see even with a lighterThe cave's walls often disappearBottom line:[/b]Great game so farHas serious potentialCurrently has serious bugs (Still in Alpha so understandable)If you can handle having lots of issues and bugs and want to be essentially a play tester and help in the development of the game, play now.If not, wait until some stuff gets ironed out.

								I bought the game 2 weeks after went into early access. I had a break from the game for a few months and tried it again and here's my review for the game since then:This game is progressing pretty fast. They have quite large updates every two weeks or so. One of the best developing teams in early access I've seen when it comes down to actual content releases and fixes. You can actually see a timer in-game referring to the next incoming update and they are really accurate.Before I stopped playing for a few months the game felt a little clumsy and not really responsive. The visuals were great but I had the feeling I had lots of framedrops and performance wasn't how it could be. A few months later (Last week) I gave it a try again and I was stunned how much the game had been improved since then. Game-play AND performance have been improved drastically. I have nearly to zero dramedrops now and I can actually play on 50-60 fps with a medium range computer (Nvidia 670gtx, Intel-i7 2600k 2,4ghz overclockeded to 3.4ghz).As for the price, it is really low in my opinion.

								The amount of survival games we've gotten over these past few years is staggering , vast majority of which turned out to be complete utter garbage even after 2 or 3 years of development.The Forest i'd say is one of the few that turned out good over the years and had actually made good meaningful progress, this and the lone dark are probably the  two only survival games of these types I'd recommend checking out.On my first day i pretty much played the game for 11 hours straight with my bf and we couldn't stop, honestly apart from some janky boat/raft physics we experienced, the game almost feels fully finished  yet it still says it's in alpha 0.52, heck the game even has a full on ending now, so it's not just surviving an x amount of days till' yo get bored or die, you do have an objective, one which is rather difficult and will take time to do unless you just  look up youtube guides but  that removes the fun and surprise of exploring the world and its  horrifyingly scary dark a** caves.Probably the bigest reason i'm loving it is because it's a survival game where the enviroment is actually dangerous and f*cking scary as hell to the player, unlike most of these types of games where the enviroment is usually just a minor annoyance while other players are the main thing to fight always, and that's thanks to the game being focused on Co-op/solo play. So yeah no PVP at all, either play solo or co-operate with other players, granted I'd never recommend joining random lobbies, my strong suggestion is to try and get a friend to play it with you but if you can't, rather stick to solo play instead of dealing with strangers online.Visualy the game looks fantastic with some really gorgeous looking lighting effects and foliage that reacts to everything in the world, everytime the wind blows strong and i see and hear the trees leaning and cracking above me it just sends a chill down my spine. It also runs pretty well on my mid-range system that has a now old 760 GTX 2GB, usually sticking around the 40 to 60 fps marks on High visuals quality with pretty much all the bells and whistles [part from SSAO] turned on in a 1080p resolution.One more thing, something i mentioned earlier but want to say it again ; The game is scary as hell during a lot of moments and i love it, this is the first survival game where i genuinly got pi** a** scared due to the excelent atomsphere,sound design and just general unsetling moments it can have as you explore some areas. It pretty much enters full on survival horror and it's bloody fantastick.If you love survival games, you'll love it, if you also love horror, you'll love it even more. This is the 2nd survival game in early acces which I'd say is actually worth your time and money. It's cheaper then vast majority of its competitors that usually cost 20 euros or more and can it drop as low as just 10 euros during sales. This game beats DayZ's,Rust's,Ark's and many others a** in my opinion. I'd also recommend looking into the Long Dark which is the other survival game i mentioned that I'd wholeheartedly recommend checking out.			"

								Amazing survival horror game!In this game you'll start by flying around in a plane and then boom, you've crashed. When you wake up you'll have to find food, find water and build a shelter and even a fire. Without these you will die for sure. There are people living on this island that you've crashed on and they will attack and I've found that they're very strong. They will kill you with a few punches but hitting them with an axe will do very little. One of the things that makes this game so fun is that it's single player and you don't go around getting killed by a more experienced player. Currently this game has little to no bugs that I've found but there's room for improvement on the animal AI.The graphics on this game are amazing but will require a decent computer to max out, but this game looks beautiful assuming you can max it out. This game feels very beta and not alpha, the animations are very well done and the game has a very high level of detail to lots of things.9/10 I'd recommend this to any friend and have already.Currently loving this game 5 hours still counting			"

								~The First Encounter~Surviving a plane crash isn't so easy once i woke up what i saw was rows of seats and a few food trays,I decide to get out as soon as i came to I found an axe,The axe was hacked into a persons chest,I decide to grab it and start getting some wood and some food to try to survive,I decide to head north and i found a perfect area a little beach area,I look around and i see a  silhouette staring right at me,The silhouette starts to run at me so i run,I saw a boat in the ocean so i swimmed as fast as i could to the boat,i felt safe for a bit and saw a few other silhouettes they ran,""huh they didn't see me"",I thought,So i decide to get off the boat to get some food since i'm starving,To my surprise the thing that chased me was still alive and ran straight towards me and punched me clear to the sky,i blacked out.~Summary~So aside from a few glitches the game is wonderful a true survival horror it gives you the feeling of being scared and hunted by these tribe people,This game is worth every penny and can't wait for it to be finished.

Early Access Review
								This game IS in ALPHA and i have taken note of that and everything i reference is in light of that fact.Ok so i saw the price was £11 for me, after all the hyp, i thought, you know what, that's good! So i buy the game. When i got to the menu, full of excitement i was a little diss-appointed at the lack of options and maybe the menu could have looked a little nicer, but hey, its alpha! Anyway i jumped right in after disabling the motion blur, personal preference. (you do have to do this every time you die, nothing saves, but more on that in a minuet) ok the opening scene is just how you see in the trailer. I won't give anything away but it's how it is portraid in the trailer as a plane crash. The opening scene isn't very long and your soon in for your first taste of the experience...Now i have jumped out of the plane realising i have been left to fend for myeslf with bare tutorials, just a few notifications telling me im hungry. The first thing that really caught my eye was the stunning scenery! The pure expansion of greenery foliage goes beyond description. I soon realised that you can harvest a good majority of that foliage too!Me being completely logical thought that using the plane crash as shelter is a good idea, only... you can't get back in the plane, i can only assume this is so it can't be abused and it forces you out to fend for yourself and build your own shelter! Which i like. Now something tells me these things are attracted to the lufthansa plane landing in there back garden and soon begin to investigate.... very soon...The HUD is simple and personally i like the inventory, which is simply (i). The layout of the inventory is nice, it is easy to use, the only thing i would say is you can craft items, which there is no clear tutorial for which i have seen. There is very little help on this game. After about 5 minuets or so, i encounter my first jump scare, they are VERY sneaky! i turned around and there was a half naked man in my face. I hit him with my axe a few times... and a few more.... and a few more.... and a few more... yes these people seem to have an immunity to anything with a sharp edge! Eventually you can knock them down and kill them.An issue ive encountered is once they aggro you it is VERY hard to loose them as your stamina will drain fast and they are TOUGH. It's best to try not to get seem AT ALL in the first place. So you WILL die probably sooner rather than later and it is not over there. You get taken to their lair... only to find more shinies! YES there are LOTS of collectables especially in the conveniantly placed suitcases lying around the wreckage... and the whole island. There is only one way in and one way out of the cave!  It is known to be able to fall through the map in the cave, again its just alpha. Once you are out the next time you die WILL be your last! Don't die again.My advice is open the guide it does give you using (b) and build those first few basic items. My furthest so far is 5 days and it was enjoyable, however there are some underlining issues that are BIG in my eyes, these are as follows:- The save feature is broken (atleast for a very vast amount of people such as myself) I REALLY need to be able to save my progress, because if i die i HAVE to watch the cut scene again, do the cave AGAIN.- The log stockpile doesn't seem to work where you store logs for later use. Not sure if it's just me on that one but i can't anyway.- The tribal people are a little bit OP in the fact that they are tough and spot you vey easily. Make sure you always have food, that gives you stamina to run!With that said, this game has a ridiculous amount of potential, im really enjoying it, at night sometimes i don't want to leave the safety of my camp, thats a GOOD thing, the atmosphere is awesome, very tense. I am REALLY looking forward to co-op, which they have put in the future features list!I am a bit unsure as to whether to recmmend thhis game simply because of a few big issues as stated above. BUT i WILL recommend it simply because when they are fixed this will be incredible. My advice is buy it whilst it's £11 or what ever your currency is and thank me later! Buy it now, enjoy it a small amount, enjoy it MORE when its public release!Hope this helps...			"

								This game is like they say an alpha build. So don't expect it to be free of bugs or completly feels like a finished product. To the time I write this I only have played around 3h but I still continue to play it.What is positive:-The nice graphic which I personally don't really expect from an Indie-product-The feeling when you move around to look for a place to build or just explore and you didn't look around and you run into a group of nativs-The KI is believable some natives will attack you if they see you, some will flee and other will watch you courious. Also if you build a camp or just cut down a tree the nativs will notice and investigate.What is negativ:-Enemy design: So far all enemie-typs looks alike so you get the feeling there is somewhere a clone fabric.-Glitches: Sometimes you can see and walk through stones-Logical problems: You crashed with a plan (only you and your sons flys with) and wake up but everyone else is dead. I asked myself: What the... how long was I out?I would recommend this game to everyone who don't intent to get a full developed game. Overall it has it's weakness like anyother game. It is an alpha build (to release a alpha build as buyable early access is questionable but still 15€ it is rather cheap) and as such it is rather good. I for my part will watch the game as it change and if the developer do implant everything thay planed on then this game is completlly worthe it's money.			"

								This game features some amazing gameplay! The singleplayer is good but could ofcourse improve. As the devs mention in the section ""Development roadmap"" They will be making the game graphics better aswell as improving the ""running"" of the game. I like the game and can't stop playing.There are some things that I think should be quite high on the dev priority list though. I am not a software developer but I think that the bugs in multiplayer should be fixed. First and formost the bug where you can play a game with your friend, both of you save in your shelter by pushing the C key and the you exit the server. When you come back in only the host will have kept his/her things like axes and food. The other thing that isn't really a glitch but a feature that would increase the gamplay experience is the ability to destroy or tear apart your buildings after you've started building or finished the build. My friends and I have realized that not being able to demolish your built stuff can be gamebreaking and make the gameplay less fun. Last but not least i would like to ask the developers to make it possible to share items with your friends in multiplayer (cop-op mode). This would make the gameplay more immersive and make the game a lot better. I hope the developers will take notice of these things and add them into the game although that is just my wish and I do understand if the developers want to chose another path for the game.To sum it up. I like the game and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to play a scary game alone or with your friends. There are a few bugs and some features missing (according to me) that i hope the developers will fix/add to the game.I give this game a 8/10 because of the things listed aboveKind regards, Your fellow gamer			"

								This is my first survival AND horror game (well, that old Alone in the Dark from the 90's doesn't count, right?)... and i loved it!Graphics and animations are brilliant. Sound is great and really captures the feeling of being alone in a forest, it even makes you a bit paranoid after some time...The tribesman are scary as heck, for some reason i think they are even more scarier than the mutants, maybe because they are super fast and have the bad habit of showing up in very unexpected moments making horrible noises and staring at you. Also their behavior and AI is excellent and very unpredictable.While single player can be a bit tense, co-op is more relaxing and fun. Specially when you or your friend get scared and scream!Great game. Recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW PATCH V.08First of alll I'm not going to fully review the game, I'm going to answer what you probably have questions about in regards to this game. If you're reading this on the store page or reviews then you're more likely to be looking for insight on whether you should buy it or not. So here we go.Do I recommend the game, yes definately it's fun and very playable. Is it buggy? No not very buggy. I would say after the last few patches it seems to be getting better annd better. It is afterall regarded as an EARLY ALPHA title, so they could put out a new patch and totally mess it up so it's unplayable. However the development team appears to be quite responsible, attentive and would likely release a hotfix ASAP. The game seems very stable, not to buggy, fun to play and enjoyable for the most part.You can build a log cabin, build other structures, traps, craft weapons. The bad guys are mostly Natives or Cannibals and are not to difficult to fight. You can hunt animals for food such as Rabbit, lizard and (Deer as of v.08) There is no storyline yet although it appears this PC Title will eventually have a very involved scripted storyline. The world is a large jungle or forest like island, it's not huge but it's big enough; dunno if they intend to make it much larger. There is no multiplayer yet and I don't know if the Development team intend to add multiplayer at a later date.Price wise, as of October 09, 2014 at the Steam store has the game listed at CA$16.99. I would recommened it at this price. "

								This is a survival craft kind of game. I see a lot of potential but am unsure about the long-term point of the game. It is still in alpha and that's fine you can't expect the final product yet, but this game definately needs something to make it feel like your going somewhere in it. Right now theres not really any point to the game but the crafting is amazing. You gather supplies from the island like sticks rocks and wood which you chop trees down to get. There are traps to set to protect your base that you want to make. Your guy gets hungry, cold,  and needs energy to perform tasks so theres an obvious survival feel to it. Having fun in it and can't wait for more content. Has a lot of support and feels like they are serious about putting out a lot of content for it soon though it is still kind of buggy.			"

								This is hands down the best survival game I have ever played. Hour after hour I have spent chopping wood, hunting rabits, spearing fish, and collecting mushrooms have immersed me in a world I could believe existed and has required me to push my creativity and quick thinking to the limit.I am NOT a fan of horror games, but whether or not you go into peaceful mode or not, you cannot shake the idea that you are being watched. However, that feeling goes away as you build yourself a cabin, then some walls, and a farm, some standing fires, meat racks etc, and soon well armed with my arsenal of arrows and traps I was ready to take them on. I had always adopted a live and let live aproach to surviving with these cannibals. Until they aproached my fortress, at which points all bets were off. I caught my first cannibal that evening, he hung there until I put him out of his misery with my axe. It was a thrill, The cannibals stayed out of my way but I was dying for them to come and feel my wrath. I had my getaway raft down the cliff if things went downhill. Unaware that my girlfriend had been trying to reach me for the preceding hours my phone drew me away from my new reality. Tommorow, I shall face my fears, tommorow, I shall rule the Island. Tommorow, they shall now fear me. I am the hunter, I am the builder, I am the survivor, I am the Forest			"

								Summary:The Forest is an extremely incredible game for early access, and doesn't disappoint! Realistic, scary and beautiful.As one of the survivors of a mysterious plane crash on an island, you are put to the task to survive. There are cannibals, they will kill you. That is why you need to kill them. You will have to explore dark caves, cannibal camps and historical events which all makes sense in the end. All you have to do is survive and complete the game, yes there is an ending. All you have to do is to survive, survive in The Forest. ----------------------------------------------------------Holy crap this is amazing for an alpha game, even with bugs! Just wow!Looks good, feels very creepy and is extremely fun, especially with friends.I would strongly recommend this game above any other early access survival game. Sure, Rust is also good, but The Forest is a different kind of game.This game is very realistic (apart from bugs  & stuff, but you will get used to them and usually think they are funny) compared with Rust for example. Rust isn't realistic..			"

								I am obsessed with this game right now it's so fun. I have about 20 hours of gameplay and I have been having a blast crafting, building, and showing the natives that I'm not somebody to be trifled with. I'm decked out in nearly maxed out bone armor and have built myself  some defensive/offensive traps and a sturdy wall to protect my beach-side retreat. I even  have a dock, a raft, and a houseboat with a bed and decorative lighting. This game is awesome so far! Great graphics; smooth/speedy game performance; Pretty smart A.I.; item and base crafting; weather effects; and the list goes on. Coop has been very fun too and building can obviously go much more quickly. Enough, Buy it already.  Did I mention great Developers as well.I now have 287 hours of game play in The Forest and it's still my favorite coop survival/action game by far.  And of course single player is awesome and super intense in this game for certain.			"

								I'm not sure to recommend this game since this game is still in alpha.If you like survival games,this game may disappoint you a little bit.There're too many cannibals spawned around your house every 3-5 minutes and this thing made this game become more of a hit and slash game rather than survival game.The survival thing has become just to survive from the constant cannibals attack and you barely have enough time to build a shelter,since you have to defend yourself/flee every time 3-8 cannibals attack you.You need to know that it's really hard to kill just one of the cannibals since they have a lot of HP and high amount of damage.I wrote those things on the feedback discussion page,and I really hope they read it and repair it on the next update.If they solve the cannibal problem,there're tons of reasons to buy this game.I will totally recommend it ! The game is really interesting and you'll spend a lot of time collecting resources to build your fortress,collecting foods to save for the night time,and think how you'll survive the day each morning.The game is very realistic and I don't think you'll find any other kind of this game on steam.Of course I know that there're tons of survival games in steam,but this one is different.It's not just simply collect food-water-build shelter.You really have to build the epic impenetrable fortress in order to survive the overwhelming number of cannibals hunting you everyday.You can even burn their body parts to attract them if you want to kill some cannibals.If you have finished building your fortress,you can explore the other parts of the island,and you can even build a raft and travel to other islands ! So I suggest you wait for a while until this game is finished.This is a great game with great idea of gameplay.It's just not perfect yet because it's not done.It'll become a favourite survival game in the future.

								The forest deserves on my opinion a highly recommendation of 101% The story of this game is awesome. There more you find out, the more exciting it gets. I played this game straight until the end with someone who has already finished the game (I finished it in 7 hours) and since I rushed the game I will probably play it again with someone who hasnt finished it yet to get a closer look at the things (pictures, dead humans etc.). The good thing is, even though I finished the game I can still do alot of things like building my own empire and invite my friends to use them as my slave and let them finish building it for me.			"

								Haven't played this game a whole lot (I played more than what it says! About 5-6 hours in offline mode), but this is my first impression:This game was a little hard for me at the beginning because those cannibal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were everywhere! Like literally, they wouldn't let me alone for a minute.After understanding a few tricks that you can do in this game (and that you wouldn't imagine would be possible in a game) like covering yourself in mud, I started to get the hang of it.I was building a nice, small house next to a rock, but those ♥♥♥♥ers were there to bother me every single day, so one day I decided to kill one of those ♥♥♥♥♥es and put his head, legs and arms on a pole.  From that day, ♥♥♥♥♥es never came to visit me.The next day, while I was hunting rabbits, I realized they had a big camp right next to my house -_-...I was ready to kill all sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es, but then I fell from about 10 meters and died.  I was in a cave full of bodies hanging from the ceiling and it was 3 AM, so I just ragequitted.Definitely going to do the same thing today.Oh yes, this game has a lot of bugs, but you know, it's in its alpha stage.

Early Access Review
								EDITED TO UPDATEIt's been a couple of years now that I've gotten to enjoy this title, and in this time, the game has improved and added so much that it's crazy to look back and see how awesome it was even before all of the beautiful updates.  So many new features and functions have been continuously added, and graphics continue to be improved.  It's easy to see that the team working on this game LOVE their work - this game is their baby.The Forest is still phenomenal to me, and despite having logged (as of right now) 80+ hours of gameplay, there is still so much left for me to try, and plenty left to explore.  New weapons have been added (including a wicked katana) and new building features have left the options so expansive for us players that I no longer see myself getting bored of it.  You can build anything you want on this game, from small cabins, to floating boat houses, to humongous castles made mostly of rocks.  Furniture is also included, like a bed and a weapon rack.I once complained of the imbalance between ease and difficulty of the AI enemies.  They have improved greatly on this imbalance.  I still find myself dying from time to time, but it is so much easier to defend yourself now against powerful cannibals.  Fights are no longer boring because you are constantly on your toes, making sure not to take too many hits, and probably resetting traps constantly.  All structures can be torn down, even by yourself with accidental explosives or chopping a tree too close to home.  It brings much more dynamic now, as you cannot simply stow away in a walled fort and ignore the enemies as they will, within minutes, knock down holes in your defenses.It's exciting to see how great it is, knowing they are adding more every couple of weeks.  This is one early access game that I doubt anyone has regretted buying - it's been a real pleasure watching it grow.__________________________________________________________Obviously, since this game is not yet finished, I've come across some minor bugs or annoying glitches, but considering just how severely underdeveloped it still really is, I'm impressed with the quality.  The bugs have been few and far between and the only one that actually effected proper gameplay seems to have been fixed.  From my gameplay hours, the few words I can best use to describe this experience would probably be, ""Zen"" and ""Frustration,"" which may some like a paradoxical combination, but let me explain.This game is relaxing.  With stunning visuals, the scenery alone is enough to encourage lengthy exploration of its open world environment.  I've enjoyed running through thick forests while trying to strategize about where and how I'm going to build my base camp.  On the way, though, I can't help but stop and admire the lay of the land and the mountains in the distance.  You'll find funny-looking trees, beached sharks, beautiful and detailed sunsets, an expansive sky of stars, and the strangest of the island decoration, the random effigies and shrines that will pop up all over the place (most of the time, around your camp, which is gonna make you squirm a bit.)  Right now, this ""open-world"" is currently limited, but I don't really like to use that word because limited implies something small or confining; that's not the case.  I've already spent a few hours of playtime over several different restarts, and I still haven't discovered all there is to see.  I'm kind of at the point where I enjoy exploring so much that I may start a game just for the sole task of unearthing each corner of the available map, before it's updated and expanded more.  The best part of exploration is finding all of the creepy and often gruesome landmarks of the map - leftovers of what appears to be tourists that were abruptly killed by something unexplainable.  These patches of death pop up all over the place, just like the monsters that stroll around the island looking for their next human meal.  When you come across these setups, you will be left uncomfortably eager to disappear, and fast.  You see them and look around for a brief moment, before getting the feeling of, ""Oh snap, something bad went down around here, I'd better not linger.""So, the scenery is great, the controls are pretty unique, the graphics are generally bad to the bone, but I do see one major flaw in this game that makes me feel it won't be a long-term relationship: the lack of action, or rather, the periods of rest inbetween cannibal encounters.  Now that I understand how the dynamics of the game works, I can much more easily track the movements of the cannibal packs.  I've learned the general distance it takes to either be seen or to stay safely hidden.  What I don't like, is how this feels to be based solely on the distance between you and the monsters, instead of, say, how Skyrim works, with having to constantly stay in cover, out of sight.  In The Forest, you could be standing in the open, they'll be walking nearby, but as long as they don't come within a relatively short range of you, they're not going to 'notice' you, and that makes things simultaneously easier and a lot more boring.  Now, there still have been times that I've taken a stroll through the thickest parts of the forest and was suddenly ambushed, and I appreciate that level of suspense and fear that is preserved with travel.  When you're in the thick foliage and trees, it makes it way harder to spot them before they spot you.  Also, the mutant packs seem to randomly deviate from a slow casual walk to a sudden sprint, making you even more cautious to keep close to camp at all times.On that note, here's where things REALLY get me snoring.  Once you've learned the essence of the game, which is to quickly establish a walled fortress with lots of fires all around you, the action starts to come by a lot less frequently and sometimes it will cease all-together.  With my perfect strategy, I have a small house built within ten minutes of starting the game, of which during this time, no cannibals have seemed to spawn yet.  It's not often that I see the monsters before I'm done building more than half of my survival necessities.  IF you DO happen to run into them before you have protection, it's upsettingly hard to defend yourself against them, which seems unfair.  They will come to you in a pack, and they will attack all at once.  Sometimes, they will one-hit-KO you.  So here's the gist of what I'm getting at: if you do it the right way, you become OP. If you slack and struggle and don't build what you need ASAP, the cannibals will be OP.  The flaw is when you get too good at what you're doing, and the cannibals no longer become a threat and literally all you're doing is camping out at the entrance of your shack, staring each other down.  I'm hoping they will pay a lot of careful attention to this in the next few updates, and  perhaps add some interesting counterattacks to their dynamics; maybe some fires to burn down some of your walls, or flinging burning stones at you?  Why not have them sneak into your camp while you sleep?What keeps me excited about this game is knowing that the possibilities are endless, and the creators can really initiate some imaginative scenarios to keep it from becoming slack.  The bugs I've come across are as follows:Trying to build something and getting stuck on the 'placement' mode, where the opaque object stays in your sight wherever you go but will not be placed no matter what you press.  Restart fixed it.Trying to click on your builds and nothing happens.  Restart fixed it.There are still objects that disappear inbetween saving and reloading a game, like the cloths you can collect.Sticks will sometimes disappear right after I cut down a small tree.Once, to escape an ambush, I fled into the ocean and just kept swimming.  The cannibals kept chase, but they weren't swimming - they were running along the floor of the ocean beneath me.			"

								The Forest was one of the first survival games to hit the market a couple years back.  It was released as a single player game, but it now has multiplayer as well; however, the multiplayer lacks some of the features that single player holds.  Though, whether playing alone or with friends, it is an over-all fun game that stands alone from the many other survival titles.  That being said, it has been in ea for a long time now, and the devs often add bugs with updates that require more time to then fix.The survival aspect of the game is a little concerning to me.  It can seem daunting at first, but once you get past the first few days and have a solid base built, it is far too easy to stock up on non-perishable foods and beverages.  The fault comes from the fact that loot re-spawns EVERY DAY...  On top of that, hunting is extremely easy and edible berries re spawn along with the loot.  You can just run up to a deer and hack it to death with an ax if you want meat.The wildlife feel like they belong in the forest with you and there is a solid variety that ranges from crocodiles to rabbits, but like I said already, they are way to easy to kill, and the game animals basically offer themselves to you.The combat is fun at first, but it lacks depth.  There are a surprisingly large amount of melee weapons, but all of them are pointless once you have found the katana.  You are able to upgrade the basic weapons in a way that no other game allows, but again, that is all a moot point once the sword has been found.  There are a number of explosives and a few ranged weapons that are powerful tools, but just like the survival aspect, they are far to easy to acquire.The crafting portion of the game is nothing new.  Though, I do like seeing how much of the forest will be cleared while creating a base.  And I can't think of any other game that you can chop up the dead enemies and either eat them, or turn them into human effigies.The strongest parts of the game are the island and the enemies.The island is large and beautiful.  There are a number of places that can be explored that range from snowy mountains to steamy swamps, even smaller islands that you must build a boat to reach.  Once you have geared up and are feeling brave, the caves are dark and spooky places to explore that hold some of the better loot, as well as some creepy mutants that you will rarely find on the surface.  I had more fun exploring with a friend in this game than in any other.  Hands down.  The openness of the island bioms allow for different play styles to be tested before deciding what works best for you.The aspect of the enemies that makes them such a joy to me is the way they respond to you.  They don't offer any innovative attacks or weaponry, but they will often stalk you when on the surface and even run away and get backup before coming back to kill you later that night.  That type of AI is rarely found in games.  I get tired of enemies that attack without any fear of death, charging at you as  if they have nothing to lose.  The sounds they make at night and the design of some of the large mutants will mess with your mind the first time around as well.Over all, its a great game to play single-player or multiplayer.  With some balancing to the difficulty, this game could shape up to a masterpiece.  In the meantime, I will recommend this game do to its unique in-game content and enjoyable game-play, even if it is a tad easy right now.  The modest price  tag is also a bonus!

								First: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to support the developers and not actually play.The game doesn't save for a lot of people including me. BUT this is alpha and for an alpha this game is quite gorgeous, and I did enjoy my team playing.You'll be building a shelter and some weird mutant freak is stalking you from behind, you can either try to kill him/her and risk having his/her entire family trying to eat you or you can try to scare him away. The AI is decent, much better than the AI in some Alpha games that have been out for a while now *cough* DayZ *cough*But even with all this, you should only buy it if you absolutely want a game where youre only buying it to help continue its development. After all this game has so much potential and I cant wait to see what it becomes.			"

As long as the devs keep up with this quality and perhaps add a low player count multiplayer and co op this can easily be the defining open world survival games.  Plenty of bugs at the moment.  Make sure you read up about it before you buy.  But trust me, if your a fan of the genre this is A MUST HAVE!!			"

								(WARNING THIS IS IN ALPHA) I awoke from the plane crash only to see my son being taken away from me by a mutant. I awoke again moments later and scavenged whatever i could get from the plane, and i set off reminding my self of my past life, which i only survived 1 day. My stupid self set up camp next to the plane, only to realize that the mutants come from a cave not far from the camp. i got rekd. Anyways, i set off far away from that damn plane trying to build a fire and a little shelter i found a perfect spot near the beach, i slept. I awoke at dawn and saw a patrol of 3 mutants searching for survivors, i guess no place is safe after all. I quickly crouched in the grass. Watching from a distance i saw that they have put up some sort of pole with a skull and a bottle above it, maybe to catch rain? I was right, lightning flashed and they all scattered back in the cave. I felt relieved and now knew that they were frightened by the rain as if the rain was some sort of safe haven for me to scavenge around and get some supplies. It was getting dark, i slept and awoke at dawn once again only to wake up to a horrifying shriek from a female mutant, she ran away as i knew she was going for backup i quickly ran away from camp into the woods only to restart once again.The game is really good even with the little stuff it has in it at the moment, the graphics are splendid and the animations are well done. There are ALOT of bugs with the game but that doesn't stop it from being good, and it will only get better. Snag it right now for $15 it is well worth it.(Bugs)- MAJOR fps drops while cutting trees.- mutants will not die? (Maybe i suck)- Animations while cutting trees is clunky and does not respond at times while chopping at it.- Birds floating on top of rocks.- Mutants one hit me. (like i said i suck)- Garden did nothing at all.- When cutting down small trees the branches take a while to respond to me pressing ""E"" to pick it up.- When i have no more room in my inventory it says ""No more raw fish"" even though i have no fish.- My shadow has no headAnd there's more but they will get patched and it is in alpha.

								This is hands down the best survival game I have ever played. Hour after hour I have spent chopping wood, hunting rabits, spearing fish, and collecting mushrooms have immersed me in a world I could believe existed and has required me to push my creativity and quick thinking to the limit.I am NOT a fan of horror games, but whether or not you go into peaceful mode or not, you cannot shake the idea that you are being watched. However, that feeling goes away as you build yourself a cabin, then some walls, and a farm, some standing fires, meat racks etc, and soon well armed with my arsenal of arrows and traps I was ready to take them on. I had always adopted a live and let live aproach to surviving with these cannibals. Until they aproached my fortress, at which points all bets were off. I caught my first cannibal that evening, he hung there until I put him out of his misery with my axe. It was a thrill, The cannibals stayed out of my way but I was dying for them to come and feel my wrath. I had my getaway raft down the cliff if things went downhill. Unaware that my girlfriend had been trying to reach me for the preceding hours my phone drew me away from my new reality. Tommorow, I shall face my fears, tommorow, I shall rule the Island. Tommorow, they shall now fear me. I am the hunter, I am the builder, I am the survivor, I am the Forest			"

								THIS IS AN ALPHA BUILD! I see people upset the game is glitchy and they dont realize that it is the first iteration of the game. Give it time and the bugs will be ironed out. The game has amazing graphics, great sound effects, and a creepy atmosphere. The developers hav a clear vision of the game and which direction it will go, and this alpha is an amazing peek at their goal. Get it if you want to play a game that will be comparable to DayZ and other survival games, but again, its only in alpha. Building functionality is limited, saving is broken (At the time of writing this review), and many other game breaking bugs are in this version of the alpha. However, the game is going to be something much better in the future. Buy to support and help make the game better, but do not buy if you want to play a finished product.			"

								The Forest starts out with you're character finding himself in a tough position in the middle of a spooky forest and he must craft, build, eat and fight to survive in the dangerous areas of this large open world game.The world of The Forest is very well layed out and the most enjoyable part of the game are the caves that you can explore and raid for more supplies to help you thrive.The base building in the game is quite good, but expect alot of grinding for recourses as it takes very long to collect them.The combat can be extremely frustrating at times and I found myself dying most of the time due to an unfair glitch that launches me 15 feet into the air.If it weren't for the co-op mode then I probably wouldn't have carried on with the game.Although there are alot of glitches, it is still fun and enjoyable however I do strongly recommend that you play this with a friend.

								The Forest is a well developed game with both it's positives and negatives. The graphics are superb for a 870mb game and the gameplay is quick and smooth making it an enjoyable experience. However for the amount of time the game has been around it seems fairly limited in development. Yes, the producers do keep bringing out 'small' updates and generally listen to the community when it comes to little hot fixes. But the content of the game iss very limited, you are isolated to only 1 island to live off, you dont have the option to leave the island to go in search of different territory. Also there are no achievements or goals to aim for, all you have to do is, chop down trees, gather logs, ransack the respawning suitcases for never ending food and supplies, make a boat, go spelunking and your done.If there was more content in the game and a wider variety of things to craft i would rate this game 9/10, but as it stands I would give it a mere 5/10..

								Haven't played this game a whole lot (I played more than what it says! About 5-6 hours in offline mode), but this is my first impression:This game was a little hard for me at the beginning because those cannibal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were everywhere! Like literally, they wouldn't let me alone for a minute.After understanding a few tricks that you can do in this game (and that you wouldn't imagine would be possible in a game) like covering yourself in mud, I started to get the hang of it.I was building a nice, small house next to a rock, but those ♥♥♥♥ers were there to bother me every single day, so one day I decided to kill one of those ♥♥♥♥♥es and put his head, legs and arms on a pole.  From that day, ♥♥♥♥♥es never came to visit me.The next day, while I was hunting rabbits, I realized they had a big camp right next to my house -_-...I was ready to kill all sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es, but then I fell from about 10 meters and died.  I was in a cave full of bodies hanging from the ceiling and it was 3 AM, so I just ragequitted.Definitely going to do the same thing today.Oh yes, this game has a lot of bugs, but you know, it's in its alpha stage.

								Game is awesome, I've been waiting for a game like this one for a long time. Obviously there is a ton of bugs, but come on, it's only alpha, isn't it? This game reminds me of an old game ""Stranded"" but with more gore and horror. Introduction was awesome, I'm still wondering whether I can find this boy or not (he got kidnapped by these tribe people). All survival aspects were done quite well, you have to sleep, eat and drink to stay alive. Also, you should consider building wall for defence, but it's not an easy task and you will most likely end up with chopping a lot of trees. Overall feel of this game is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone, maybe not in alpha, but if you want to support the makers, go ahead, it will just make the game improve quicker. The AI is interesting, these mutants really seem to cooperate with one another, they run in groups and attack in groups, from all sides.			"

								I'm not sure to recommend this game since this game is still in alpha.If you like survival games,this game may disappoint you a little bit.There're too many cannibals spawned around your house every 3-5 minutes and this thing made this game become more of a hit and slash game rather than survival game.The survival thing has become just to survive from the constant cannibals attack and you barely have enough time to build a shelter,since you have to defend yourself/flee every time 3-8 cannibals attack you.You need to know that it's really hard to kill just one of the cannibals since they have a lot of HP and high amount of damage.I wrote those things on the feedback discussion page,and I really hope they read it and repair it on the next update.If they solve the cannibal problem,there're tons of reasons to buy this game.I will totally recommend it ! The game is really interesting and you'll spend a lot of time collecting resources to build your fortress,collecting foods to save for the night time,and think how you'll survive the day each morning.The game is very realistic and I don't think you'll find any other kind of this game on steam.Of course I know that there're tons of survival games in steam,but this one is different.It's not just simply collect food-water-build shelter.You really have to build the epic impenetrable fortress in order to survive the overwhelming number of cannibals hunting you everyday.You can even burn their body parts to attract them if you want to kill some cannibals.If you have finished building your fortress,you can explore the other parts of the island,and you can even build a raft and travel to other islands ! So I suggest you wait for a while until this game is finished.This is a great game with great idea of gameplay.It's just not perfect yet because it's not done.It'll become a favourite survival game in the future.

								I am obsessed with this game right now it's so fun. I have about 20 hours of gameplay and I have been having a blast crafting, building, and showing the natives that I'm not somebody to be trifled with. I'm decked out in nearly maxed out bone armor and have built myself  some defensive/offensive traps and a sturdy wall to protect my beach-side retreat. I even  have a dock, a raft, and a houseboat with a bed and decorative lighting. This game is awesome so far! Great graphics; smooth/speedy game performance; Pretty smart A.I.; item and base crafting; weather effects; and the list goes on. Coop has been very fun too and building can obviously go much more quickly. Enough, Buy it already.  Did I mention great Developers as well.I now have 287 hours of game play in The Forest and it's still my favorite coop survival/action game by far.  And of course single player is awesome and super intense in this game for certain.			"

You can tell a lot of hard work has went into this game, the environments look amazing. The gameplay is fun and challenging. Well worth a purchase.			"

								I found a dead man impaled by a katana in the forest. I took this blade out of him, like The Sword In The Stone. I felt awesome. My brother continued to bash skulls with his upgraded rock. It was a big rock. Then a red, blood soaked rock. Rocks are great. Raccoons climb trees when startled. I was hungry. Then sad because I couldn't catch the racoon with my rock. Should have thrown the katana.We spotted a rainbow. This game is fantastic.			"

								The Forest is a well developed game with both it's positives and negatives. The graphics are superb for a 870mb game and the gameplay is quick and smooth making it an enjoyable experience. However for the amount of time the game has been around it seems fairly limited in development. Yes, the producers do keep bringing out 'small' updates and generally listen to the community when it comes to little hot fixes. But the content of the game iss very limited, you are isolated to only 1 island to live off, you dont have the option to leave the island to go in search of different territory. Also there are no achievements or goals to aim for, all you have to do is, chop down trees, gather logs, ransack the respawning suitcases for never ending food and supplies, make a boat, go spelunking and your done.If there was more content in the game and a wider variety of things to craft i would rate this game 9/10, but as it stands I would give it a mere 5/10..

								The Forest starts out with you're character finding himself in a tough position in the middle of a spooky forest and he must craft, build, eat and fight to survive in the dangerous areas of this large open world game.The world of The Forest is very well layed out and the most enjoyable part of the game are the caves that you can explore and raid for more supplies to help you thrive.The base building in the game is quite good, but expect alot of grinding for recourses as it takes very long to collect them.The combat can be extremely frustrating at times and I found myself dying most of the time due to an unfair glitch that launches me 15 feet into the air.If it weren't for the co-op mode then I probably wouldn't have carried on with the game.Although there are alot of glitches, it is still fun and enjoyable however I do strongly recommend that you play this with a friend.

								Haven't played this game a whole lot (I played more than what it says! About 5-6 hours in offline mode), but this is my first impression:This game was a little hard for me at the beginning because those cannibal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were everywhere! Like literally, they wouldn't let me alone for a minute.After understanding a few tricks that you can do in this game (and that you wouldn't imagine would be possible in a game) like covering yourself in mud, I started to get the hang of it.I was building a nice, small house next to a rock, but those ♥♥♥♥ers were there to bother me every single day, so one day I decided to kill one of those ♥♥♥♥♥es and put his head, legs and arms on a pole.  From that day, ♥♥♥♥♥es never came to visit me.The next day, while I was hunting rabbits, I realized they had a big camp right next to my house -_-...I was ready to kill all sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es, but then I fell from about 10 meters and died.  I was in a cave full of bodies hanging from the ceiling and it was 3 AM, so I just ragequitted.Definitely going to do the same thing today.Oh yes, this game has a lot of bugs, but you know, it's in its alpha stage.

								Game is awesome, I've been waiting for a game like this one for a long time. Obviously there is a ton of bugs, but come on, it's only alpha, isn't it? This game reminds me of an old game ""Stranded"" but with more gore and horror. Introduction was awesome, I'm still wondering whether I can find this boy or not (he got kidnapped by these tribe people). All survival aspects were done quite well, you have to sleep, eat and drink to stay alive. Also, you should consider building wall for defence, but it's not an easy task and you will most likely end up with chopping a lot of trees. Overall feel of this game is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone, maybe not in alpha, but if you want to support the makers, go ahead, it will just make the game improve quicker. The AI is interesting, these mutants really seem to cooperate with one another, they run in groups and attack in groups, from all sides.			"

								The forest deserves on my opinion a highly recommendation of 101% The story of this game is awesome. There more you find out, the more exciting it gets. I played this game straight until the end with someone who has already finished the game (I finished it in 7 hours) and since I rushed the game I will probably play it again with someone who hasnt finished it yet to get a closer look at the things (pictures, dead humans etc.). The good thing is, even though I finished the game I can still do alot of things like building my own empire and invite my friends to use them as my slave and let them finish building it for me.			"

								I am obsessed with this game right now it's so fun. I have about 20 hours of gameplay and I have been having a blast crafting, building, and showing the natives that I'm not somebody to be trifled with. I'm decked out in nearly maxed out bone armor and have built myself  some defensive/offensive traps and a sturdy wall to protect my beach-side retreat. I even  have a dock, a raft, and a houseboat with a bed and decorative lighting. This game is awesome so far! Great graphics; smooth/speedy game performance; Pretty smart A.I.; item and base crafting; weather effects; and the list goes on. Coop has been very fun too and building can obviously go much more quickly. Enough, Buy it already.  Did I mention great Developers as well.I now have 287 hours of game play in The Forest and it's still my favorite coop survival/action game by far.  And of course single player is awesome and super intense in this game for certain.			"

								I'm not sure to recommend this game since this game is still in alpha.If you like survival games,this game may disappoint you a little bit.There're too many cannibals spawned around your house every 3-5 minutes and this thing made this game become more of a hit and slash game rather than survival game.The survival thing has become just to survive from the constant cannibals attack and you barely have enough time to build a shelter,since you have to defend yourself/flee every time 3-8 cannibals attack you.You need to know that it's really hard to kill just one of the cannibals since they have a lot of HP and high amount of damage.I wrote those things on the feedback discussion page,and I really hope they read it and repair it on the next update.If they solve the cannibal problem,there're tons of reasons to buy this game.I will totally recommend it ! The game is really interesting and you'll spend a lot of time collecting resources to build your fortress,collecting foods to save for the night time,and think how you'll survive the day each morning.The game is very realistic and I don't think you'll find any other kind of this game on steam.Of course I know that there're tons of survival games in steam,but this one is different.It's not just simply collect food-water-build shelter.You really have to build the epic impenetrable fortress in order to survive the overwhelming number of cannibals hunting you everyday.You can even burn their body parts to attract them if you want to kill some cannibals.If you have finished building your fortress,you can explore the other parts of the island,and you can even build a raft and travel to other islands ! So I suggest you wait for a while until this game is finished.This is a great game with great idea of gameplay.It's just not perfect yet because it's not done.It'll become a favourite survival game in the future.

Early Access Review
								EDITED TO UPDATEIt's been a couple of years now that I've gotten to enjoy this title, and in this time, the game has improved and added so much that it's crazy to look back and see how awesome it was even before all of the beautiful updates.  So many new features and functions have been continuously added, and graphics continue to be improved.  It's easy to see that the team working on this game LOVE their work - this game is their baby.The Forest is still phenomenal to me, and despite having logged (as of right now) 80+ hours of gameplay, there is still so much left for me to try, and plenty left to explore.  New weapons have been added (including a wicked katana) and new building features have left the options so expansive for us players that I no longer see myself getting bored of it.  You can build anything you want on this game, from small cabins, to floating boat houses, to humongous castles made mostly of rocks.  Furniture is also included, like a bed and a weapon rack.I once complained of the imbalance between ease and difficulty of the AI enemies.  They have improved greatly on this imbalance.  I still find myself dying from time to time, but it is so much easier to defend yourself now against powerful cannibals.  Fights are no longer boring because you are constantly on your toes, making sure not to take too many hits, and probably resetting traps constantly.  All structures can be torn down, even by yourself with accidental explosives or chopping a tree too close to home.  It brings much more dynamic now, as you cannot simply stow away in a walled fort and ignore the enemies as they will, within minutes, knock down holes in your defenses.It's exciting to see how great it is, knowing they are adding more every couple of weeks.  This is one early access game that I doubt anyone has regretted buying - it's been a real pleasure watching it grow.__________________________________________________________Obviously, since this game is not yet finished, I've come across some minor bugs or annoying glitches, but considering just how severely underdeveloped it still really is, I'm impressed with the quality.  The bugs have been few and far between and the only one that actually effected proper gameplay seems to have been fixed.  From my gameplay hours, the few words I can best use to describe this experience would probably be, ""Zen"" and ""Frustration,"" which may some like a paradoxical combination, but let me explain.This game is relaxing.  With stunning visuals, the scenery alone is enough to encourage lengthy exploration of its open world environment.  I've enjoyed running through thick forests while trying to strategize about where and how I'm going to build my base camp.  On the way, though, I can't help but stop and admire the lay of the land and the mountains in the distance.  You'll find funny-looking trees, beached sharks, beautiful and detailed sunsets, an expansive sky of stars, and the strangest of the island decoration, the random effigies and shrines that will pop up all over the place (most of the time, around your camp, which is gonna make you squirm a bit.)  Right now, this ""open-world"" is currently limited, but I don't really like to use that word because limited implies something small or confining; that's not the case.  I've already spent a few hours of playtime over several different restarts, and I still haven't discovered all there is to see.  I'm kind of at the point where I enjoy exploring so much that I may start a game just for the sole task of unearthing each corner of the available map, before it's updated and expanded more.  The best part of exploration is finding all of the creepy and often gruesome landmarks of the map - leftovers of what appears to be tourists that were abruptly killed by something unexplainable.  These patches of death pop up all over the place, just like the monsters that stroll around the island looking for their next human meal.  When you come across these setups, you will be left uncomfortably eager to disappear, and fast.  You see them and look around for a brief moment, before getting the feeling of, ""Oh snap, something bad went down around here, I'd better not linger.""So, the scenery is great, the controls are pretty unique, the graphics are generally bad to the bone, but I do see one major flaw in this game that makes me feel it won't be a long-term relationship: the lack of action, or rather, the periods of rest inbetween cannibal encounters.  Now that I understand how the dynamics of the game works, I can much more easily track the movements of the cannibal packs.  I've learned the general distance it takes to either be seen or to stay safely hidden.  What I don't like, is how this feels to be based solely on the distance between you and the monsters, instead of, say, how Skyrim works, with having to constantly stay in cover, out of sight.  In The Forest, you could be standing in the open, they'll be walking nearby, but as long as they don't come within a relatively short range of you, they're not going to 'notice' you, and that makes things simultaneously easier and a lot more boring.  Now, there still have been times that I've taken a stroll through the thickest parts of the forest and was suddenly ambushed, and I appreciate that level of suspense and fear that is preserved with travel.  When you're in the thick foliage and trees, it makes it way harder to spot them before they spot you.  Also, the mutant packs seem to randomly deviate from a slow casual walk to a sudden sprint, making you even more cautious to keep close to camp at all times.On that note, here's where things REALLY get me snoring.  Once you've learned the essence of the game, which is to quickly establish a walled fortress with lots of fires all around you, the action starts to come by a lot less frequently and sometimes it will cease all-together.  With my perfect strategy, I have a small house built within ten minutes of starting the game, of which during this time, no cannibals have seemed to spawn yet.  It's not often that I see the monsters before I'm done building more than half of my survival necessities.  IF you DO happen to run into them before you have protection, it's upsettingly hard to defend yourself against them, which seems unfair.  They will come to you in a pack, and they will attack all at once.  Sometimes, they will one-hit-KO you.  So here's the gist of what I'm getting at: if you do it the right way, you become OP. If you slack and struggle and don't build what you need ASAP, the cannibals will be OP.  The flaw is when you get too good at what you're doing, and the cannibals no longer become a threat and literally all you're doing is camping out at the entrance of your shack, staring each other down.  I'm hoping they will pay a lot of careful attention to this in the next few updates, and  perhaps add some interesting counterattacks to their dynamics; maybe some fires to burn down some of your walls, or flinging burning stones at you?  Why not have them sneak into your camp while you sleep?What keeps me excited about this game is knowing that the possibilities are endless, and the creators can really initiate some imaginative scenarios to keep it from becoming slack.  The bugs I've come across are as follows:Trying to build something and getting stuck on the 'placement' mode, where the opaque object stays in your sight wherever you go but will not be placed no matter what you press.  Restart fixed it.Trying to click on your builds and nothing happens.  Restart fixed it.There are still objects that disappear inbetween saving and reloading a game, like the cloths you can collect.Sticks will sometimes disappear right after I cut down a small tree.Once, to escape an ambush, I fled into the ocean and just kept swimming.  The cannibals kept chase, but they weren't swimming - they were running along the floor of the ocean beneath me.			"

								Summary:The Forest is an extremely incredible game for early access, and doesn't disappoint! Realistic, scary and beautiful.As one of the survivors of a mysterious plane crash on an island, you are put to the task to survive. There are cannibals, they will kill you. That is why you need to kill them. You will have to explore dark caves, cannibal camps and historical events which all makes sense in the end. All you have to do is survive and complete the game, yes there is an ending. All you have to do is to survive, survive in The Forest. ----------------------------------------------------------Holy crap this is amazing for an alpha game, even with bugs! Just wow!Looks good, feels very creepy and is extremely fun, especially with friends.I would strongly recommend this game above any other early access survival game. Sure, Rust is also good, but The Forest is a different kind of game.This game is very realistic (apart from bugs  & stuff, but you will get used to them and usually think they are funny) compared with Rust for example. Rust isn't realistic..			"

								First: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to support the developers and not actually play.The game doesn't save for a lot of people including me. BUT this is alpha and for an alpha this game is quite gorgeous, and I did enjoy my team playing.You'll be building a shelter and some weird mutant freak is stalking you from behind, you can either try to kill him/her and risk having his/her entire family trying to eat you or you can try to scare him away. The AI is decent, much better than the AI in some Alpha games that have been out for a while now *cough* DayZ *cough*But even with all this, you should only buy it if you absolutely want a game where youre only buying it to help continue its development. After all this game has so much potential and I cant wait to see what it becomes.			"

								Type of Game:First Person Survival HorrorVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Rust, DayZ, and to a lesser degree The Stomping GroundThe Good:- A refreshing take on the survival/crafting genre that emphasizes narrative more than its competitors.- The large and open world creates an exciting setting for exploration and resource gathering.- Thankfully most of the world (that I’ve seen so far) has elements that keep it interesting. While a lot of the game finds the player navigating a forest (SURPRISE!) you’ll find a number of set pieces and environments that make it worth venturing further.- The Forest is very difficult, as a survival game should be. Resources must be gathered and shelter crafted. All the while you are being observed/stalked by the island’s frightening inhabitants. Finding the right balance of finding shelter, warding off the natives, and venturing out is arduous but rewarding. It almost has a roguelike or PDL feel about it.- The Forest feels like an interactive version of the TV show Lost. As I played I experienced similar feelings of wonder and intrigue that I did with the plot of the show.- The crafting system is quite different from most crafting games I played. The player uses a Survival Book to identify items that they want to craft. Once selected, you place the outline of the object on the ground, which visually features each of the resources needed to craft the item. As you begin adding resources you can see them being added to the overall crafted item in real time. It is a small detail, but very immersive and intuitive.- Resource gathering also has a neat way about it. One example is wood: wood comes from trees that you literally have to chop down (chunks of it slowly remove as you chop) and then harvest from the fallen tree, which actually falls down with force and physics.- Resource management is handled by a backpack with limited space, which you have to manage in real time. Combining objects requires you to place them together in the middle of the satchel. I found this to be a welcome addition to immersion factor.- For the first time when playing a “survival” game, I felt like I was using actual survival techniques to stay alive. Questions that one would really ask themselves in a survival situation were constantly running through my mind: “Should I stay close to the plane wreckage and build shelter here, as there is an abundance of supplies? Do I venture further away so that I potentially steer clear of the natives? What if I find a cave that will offer the security of only having to protect one entrance?” etc.The Bad:- There a numerous graphical glitches that pop up occasionally. Just checking out the community boards on Steam will enlighten you to the extent of these glitches. Some of these are TERRIFYING!- While there is definitely plenty to see and do in the current build, the game seems to be missing more elaborate fauna and flora. It would add a lot to the already enjoyable survival experience.- As enjoyable as the plot/setting is, I feel like there should be some further incentive to explore. I wouldn’t want anything that holds my hand through the narrative, but some elusive shrines or hidden lore would be welcome.Can you play it while the children are awake?:Absolutely not. The main screen depicts a gruesome vigil that unintentionally terrified my six year old when he woke up from his nap. This game is labeled a survival horror game for a reason. Did I make time to complete it?The game doesn’t appear to have an ending, as such. At my best I survived a whopping three days on the island, which I felt was an accomplishment.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.While a single player survival horror game may sound like it would get stagnant quickly, the intelligently designed environment and intriguing overall game design keep it from getting old. The Forest excels in areas that I never knew were lacking from other survival games: purpose, intrigue, and design. I went into it expecting another DayZ clone, but ended up enjoying something quite unique. This all from a game that isn’t even close to completion. As long as the development team doesn’t deviate from the core gameplay fundamentals, the updates to this game should end up being free DLC to early backers.This game is well worth the $14.99 asking price.A Quick Look at Those Games you Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

								I saw a tribesman run around and was playing in the grass just running in circles, i didn,t want to interrupt him. I cut down a tree, The tree landed right in front of him as he almost got smashed he looked around, it took awhile then he started to run around and play again. I collected the wood logs and it was 2 logs left infront of the playing tribesman.As i fully was focused to collect them all, i gathered the first one and as fast as it went i only heard a knock * I got hit *. The nice playing peaceful tribesman, he... He punched me as much it hurted the character it hurt my heart.As the game started to bug my character got launched up in the sky, i saw the last sight of ground and i was thinking abit... It took a minute and i started to see clouds.As fast as i got lauched up in the sky i got down, hitting the ground hard my legs got puched up my butt.As i layed down as the screen turned gray i saw the tribesman running around playing again, as i fell next to him.Would do it again 10/10			"

								Okay, after 24 hours of playtime I have the following to say;This game is absolutely fun to play. Honestly has the potential to become one of the better survivor games out there. Highly recommend buying it now that it is in alpha develop before it becomes 30+ euros after release.Pros:- The amount of food/water needed per day for sustain is realistic.- The graphics look really good and the gameplay is very smooth.- Combat system/variation of weapons is very nice.- Big map with loads of places to discoverCons:- No proper story-line, no empathy for the kid. (I seriously don't care if I find him back all FUBAR)- Fire-resistant mutated cannibals, like what?- Not able to radio in a rescue team?TIPS:- Get NPCs, be able to make a survival group or something that also survived the plane crash.- Be able to build more stuff, different kinds of traps/houses etc.- Make fishing a more viable way or survival.

								It's simple - This is the best survival game so far. I compare this game to also an Early Access title, called Savage Lands. It's good compare because both games have similar game mechanics. You have an open world, you can play single player and multiplayer - coop, and you have monsters or canibals, what ever. One of the most important points of such a game is, the The Forest has very good looking graphics. The other one is the gameplay, if you look down, you can see your own body like in other games like BF3-4 or ArmA etc. Every modern FPS should have this important detail! If you get hurt or dirty, you can see it on your clothes. The canibals and the whole atmosphere is creepy to me. It is a real horror survival game. There are some canibals, very realistic, but also sci-fi mutants, but its not disturbing the feeling. I had played only 6 hours, but it is enough to tell you, this game rocks! I recommend this dope!It would be nice to see PVP in the future. "

								The game devs have been working hard at this game and it shows. The updates just keep coming. However, there are some bugs here and there and if you have a low computer, it probably will have some problems. That being said this game is overall excellent.The cannibals like to scout before they attack but once they know where you are they will send larger groups to investigate. If you have built structures, they will notice you sooner and come in very large groups. If you decide to wander around without building much, it takes longer for them to notice and you may only see a few at a time. The caves are terrifying especially when you've been dragged in and don't know where you are.If you are interested in a open world survival game with some horror element to it, I fully recommend this game.

								The idea of the game is good for everyone who like adventures and discovering nature, like me. It will let you join the survive journey when you get lost in a forest in an island after an airplane's crash. You have to find food, water and learn how to make tools and weapons to survive, fighting with cannibals, and facing other danger stuffs in the forest. The game's graphic and sounds are good like reality and you will feel real fear like you actually get in that scenes. It give you chance to overcome your fears when you accidentally have one in your life!			"

								Purchase Date: 1/23/17Initial Review: 1/25/17Craft/Building Mechanics:So far the game has been exceeding my expectations as far as crafting complexity goes. When comparing to other games of this genre, it appeared as though it was going to be to dumbed down to be of any real fun, but as it turns out, the simple nature of the crafting system is complimented and reinforced positively by the sheer flexibility of the building system. You're not constrained to build on any particular grid-line, tile or voxel. It feels much more like drawing lines in Microsoft Paint, encouraging free-form building. This is a huge plus for me. Atmosphere:A huge plus is in the environment and atmosphere. Sounds are superb, the forest undergrowth is accurate, the lighting is realistic and purposeful, and the legitimate sense of unease is deffinately there. I'm always looking around for movement to make sure I'm not getting ambushed by enemies, glacing at every dash in the shrubery only to learn it was only a deer racing through the surrounding flora. Ocean swimming is likely one of the most impressive moments actually, because of the flow of waves and swells in the ocean that are very realistic, and makes me feel as though I'm really swimming in the ocean (I'm a deep sea diver, so you can't fool me with lame ocean mechanics). Combat:The current combat system is alright, although I'll enjoy it more when the system evolves more as far as enemy tactics and siege mechanics. I've only encountered the basic enemies so far, so my frame of reference is limited, however I'm looking forward to seeing the tougher more advanced mobs further along in the game. Storyline:Despite what I read in other reviews, there actually is a storyline, and a greater mystery to unfold as you explore and scavenge your way through the surface of the landscape in addition to the depths of it's underdark. Overall:I endorse this game for those who like survival horror/sandbox genre games, and don't mind playing pre-launch style titles. This game gets regular updates and from what I've seen in the changelogs, it just keeps getting better and better. Totally worth the $15 that I paid, (bought it for my kid's steam account as well for local Co-Op capabilities). If you're complaining about the price being too much, maybe it's time to get a better job. I'll review again after a month or so of additional gameplay.  "

Early Access Review
								I've played approximately 35 hours now in this game and I think it is well worth the money. I've never been into anything horror related, albeit this game is more of a thriller than a horror game, but what really makes the game so enjoyable is the co-op experience. Honestly, I have been watching this game for about a year and I'm glad that I waited some because earlier versions of the game looked somewhat uneventful. 0.52b is a ton of fun and I really hope this game makes it to beta/full release very soon because I would love to see more content.Pros:-Expansive crafting system that is enjoyable to learn-Surprisingly attractive graphics for a $15 game-Lore-intensive storyline, that is extremely subjective. Requires the player to figure out what happened. Different people have different theories often.-Stable multiplayer, never really experience FPS issues -Suspenseful gameplay, especially when traversing caves, with nothing but a lighter-Enemy classes, where taking out a leader first can end an enemy raidCons:-UI is difficult to use especially during combat. It makes sense for this to be the case but hot keys would be a great addition-Collisions for items, sometimes falling off the map, namely smaller objects-Collisions with moveable objects, sometimes causing you to launch into the air and lose significant health, including players-AI could use improvements, I've seen natives and animals often caught running in endless circles for no apparent reason-The building system needs to be polished. It's pretty difficult to build an attractive base at this point in the game. Maybe the devs want to keep it that way but I like to build bases with 90 degree angled walls and platforms that connect seemlessly. Right now it is very difficult to accomplish that. Overall I really enjoy this game. It has a great effect of realism. The audio is done very well and that is extremely important to me because I produce music and sometimes scores, so I tend to critique that sort of thing harshly. It's not a perfect game but I think it could become a new standard if the devs ever finish it.			"

There might be some bugs but these always get fixed pretty fast so dont worry about that.. The creator adds new stuff and works on the game pretty much too so thats good to... anyway.

								When this game first came out, it was a  buggy mess with a pretty good premise and a lot of promises. Now, it's a fairbly buggy mess that has so far delivered on a surprising amount of those promises. I played this game a few times with my friends, built a few fortresses, killed a whole bunch of mutants, ran from armsies because seriously what the hellisthatthingkillitohgod. Then, I heard that the most recent update introduced a win condition. The story finally had an ending. So I redownloaded the game, saddled up with a buddy and ran through it. As of about ten minutes ago, we watched the final cutscene. Sweet mother of god. I'm honestly not sure what I expected, but that...was not it. We're still in our voice channel freaking out, because that was one of the BEST videogame endings I have ever played through. Good job, guys. Good job.			"

								Really good game to play with friends.Played the entire game with two friends, found basically all the items, and seen the game develop from day #1. The map now has a sinkhole. You can build your own base. You can craft weapons. There is now a story and a checklist for tasks to be done. The NPCs are good, but sometimes take a lot to down. There is plenty of variety in the map area of places to explore, from the plane to NPC camps to the mountain and also down the sinkhole. After a lot of exploring we finally decided to find the climbing axe and descend into the sinkhole, where we found the next area of the game, which has not yet been developed -  a metal door that looks like it leads into a Japanese-style war bunker, or some Lost-type♥♥♥♥♥♥ who knows? . The glitches have certainly been fixed form the original alpha, and I'm sure more will come.Overall, for a game still in alpha, The Forest is a lot of fun with friends, to explore the map and kill cannibals with.7/10			"

Be warned though, as you build a biger and bigger camp the monsters in the game get bigger too.Have fun "

								AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. Open world adventure in a mysterious land. No instruction manual, but somewhat of a reference guide on the environment around you (which keeps expanding the more you discover, the guide, not the land*).  The story is very light so far; you're stranded on this unknown land due to your plane crashing, your son is taken by the natives, and you gotta make yourself boss to fend off the zombie-like people roaming around (which are mostly naked...yes, even women) *interest spark*.     It isn't a hack and slash, you must time your attacks precisely- and even though not hard, it can be very punishing (similar to Dark Souls series) were you must play smart between taking hits, healing and reacting to the enemy attacks. Practically anything and everything can be gathered and crafted into something. A decent amount of weapon choices: spears, axes, swords, explosives, exc. catapults, tree houses, water houses, bombs, booby traps, skull bombs all included  ***The best thing is that the developers are still working on it and plan on adding more awesome things. Multiplayer is pretty fun, jump into your friends' games or invite them to yours to create villages of awesomeness. Graphics are very good considering the budget on this game.well what are you waiting for mate? buy it!			"

Now however times have changed, i recieved this off humble monthly and i have been very very impressed. Atmosphere is creepy/intense, weather effect is good, over all user friendly game play/crafting etc, good/decent AI (in comparison to a multitude of other EA titles that are god awful), bugs few and far between and all with a story that you can follow ""at will"" put this game IMO in the top 3 openworld survival EA games that i personally own. Nice work devs. Keep it up.			"

								Welcome to my extremely serious review of ""The Forest"" The Forest is an early access title that definitely shows promise for its future. Development seems to be active as bug fixes and content updates are being put out quite frequently. The stability of the game isn't very polished yet, but the adventurous nature of the gameplay is what keeps me playing. Forage, fortify, hunt, explore, and... hide? ( The last one was a bit of a joke, unless you're a little scaredy cat such as myself ) Survive the onslaught of cannibalistic tribe members! These things will creepily stalk you from the very start of the game. Tensions between the player and the AI savages can increase depending on the player's actions. Will you kill them on sight? Or perhaps simply engage into some friendly political diplomacy? Nawh. Either way, the cannibals will eventually start to breathe down your neck to the point where having a sturdy fort might sound like a good idea. After that concept piledrives itself into that noggin of yours, It's time to get to work! Most of your time spent at the start of the game will most likely be building the base of your dreams. Unless you're an intelligent person that strives for optimization, you'll probably put way too much effort into building a badass fortress ( I'm implying the fact that cutting down trees is all you'll be doing if you don't think small and compact ). After you've made your sweet base, It's time to venture out into the unknown wilderness and explore! Don't mind the nudists off in the horizon that dash from tree to tree, they're simply observant individuals, that's all. Gameplay: Cutting trees / 10Story: Hm? Son is kidnapped by cannibals? I have more important matters to attend to such as spending days on end crafting and refining my masterpiece of a base.Bugs: Quite buggy but not like BUGGY buggy, you know what i'm saying?Overall: Buy it with some friends and you'll have a grand ol' time.

								The Forest is an astonishing game! The story is really interesting and entertaining as well as the multiplayer mode. You can play all by yourself, with your friends or online on a server. I'm in love with the textures, especially when you can see the beautiful sun shining through the woods.Of course, there are still a lot of bugs but with every update it gets a little better and I don't really think it's that bad.

								An amazing survival game, where you can explore through caves or run across plains. From shooting down a deer with your bow you made out of sticks and cloth, or grab at oysters at the beautiful ocean. But be warned! Monsters crawl around, and can attack at any minute (unless you have a cheatcode activated, of course) At the blink of an eye, your life could be taken with one swipe from one of the powerful mutants. The island is contaminated with these, some angry, some passive, but never fully peaceful. An incredible game! I find that multiplayer makes it more fun, because I don't necessarily enjoy single player games for too long. Stab your pals and play tug-of-war with a human leg, you decide. Fight over which gets to cook the body, or who gets to keep the lizard skin!Despite the glitches, the game is amazing, and I really hope it keeps improving. I suggest more fur armors, like jackets and hoods that you can create out of pelts and furs. And, of course, make the cannibals less glitchy, and make them smarter. (No offense to those man-eaters, right there.)			"

Not to mention cutting up cannibals that attack us and eating them for easy food.Looking forward to all the content to come! Such a fun game for one that isn't even finished!			"

								Easily one of the best survival/sandbox games around. The crafting is straightforward yet rewarding. The hunger/thirst system isn't overdone to where it ruins the game. The combat system is fluid and satisfying. The environment is immersive due to the amazing audio and visual work.Speaking of the visuals, I have A LOT to say about this game's graphics. Not only does it have the most gorgeous visuals (compared to the likes of other early access survival games Rust, Miscreated, 7 Days to Die, etc.) but it's clear that the developers put effort into optimizing the game as much as possible, providing a smooth and frustration-free gameplay experience. I can't say the same for the other survival games I mentioned, which are all graphically inferior to The Forest, yet also run at a much lower framerate. I can really tell that a lot of time and effort was put into optimizing this game because my GPU load actually reaches 90% and above during gameplay, and I constantly get above 60 FPS on max settings on my GTX 960 4GB.  With other survival games that are terribly optimized, my GPU load will be at 50-60%, and my CPU load will be at maybe 70%, but the game still runs like trash. That's poor optimization.I have high hopes for this game, and will continue to play it and support it, recommend it to my friends, etc. Can't wait for additional content and the official release.

								If you wish to play a truly-gripping survival horror game still in production, and wish to give feedback and help the development of said game, then The Forest is truly for you-- if you can deal with bugs, glitches, and some unpolished spots. Despite said issues, there are several redeeming factors-- I am an avid horror fan, and many horror games have failed to deliver for me, but I can assure you that The Forest is a truly nerve wracking experience and it is quite exquisite. There are several more things the developers plan to add and are currently working on, and if you have any ideas or feedback to give to them, it is a perfect time, seeing as how it is in Early Access and still in heavy development. If you can't deal with some unpolished spots, bugs, and such, I still highly recommend the game-- Just wait a while until they flesh the game out more and polish it.			"

								Good survival game to say the least.It has loads of bugs to be honest,and it can get a little bit flustrating as i write this review after being killed 2 times in a row because of the cannibals hitting bugs.So you have to take it easy and calm.It's a good thing they introduced peaceful mode with the last update(0.03),and if you are new to the game i recomend playing on that mode and build a good base and some traps as they now come in a larger number than before.Speaking of a base the game construction system is unique and perfect as it is(i hope they will put more types of houses in future as they are only 4 now with the house boat that can't be built) and the trees chopping system will never get old :) Another thing that i hope they introduce is more animals that you can hunt instead of rabbits,lizards and fish,you are in a Forest why only so little variety of food you can gather? Another thing that i don't like is the way that cannibals are in this stage they really need to improve the way that they react and attack you.I recomend this game to anyone that wants to be a survivor,it is a relaxing,fun and entertaining game if you play it on peaceful or even normal  and when cannibals are cannibals not bombs that trow you 100 meters in the air.

								I've owned the Forest nearly since it first appeared on Steam (or at least since I first spotted it and instantly bought it) and watched it grow from a scary, solo forest game with much charm to an incredible survival experience.The graphics are superb, something that few of the other games in the genre can compete with. The best thing about it is how much better it's optimized than the other early access survival games out there. You don't have to put your settings down just to be able to run the game at acceptable FPS. This is an example where devs know that adding content to a game isn't the most important thing. (Dat water though)That said, since I've started playing The Forest the content that has been added has only improved the experience. I've found with some games in the genre that they often take a few steps back with their updates, changing things that didn't need changing. So far The Forest has been building on its strengths and it's not trying to be something that it's not, nor is it copying the other survival games simply to be able to compete in this overcrowded genre.The crafting system is easy, yet has a lot to offer and be creative with. We've built everything from a tree-house town to a large compound. The traps are a nice touch too.Since the introduction of co-op and mp it's also brought a whole new perspective to the game....and it's less scary with friends around. :) I feel like The Forest is a reason to trust in Early Access games and I feel comfortable recommending it to everyone I know. Even at its current state it's a game that surpasses many of the other survival games.			"

								Ok so to start, this game is constantly updating and is always looking for ways to improve. The creators of the game really care about the community too. I've posted loads of feedback/errors and most of the time, someone whos created the game or just the fan base responds quickly. If no one responds they go ahead and release a hotfix to fix the issue. The game is in alpha but who cares, buy it now and watch The Forest rise to its undoubted potential. seriously though xDThe game requires a decent pc to run, but all this will be fixed with optimization over time, so nothing to worry about there. I have a GTX 770 and an i5 3570 and have no problem running the game 60 FPS while recording. Think of this game as GTA 5 ( the open world aspect ) meets minecraft ( the survival aspect ) having a baby naming it johnny but then legally changing it to The Forest and constantly feeding it more and more updates to make it better. And there you have The Forest. I don't recommend this game, i honestly think everyone should own it. Like i said GTA meets minecraft. But in all seriousness its minecraft on steroids and some other drug taken from sweet savory squid intestines and pork tenderloin. Ok so with all that aside, you're all going to buy this game and if you dont like it, well to be honest... i dont know whats wrong with you <3			"

								First run through I got my camp set up near all of unusable tents, had a fire going, and everything was alright until it began to rain. I needed sleep, so I slept and woke up in pitch-black darkness with rain still pouring down. Back to sleep, wake up and it's still dark and raining; repeat about four more times trying to find the day until I got ambushed, sent to the cave, and found the glitchy little crevice behind the dead man on the table then fell to my death under the map. I'm pretty sure I got beaten to death with a dead seagull when I was trying to build a basic shelter on the beach on my second try. When I got back, I saw a lone tribal on the beach. he tilted his head back and let out a high-pitched shriek and then  saw a group five tribals run out of the woods onto the beach; I assume the two actions were related, I hope that they were. I was terrified getting off the plane at the start not knowing how to do anything and jumping at every sound afraid of being rushed by tribesmen, it was so much fun. This game may be in development, and it may be full of bugs and glitches, but it was so worth the $15 dollars. Cannot wait to see it progress.			"

								I'm just going to say that I understand that this is an alpha and an early access game so any negatives I may mention are simply highlights of the main problems that I think should be dealt with sooner rather than later. Its got really good mechanics, it's a very natural and beautiful looking game and has a nice cosy feel to it - it seems to flow quite nicely. It's just I can see it getting a bit repetitive and especially because the likelihood of getting anywhere is slim as the cannibals appear at my base in less than a day (and also whenever I dismember the dead cannibals they tend to explode which killed me midway through my first effigy). Aside from that though it lives up to the hype - it's scary, eerie, and also quite lonely save for the odd turtle or lizard. Also as a side note the rather safe log cabin assembles itself in mid air (not sure if it moves to the ground when finished because I haven't been able to accumulate 82 logs yet). It is a game that would be worth playing at night as it would create a great atmosphere as well as the fact that it might be easier to see things as the in-game brightness can make this quite difficutlt (logical when you're in a cave I know but it does tend to take away the inquisitive nature of the game if you have to study something meticulously up close with a very weak lighter just to see what it actually is). The cannibals themselves though I expected to sort of become more brave and dangerous as the game progressed which i'm sure is the aim in the next few patches, but at present they attack straight away and the fact that they spawned at my base on multiple occasions whilst I was out collecting logs also made it very difficult for me to progress as I couldn't then access my gear. Overall I would say that a few tweaks of the above mentioned issues would make the game worthy of a fuller release were they tackled correctly and with the few developers there are it is a momentous achievement to have produced such an immersive experience so far - I can't wait for what's to come! Keep it up :)			"

								So far on what I have played, it's very good. It has a lot of potential and the exploring aspect of it is pretty good. The only problems that seriously prevent me from playing is the save bug. Where when you host, everyone else has to save first and then leave and then the host saves, otherwise if the host saves first it'll bug the save. This needs to be one of the more higher priority. This save bug is a pain as me and a group of friends just spent 8 hours on two different games because of this bug (and the game randomly crashed with a runtime error). Now I know we should save more often but it really hinders things when people all have to stop what they are doing, save, and then leave so the host can save so the game can be loaded again. Other than that this was really the only game breaking bug we have found. For an alpha it's pretty good apart from the bugs I've mentioned. I also forgot to mention that it runs very well, you don't see many newer games being as smooth anymore it seems.			"

								Truly, restored my faith in indie devs.Never before have I seen so much love put into a game, the developers have provided a horrifying, mysterious, thought provoking and incredible adventure. And one I can share with my friends. The base game crash lands on a mysterious island and you soon discover you are not alone, as you fight to survive, build civilisation, and save your son. Through this, alongside the games brilliant offerings to explore, you discover the dark secret behind the island, and the character you play.As a player who sunk 60hrs into the game prior to the story update, I would recommend that for £9.99, but when the storyline was finally complete, I was truly blown away.This is a no brainer for anyone who enjoys survival games, and I'd still recommend it to any gamer dispite the rare visual bugs that you'd expect from an alpha.If this game isnt even finished, Im SOLD, and you should be too.Well done Endnight Games.

								First run through I got my camp set up near all of unusable tents, had a fire going, and everything was alright until it began to rain. I needed sleep, so I slept and woke up in pitch-black darkness with rain still pouring down. Back to sleep, wake up and it's still dark and raining; repeat about four more times trying to find the day until I got ambushed, sent to the cave, and found the glitchy little crevice behind the dead man on the table then fell to my death under the map. I'm pretty sure I got beaten to death with a dead seagull when I was trying to build a basic shelter on the beach on my second try. When I got back, I saw a lone tribal on the beach. he tilted his head back and let out a high-pitched shriek and then  saw a group five tribals run out of the woods onto the beach; I assume the two actions were related, I hope that they were. I was terrified getting off the plane at the start not knowing how to do anything and jumping at every sound afraid of being rushed by tribesmen, it was so much fun. This game may be in development, and it may be full of bugs and glitches, but it was so worth the $15 dollars. Cannot wait to see it progress.			"

								For a while this game was incredibly buggy; to the point of being unplayable. To some, it may still seem this way. However, if you look at it more objectively you see that most of it isn't buggy. The only two awful bugs that they absolutely NEED to fix to make this game work is the fact that there are some world holes around ponds, and that sometimes you fall down ropes (NOTE: The rope glitch has been fixed). Otherwhise, the AI, the combat, the crafting, everything other than those two things, works marvelously. The only thing that The Forest is currently lacking in is bug fixing, and content. Two things which it SHOULD be lacking in, at this point in the game. Also the Developers are ♥♥♥♥ing great.But anyway, onto the reasons I love the game itself.The thing that really stood out to me wasn't the pretty graphics, or the creepy cannibals, or the survival aspect, it was the cannibal's AI. There are SO many things that the cannibals react and adapt to. I'll give a few examples1: The Cannibals can be somewhat reasoned with - The first few times you see the cannibals, especially if you are NEAR the plane (they see you as less hostile the closer to the plane you are) they aren't there to kill you, or even hurt you. They come to check you out, see if you're a threat, and they'll probably just leave you alone if you're not too much of a threat. For instance, as long as you make sure they are in your line of sight, you don't back up to their advances, or go towards them threateningly, they won't attack. If they run to you and attack once, block it, and then if they attack again, they will ACTUALLY mean to fight. Sometimes they just want to see if they can land a hit, and will back off after you block it. Cutting down trees, overhunting, and overbuilding also makes them more hostile. Hiding your fires from view makes them less hostile as well, as they hate fire. There are many other things that make them more/less hostile, but I myself don't know many anyway. The last, most noteable thing is that if you overhunt, and do things to bother the cannibals, and if you let survivors that spot you get away, they will send raiding parties of increasing numbers after you, until they finally get tired of you surviving them, and send the creepy, huge monsters that are in the trailer at you2: The Combat Is Realistic, and the AI isn't bad at all, especially for an Alpha game - The Forest's combat, while a bit wonky (especially with player versus player) looks fine from first person; it seems heavy hitting, and brutal, with each of your hits knocking the cannibals back, occasionally knocking teeth out. And while the blocking system is currently a bit over powered (you literally can just hold the block button and take 0 damage from hits, provided you have the stamina), they are fixing it slowly; it can't be easy to make a game balanced. The AI acts exactly how you'd expect feral, animal like cannibals to strike at you. They run at you, hit once or twice, then back off because they're frightened of you. (Note this is for the ones that look like little Gollums.) 3: The Variety of Cannibals - This one is a bit of a list, but these tribes compete, and often fight. This also includes the fact that there are a finite number of cannibals in the Forest; they run out eventually.1 Starvers: These are the gollum lookin' dudes I was talking about. They are feral, creepy, and like to laugh maniacally. They are also weak, quick, and probably one of the easiest enemies in the game2 The White Cannibals?: Not sure what their real name is, but they are white skinned to the point of being pale as hell, they are one of the more civilised cannibal tribes, and will do the aforementioned out-checking of you (they're less hostile than the Starvers) They kinda look like aliens sometimes.3 The Brown Cannibals?: Also not sure; these look like normal humans, entirely, they are also more peaceful, and are fairly strong, along with the White Cannibals. 4 The Mutants: Ok here's where we get creepy; these are the huge, multi-limbed animals that like to smash your defenses, and are incredibly difficult to kill. You need fire to kill these bad boys. They come in two categories: The Virginia (Aka spider mutants, they have many legs and are quick, blind, and creepy as hell) and the Octopus Mutants: Which have many many arms, and are strong and chargy.5 Not sure if these deserve their own category, but they are incredibly creepy and sometimes kinda deadly: Mutant Babies. They are deformed monsters that jump at you, and make creepy noises. They are in caves solely. I might edit this to put in more cons as I see them, but for now the only real thing that they need to fix is the two world breaking bugs, the blocking system, and adding some more content as well as making boats actually viable. This game is great, but you might want to wait until it comes out.			"

There's not much you can do after you build the highest teir stuff, and make a base, then you just kinda see how long you can go without falling out of your tree house, but as they add more stuff the game will be far better than Rust, which i regret buying.Goods:- Amazing graphics- Good Crafting system- Easy menu - Co-op is great with freinds- Interesting enemy AIBads:- Long load times- Early access bugs ( Things sinking through ground etc. )If you are okay with waiting for updates then I definitly reccomend this game.

								Ever since it's first early alpha release I have been obsessed with this game. The visuals and stunning the developers went above and beyond to create a living breathing forest atmosphere for players to explore. With simulated weather, altitites, wild life etc the game really immerses players into the island world.As a survival horror, this game takes player surival and believability seriously one of the most realistic survival games I've ever played. Players will be required to keep tabs on their hunger, temperature, thirst levels and infections to survive after their plane has crashed landed. Clean drinking water becomes the upmost importance for players as thirst is constantly going down, and most streams/ponds are poisoned.The game has an amazing crafting system and surivival book for notes and tips on how players can survive and what crafting options they have. Most people have likely already seen videos of the tree cutting, but guys, guys! YOU ACTUALLY CUT DOWN THE TREES. You fell them, with your tools and they fall. Brilliant. Seriously guys we've been gathering pixelated resources for years and trees have never actually fallen. Go buy this game! DO IT! Story mode is coming, but for now multiplayer survival horror is brilliant. If you aren't a fan of survival games, then maybe this isn't the game for you. You are literally stranded on an island so you spend a lot of time in nature trying not to die, which is challenging and rewarding but I can see how some people in this COD erra want more   'action'. There is combat and enemies in this game, but for most players the best strategie to to run, avoid, hide and build until you have a secure location to wage war.			"

Get this if you like being scared. Best jump-scares I've seen.4. Hunting could use some work, but nothing too bad.5. The crafting is pretty easy and fast to learn. 6. The building is pretty fun but limited, which is ok.8. I need people to play with. Great game so far, I can spend a lot more time in this game and I will. 6/10 Stunning game			"

Early Access Review
								First let me start by saying this is EXACTLY how an Early Access game should work.- Devs regularly update.- Devs regularly bug fix and hotfix.- Devs listen to the suggestions of its community.- Game is not the price of a full release AAA game- No DLC in Early Access (sorry that was a little biased)Well done Endnight Games!Ok now on to the real review!Lets talk about the Pros of the game.- GraphicsFor an indie game in Early Access this game looks gorgeous. I find my self completely lost in the game, which it being a sort of horror/survival game makes it really shine.- CraftingIt has a very robust crafting system with plenty of things to craft: armor, weapons, fires, shelters, walls floors and roofs (more on this later), ect and in a simple, easy to understand way.- AI/EnemiesFirst of all let me say the enemies on this game really drive home the horror aspect of this game. Without going to far into details (I don't want to run all the fun ;-) ) expect very intelligent AI and even certain amounts of teamwork.- Horror aspectWhile I'm not really sure if I would call this the main aspect of the game, it has its scary moments. You are the one being hunted (at least early on) and not the other way around, it really does feel that way.- PriceThis maybe a big factor to some and not so much to others. First of let me tell you that even if no more updates were released (which is NOT the case), this game is absolutely worth the $15 purchasing price. This game has more content, polish, and stability (at least for single player, more on this later)  than a few games out on the market today.Now for some Cons!- Bugs and Multiplayer StabilityThis is an Early Access game that is in its Alpha phase. This shows in the amount of bugs and glitches that are present in the game. The worst offender of this would be multiplayer, which still has a few problems with host - client sync along with other small problem. That being said they are improving on this with every patch (which are very frequent) and they have already made tremendous progress on this front since I had originally purchased the game.- Lack of Complex BuildingIn this game you can build custom structures using floors, walls, platforms, stairs, ect. That being said what you can do with them is still somewhat limiting compared to some other survival games. This is something that they have said they will be improving on and I am very much look forward to it.- Ease of Late GameEarly on this game is quite challenging to new players; enemy attacks, food, water, and shelter needs can make this a challenging game and you may find yourself struggling to survive, which is exactly as it should be. However this is somewhat dulled down by how easy it becomes to survive the later you play and the better prepared you become. Enemies spawns and patrols do increase as time goes on, but if you are well prepared it becomes very easy to survive.Overall The Forest is an exceptional example of how an Early Access game should be made and an outstanding game overall. There are a few things the Devs can do to improve the game and I am very much looking forward to Endnight Games continued work on both this game and any games they work on in the future!I definitely recommend this game as both a single-player and multiplayer experience that you can pickup to enjoy now and continue to enjoy in the future.

								One of my favourite games in recent times. Super in depth with lots of features (especially since it's in alpha). All bugs are understandable and at the minute add a certain 'charm' to the game. Updates are weekly and full of changes/new features. Multi-player is a lot of fun too! 10/10 would highly recommend. Especially if you have a friend or two to play it with as well!			"

The Price Fair if you want to play a thriller and don't want to wait for a sale (I'd personaly wait for a sale). Specs./Computer Hardware If you have a weak PC/LapTop then you will more than likely not be able to run this game as it requires a descent set up, but you can play this game at a steady 35 fps. Content The principle of the game is simple: gather resources (water, food, lumber,etc.), build a house, and survive by killing the mutants but there are survivors being held hostage by the mutants that you can rescue (purely your choice).  There are many cheats you can try out to add more fun to the game.   Conclusion The game is great as it features great content and consistent updates; Ill give it a 4.75/5 stars			"

								For an early access game this game is really fun. Only game i could compare is kinda similar to, would be rust except single player.  Graphics are pretty good for it to be an early access game. Common items you find, and believe you can make can actually be crafted.  If you like true survival games, this is ment for you. Exspecially when your chilling by your little home and your just hoping that these mutants dont find you. Coop needs some fixing but its fun with friends. One thing i wonder is where the hell is your son!Pros: Great gameplayBuilding options are really creativeUpdates are bigCoopCons:Missing textures to where you can fall thru mapNot much to build at all (gets boring once you made everything)			"

								This game has a countdown on the main menu page to let you know when they will be rolling the next big patch. The graphics in this game are excellent and the feelings you get while playing it are phenomenal. I have lasted a few days and other games I have huge houses in the trees. I have one saved game that is a cabin just near the beach surrounded by walls/traps. If more people knew about this game and how it plays, it would be a top seller easily.Game Review -

								I am torn between whether to recommend this game or not. For £10.99 it may be worth having a look if you have money to splash around and you like survival horrors but otherwise there just isn't enough depth. The bugginess and ridiculously dark caves filled with op monsters and no save points will annoy the hell out of you.I have had this game for almost 2 years and it is still in alpha stage and looks set to stay there. Once you have seen the four corners of the forest, chopped down a few trees and died in a deep dark cave there really is nothing else left to do.The crafting system works well enough but the combat feels clunky, particulary the bow. The torch is next to useless. Aside from a few unique items there seems no real point in venturing into caves and constantly having to build fires because you fell into a pool will test your patience, wandering around in the dark for nothing just seems pointless.The atmosphere, however, is palpable. Having a cannibal appear out of the dark and scream at you is liable to require a new pair of under pants. But that soon wears thin.All in all a good attempt at survival horror but the developers need to finesse it into a game for the masses rather than a niche market for it to be recommended. If, however, survival horror is your thing then consider this recommended.			"

It doesn't play particulalry amazing.The options menu is somewhat lacking.Disapointing sound design and mixing.Ultimately, The Forest is not a bad game for someone who really like open world survival horror sandbox games, but if you're not well versedin the genre or don't get much enjoyment out of it, your money is better spent elsewhere.

I followed the development for a long time leading up to the game release and have owned it since then, but lately I log in on occasion to see what's been added and improved on, and it does not disappoint. There are so many nice features and great gameplay - Visually, these images just expresse the wonderment wandering around the island.

If you want a realistic, raw, survival game with great imagery, I definitely recommend this game. I can't talk much about the AI as I tend to play 'Vegan' mode more often then not just so I can experience the exploration, hunting, foraging and building aspects, which are unsurpassed by other games of a similar genre.

								Let's get started! So upon opening the game I really wanted to see what the game really had to offer (as did most people) and as soon as I got in game the bad quality sounds put me off a bit... However with the graphics are simply just amazing.I have been super impressed with the crafting system throughout the game. It gives you a building template for anything you want to craft which tells you what you need for the constuction. I give the crafting 8/10 still needs fixing however still lives up to a great crafting system which most games would need.The graphics were over powering as 4 people made this game! It brings a huge amount of immersion and realism into the game and improves the overall feel of the game itself. The art was very well done! 7/10 for the art!The sounds are something that can bring a huge point of immersion as well and to start off with there really isn't that great quality sounds. There isn't any bass in the sounds and it sounds like something off a nintendo 64. The sounds (however) get better after that starting scene and really bring you into the game. I will rest with 6/10 for the sounds until they fix the starting scene.The A.I isn't always the smartest however for an alpha game they have really made some really good A.I. If you get too close the enemy's as they approach you they will back off and the other ones will try and circle around you! 8/10 for the A.IMy overall score is:Average score given: 7.2/10My personal total score: 8/10The planned features interest me very much, The co-op would be a really nice addition and I am look forward to that when it comes out!

								Well do i recommend? Yes.If you have 1-2 friends to play with it can be so much fun creating a good base.Didnt expect it to get creepy but it did.Alot of fun. I recommend 7/10 when you don't consider the bugs in the game.Pros: +Great survival game and all around idea+Really fun when you have friends with you+decently sized map with varying enviroment for something of this engine/price+Decent amount of replayabilityCons:-Buggy-Can get a bit difficuly/creepy(but thats expected with a horror survival game)			"

In Turkish, for english look downOyunu çıkmadan 2 ay önce takip edip, çıkacağı gün nöbet tutup çıktığı saniye alan biri olarak şunları söyleyebilirim.İlk çıktığı gün save sistemi var gibi duran ve çalışmayan bir oyun ile karşılaştım.Multiplayer geldiği gün aynı yerde görünen ama farklı oyunlar da oynayan iki kişi gibiydik.Bugün ise oyun 4/4'lük.Şunları söyleyebilirim, oyunu ilk çıktığı günden beri belli aralıklar ile küçük küçük oynuyordum. Oyun bazen bunaltıyor bazen eğlendiriyordu. Ama bugün gerçekten sıkıcı hiçbir şeyi olmayan bir oyun. Tabi ki Multiplayer'da, single player'da illaki sıkılınır. Stabil bir hayat...Oyun basit bir ev yap korun mantığı değil, oyunda teker teker mağaralara girip, dağ tırmanma aleti, su dalış takımı hatta ve hatta oyun haritasının 4 farklı parçasını bulup tek bir tam harita elde etmek gibi bir çok içerik var. Sadece biraz uğraşmak gerekiyor. Bunları yapmak zaten çok uzun bir sürenizi alıyor.Bana sorarsanız oyun;10/10In EnglishI am following this game since the game didn't even out and bought when it released. I can say, the game had no save system and it wasn't working. In multiplayer, we were two players but it was like in different games. But now, the game is slap-up. In the first times, the game was sometimes boring and sometimes funny. I wasnt playing so much. But today, it has nothing that can bore me. Of course in multiplayer; on the other hand, single player is boring for now. A common life...The game hasn't ""do the house and keep safe"" logic; we can discover many caves, climb mountains with climbing axe, dive in the water with Rebreathers, collect the map pieces and have a full map... So mant things. If you ask, the game is 10/10.			"

								Day 1: I did what any sane person would do when crashing in a forest; Ran around and punched suitcases to steal from the dead. They didnt need it, I did. After I had my arms around 4 sticks and 2 stones, I found a convenient survival guide in my back pocket. It stated that a fire was good for morale, and I've seen Bear Gryllz, so I could confirm it. But, to aimlessly build a shelter out in the open is a bad idea. So I took a moment to gather my bearings, and placed a campfire behind a hill, near a bottleneck formation of rocks. This place was perfect. Fire was up, I caught a lizard (It was petrified from my manlyness) and cooked it. What a boost to my morale. I had heard these forests were dangerous, so I took no time to doubt, and hurried to build defensive walls around my rock formation, to keep me safe. I lost sunlight fast, and decided to call it a night. Something in the dark, deep forest was screaming, I dont know what.Day 2: The screams from last night kept me up. I've gotten close to no sleep, my water is running out and I am low on food. I must think of something fast if I'm to survive in this unforgiving habitat. Then I remembered a technique known to noone at all. Slaughter a threatned species to use its shields to gather rainwater in. Now I had water. A human can survive for three weeks with water, and barely one without it. I made an axe out of what you would expect. Stone, some bindings and a stick.  Now I had a weapon, I was ready. I awaited the twilight, built traps and stocked up on all my most vital resources; it was going to be a long night.After a battle in the darkness I was defeated, I dont know what I fought, but it was tough. And it dragged me to a cave. Luckily, my time in the Elite Gamer's League taught me a thing or two about survival in caves. DONT EVER USE A LIGHTER or a FLASHLIGHT; Use a torch, they are reliable. So I did. I finally saw some distant light in the cave; civilization. I was saved. I had found human beings. Here my adventure en-.. Wait, why are they naked? Hello? Why are you growling at me? That's a nice club you got the- Excuse me? I'm in time for dinner? AAGH!♥♥♥♥♥♥ 11/10 - Bear Grylls would♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants again.			"

								Okay, I like this game. The developers have obviously put a lot of work and effort into it. Its not the horror game they promised. I havent been truly scared yet BUT! Thats not a bad thing. I once got into a battle with six mutants, put the song Light Up The Night by The Protomen on, and had one of the best melee combat experiences in any game ive ever played. I like this combat better than Skyrim's, Assassin Creed's and some of Chivalry's. The graphics are the BEST ive ever seen in any indie game. The lighting is superb and the flora and fauna rival a tripple-A game's quality.Now, I must say I am extremely disappointed by the fact that there is no save option yet, so i'm mainly looking for cannibals to fight, rather than building a base. The sound design could be better. I think having war cries in battle of mindless chattering sounds coming from dormant cannibals would make the game  much more immersive. I probably wont play this game until a save option is implemented. But know this, Endnight Games, you have achieved great things with this game. Do not buy if you dont want to deal with bugs or having no save features. Wait for the full release of beta.8/10			"

								My first run was terrifying. Got out of the plane, grabbed supplies, and noticed a group of cannibals walking away from the crash site.I decide to investigate.BAD idea.A group of them rush me from out of the bushes and I'm forced to run as far away as I can.Eventually I lose them, and I find the other half of the plane, with the pilot and co-pilot both dead. I decide to make camp here for the night. Gathering materials isn't too difficult, but once night hit, I was in for some fun from a group of 6 patrol-cannibals, ready to destroy me on sight. This was all in my first couple hours of playing by the way.Just get this game. There's too much potential here. It's really a fun nervewracking time.			"

								I loaded up The Forest for the first time, finding myself wandering away from the crashed plane - meandering around with an axe, cutting open locked suitcases and stealing the contents. All the while, in the distance, figures darted away through the treelines; spooking me out something nasty.Eventually I decided it would be a good idea to make a shelter, so with the help of a chocolate bar and an axe - I quickly assembled a shelter on a plateau just downhill from the crash site.Figuring it would be enough for today, I went to sleep.I woke up in the early morning to decide to wander down to a nearby beach and swim out to a yacht, only to find a group of figures wandering around the beach. The moment I stepped onto the beach, they screeched and legged it into the nearby forest.A little bit spooked - I swam out to the nearby abandoned yacht to salvage a few painkillers, soda cans and rags - deciding to return to my shelter for the night (it was now the middle of the day).Upon sleeping, I was woken up with the message that I should build a fire to not die of cold - so I wandered around in the forest for a few minutes, chopping up bushes and finding sticks to build a necessary fire. However, I happened to notice that this time, there were a few fires in the distance. And between the thin light those fires gave out - there were outlines of people, figures watching me: A good 7-13 of them.A little bit spooked, I sat by my fire and cooked some raw lizard I had killed the previous day.The figures still stood in the distance, but after eating my food and drying off - I went to sleep.I was woken up what seemed an hour later, still in the middle of the night.The fires were closer.Much closer.And the figures were walking towards me.I hit by some nearby rocks, fear pulsing through me like a shark in a Burger King.As one approached my shelter, I ran forwards, swinging my axe like a mad man and hitting him square in the neck. However, before I could properly turn to meet his companions - a swift kick to my right side knocked me to the ground and everything went black.I woke up in what appeared to be a cavern, but it was too dark to tell exactly where I was - pale light from a distant fire in a tunnel dimly lighting up the roof.Pooping my undergarments, I got out my lighter and lit it - the orange luminescence immediately reflecting off claret in front of me.Five bodies, dismembered and hung all around me.Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥TL;DR - spooky 10/10			"

Also, CO-OP would be amazing in the next patch further are there still a lot of bugs in the game and the monsters are to OP imo. But hey, this is the risk you take while buying it in Early Access!

								""EAT FLARE!"" I exclaimed to myself, face to face with hissing, cannibalistic mutants, with flare gun pointed directly towards them. I fired away, watching in bewilderment as the flare rocketed harmlessly through the chest of my opponent and proceeded to travel through the nearest cave wall without so much as a pop. I was soon thereafter, beaten to death; my punishment for entrusting the game's description of the flare gun's use as a weapon with my life. This is through and through, a game in its Alpha. Its incomplete, and nobody is hiding that fact from you when you purchase it, or play it for that matter. However, dealing with the fact first hand can be tedious. Right now, this game seems nothing more than a massive playground, of which your only goal is to stay alive. That goal will be continuously hindered by the game's lack of fairness as an incomplete piece. Your biggest enemy, at this point, are not the mutants you face, but the bugs you'll encounter in trying to deal with them. Hiding away in your treehouse means little when enemies can see you plainly right through its walls. Traps you carefully laid for them fail to go off. One moment you'll be squaring off with a mutant, swinging your axe, only to have the axe unequip mid-swing, left defenseless to their onslaught. Its very easy to forget this game is Early Access when you're in the throes of it because its such a damn good title. Its too much fun for its own good. It's a gorgeous game with  solid mechanics when they do work, and addictive replayability. It makes you want to endure the struggle of survival so very much, that when its early programming flaws rear their head, it is just that much more frustrating to deal with.So I do give The Forest my recommendation. I want people to play this game. I just see too many condemning it for its bugginess, as if they didn't know what they were signing up for. As long as you go into this project with reasonable expectations for how it will function, you won't be disappointed.			"

								Hi everyone, I played the forest from day one and loved the idea as it was fresh and gave something different. This survival horror slash/hack em up will make you love it and hate it (but hate it in a good way). When i first had the forest it was glitchy as hell, there was no save function. It was really good fun but temporary fun, it went downhill pretty quickly. I had several hours worth of fun until glitches and saving ability wasnt added into the game.Anyway ive come back to the game after many months, even upgraded my pc and i have fell in love with it :Dits scary and beautiful at the same time!In a nut shell, i followed a group of turtles making their way into the water at the edge of the beach. The moonlight shined on their shiny shells, i was taken in by the max quality/graphics (rub it in) and smooth game play.A group of four shuffled their big homes along the beach and 2 had gently breached the shallow water and i had a message pop up in the bottom of my screen saying ""you are thirsty find some clean water to drink"", i looked up the inventory screen and saw a recipe that made my day.All of a sudden lightning and heavy rain followed immeadiately after i closed the crafting book. I remembered the water storage recipe and looked at the last of the 4 turtles... the one little straddler... who nearly entered the shallows....he made a good meal.I felt really guilty killing the little guy just so i could have a water storage stand using his home to help me.In a turtle shell Donatello, Michaelangelo and leonardo will swim and swim freely, raphael is my ♥♥♥♥♥..,......Teenage mutant ninja trio11/10			"

								The Forest was not at all what I was expecting it to be. I wasn't aware of a story until I started exploring the caves. Honestly, The Forest doesn't really have jumpscares (besides the bats when entering a cave, seriously why). It's more horrific and haunting, and the cannibals are a nightmare, especially the sounds they make. The Forest could have a few improvements, for example I crash a decent amount when entering caves.

								12/06/2014 - If you haven't already heard, The Forest is a must have for anyone looking to settle for nothing less than amazing. From the begining this game is very easy to get into providing exactly what you would expect a Triple A title to deliver, but always fail to do so. Endnight Games has taken the best of many open world and horror games and mashed it into The Forest. Making it the perfect past time for soo many gamers. 9/10 ***THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA. The game does have little bugs and glitches but that is expected, 5 more days until the next update.Example of typical day in The Forest - Wake up from whatever shelter you have built, scavenge the creepy woods for an animal to satisfy your hunger and raise your energy levels. If your lucky you will encounter some cannibals face to face rather than being jumped from behind when you least expect it. Realize you should have some fun with the Island's inhabitants by setting up traps, catch a cannibal and use his arms or legs for combat or to warn other cannibals of your abilities. Go back to your base in progress and keep a sharp eye out for anyone trying to take your life at night.			"

								Well, I just had to take the time to leave a review for this game which i would class as one of my absolute favourites dispite being early access and which i will continue following and playing. I am a scaredy cat... I couldn't bring myself to play this alone without freaking out at the pitter patter of a deer in the distance about to run past me or an unseen rabbit lurking in the bushes rustling. So i played with a couple of friends. Still scared but feeling a little more confident we ventured. Built a base on the island crafting whatever we could to help us survive. The cannibles are quite frankly horrifying at first. The noises when you are caught out at night are enough to curdle your blood at times. Especially when you can tell they are coming from a mountain somewhere probably spying down on you, stalking ready to strike some time.The caves are where the early access shows. Don't get me wrong they are unnerving and so fun to go through but lacking in enemys in some places. Never the less you want to search the entire thing to find clues to what has happened. All in the aim to get to that dramatic sinkhole you come across at some point while adventuring. The story had a turn i didn't really see coming and is open ended which makes it quite exciting to think of whats going to be added from now to the time of full release. In short terms. I have had an absolutely amazing time with this game already. Have completed it twice. The building and gathering has that addictive feel. The story is great for an alpha. I cannot make this game sound as great as it is so buy it and put in the time to find out!			"

But then the plane crashes and some naked guy steals Liam's son, now it's up to you to find him!You say to the guy that has taken your son, I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my son go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you.			"

								This is a review of The Forest v.0.02 (v0.03 in game im not sure why it is incosistent like that)I had originally made a negative review on the game with the supporting evidence of the wonky A.I. and the lack of support for lower quality systems like the one i own.I'd just like to point out how wrong I was after the first major update came out which considerably improved performance to the point that the game, on my $400 system, was playable and ran quite well.Even though the difficulty and A.I. mechanics could be refined in order to make to make the game a lot easier for a casual gamer who wants a game he/she can sinks hours into with no intentions of ""making it big,"" I believe the game is solid at this point and only requires some polishing.Hope this was helpful!~Lex			"

								I am completely amazed that this game was made by a group of only 4 people.  There are some issues here and it is an alpha; however the forthcoming patch is going to fix issues such as not being able to save the game.  The enviroment is beautiful, immersive and absolutely terrifying depending on where you are.  I am very much looking forward to seeing how this game develops.  Do not buy it if you are going to get upset over glitches and issues that are to be expected in an alpha.  I personally think the price of this game will go up significantly once it is out of early access and I think the current price is fair for something quite so remarkable.  If you like games like Rust, DayZ, Project Zomboid definately check out the forest because I think you will love it.			"

Killed a few of the locals that attacked. Made an effigy then shelter. Then two more parties came during the night and I ended them quickly.Day 2: Killed another hunting party wih molotovs... Died my first time by hitting a dead local's body. Awoke in the cave, quickly retrieved the Flare Gun and made my way out. Found my way back and went to sleep.Day 3: Killed some more locals, built un-needed structures.Day 4: Uneventful... Where did the locals go?Day 5: Uneventful...

								The Forest is incredible! BUT I recommend you wait for full release. This is because the game is constantly improving and can only get better with each update. I think patience would be a true virtue in this case. To wait for a complete, finished product that would be unlike any game you have played. Unless you want to be apart of the process of making the game better, defending yourself from cannibals with friends in co-op or in multiplayer, squashing bugs, and to see how the game develops. I've put quite a lot of time into this game and came to the conclusion that at certain times when I visit the game there always comes a point where I feel like I've explored, crafted, and had done everything the game was capable of at that point in time. What I like to do is revisit it every now and again and I am always impressed. My favorite part of the day is seeing the devlogs from the developer (Praise be to them). They update it frequently, packed with new content, systems. Every once in a while it's like a whole new game after a certain time period of updates. I didn't purchase the game. I won it on a twitch stream. If I did, however, purchase it I would have been very happy with my decision because of how the developers treat the games development and it's players. It's an incredibly beautiful game, sound design is constantly improving and is excellent, has moments that have never been done before in a game. The potential is unreal. I can't wait for final release. I would say that the game reminds me in certain ways of Silent Hill without spoiling anything.			"

								This game is great. This was my first experince with the game. I wake up in a crashed plane. I immediately gather food and meds that are left over from the crash. Then I pull an axe out of a womens stomach. I'm out of the plane and I see a bunny. The first thought into my mind is ""FLESH. I NEED FLESH!"" I charge at the bunny and chop it up. I then hear screaming from behind me. I look and see a pack of 5 mutants walking towards me. My heart stops and I♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. I start running the opposite direction to try to get away and I come upon a cave. I look behind me and there still chasing. There was no other way to go but the cave. I walk inside. Its pitch black. I pull out a cigarette lighter using it for light. I trek deeper into the cave and I come across an underground pond. I look above me and I see bodies hanging from the ceiling. I think to myself ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" On the other side of the pond I see a man standing there. Another one of the mutants. I pull out my axe and approach him. I see no other choice but to kill him. I swing my axe in to him a couple times and hes dead. Then I hear more screaming from behind me. Another pack of mutants. I walk backwards only to end up walking into a wall. I'm trapped. They all start charging at me. I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself once more. I quickly press escape and exit the game. The Forest has been one of the most anticipated games of this year. It dosen't fail to impress. At this moment in the game there are a LOT of bugs. One of the major ones being not being able to save your game which kinda sucks. But its not a reason to not buy the game. The $15 is well worth it. Once the full game is released the price is surely to rise. So why not buy it now.11/10 would bang.			"

								Only played one hour so far. However it's exceeding my expectations in terms of immersion, atmosphere and graphics. (Seriously, this game is beautiful!).My only gripe is that The Player is engaged by the Tribesman really quickly. You barley have time to get familarize yourself with controls and basic mechanics, before you're attacked and dragged off into a cave (which is not a scripted event). However, I've only started a new game twice, so other players might have a different experience.I'm going to stop playing for now, because the game is filled with a few bugs including rendering players unable to save game, forcing them to start from scratch every death.

								Day 1:NoonI awoke in the wreckage of a small passenger aircraft, hungry and confused. All of my fellow passengers seemed to have vanished save for a woman with an axe lodged in her stomache. After finding a packaged snack and recovering the axe from that poor woman I struck out into the forest. Not long afterwards I began to hear rustling in the bushes. Fearing some sort of wild animal attack I quickly fled to a small clearing. As the sun began to set I realised that I would need warmth and shelter to survive the night. After creating a small fire and a makeshift lean-to I settled in for the night.Day 2:Sometime around midnightI awoke with a start and looked around, searching in vain for whatever disrupted my sleep. The stars shone brightly through the trees, but my fire had gone out. Quickly, I sat up and dug the old BIC lighter out of my pocket to re-light it. Once the warm glow of the fire had once again bathed me in its comforting glow I took my first proper look around.And thats when I saw them.There were three in total, standing just outside the firelight. They wore nothing but tattered loin cloths, and had no hair whatsoever. They appeared human, caucasian and tall in build. But their eyes. The eyes of those monsters had no human quality.

								Let me begin by saying my hours in this game are far from accurate. I have spent countless hours playing this game offline.The forest is a game unlike any other on Steam. Some may claim this is not true, and there are other survival games, but in my opinion nothing compares to The Forest.When I first started playing this game the sounds of cannibals in the night would send chills down my spine. The light of a torch can only shine so far, and sometimes the most deadly creatures in the game lie right beyond the torches light, waiting for a chance to pounce. This thought in the back of your head makes you wary of working at night, but sometimes the sacrifice must be made if you wish to prolong your life in single player.The Forest takes many survival factors into consideration giving it one of the most realistic feels of any game on Steam as I said earlier. From sickness, starvation, and dehydration, anything could bring about your death. Cannibals aren't the only thing you must fear.The game is regularly patched, and new content is added with almost every update.Multiplayer is a new beast on its own. Though still focusing on survival the game seems to become both easier, and harder, at the same time. Survival from the elements grows drastically easier, for a time. The cannibals however, grow more frequent and more deadly as the days pass.Cave exploration becomes much easier with friends, and far less dangerous, and with the caves staying cleared thanks to one of the latest patches, the caves can also be used to escape danger if your base ever gets overrun in the later days of survival. (Caves may repopulate after a patch. I experienced this with a group of friends in the pit cave, and we had to flee from the sheer number of enemies that spawned, and our low supply count from the initial exploration).Overall the game is amazing, the gameplay is great, and the time you get to enjoy with friends if you wish is also a plus. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a challenge, and prefers their survival simulators more on the realistic side.Pros:+Great Game+Fun with friends+Great Simulator for Survival+Challenging+Interesting, and ever growing story with interesting side discoveries+Frequent Updates+Tree explosions sending logs into your friends heads is always worth a laughCons:-Sharks still stuck on the beach (kinda a plus because we just use the heads and stick them to rocks lol, and if it gets fixed I will update this)-You don't own it yet-Needs more enemy classes (Though it seems more have been added. With the addition of what me and my friends have called the Tubby, (you will be able to tell what I'm talking about if you ever see it, I won't spoil the experience hehehe) I can see many more enemies being added in the future though. So this isn't really a Con, more or less a suggestion that would make the game challenging and force the experienced players to rethink some of their tactics.  Buy this game, its worth it. And if you can find it on sale its a steal for the amount of content and fun you will recieve.			"

								Great game thus far, there are still a few glitchs and it has crashed a couple of times, but it has been on eof the better games of it's type thus far. there choice to not allow trees to regrow very muich anoys me however. if your like ma dn enjoy building up large complex bases be prepared to run a LOT as those logs start to get ungodly far away and at least for me this GREATLY detracts from game play. Google searches tell me this was intentional which I think was a bad mistake, I feel the host should be allowed to set regrowth time or have some form of plantable tree that can be reasonably harvested or something. but I still strongly recomened the game if you enjoy suvival type games.

								Bought this game a couple months ago, maybe a year. When i started it was really quite rough, hardly any animals to kill, terrible physics and just a hell of a lot of bugs. I check in with this game every month or so and i see it developing more and more. It's now to the point where the game is incredibly alluring, both physically and game play wise.It's a time sink let me tell you, prepare to get lost and sucked into this game's mysterious and adventerous agenda. With any early access game comes the possability for bugs and glitches, but there is hardly any feeling of lack of content.All in all, completely worth the purchase, and when this game is prepared for a full scale commercial release, i will be proud to say i was one of the first to test the waters.

								The Forest is a good game, I think they should rename it into ""Bear Gryllz the hardcore survival Guide Simulation"" because in the normal TV show they only show you how to survive in normal forests but in this game you gonna get a new phobia if you like to travel with plans and like to discover caves but as I said they shoud rename it into ""Bear Gryllz the hardcore survival Guide Simulation"" I meant there are cannibals that are not in the normal TV show and they dont like you from the beginning so dont even try to make a friendly contact with them , but if you are an adventurer as I am and like to do a big slaugther then go ahead and buy that game they fixed the performance problems i got now like 40 fps more then before , to build a base is awesome and it feels realistic and it looks very nice .You can even get a diving suit in some caves and dive with it under water :D but dont go into the ocean , because there are sharks. The game looks very nice for a game that is made with unity enginee. I played it now like 23 because and I think I will play it way longer because they're updating the game every 1-2 weeks so keep it going and you can report to them buggs via twitter and as my last few words its for what it is very cheep. If you got 2 more friends you gonna have a great time for a price of 15 euros .So thats my review for The Forest hope you enjoy it. If you are going to play it and you are from Germany and you are in search for some mates to play with just add me and ask me I like to make new contacts .So now Im out ah and my PC Specs are:GPU:Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 Gigabyte Gaming G1 CPU:I7 4790k @4ghz (the normal clock)Ram:2x4gb g.skill 1600mhz dual kitMainboard: Gigabyte Z97X-UD3HI get on the highest Settings like 80fps ~So Hope you enjoy my review			"

								this is an amazing game, i have troble finding animals sometimes the spawn seems to be down, but i have some ideas for this game, maybe neat skill trees with survival, techical, and hunter, on survival it allows you to cut down on building materials, or build advanced stuctures, on technical you can strip things for parts, and open up advanced crafting options, on hunter add bows or throwing tomahawks, it would make for a very interesting game, and varied gameplay, wether you take my idea or not im just glad i could take part in such an amazing game!!!!

								From the one game I played, and the 5 days I survived -Day 1: Build Cabin off of edge of cliff overlooking ocean so no cannibals can sneak from behind it- Surround the front with traps- Try to sleep for the night, but cannibals chillin outside so can't- Spend the night behind my cabin with a small fire (theres a little spot for my character to hide, but not enough room for the cannibals to reach me, they just fall off the cliff)Day 2: Time to explore the beach-Find luggage scattered down the shore, with more energy bars than I know what to do with-Find boat, on it - flares, new axe, rope, someones mix tape and a skull-Head back to basecamp, but on the way find some camp with triangular cabins. Creeoy music starts up so I don't hang around too long-Actually get some decent sleep that nightDay 3: More exploring-Decide to explore the woods some more-Find berrys, seeds etc-Stumble across another one of those camps, this time I look around-Seems like the cannibals have a fetish for tennis balls since every corpse I find has about 8 shoved in them-Find a hole leading to a cave with a rope going down, decide against it since I'm probably not ready-Head back to camp for some sleepDay 4: Defenses-Decide I need better defenses around my cabin-Build walls almost all around my cabin (this takes about the whole day)-SleepDay 5: Death-Wake up and go to finish my wall-As I step out side my fortress to gather more logs I see a group of cannibals just walking around not far from me (about 6)-Stay away from them but don't actually run-As they get closer I go back into my fortress-They don't chase me but somehow they all wandered into the one spot I hadn't set up a wall-They want my blood now-I hide in my cabin as they all rush to me-5 of the 6 hit my traps-He starts attacking, I try to swing my axe and he doesn't swing it-I die because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ didn't swing his axe no matter how many times I tried to get him to10/10 would play Cast Away Simulator again "

								This game is in alpha, there are some gameplay bugs. Given. But, those few bugs aside, this game is amazing. 9/10Pros: 1. Best story, hands down, I have ever experienced in a game. (Cut scenes are rare, short, and ACTUALLY make groundbreaking inpacts on the plot.2. Amazing co-op experience. All of the bugs I experienced that I actually needed to note because they impacted my experience were because of co-op. (ex. Entering a cutscene with another player in co-op caused them to fall through the world infinitely. Had to restart from last save.)3. PvE is fun. It isn't exactly hard but once you enter the caves it sure as hell ain't easy when you find harder enemies. If you gear up, recruit a pal to take on the big guys with you, it's enjoyable and sometimes got my heart racing. (Boss fights are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!)Either Pro or Con:1. If you don't look for the clues, you might never find a piece of the story. You actually have to put a lot of effort into solving the story for yourself, the game doesn't hand it to you. I personally enjoyed this and having someone to play with that had just enough information to get us to the next plot point made running around the island looking for clues a blast! :DCons:1. Not for the faint of heart. I'm not saying this game is utterly terrifying and competes with big horror games on the horror scale, but god damn I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing scardy cat. The sound engineering in this game is what sets the mood. Some cut scenes had the most generically ominous music I ever heard but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. (Just scheduled my first PTSD rehab session in town...)2. Saving progress can be annoying and inconvenient, but preventable. The only way to save in caves (where most of the plot points occur) are by building a small shelter with sticks and leaves. I ran out of sticks quick and ended up being forced to keep pushing on, and on, and on until my co-op friend and I decived to call it quits because it was 3am and to retrace ALL (A-♥♥♥♥ING-LOT) of our steps in the morning. Really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, but annoyance here is preventable if you wait until you know you absolutely should.Notable bugs:1. Falling through floors, rare though. Sometimes through the entire map, sometimes just to the next durface available like falling through the floor of my cabin to the sand below. Eh.2. Being forced into the same spot as another co-op player or item like a log can launch you into the air and kill you from fall damage. Double Eh.TL;DR- ♥♥♥♥ing amazing story, chills me to the bone. Have fun digging for clues! :D			"

								Still under development, obviously, but still one of my favourite games on Steam. If you want a horror survival with  beautiful graphics, this is for you. Make sure you have a good computer though, my old one hindered my gameplay horribly.UPDATE: I still love this game tbh, the story is much more rich but you have to read about it a little and/or find clues around the map - takes a while. The game runs better on bad computers now thanks to the devs. I'll always love this game			"

								If i had to use one word to describe this: ""Beautiful"". While this game has a few (a lot of) glitches, the stunning graphics make up for it. Now for the sake, of this review, I'll talk about some of the glitches that i've encountered:1. Log sled- If you are using a log sled, run over a stick holder and jump, you will fly in the air infinitely. Until you let go of the log sled, from which point you fall to your death. (Still hilarious. Im actually starting to think the developers meant to do that because it shows off the incredible landscape.2. Happy Birthday trap (the spikey one)- When you use the trap, the cannibals will appear dead. With this glitch, they arent. as soon as you reset the trap, they come back to life. A solution: wait for their bodies to despawn (although this is incomvenient if you are being raided.)3. The multiple bodies- This is actually hilarious and doesnt cause any harm to the player. Two cannibals can get into fights. Sometimes a canibal will glitch and stand there idle while the other one attacks it. The idle cannibal is technically dead, but has the animation of staning up. Everytime a player or cannibal hits the idle cannibal, another idle body forms behind it, leaving a marvelous spectacle. (Note: this has only happened once)Overall------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think this game is amazing for how small it is (data-wise) It doesnt require much fire-power to runand still looks beautiful. The ai is great, the cave systems are beautiful, as are the different types of cannibals found there. I am overjoyed that this game is in alpha because that means this already amazaing game will become much better.My only problem: glitches and lack of variety of melee weapons.Thank you for reading this review, I hope it helped.

								I like this game however I think there are some things that need to be addressed. Think about this when you go to spend $15 on this game. 1. The cannibals come out in the day so it's not like mine craft, there are some ""cheat modes"" for this that turns the cannibals to only coming out at night or just off completely. Don't try to play the game normally. It is just to hard. 2. The building system is pretty good except with custom building. The roofs don't line up and it's just complicated. However the devs are always releasing new content that makes the game interesting to play. And finally, multiplayer, the multiplayer is pretty solid except for some stuff going missing and not being able to build some stuff just yet. All around a great game. Expect the price to skyrocket once this game comes out of alpha. 10/10 would play again!			"

								Been playing this game for a while and can say that It's one of the better ones out there as of this date.There is alot of games that are buildt up on the same thing, including having zombies / hostile mobs attacking etc.I was looking for a game when I found The Forest that allowed me to build freely, without any Villagers / Zombies attacking my base etc.And I did play The Forest a little bit before I knew I could turn the villagers / zombies off at anytime.I messed around a little bit and finally figured out that I had to type ""veganmode"" to disable those zombies.The good thing about The Forest is that it allows you to turn them off in the main menu then build up a base / save the game and then turn them back on with ""meatmode"". (This allows you to build up your base instead of having them to pick on you now and then while you are building).Chopping trees / building freely / gathering resources / exploring caves / hunting wildlife - This game is truly a good quality game. Highly recommend it, even if it's in alpha stage it's worth it - compared to other games in Alpha state.5/5 Stars			"

								So this game is in alpha, remember that.  Things can change, so this review may be rendered pointless at some point.  But, seeing as I love it so much, even though I haven't spent a significant amount of time on it, I had to write a review.  For being in Alpha, they are working their absolute hardest to push out updates and big fixes every couple weeks.  Loads of new content always being added.  First, the normal survival mode.  AMAZING!  Haven't been that concerned about my health, clothing, shelter, and scariness factor in a while.  From the moment you jump in, landing in a new location, u can't wait to explore and find the perfect spot to build a cabin that will ultimately hopefully become a fort at some point (soon, if your lucky).  I must say, the plot is intriguing.  The random passenger counter you get when finding bodies strewn from the cieling in caves has me wondering, not to mention, will you get your SON back?  Second, multiplayer mode.  Still really buggy, and it is awkward trying to share items and stuff, but recently they released an update that added communal cabinets for people to share stuff, thus making it a bit better.  The developers have obviously worked hard on this and seem to be very invested in making it a great co-op experience instead of a copy and paste that we see from so many other franchises.  Lastly, gameplay, graphics, and other odds and ends.  The quality is simply stunning.  Sometimes I stand there and look at the water ripples or the sunlight for fun.  Because it looks awesome.  The building of items seems to be very decent, and the guidebook and inventory layout are super creative.  The hidden items around the island like the axe and flares and rope and stuff you can find in the boat, or the flare gun in caves or the cockpit of the plane if you find it.  So much to do and explore.  This game has not once failed to deliver me and my friends an entertaining time.  So I rate this game highly, singing it's praises.  :)  I look forward to what this game has to offer, seeing as it is far beyond fantastic as it stands in Early Access!  I recommend it.			"

								First things first: This game has been in early access ""alpha"" for literally years. Yes, that's annoying and yes, I wish the game had progressed further in that time than it has. That said, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with it and love the changes and additions that have been made.The crafting system is really great, and I love the variety of things that you can build. From meat drying racks to spiked walls to creepy totems of limbs and heads, there are some really interesting things and they're really fun to build. Not to mention they look great, as does the game in general. The forest is probably my favourite survival type game to date, I've had more fun playing it than even Ark or Minecraft.Part of why I like it so much is the horror element I think. The cannibals are genuinely creepy, and I get scared every time they appear. It's a really compelling element which gives you a reason to build up as quickly as possible and stay hidden at night. The creepy mutilated bodies and trophies made from body parts littered around the map add to this element and really drive home that the cannibals are to be feared.TL;DR, if you see this game for cheap I'd recommend it. It's a lot of fun, especially if you play with friends, and you'll get your money's worth so long as you don't spend too much money. Just don't expect it to ever be a finished product, I don't think that's happening anytime soon.			"

								  Do you want to battle a horde of cannibals,or,even better,sit back in your man-made home watching the cannibals turn on each other(they actually do that)?Or take down multiple mutants at once by running into them with a flaming axe of death?Only to be killed by gravity or a cannibal that just wont die.Then play the horror simulator game,The Forest.Sure it has some chinks here and there like being thrown across the world by one of the female cannibals but at least you get to build whatever you want,kill everything you want,do whatever you want.

								The Forest is a terrifyingly awesome game! Once you get ingame you are left alone after a horrific plane crash, where apparently know one survived but you. You are a lone survivor and have to build your own shelter hunt and find food to fill up your belly, but the world is in't a trip in lala land; you will run into inhumane enemies. You will run into these creatures that look very similar to humans, but they aare much stronger and faster than you. They are challenging, especially if you find yourself surrounded by more than one. The best way to survive these cannibals is by running away or fleeing. If you get killed by the cannibals they will abduct you, and take you to a cave where you will find the rest of the airplane passengers. This cavern is very big, and will have to be explored later on in the game, but I would stay away from it for the first few days. In this cavern you will have to escae, but if you get lost you might find yourself in a very dangerous situation. Deeper in the cavern live these mutations, some look like people wrapped around by human skin. These mutated creatures are probably the most dangerous, and they will be quick to kill you. Ofcourse they live in the caves! So if you don't go in there you'll be safe right? WRONG! After a couple of days when you have developed your little safe haven, and you think nothing can get you... they will emerge from the depths of the cave and will surround your home then they will break through anything they need too; just to kill you. This is a very challenging game, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting it if you are into open world survival games like Rust, or are into horror games; trust me the cannibals do a good job at sneaking up behind you, then SCARING THE LIVING♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF YOU!!! This game is fun, but it does have a lot of bugs and glitches; it's fine because it is in Alpha and hopefully they will fix it soon - SlenderCat			"

								Probably the best release any early access game has ever had.  The Forest throws you in to a bewildering forest, and forces you to find your own path.  Every experience is different, and everyone's story is new, and completely genuine.  I have never had a better experience in any other COMPLETE game in this genre, and I can only hope they stick to their formula.  As it is, The Forest is incomplete, but that makes it no less perfect, 10/10.			"

								It would be cool of there was friendly AI at the camp sites. Also if there was different tribes of canibals, and you could either make friends with them, or be there enemies. Then with the tribes you are friendly with, you can go to war against enemie tribes.  The different tribes could be determiend by different colored clothing. Im not sure this would ruin the concept of the game or not but the rare introduction of guns could be cool. Maybe just 2-3 in the whole game, with bullets not found at the same camp sites to make it more challenging. "

								I am completely amazed that this game was made by a group of only 4 people.  There are some issues here and it is an alpha; however the forthcoming patch is going to fix issues such as not being able to save the game.  The enviroment is beautiful, immersive and absolutely terrifying depending on where you are.  I am very much looking forward to seeing how this game develops.  Do not buy it if you are going to get upset over glitches and issues that are to be expected in an alpha.  I personally think the price of this game will go up significantly once it is out of early access and I think the current price is fair for something quite so remarkable.  If you like games like Rust, DayZ, Project Zomboid definately check out the forest because I think you will love it.			"

Killed a few of the locals that attacked. Made an effigy then shelter. Then two more parties came during the night and I ended them quickly.Day 2: Killed another hunting party wih molotovs... Died my first time by hitting a dead local's body. Awoke in the cave, quickly retrieved the Flare Gun and made my way out. Found my way back and went to sleep.Day 3: Killed some more locals, built un-needed structures.Day 4: Uneventful... Where did the locals go?Day 5: Uneventful...

Early Access Review
								The Forest is a brilliant game. Both the concept, graphics, atmosphere, and the gameplay are all great. Early access or not, this a game worth picking up.Pros: well to start out, it looks beautiful. The island looks great, both thanks to the graphics and the layout of the island itself. The way the light goes through the trees has made me stop actually playing and just look at it many times. While obviously not what you buy the game for, this is something worth mentioning. On top of this, the world feels alive. It's hard to explain but the island really feels like a real forest (or at least as close as a game can come to feeling real). The combat feels good, as the weapons feel like they have weight and power. Also, of course the survival part of the game is great and is the strongest part of the game. You have to manage food and water intake and must build to protect yourself from the outside world. It can be truly nerve wracking to be stuck in your fort for the night knowing you're out of food. The building aspect is also pretty cool. It's really exciting when you're building your walls and you need just a couple more pieces of wood to complete it, but the sun has gone down so you have to finish before cannibals show up.Cons: well, the biggest problem is that it's early access. Many may claim that I can't list this as a problem since it is marketed as early access and never pretends to be anything but early access, but the truth is that it is a product and when you buy it this is what it'll be like (at least for now). The game is often a buggy mess. The ""zombies"" will glitch through walls often times. You'll use resources making something just to have it not actually be crafted. These kind of glitches aren't too common, but they can kill you when they do happen and ruin your 5 hour game. While I'm sure in 6 months they'll fix the problems, but for now they exist and that what you have to play with. The other problem is kind of a half problem half not. The game's weapons are too weak. Like I said, they feel powerful but they really aren't. While I don't mind weak weapons in a game like this, they're too weak in my opinion. Even when you're 10 hours into a game and have a super fort, if you get caught fighting even 4 or 5 enemies, you're life is in serious danger. I love having the game make you feel as if you're truly outgunned so to speak, but here it feels like you're using a foam sword to fight a tank. However, many people will love how the game makes you avoid combat often because of this so it's a personal preference really.In conclusion, this a game that is good as it is, but I feel will only truly reach its full potential in a couple of months. I recommend buying it now, as it is still REALLY fun and of course the more money the studio has, the better they can make their game. I'd give it a 7.5/10 as of now and expect it to be around a 9/10 when it's finished			"

Early Access Review
								This game is in alpha, there are some gameplay bugs. Given. But, those few bugs aside, this game is amazing. 9/10Pros: 1. Best story, hands down, I have ever experienced in a game. (Cut scenes are rare, short, and ACTUALLY make groundbreaking inpacts on the plot.2. Amazing co-op experience. All of the bugs I experienced that I actually needed to note because they impacted my experience were because of co-op. (ex. Entering a cutscene with another player in co-op caused them to fall through the world infinitely. Had to restart from last save.)3. PvE is fun. It isn't exactly hard but once you enter the caves it sure as hell ain't easy when you find harder enemies. If you gear up, recruit a pal to take on the big guys with you, it's enjoyable and sometimes got my heart racing. (Boss fights are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!)Either Pro or Con:1. If you don't look for the clues, you might never find a piece of the story. You actually have to put a lot of effort into solving the story for yourself, the game doesn't hand it to you. I personally enjoyed this and having someone to play with that had just enough information to get us to the next plot point made running around the island looking for clues a blast! :DCons:1. Not for the faint of heart. I'm not saying this game is utterly terrifying and competes with big horror games on the horror scale, but god damn I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing scardy cat. The sound engineering in this game is what sets the mood. Some cut scenes had the most generically ominous music I ever heard but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. (Just scheduled my first PTSD rehab session in town...)2. Saving progress can be annoying and inconvenient, but preventable. The only way to save in caves (where most of the plot points occur) are by building a small shelter with sticks and leaves. I ran out of sticks quick and ended up being forced to keep pushing on, and on, and on until my co-op friend and I decived to call it quits because it was 3am and to retrace ALL (A-♥♥♥♥ING-LOT) of our steps in the morning. Really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, but annoyance here is preventable if you wait until you know you absolutely should.Notable bugs:1. Falling through floors, rare though. Sometimes through the entire map, sometimes just to the next durface available like falling through the floor of my cabin to the sand below. Eh.2. Being forced into the same spot as another co-op player or item like a log can launch you into the air and kill you from fall damage. Double Eh.TL;DR- ♥♥♥♥ing amazing story, chills me to the bone. Have fun digging for clues! :D			"

They said that they only hunt at night, but it is most likely a bug. I expected the game to have many bugs, considering that only four people made the game. Hopefully in the next update they will fix bugs that seem to disrupt the game's machanics. Other than the bugs, the game is quite beautiful. The atmosphere is amazing and so is the lighting. Either buy it now and try it yourself, or wait for the bugs to be fixed and then buy it. I absolutely recommend this game!			"

								If i had to use one word to describe this: ""Beautiful"". While this game has a few (a lot of) glitches, the stunning graphics make up for it. Now for the sake, of this review, I'll talk about some of the glitches that i've encountered:1. Log sled- If you are using a log sled, run over a stick holder and jump, you will fly in the air infinitely. Until you let go of the log sled, from which point you fall to your death. (Still hilarious. Im actually starting to think the developers meant to do that because it shows off the incredible landscape.2. Happy Birthday trap (the spikey one)- When you use the trap, the cannibals will appear dead. With this glitch, they arent. as soon as you reset the trap, they come back to life. A solution: wait for their bodies to despawn (although this is incomvenient if you are being raided.)3. The multiple bodies- This is actually hilarious and doesnt cause any harm to the player. Two cannibals can get into fights. Sometimes a canibal will glitch and stand there idle while the other one attacks it. The idle cannibal is technically dead, but has the animation of staning up. Everytime a player or cannibal hits the idle cannibal, another idle body forms behind it, leaving a marvelous spectacle. (Note: this has only happened once)Overall------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think this game is amazing for how small it is (data-wise) It doesnt require much fire-power to runand still looks beautiful. The ai is great, the cave systems are beautiful, as are the different types of cannibals found there. I am overjoyed that this game is in alpha because that means this already amazaing game will become much better.My only problem: glitches and lack of variety of melee weapons.Thank you for reading this review, I hope it helped.

								Yes, it's alpha game. And yes, there is some glitches and bugs. But game is pretty good at current state. This game is not like Rust where you have shotguns and rifles. You use spears, axes, bows and arrows to defend yourself against endless waves of cannibals at night. You are not immortal, sometimes you have run away and leave everything behind. Hunt animals for meat and leather. Maintain your garden. Build your own cabin. Explore caves where you press ESC after every sound or scream you hear. And sometimes, you just want sit down and watch environment. Rest your mind and body looking waves of sea and listen sounds of birds and water. Only to remind yourself that next night might be your last. Also, regular updates (there's countdown at main menu to next big update).			"

Also, the devs are very active and release updates on a schedule. This game is more fun with friends, but it is still an amazing game for all you singleplayers out there. 10/10			"

								This is my review for the intial release:Man, I just can't explain what I have gotten from this game, but the best thing I can describe my lagfilled experince (because my com is not awesome enough to handle this game's awesomeness) is it has been a joyride full of thrills, spills, laughs and weirdness.The AI, from what I've seen so far, is EXTREMELY advanced. The mutants themselves might be a bit buggy, but I have never been so scared of these enemies in any game I played before. They have stealth, they have the knowledge to fight or flight, they even have fricking attack patterns!!! They don't just go for me instantly, they wait for me to attack first before they counter! This part of the game I really love.Now, the gameplay. The UI is simple to understand. I managed to figure out which is my health, armor, stamina and hunger on the bar. The inventory was 3D as promised, and I was glad it was pretty simple to learn. Crafting was straightforward too, and I love it when I can figure things out. And you have to love the fact that you can see animals walking over your inventory if any are near!!!I wish to be able to play with a bit less lag so that I can experience more from this and help come up with a few suggestions to make it even better. For now, I guess it's bug hunting time! XD			"

								This game, while buggy (for now, Early Access first day release afterall) seems to be quite good and full of potential. The current bugs I've ran into was me being able to walk into the plane after it crashed, you may be able to hold two items at once (I held both a leg and an axe at the same time in the same hand and they appeared to clip into one another), the fact that there are so many rabbits and lizards near a plane crash (at least I ... think that's a bug), and when collecting too many rocks it says I have in fact collected too much raw fish meat. This game though is a lot of fun and is interesting! I'll be giving a more full review later on.Edit 1 : I made an simple effigy in the middle of a village, the residents of whom I molotoved. I took their corpses and set them upon a podeum to instill fear into the others. Upon it's lighting birds swarmed both it and myself, one of which landing on my hand.I shall name it Mr.Tweetums.Get this game 10/10Edit 2: Here is a more extensive http://xshadowsaurgaming.wordpress.com/2014/05/31/the-forest-early-access-review-v-01-with-bugs/ "

								A forest full of mutant cannibals that insist on playing the piano (well, smashing the piano keys) when they approach you, but are absolutely no good at it!! Obviously, our character shows no appreciation for their surprise musical act, so they proceed to attack, fiercely. During a few attacks, I noticed the cannibals had severe hair loss, maybe caused by stress?On a serious note, this is an amazing game and although still quite unfinished, the awesome and funny moments it has provided me so far, has made it worth its price. Challenging, scary, fun and rewarding, a great survival game. Couldn't stop chopping those trees!!!! "

								Now ill be honest, this game shows a lot of potential, it has good graphics for a Early Alpha and has quite the content, here comes the bad news, my first problem was my PC cant handle most graphics so i always turn down the settings, when i start the game however it resets itself which is annoying, on the gameplay side, sticks are very scarce, i looked high and low and only managed to find about 3 sticks, while there are tons of rocks heck i could make a castle if i had the time, and last but not least the enemies, they knock me down in 1 hit, call me crazy but thats not fair at all, its insane how overpowered they are and it kills the mood to play any further fast.Once again i know this is Early Alpha so i wont give this a negative rating, but please for the love of Gaben fix this.

								This game is very fun for what it is right now. The recent patch has disabled saving which is a little annoying but it will be fixed soon I'm sure. The biggest complaint I have is that for an open world off-rails horror game the beginning is very scripted. Before your first ""death"" (you get captured by tribesmen instead of killed by them) you are hunted constantly, they will always find you and always be on your tail. They will never let up even if you manage to escape and set up a small shelter, they will find you just after you sleep and come and try to kill you. Afterwards I don't know if I bugged or what but I only found a small group of them and empty huts. Still, for an extremely early alpha it is in good shape, you might just want to hold off your money until it is more finished unless you can deal with bugs such as dropping weapons when switching them(which annoyingly includes molotov cocktails so my feet are ensured to be charred most of the game), tribesmen sometimes flat out ignoring you when you wave at them as they walk by, weird land floating near the plane, water becoming staticky looking, etc.			"

								This game is overrall great, I played for a few hours a year ago with a friend of mine and thought it was fantastic. The graphics are good, the details are precise, shading is excellent and the mutants are terrifying. Now that I play it again, the things I liked most about the game are still there, but they haven't evolved much since I last played. They're still good and all but not as evolved as some games such as ARK; then again, with a team of only four developers, it's really nice. After playing this game again after a year, I bought it for my boyfriend, too, and now we both play it.Don't expect too much, but if you like building structures and defending your bases from monsters, have at it!PROS:-The graphics and shading are well done-The AI is difficult, the cannibals are very smart sometimes-Building and defending is overrall fun-Sound design is awesome-It's scary at first-The models are pretty niceCONS:-Repetitive at times-A bit unbalanced with the cannibals and humans-Only scary for a little while-Not much content (will be fixed by game's release)-A bit glitchy			"

								When the plane went down, I couldn't believe I survived. As I laid there watching a strange man with black eyes carry my son away, I could only think, ""why him?"" Where is he taking him? I try to speak. “Take me instead”, but the words wont come. As soon as he appears, he’s gone with my son. I lay there waiting  for him to return to finish me off but he never comes. What had I done to deserve this? Why me? I can’t stay here. I wont stay here! I have to get up! As my strength returned and I got to my feet, I gathered what supplies I could and set off into the forest. Not knowing if he was alive or not, I knew that no matter what I had to find him. I walked for what seemed like days. Through water and over mountains, eating what I can only hope are harmless berries, until I came to a cove. There were rabbits running around, birds blackening the sky and more fish than I could count. Here is where I start. Here is where I begin the search for my son and hopefully a way to get out of this God-forsaken place. As I begin to take stock of what I have, I hear a noise. Not a noise one associates with a peaceful stroll through the woods. No. This was a screech from the deepest bowels of hell. A noise that only the darkest creatures that dwell in the deepest corners of your mind can make. Every muscle in my body is screaming for me to run, but I have to know. As I turn to face what ever creature this is, fear washing over my body, I realize. It's just a woman. She's just standing there in front of me. Eyes agape and the most puzzling look upon her face. We stand there for minutes just starring. Waiting for the other to do...Something, anything. I open my mouth to say, ""I'm not going to hurt you"", but the realization washes over me. She wasn't screaming in fear, oh no, that would be too simple. In fact she was calling for the others that I didn't know where there. One, two, four of them. Leaping from tree to tree so incredibly fast that it's inhuman. I run. Faster than my legs have ever carried me, but no matter how fast I run, THEY are faster. I cannot escape. I turn to face them. As the first one jumps down to attack, I lunge at him with my axe but I'm not fast enough. He strikes me long before I can hit him. I feel the cartilage break in my nose and the blood once contained in my nose now running freely down my face. I swing wildly, just hoping to connect, but to no avail. When they tire of this game of ""Cat and Mouse"" the deliver the final blow.....I wake up cold. So cold. Where am I? Is this what death feels like? Thank God it's over. Then, when I see the rest of the crew and passengers on the plane, I realize I’m not dead.  It's not that easy in this place..... I gather myself up and start feeling around for an exit, but I only find dead bodies. There’s a light in the distance. Am I hallucinating? Is it real or was I slowly going insane? I feel my way towards it. Inch by inch, through water filled with the decomposing remains of people I’d known days before. As I grow closer, I notice there is a table with a body on it. A child’s body. Oh God, is it him? Is it my son? I began to shake as shamble nearer and nearer, hands shaking uncontrollably the realization comes. It’s not him. I never knew I could be so happy to see a child dead in such a manner, but I didn’t care. There was still hope for him…and for me. "

								If i had to use one word to describe this: ""Beautiful"". While this game has a few (a lot of) glitches, the stunning graphics make up for it. Now for the sake, of this review, I'll talk about some of the glitches that i've encountered:1. Log sled- If you are using a log sled, run over a stick holder and jump, you will fly in the air infinitely. Until you let go of the log sled, from which point you fall to your death. (Still hilarious. Im actually starting to think the developers meant to do that because it shows off the incredible landscape.2. Happy Birthday trap (the spikey one)- When you use the trap, the cannibals will appear dead. With this glitch, they arent. as soon as you reset the trap, they come back to life. A solution: wait for their bodies to despawn (although this is incomvenient if you are being raided.)3. The multiple bodies- This is actually hilarious and doesnt cause any harm to the player. Two cannibals can get into fights. Sometimes a canibal will glitch and stand there idle while the other one attacks it. The idle cannibal is technically dead, but has the animation of staning up. Everytime a player or cannibal hits the idle cannibal, another idle body forms behind it, leaving a marvelous spectacle. (Note: this has only happened once)Overall------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think this game is amazing for how small it is (data-wise) It doesnt require much fire-power to runand still looks beautiful. The ai is great, the cave systems are beautiful, as are the different types of cannibals found there. I am overjoyed that this game is in alpha because that means this already amazaing game will become much better.My only problem: glitches and lack of variety of melee weapons.Thank you for reading this review, I hope it helped.

								The general feel of the game is nice, and its a working idea. Some of the gameplay elements might feel a bit gimmicky at first. The only thing I find unappealing are the bugs, namely clipping through nearly everything, sound system failing, launched into the air etc. But thats something you should expect from an early access.. Right? tl;dr    5/5 would play again when I have more patience			"

								Day One: Looks like I crashed in the middle of nowhere. Huh. Well, first thing I should I do is loot. I proceeded to exit the half of the plan that I was in. I went to the shore and collected twigs. Found a boat that was wrecked pretty close to the shore. Got some booze, drank it and continued. Next, survival was important. I found a pond, jabbed a sharp stick at some fish and continued. I saw some weird tribal markers. I kept a low profile and headed inward. I had the perfect area: Flat piece of dirt with some foliage to cover myself. I just put down my blueprint for my shelter when I looked behind me. 3 ""humans"" were behind me. Two were male and one was female. We exchanged looks and I BONZAI charged them. Didn't go to well. They outnumbered me and I died. Or so I thought. Day Two: Woke up in blood, tried and hungry. I soon found out they kidnapped me to their lair and soon found some of the passangers. I found the exit and decided to start new again. I found a lake and from where I was standing, I had the higher ground. I also saw three ""humans"" run away when I got there. I shrugged it off and began to build camp. I just finished my hut when AGAIN the same people hunted me down and surrounded me. I died.10/10 would bonzai charge again			"

								What incredible potential! This Alpha is beautiful, unfinished, unpolished, but stunning and intriguing.  While playing you truely get a sense of what it's going to become.  Rather than being disapointed i find that even though it's buggy and at times frustrating, I cant wait for it to develop into the amazing game you can feel when you play it!Pros:* Scenic and picturesque* Sounds great (on my headset at least)* Intuitive crafting system* Inventory looks amazing* Enemies are as creepy as they promised!Cons:* Has quite a variety of bugs* Has no game saves yet* AI is difficult to kill/escape/hide from* Larger building is very time intensiveClearly there is a lot of things for them 'to do' in order to get this game to be consistently playable.  But given how far they've come, I get the impression that it'll get there.Update:This game is great.  Coop is so much fun.  Screaming at friends as they die is great.  Consistently updated.  More content added regularly (considering there's so few devs working on it at least).  10/10 get wrecked every time i play.			"

								The Forest is a great survival game and has loads of potential for expansion. After my crash landing I grabbed an axe i found and some food and headed for the forest. Immediately i tried gathering things for a camp...but in the distance i saw movement, it intrigued me, what was i thinking? approaching these tribal looking people...They spotted me and starting hunting me! I made a run for it, jumping over rocks and moving between trees, UNTIL...i couldn't run anymore...why? i had no stamina, and now i had to face these 3 tribals head on, 1 in the tree, 2 circling me and I'm standing there ready to swing at the first one to come for me..i was scared i must say, having these creatures starring at me..and then it happened, it leaped for as i swung my axe, hitting it to the ground, i didn't stop hitting it though, i swung that axe like I've never swung an axe before! Swinging it so viciously i was hitting two of them at the same time, completely out of control, fighting for my life, realizing I had just killed two of them, blood on my hands and axe, shaking, the third one does a mighty jump with a rock in hand and knocks me cold...BUT i woke up moments later in a strange cave...their home. I now need to escape.and so is the life of the forest...			"

								This is a great game to play co-op.  Once you establish a base and figure out crafting you can basically become unstoppable if you play smart.  Resources are pretty easy to collect except when you REALLY need something and then you can't find it anywhere for about 15 or 20 minutes.  It's like the game knows what you want/need and it hides it from you.  Or the local cannibals are using dark magic to hide the neccessities from you.  I really can't wait for the story line of the game to progress as my co-op partner and I have explored a good amount of the map, found the more impressive and helpful items, and crafted most of the materials that are available.  There are plenty of bugs in the game as it is still in Alpha.  None of which make the game unplayable or unenjoyable.  Some of which that I noticed most are my axe randomly switching to the plane axe when chopping trees and I push my log cart away or get aggroed my the locals and lay them to rest.  Getting stuck at my bed/save point after loading up the game at the start of play.  Wild life and enemies will run into and through things occasionally disappearing.  Trees and bushes growing under the foundation and into your base.  Wildlife will spawn repeatedly in the same spot occasionally as well as birds flying to same spot and landing.  Overall I am really enjoying this game and it's extremely fun to play.  I would like to see a wider variety of tougher enemies and enemies in general but the game is great so far at this point.  Updates and hotifxes about every 2 weeks so far which is awesome.  Hopefully the Devs keep it up because they have already fixed a lot of the bugs that I've noticed since I've started playing the game.			"

								The open world survival genre seems to be growing by the day, we have Rust, Reign of Kings, Ark and many more.I had origanally thought about getting The Forrest but having bought the already mentioned games I thought "" Nah"" and placed it in my wishlist.I was intrigued by Forest, and kept looking at it like I wanted to buy it but didn't want to be disapointed like I was with RoK in regards to just being a plain bad game or Ark with it's Graphical problems!!!!Along comes the christmas period of 2015 and I was talking to a freind playing another game and he mentions Forest to which I mentioned that I was interested but don't know whether I should or not. 5 mins later "" you have a gift alert"" he only went and bought me The Forest.So we got on it, first thing I saw was some beautiful graphics, I thought why isnt ark like this? lolon a side note I do like ark, with that being the game I have most time on so far :-)the graphics were awesome, I didn't know what I was doing regarding building ect so that took a little learning but wow the game it self is amazing, sure there are a few faults in it but the game is awesome, finding canible villiges, or caves ect to explore, to craft weapons and items and to build a base area, everything in the game has SOME use to it, see a turtle? Kill it and use the shell as part of a water collector, see a canible? kill it and chop his arms and legs off and either cook them up to eat or hang them on a drying rack and eat as jerky :-) Nom Nom Nom Nom			"

								There are some things to know about this game before you buy it. #1: There are still many bugs (This is a EAG Review). Some tools will be inside eachother when you hold them in your hand. I found this very annoying because i couldnt get the right tool out withought dropping something. But im sure this will be fixed withen the next few updates. #2: You will be very paranoid about your surroundings and allways think that you're being watched, and most of the time you will be. The enemy will test you. Sometimes you may see one get right next to you just to look at you. As i was building my first shelter a nude woman came up to me and just stared. I didn't want to fight, so i just kept to my business and kept building. As soon as i picked up a big log and couldnt hold my weapon, she lunged towards me and attacked. I pulled out my axe and she ran away. I thought this was very interesting because she knew when i was vulnerable. In other occasions i have seen them on the beach eating. As i went up to them they looked at me, and it seemed like they were testing me in a way. They would run at me, stop, and just stare. It felt like they were seeing what I would do. Eventally they attacked me, nearly killed me, and i woke up in a cave covered in blood. #3: You will have to survive. Nothing will be easy and given to you. The Survival Guide book given to you in the beginning is your key to everything. You will need to use it to build shelters, fires, houses, ect. Keep in mind that this review was written the first day the game was released, and many things will changed, added, fixed, and removed. Im very happy with the game, and I know that it will just get better.			"

								A Survival game with pretty impressive ai. Some bugs here and there but a game with great potential if it´s further developed and current core features are kept the way they are. The Price is fair and good for what is delivered (currently). COOP mode is very fun. It would be nice if a story (which should be optional to follow) would be developed but is not neccasary to enjoy the game. After you got the basics of building and getting your needs like food and water filled you will spent A LOT of time figuring out what the cannibals will do next to get you if they have even seen you, yet. They follow a certain routine but will also change their behaviour to match situations which makes them an intellegent and unpredictable enemy in certain ways.			"

								Buying this after a few years of playing non-steam really blew my mind, I am so impressed to the work that the devs have done, I actually thought this game was a kinda dead after forgetting about it for 2/3 years, but I see how it's still being played and updated! The new things they've put in gave me so many ideas to do, like, I started a new game after years, gathered supplies, went to the beach, made a shack on a cliff, made some defences around it, I see a cannibal, he doesn't attack me, and he keeps fleeing when I go to him, I call him ""Henk"" , he runs off in to the forrest, that night, I just see ""Henk"" again, but with 2 other cannibals, they attack, one gets caught in my trap (you can check my screenshots) , I kill the other one while he's trying to break in my base, the last attacked just screams from a distance and just runs off crying. It's one the best experiences I've ever had in video games, 10/10 would get attacked by strange mutant naked people again. "

YouTube™ Video: The Forest - Alpha Gameplay - v0.01 

			Views: 37		

			The Forest is finally released on Steam, this game is AWESOME! Except that it's super alpha early access and borderline broken to the point of unplayable.		

The game is like Rust on steroids. Obviously very early alpha, v0.01, but even now i enjoy it tons. Need wood? Chop down a tree and watch it fall over. Food? Grab the spear and impale lunch!			"

								This game is pretty good as it is but could be awesome.   This is my first review after playing only a few hours.  I'll edit and update this as I play!Pros:-Nice crafting system with creative uses for animal parts-Cool building system allows for variation-Realistic setting provides good immersion -Survival manual is a great way to browse craftable structures-Nice AI animals-Cool places to exploreCons:-I don't like the intro, it's very well done but I'd rather just spawn in-I didn't realize this game had an ending.  I'd prefer an open ended experience-I think the map is locked, so it's always the same.  This limits replayability and exploration.Overall I would give this 7/10 stars as it is.  I haven't been ovewhelmed or super impressed by anything aside from the brilliant tree chopping and building mechanics.  I also really like the creative use of skulls and skins for lights and decor.Suggestions for the devs:I would keep the intro for trailers etc.  But it doesnt need to be in the game, especially not in multiplayer.  You can wake up with amnesia and have no idea what happened but still have plane parts lying around as it is.  The player will figure it out.  This way you maintain the story without limiting the players imagination as to what happened in the past.  I think it's a lot more interesting and open ended if you provide an open world with very little narrative.I'd also recommend looking into a procedural option for land/terrain generation.  It is hard at first but pays off as each players maps can be varied.  You'll attract more players and build new tools to help develop your next game...7/10Thanks for reading			"

								When I fell, I was a nothing, a worm in the dirt just hoping to kill a lizard or find some undeath berries. The savages stocked me and I was scared, for the first time in my life, I was scared. But I grew, I made myself a nest and would not resign myself to the fate of so many others, I would become something more. They would know the white man's soul was more black and corrupt than theirs. Soon enough I was hunting the savages, the cannibals, the islanders, I was killing them, their crimson tides spilled upon my axe arm and I made omens to their suffering. The pale demon would descend upon their homes and make them pay for being a part of this ancient land. I cut their trees, ate and wore their animals and burnt their forests, I could make them thralls but they lack even the simple ability to obey. So I would show them what the rest of the world knew, the white man is death.For real tho, I slaughtered a savage woman while her man ran behind a tree and watched me, then I kill him with her leg. 10/10Wait, I'm supposed to find my kid?

								This is my first time reviewing a game, but this game is definitely, definitely worth the review. First and foremost, the game is a survival sandbox where you're pitted against Cannibals. There are different Cannibal tribes that are out to eat you, as they have with the rest of the flight passengers. There are also Mutant Cannibals that are terrifying to come up against. In the opening cinematic you find out that your son has been kidnapped by a Cannibal, and you spend the game hunting up clues to find out where he is and what happened to him, while trying to build a structure to protect yourself from the onslaught of enemies. What's so incredibly enthralling about the game is that there's no strict guidelines of what you HAVE to do. There are a lot of people who like to try and hide from the Cannibals. It's possible to actually avoid being seen at all by them, though this last patch has made it far more difficult to do so. There are some players who don't have any interest in finding their son, don't even bother with the caves and just build the most intricate structure they can before the next reset. There are also players, like myself, who enjoy building right in the middle of their patrol patterns and try to instigate them into attacking. The crafting system is pretty fun. They recently implemented that the Multiplayer games can now have customized walls and foundation, roofing and flooring. They also introduced the custom stairs which have been immensely helpful for everyone. The cannibals have a very advanced AI. It's incredible to see how they interact. I actually had a couple kneel before me to sacrifice themselves recently, and a cannibal drag off a dead cannibal as well. They are usually more active at night but you will see pats during the day. They won't always attack you, some will approach you and then back away, others will just run in the opposite direction. If you get the starving cannibals on you and you take one down then on occasion the other starving cannibal will actually stop attacking you to eat his fallen comrade.Fire, fire, fire. It's THE best way to kill the cannibals. Molotovs are good, though aiming is a little rough. Fire arrows are the best way to go, by far.There are glitches however, that can be rather game breaking. In multiplayer there has been an issue where it will randomly start making it to where you can no longer add items into the thing that you are crafting. Without being able to add to it, the game has to halt and you have to start over. There are several log sled glitches, the main one that I've seen recently is that you can put some logs into the sled but then cannot remove them. If the host tabs out for longer than 20-ish seconds then the clients in multiplayer will get kicked from game.Considering this game is still in Alpha, it's an incredible investment. They regularly update it and you can see a lot of progress. I'd prefer if they would post updates about what they're working on as they're working on it, but overall I'd definitely say to get this game!			"

								The Forest! What an awesome game. I can only list pros to the game, even though there is a cons list, the cons list has things that will probably be implemented within the game, ready for full release.Pros:- The game looks and runs incredibly as it is designed to run on an array of systems from the very low end to the very high end so yes, you will probably be able to run it- It feels very real and it does not take long to be engrossed into the action- It feels like a survival game as nothing is obvious to the player. It doesn't feel like a game as you are a massive part to it- The crafting system is good so far and has been expanding slowly.- The mutants vary and you really do feel like you are being attacked by a co-ordinated tribe with a few rogue elements thrown in too.- The storyline is incredible. The lore for the mutants has been amazing to follow and invest in. And the story is heart breaking and shocking with the twists that occurCons:- The crafting system must be more realistic. For instance, it only takes logs to make a tree bridge but no 'tree sap' or 'rope' to hold it up. - Being able to change the landscape would be a welcomed adjustment. Big rocks and some tree types should be breakable.- Being able to make a pond or a moat around your base would be a cool addition- New crafting animations and being able to write your own notes in the bookOverall, if you want a good survival horror game, this is the best game on steam and NO - THERE ARE NO GUNS. Apart from one gun which takes 5 seconds to reload and you have no crosshair so good luck with that!			"

								The Forest,one of the closest games to perfect. The controls are realistic without being too slow,and you really do feel like your a survivor carrying an axe or logs or whatever's in your hands,dealing with the cannibals and other threats such as dehydration,hunger,energy,and fall damage. The building construction works well,they can be damaged and deleted without exploding the second you touch one,and it's surprisingly satisfying to complete a project such as the full size log cabin,which takes at least 90 logs. It can get kinda boring to build larger things at times since you can only carry 2 logs at once,and you sacrifice any weapons until you put the logs down or place them. However,this is realistic without being terrible. There are now 3 different tribes of cannibal instead of the 1 kind there was when the game first released. These tall grey/silver ones that jump at you,the glowing ones that have always been there (now they throw you either forwards or hundreds of feet into the air,which can be fun,and deal significant damage,making them sort of the bosses of the game) and then the female cannibal,which is entirely naked except for a skirt,and these actually explode if hit from above,but otherwise throw basic punches. In addition to these 3 tribes the cave monsters will now come above ground and attack you,i first noticed them on day 20,so i guess that's when they come out. These things are horribly overpowered,2 hits and your down,but that's not nescessarily a bad thing,since these were kinda designed to be the ""monsters in the shadows"". The ones that drag you in before you can even scream. That kinda tension building is horror done amazingly well. To fight these bad guys you have to first build a base,starting off with nothing more than the posessions of the passengers that crashed in the plane alongside you,and a standard orange axe that hits fast but does relatively low damage. Along the way you can find ponds to drink from,stuff to collect and craft with,animals to hunt,and even other weapons such as a modern axe,which does more damage than the plane axe but is the slowest weapon,you can find rope in Cannibal villages to craft the appropriately named ""craft axe"",which is somewhere in between plane axe and modern axe,and then the Katana,which is faster than the plane axe and hits harder than the modern axe. This is the best possible thing to fight with.  Cannibals also drop their skull axes,but these can't really cut anything and you'd be better off using a stick. It's not just axes though,Molotovs can be crafted with cloth and booze,which are plentiful at the plane crash site and respawn in suitcases every day. I HIGHLY reccomend crafting as much of these as you possibly can when you first start out,they aren't great against enemies with bigger health bars,but against the scavengers you face on your first 6 nights or so,their amazing. Of course,your only way to build and know any of this is the Survival Guide. Think FNAF's phone guy if he was a book. It tells you what berries you can eat,what purpose certain things serve,and even suggests helpful locations and items to hunt for. By far the most important part of this book is the effigies section. In the tabs at the top of the book overlay there's one with a red X. Click it,and you can build a variety of effigies from the parts of mutants you chop with an axe (or stick). Larger ones last longer,but they all last at most 3 nights now,so i reccomend just going with the small fries,less trouble and less risk. These effigies will be your only hope against the mutant hoard,none of these guys are lit up,they'll march right over you,no matter how much you swing that axe around.So this is a very good,balanced survival experience,and even funner when you bring multiple players into the mix. I especially have fun naming the servers. That's right,no more fooling around with external programs,everyone and anyone can host servers on this game,new games or saved maps,it doesn't matter. If only all games made it this easy. The server naming thing is surprisingly fun to mess around in. I wish the character limit wasn't so small,but it's really only a minor nitpick. Just a little heads up,it doesn't work too well for me when i try to livestream it either,even on Ultra Low quality,but again,just a minor nitpick,if your just playing to play then you should be able to have high quality graphics with ease. They make the enviroments strangely ominous yet beautiful at the same time,even with Ultra Low settings,which is better than most games do.So the one negative i do have besides minor nitpicks? The death screens. Now i know what your thinking,dying is part of the game,it's bound to happen,it happens to all of us. While that is true,the deaths felt kind of dragged out to me. It plays this dramatic music as the cannibals roar and slash and jump at you,i guess it's supposed to make you feel something,and that would be all fine and good,games with emotional stuff such as Telltale's The Walking Dead have pulled it off spectacularly well. Only issue is,this game really has no story. I mean yeah,your in a plane crash,but after that it's an entirely sandbox survival game,racing against the clock to put that final log in place before dusk. But the main character never speaks,never shows any emotion,making these long,dragged out death scenes feel a little out of place at best and EXTREMELY annoying at worst. It's hard to connect to a silent protagonist unless it's something like the main hero from Need For Speed Most Wanted where nostalgia plays a part in it. The only reason i even mention this is that getting pounded by cannibals 5 times in a row trying to get your stuff,then having to sit through a 2 minute death,can really suck the fun out of a multiplayer party.In the end though,these devs are clearly willing to try,i mean,pushing out 3 UPDATES in one day!? Who else puts in that kind of effort developing a game? And the game is pretty fun despite that one major negative,so i'm giving it 4 stars just for the amount of effort put in and the amazing results it has given us. You have not played video games until you have played The Forest. It is that good. And if you buy it and don't like it,at least you know part of the money went to a group of developers that listen and spend their free time fixing the game for US.			"

								I LOVE THIS GAME, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes survival horror games, when I saw this game on youtube I thought it was kind of lame like ""Oh how scary, just a bunch of naked people running around in a forest"" in a sarcastic tone, but then I found out there was a story to this game and a lore, I finally decided to buy it with my steam wallet wondering if I made a good choice, IT... WAS... TERRIFYING. The first couple of days are the most dreadful with the cannibals not even attacking you, they are just watching you, which is so terrifying. I also love how the cannibals have behaviors, they don't just mindlessly attack you and be an annoyance, they watch you, they learn about you, and if they see you kill one of their tribe leaders, they usually don't mess with you. Same goes for the mutants, if you keep going into caves and attack and kill mutants, they will start attacking and killing you, I hope this was helpful and I hope you will play it			"

								This game has so much to offer... but theres a few things i hope that get put into it... like more reasons to go into the cannibal villages and caves... something like...  the only way to find other things to build are in cannibals camps/ caves... like more pages to the suvivel book... or some paper with cannibal text and some how you have to find out what it means... higher the risk better the reward!!i also have another idea... somewhere on the island you find your bag... with pictures a diary and a back story to who you are... it would be cool if the story would be different for each person but i think that would be kinda hard to do...anway... i do recommend this game to anyone who likes this genre of game... sorry for spelling mistakes and the lack of grammer			"

Early Access Review
								The Short Version: Wait for the beta or the official launch.  None of the features are implemented in any kind of finished state.  It's better to spend money on a finished product, today, than to buy an unfinished/undesigned product for ""tomorrow"".  In all seriousness, this project might not even fully finish. (See TOWNS)I'm here to counter all these positive reviews by people who barely played 10 hours.Pros:This game has many outstanding concepts and features:     >FPShooter non-shooter          I've been waiting for games like these since TRIBES tRPG     >Open-World     >Crafting          Weapons and supplies     >Construction           Shelter and defenses     >Enemies          Danger and tension from the native mutants     >Needs driven          The one game that doesn't need a hunger and rest and cold mod!     >Dynamic Weather           Day to Night, Rainy/Sunny, possible snowy/frigid environment on the mountain.     >Absence of story          In a survival-game the ending is death and the story is literally the sum of the events of your game. There is no convoluted story to understand and follow. There is no main-line objective obstructing your progress.  It's more open-ended than anything out so far.  It's more solitary than any horror story.  You truly are alone and you truly don't know what to do next, rather than constantly hearing some tutorial or figuring out some menial puzzle, respectively.  This aspect of games are largely forgotten and gamers constantly feel like they got strangers holding their hands every time they play a new game.  It's refreshing to have a manual and a start game and to be set loose on this island without having to look at a picture of a slow-talking and historically-inaccurate representation of a person telling me how to wipe my own♥♥♥♥♥♥     That is the best aspect of the game, though; it's list of features.Cons:      And with that said, I move on to the finer points of the review.  Finer in terms of scope.  A more in-depth look at each point.  A more realistic gauge on what the game is, and where it lands on the scale between buy now and buy later.  Indeed, you wouldn't want a nice looking game that doesn't play well.     None of the features are anywhere close to being implemented.  Yes, you can fish, and farm, and build a boat, and build a house, and chop down a tree, and so on.... you could do all these things and be satisfied for a few days just working your way through the list of features, but you won't find yourself doing any of them a second or third time.     Very quickly, you learn that the quality of the implemented features are barely placeholder status.  Most things you can do are written off as an alpha feature when you read the responses to the complaint about it.  If you've ever played a hugely unsatisfying game then you'll know what I'm talking about. Chop down your twentieth tree and it's likely to be your last....out of boredom.  If there's a mutant attacking you he causes the game to play a spooky noise, which is quite thrilling.  The novelty of such things, however, wear out fast and soon even encountering the main threat of the game is like encountering a group of pidgeons being fed; utterly mundane.  That novelty would have hit me much better and would still be a factor if the game was immersive.  Sadly my experiences with these alpha features have likely ruined any future experience I might have with those features entirely.     My review would likely be far more positive if the game had improved over time but the features keep getting added in a very unsatisfying way, and much too little in between too long times.  I have tried every build since v0.01 and it still feels like im playing the same game except with more annoyances.  Every time Space Engineers updates they have a game changing edition in a pretty well polished form.   So far, the form in which features are implemented with this game falls just short of ""worth throwing a tantrum"".       I didn't even bother trying v0.06B.  Why are they populating the world when there's absolutely nothing for them to do?  These mutants can barely even do a patrol, let alone more complex scripting and even combat.  I'd rather they flush out the map borders, seeing as we can't even access the whole map yet.Features:     >FPS           Combat ranges from Clunky to downright garbage.  You can't even aim the bow properly and arrows collide with just about everything except your intended target.  Don't even get me started on melee.     >Open-World          We can't even access the whole map.  The part of the map that we can access has very little to see and even less to do.  Once you realize you've finished building your base you lose all purpose and start going on suicide missions to lure out and kill a super mutant as a quasi-achievement.     >Crafting          Just like most other games, gather the materials and combine them.  Unlike most other games, theres VERY little to make.     >Building          Probably the feature that's gotten the most attention and the feature that's the least satisfying.  From stairs to walls to prefab-buildings, they all have some kind of kink in them when they're actually built.  Building them raises many more problems, and gathering the materials raises even more.  From crude mechanics like how trees are chopped, to fun-sapping useless mechanics like how trees fall over in perfectly lengthened logs, to broken mechanics like resource spawns (Rocks, farms, etc)     >Enemies          Ridiculous combat and encounter AI will have you annoyed not long before the terror wears thin.  From idiotic women following you around to waking up to a group of mask wearing dudes who like theyre guarding a basketball hoop...all of your interactions get old very fast and the AI shows it's intelligence quickly.  They'll dart in and retreat over and over to no effect.  They'll trigger the spooky mutant noise while perched in a tree, obviously stuck from a bug.   You'll walk into ghost-town camps.  You'll come across patrols making bee-lines between the water and some point outside of their nearest village.     >Needs driven          For a game that revolves around satisfying your needs, AKA SURVIVAL, it does really poorly in giving you options to solve your needs-related problems.  There's only one building in which you can rest, currently.  There's only one reliable food-source (forage) in a game where farming and breeding would be a no-brainer second and third option and should be their top priorities.  Cooking raw meat can break your fire and force you to build another fire and cook another piece of meat.  The main hunting technique, in a survival game, is to run up to it and hit it with an axe, whatever ""it"" is.  Wet/Dry and rest/energy is rudimentary at best and broken at other times.  The only real penalty is having an annoying tooltip remind you of how cold you are, or not being able to sprint.     >Dynamic Weather          Just plain broken.  Thunderstorms frequency is way too high.  Night seems way longer, as if it's winter, and keeping yourself awake in day hours seems to be a trial in itself.  GTA III did it better a decade ago.     >Absence of story          Though I wrote up on how good it is that this game has no real story, the evidence of the child in the beginning cutscene seems to suggest that a story isn't out of the picture.  It could just be that the absence of story is another alpha feature.In my opinion, you're better off waiting for a finished game or at least a BETA.  The way it is now, spending money is just spoiling a good finished game for you.  It's like buying the episode spoilers for your favorite show.  Don't reward complacency.  Buy the game when the devs actually develop the game further.  I've been sitting on this product in the same state for months.			"

								The Forest was not at all what I was expecting it to be. I wasn't aware of a story until I started exploring the caves. Honestly, The Forest doesn't really have jumpscares (besides the bats when entering a cave, seriously why). It's more horrific and haunting, and the cannibals are a nightmare, especially the sounds they make. The Forest could have a few improvements, for example I crash a decent amount when entering caves. More weapons and animal variety (even though it's already quite good) would also be cool. 8/10			"

								this is an amazing game, i have troble finding animals sometimes the spawn seems to be down, but i have some ideas for this game, maybe neat skill trees with survival, techical, and hunter, on survival it allows you to cut down on building materials, or build advanced stuctures, on technical you can strip things for parts, and open up advanced crafting options, on hunter add bows or throwing tomahawks, it would make for a very interesting game, and varied gameplay, wether you take my idea or not im just glad i could take part in such an amazing game!!!!

								From the one game I played, and the 5 days I survived -Day 1: Build Cabin off of edge of cliff overlooking ocean so no cannibals can sneak from behind it- Surround the front with traps- Try to sleep for the night, but cannibals chillin outside so can't- Spend the night behind my cabin with a small fire (theres a little spot for my character to hide, but not enough room for the cannibals to reach me, they just fall off the cliff)Day 2: Time to explore the beach-Find luggage scattered down the shore, with more energy bars than I know what to do with-Find boat, on it - flares, new axe, rope, someones mix tape and a skull-Head back to basecamp, but on the way find some camp with triangular cabins. Creeoy music starts up so I don't hang around too long-Actually get some decent sleep that nightDay 3: More exploring-Decide to explore the woods some more-Find berrys, seeds etc-Stumble across another one of those camps, this time I look around-Seems like the cannibals have a fetish for tennis balls since every corpse I find has about 8 shoved in them-Find a hole leading to a cave with a rope going down, decide against it since I'm probably not ready-Head back to camp for some sleepDay 4: Defenses-Decide I need better defenses around my cabin-Build walls almost all around my cabin (this takes about the whole day)-SleepDay 5: Death-Wake up and go to finish my wall-As I step out side my fortress to gather more logs I see a group of cannibals just walking around not far from me (about 6)-Stay away from them but don't actually run-As they get closer I go back into my fortress-They don't chase me but somehow they all wandered into the one spot I hadn't set up a wall-They want my blood now-I hide in my cabin as they all rush to me-5 of the 6 hit my traps-He starts attacking, I try to swing my axe and he doesn't swing it-I die because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ didn't swing his axe no matter how many times I tried to get him to10/10 would play Cast Away Simulator again "

								This game is in alpha, there are some gameplay bugs. Given. But, those few bugs aside, this game is amazing. 9/10Pros: 1. Best story, hands down, I have ever experienced in a game. (Cut scenes are rare, short, and ACTUALLY make groundbreaking inpacts on the plot.2. Amazing co-op experience. All of the bugs I experienced that I actually needed to note because they impacted my experience were because of co-op. (ex. Entering a cutscene with another player in co-op caused them to fall through the world infinitely. Had to restart from last save.)3. PvE is fun. It isn't exactly hard but once you enter the caves it sure as hell ain't easy when you find harder enemies. If you gear up, recruit a pal to take on the big guys with you, it's enjoyable and sometimes got my heart racing. (Boss fights are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!)Either Pro or Con:1. If you don't look for the clues, you might never find a piece of the story. You actually have to put a lot of effort into solving the story for yourself, the game doesn't hand it to you. I personally enjoyed this and having someone to play with that had just enough information to get us to the next plot point made running around the island looking for clues a blast! :DCons:1. Not for the faint of heart. I'm not saying this game is utterly terrifying and competes with big horror games on the horror scale, but god damn I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing scardy cat. The sound engineering in this game is what sets the mood. Some cut scenes had the most generically ominous music I ever heard but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. (Just scheduled my first PTSD rehab session in town...)2. Saving progress can be annoying and inconvenient, but preventable. The only way to save in caves (where most of the plot points occur) are by building a small shelter with sticks and leaves. I ran out of sticks quick and ended up being forced to keep pushing on, and on, and on until my co-op friend and I decived to call it quits because it was 3am and to retrace ALL (A-♥♥♥♥ING-LOT) of our steps in the morning. Really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, but annoyance here is preventable if you wait until you know you absolutely should.Notable bugs:1. Falling through floors, rare though. Sometimes through the entire map, sometimes just to the next durface available like falling through the floor of my cabin to the sand below. Eh.2. Being forced into the same spot as another co-op player or item like a log can launch you into the air and kill you from fall damage. Double Eh.TL;DR- ♥♥♥♥ing amazing story, chills me to the bone. Have fun digging for clues! :D			"

								The Forest is a terrifyingly awesome game! Once you get ingame you are left alone after a horrific plane crash, where apparently know one survived but you. You are a lone survivor and have to build your own shelter hunt and find food to fill up your belly, but the world is in't a trip in lala land; you will run into inhumane enemies. You will run into these creatures that look very similar to humans, but they aare much stronger and faster than you. They are challenging, especially if you find yourself surrounded by more than one. The best way to survive these cannibals is by running away or fleeing. If you get killed by the cannibals they will abduct you, and take you to a cave where you will find the rest of the airplane passengers. This cavern is very big, and will have to be explored later on in the game, but I would stay away from it for the first few days. In this cavern you will have to escae, but if you get lost you might find yourself in a very dangerous situation. Deeper in the cavern live these mutations, some look like people wrapped around by human skin. These mutated creatures are probably the most dangerous, and they will be quick to kill you. Ofcourse they live in the caves! So if you don't go in there you'll be safe right? WRONG! After a couple of days when you have developed your little safe haven, and you think nothing can get you... they will emerge from the depths of the cave and will surround your home then they will break through anything they need too; just to kill you. This is a very challenging game, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting it if you are into open world survival games like Rust, or are into horror games; trust me the cannibals do a good job at sneaking up behind you, then SCARING THE LIVING♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF YOU!!! This game is fun, but it does have a lot of bugs and glitches; it's fine because it is in Alpha and hopefully they will fix it soon - SlenderCat			"

								Its like minecraft and unturned mixed together.  For it being in alpha is still impressive and I can definitely see it being a solid survival game once they button it up.			"

								SPOILERS:So far the game has been through a lot of trial and error in the updates for the alpha. Don't buy this game unless you're willing to test it. And by test I mean enctouner glitch after glitch after glitch not to mention dealing with updates that make the cannibibals either too hostel or completely sedate. Pros: Beautiful environment, ambient atmosphere, scary monsters and disturbing noises in the dark that will surely make you second guess not building that shelter sooner.Cons: Ai is very dumb right now. I know the developers are trying hard  but the hostels are either too passive or too aggressive. The game has potential to be very very boring. You build stuff and then what? Maybe explore the island, find a cave or the other half of the aircraft? Needs more excitement. Needs missions and maybe some npcs scattered here and there. Even if all of this gets fixed the game itself is still very boring. Some might not agree but after you've built your traps and cabin its pretty much snoresville. It needs more variety, like mountains. I would argue it even needs a research station on the island thats abandoned that kinda gives background to why the natives are so extreme. Anything to add some kind of plot.  "

								Naked cannibals......What more can I say? Actually pooped my pants on my first night on the island.Not many games have the ability to make you feel this vulnerable as the player.Genuinely stunning and legitimately frightening.... This is an outstanding game and can only get better with more development.10/10			"

								got this game some weeks after it was available on steam. the atmosphere of the game is simple and amazing. dispite being early access its really good ( speaking of the graphics and new content ), you stumble over some bugs, but you can report them and a week later they are fixed and they constantly add new features which keep you testing out new things and such. never got bored with this game in 5 months. aaaand especially with the new co-op its hella fun to play it with friends			"

								The Forest is incredible! BUT I recommend you wait for full release. This is because the game is constantly improving and can only get better with each update. I think patience would be a true virtue in this case. To wait for a complete, finished product that would be unlike any game you have played. Unless you want to be apart of the process of making the game better, defending yourself from cannibals with friends in co-op or in multiplayer, squashing bugs, and to see how the game develops. I've put quite a lot of time into this game and came to the conclusion that at certain times when I visit the game there always comes a point where I feel like I've explored, crafted, and had done everything the game was capable of at that point in time. What I like to do is revisit it every now and again and I am always impressed. My favorite part of the day is seeing the devlogs from the developer (Praise be to them). They update it frequently, packed with new content, systems. Every once in a while it's like a whole new game after a certain time period of updates. I didn't purchase the game. I won it on a twitch stream. If I did, however, purchase it I would have been very happy with my decision because of how the developers treat the games development and it's players. It's an incredibly beautiful game, sound design is constantly improving and is excellent, has moments that have never been done before in a game. The potential is unreal. I can't wait for final release. I would say that the game reminds me in certain ways of Silent Hill without spoiling anything.			"

								I am completely amazed that this game was made by a group of only 4 people.  There are some issues here and it is an alpha; however the forthcoming patch is going to fix issues such as not being able to save the game.  The enviroment is beautiful, immersive and absolutely terrifying depending on where you are.  I am very much looking forward to seeing how this game develops.  Do not buy it if you are going to get upset over glitches and issues that are to be expected in an alpha.  I personally think the price of this game will go up significantly once it is out of early access and I think the current price is fair for something quite so remarkable.  If you like games like Rust, DayZ, Project Zomboid definately check out the forest because I think you will love it.			"

								What a wonderful game.Day 1: Found a nice place on the beach. Spotted a few of the locals so I crafted a few molotovs then discovered my supplies were not diminishing while I crafted. Killed a few of the locals that attacked. Made an effigy then shelter. Then two more parties came during the night and I ended them quickly.Day 2: Killed another hunting party wih molotovs... Died my first time by hitting a dead local's body. Awoke in the cave, quickly retrieved the Flare Gun and made my way out. Found my way back and went to sleep.Day 3: Killed some more locals, built un-needed structures.Day 4: Uneventful... Where did the locals go?Day 5: Uneventful... I am starting to feel lonely.Day 6: Ran through the forest out of boredom and committed suicide.			"

								The Forest was not at all what I was expecting it to be. I wasn't aware of a story until I started exploring the caves. Honestly, The Forest doesn't really have jumpscares (besides the bats when entering a cave, seriously why). It's more horrific and haunting, and the cannibals are a nightmare, especially the sounds they make. The Forest could have a few improvements, for example I crash a decent amount when entering caves. More weapons and animal variety (even though it's already quite good) would also be cool. 8/10			"

								Well, I just had to take the time to leave a review for this game which i would class as one of my absolute favourites dispite being early access and which i will continue following and playing. I am a scaredy cat... I couldn't bring myself to play this alone without freaking out at the pitter patter of a deer in the distance about to run past me or an unseen rabbit lurking in the bushes rustling. So i played with a couple of friends. Still scared but feeling a little more confident we ventured. Built a base on the island crafting whatever we could to help us survive. The cannibles are quite frankly horrifying at first. The noises when you are caught out at night are enough to curdle your blood at times. Especially when you can tell they are coming from a mountain somewhere probably spying down on you, stalking ready to strike some time.The caves are where the early access shows. Don't get me wrong they are unnerving and so fun to go through but lacking in enemys in some places. Never the less you want to search the entire thing to find clues to what has happened. All in the aim to get to that dramatic sinkhole you come across at some point while adventuring. The story had a turn i didn't really see coming and is open ended which makes it quite exciting to think of whats going to be added from now to the time of full release. In short terms. I have had an absolutely amazing time with this game already. Have completed it twice. The building and gathering has that addictive feel. The story is great for an alpha. I cannot make this game sound as great as it is so buy it and put in the time to find out!			"
