												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												Don't get this game, not because it's bad, but simply because it uses Uplay.I pre-ordered from dust when it came out and loved it, sadly I lost my old email and I've been unable to login to Uplay. I contacted Ubisoft and pretty much got a big middle finger in response; they refused to help me, even when I offered paypal transaction details. When I said the legality of their pracices relating to CD keys is questionable within the EU, they stopped responding and two weeks later, they sent an email saying that the support ticket had been closed.I've tried their support another three times but they've offered me no help.Find some other way of playing this game if you must, it's pretty fun; but don't buy it from Ubisoft.

												TL;DR, I highly, highly recommend playing this game, but I do not recommend buying it. This is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen destroyed by an unusable DRM scheme.From Dust is a work of art. Watching the form of the earth change and mould as the player manipulates it brings back memories of Black and White, but with a sense of visual awe that comes from being a much more recent game. It is something that I feel any gamer owes it to themselves to experience at least once. Sadly, I can't recommend buying the game, as I have an ethical objection to UPlay. The alternative, a Chrome app that is free in the Chrome Store, is okay, but ultimately Ubisoft's disingenuity has ruined, or at least limited access to, what I consider to be an actual art piece.Fun fact: Ubisoft actually patched the game to remove UPlay. I had been hoping that would happen and bought it shortly after. Only a few months later, I had been happily enjoying my new game when I launched one day to find UPlay had been patched back in.Ubisoft, I know you're not listening, but stop punishing your customers for buying your products. You did the right thing once before and removed the DRM from this game. Now that the DRM is back on, I would not be surprised to find the number of seeders for this game on torrent sites has spiked. No one wants a content management system inside another content management system, especially if they only have one or two games in the ""nested"" one.			"

												From Dust was a very fun puzzle sandbox game, until UPlay got involved. It didnt need it back when it got released, but now you cant play it unless you log in with a Ubisoft account. Now dont get me wrong. While I dont mind too much about logining in and saving the info so I dont have to do it over and over, the fact that the game didnt have this at launch(or a couple years after) is what drives me away. The fact that they felt it was neccesary to include this ""Feature"" that late in the game just shows me what kind of paranoid, crazy, and untrusting company Ubisoft is becoming.			"

												This game is beautiful, the physics are the best I've ever seen and the environments are pretty, but that only gets it so far, the AI is stupid, and the men seem to be incapable of moving out of the way of water and lava coming right for them, and are confused my tiny differences in height, where I have to dump earth all over just to convince them to climb it, the game doesn't let you build a village where there is 'too much water', which is fine until you find yourself not being able to find where the water is in this tiny area, because you're not allowed to have a single drop in the place you want a village. Getting to the next level seemed more frustrating and tiresome than fun. I pre-ordered this on Steam and was really looking forward to it, but was ultimately disappointed.			"

												From Dust is a creative and interesting god-game/strategy game. It's sort of an update on Populous. Way better looking than Populous, though.I enjoyed playing From Dust through about half of the game's missions. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment to advance your tribe through a series of goals is fun and challenging. But after about 5 levels, the game's challenge became less about figuring out a strategy, and more about executing it with the awkward controller scheme. After about 8-10 levels, it just became too awkward to play. The strategy elements of the game outgrew their clumsy control scheme.I might recommend this, though, if it's on deep sale. It's pretty to look at, and I had a good couple of hours of fun before deciding the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. ...That damned level with the burning trees. Gah.			"

""From dust we came and fought the natural forces""An amazing little godmode game, where you can handle the elements earth, water and lava. I think it's too small, only 15 levels, more like an advertising game. But the concept is quite good and challenging. On the one hand you have to protect your people from deadly floods, on the other hand their villages get burned down by fire caused by the lava. Sometimes you have to fight all the elements together at once. Then you should have the right strategy to survive...			"

												The Steam version of From Dust runs just fine without Uplay. If that's the only thing preventing you from buying it, then don't let it keep you from experiencing what is a very unique and enjoyable strategy game.It will only take you 5 minutes, at most, to create a firewall rule so that From Dust will run just like any other non-Uplay Steam game. You don't need a Ubisoft account either, and you can play in offline mode.After downloading From Dust, but before starting it for the first time, install Ubisoft Game Launcher from the From Dust\Support\Ubisoft directory. Then use Windows Firewall to block the Ubisoft launcher from using the internet, which will prevent it from updating to Uplay when you start the game.That's all you need to do. If you aren't familiar with how to use Windows Firewall, there is a short guide that will show you how to create a rule for From Dust right here:

												First of all this game will require Uplay to play and you will have to lock your serial to that one account so don't forget the information. While annoying, this is doable and not the only game like it. Wish I had read more of the steam reviews before buying. I would not recommend this game and if you already bought it, my sympathies, but it is not the next Black and White. Buy at own risk, I cannot stress this enough.Controls and Mechanics: Saw a lot of complaints about this. Some buttons are counter intuitive or not 'the norm' but you can grow accustomed to them fairly quickly there's only two really weird ones. UI is spare so you aren't overwhelmed with options. Movement of the cursor corresponds with the movement of your avatar and 90% of the time this is fine and you get used to it fast. The other 10% of the time it will go too far too fast or something at just the wrong time and Bad Things will happen because of it (this has caused me to restart at least one map). Similarly 1-2-3-4 isn't hard to remember, but when the powers attributed to them shift around you have to constantly check the menu to make sure you're using the right power.The AI of the people is actually fairly decent - when it works. When it doesn't you get dozens of annoying little voices screaming at you from the top of a hastily erected pillar as rivers of lava flow around them, voices which you cannot stop until either that lava does, or one of your powers comes up, etc. Furthermore idiotic people have cost me wins before, causing me to have to restart some maps several times or making simple tasks very hard. Camera: Similar to dungeon crawlers, up above and slightly behind the avatar with the option to zoom in a little or to zoom in completely (and not be able to do anything) on just one of your humans. Like the controls 90% of the time this is fine, but when it goes wrong it can be very frustrating giving the fast liquids you are working with.Now to the reason I am writing this review: some spoilers ahead (I try not to name names). Surprisingly interesting premise and I genuinely wanted to see my people through and to find out more about what had happened before me. The cut scene between maps gets annoying overtime since its pretty long and just the same footage over and over again but that's not game breaking. What is game breaking is the end. The last level. First of all the game froze just as I was about to complete it so I had to go back and do it all over again (first time this had happened). I hesitate to detail what exactly happens but suffice to say that I was extraordinarily displeased, felt that absolutely NONE of the plot points were tied up (they didn't even try to softball something in or if they did it was too subtle for my shock and disappointment to see it), we weren't given any revelations or massive info dumps, its one giant screw you to the idiot stupid enough to waste their time on this game. Before the end I was willing to give this game a pass and say there were some levels worth redoing, some content worth getting every little bit from, but afterwards I uninstalled the game without second thoughts.

												From Dust is a fun physics game that won't keep you coming back again and again to play it, but luckily the technology itself has aged well. What other game has free-flowing water, sand, and lava that can all be mixed together to create rock, land, volcanoes, mountains, earthquakes, and tsunamis? If you are hoping that the very end of the game unlocks a no-strings-attached sandbox mode, however, you may be slightly disappointed. The sandbox mode that you get at the end is another level where you get to use all the abilities you gain across the rest of the game to beat the level. After you beat it, you return to the main menu. From there you can choose to play it again, but it doesn't feel at all like a truly free sandbox mode. If you can get past that, then I would recommend this game simply so you can playing with water, sand, and lava.			"

												I don't play a lot of ""God games"" but for me From Dust was fresh and different. Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.Visually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.For the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire. It was never bad enough for me to make me stop playing though.From Dust is a nice change of scenery and play style that is definitely worth your time.			"

												I'm surprised many people down-vote this great piece only because of uplay. Uplay is a bit tiring, but the review should solely be done of the title not the other third-party system. It has a very unique atmosphere of environment.Players have to lead the small groups of tribes and achieve given goals.The obstacles are environmental hazards mostly. The physics system is beyond words. It creates a beautiful scenary while you have a power to reform terrainand also feels very responsible for such little lives of tribes. It is a genesis simulator. It gets challenging in the later phase.			"

												From Dust has been repeatedly misidentified as a ""God"" game, which it is not. It is more accurately described as a terraforming puzzle game, and a very good one at that, managing the ideal puzzle game balance of simple, intuitive mechanics that are extended across a substantial breadth and depth of scenarios. It's one crippling drawback is the horrid, controller-developed control scheme, although this is manageable and somewhat forgivable.			"

												An extremely gorgeous and breathtaking experience, enjoyable with few weak points throughout the game. If you loved Cryo Interactive's games in the 90s, such as Lost Eden, then you'll also love From Dust.The atmosphere of this game is pretty unique. The puzzles have a gradual learning curve, the challenges are pretty cool. Sometimes things can be a bit annoying to control. Speaking of which: play this with a 360 pad, not the keyboard & mice. It's so much better.Overall I'd recommend it almost on the atmosphere alone, which I'm a big fan of.			"

												Once you get past Uplay, and I did swear at the screen many times during this process, this is a good game.I wouldn't call it a 'God' game. There's no morality choices, no true growth of a civilization, and you’re the only ‘god’ around. It’s you against nature, in a series of puzzles to test your growing powers. It doesn’t take long to make your way through the puzzles, and while there’s a sandbox mode in there as well. It didn’t really hold my attention. Expect 5- 10hrs Gameplay, depending on how fast you like puzzles.All considered, it's physics engine is beautiful, the gameplay is simple but fulfilling, and if you get angry you can wall up your little guys and let them slowly drown beneath the growing tide.Once again, Ubisoft is a pain, Uplay is stupid. But if that’s the biggest downside; it must be a decent game. "

 It's a pretty nice game, buy it but if it does not work, better pirate it. As MANY of the reviewers said, it's a nice game full of breath-taking art, incredible music and deep atmosphere but try to crack it, because of the Uplay and Steam issue. Even tho, I do not had any problems playing it and the 5€ paying was totally worth it since it was on the sale.Now to the game:You play god. Controll earth, water, lava and plants. Build your own cities and create your own story of you followers.If you like games like SimCity but you are more interested in strategy, this game is a must-have for you. Set your cities, plan them to be safe, form rivers around them to let your citizens not be eaten by lava. Follow the individuals to get ancient signs and bring themm safe home.All in all. Buy the game if you like it, download the game by warez if it doesn't work. This is not a game, this is a masterpiece.			"

												While most others complain about Uplay its not all that bad. You can get the game easily working within 5 minutes, you just have to uninstall the uPlay that comes with the game, and instead use the one from the official website. Beyond uPlay this game is fantastic. With the completely terraformable worlds and amazing powers and gameplay its a definite buy in my opinion. I personally like the water physics most. Its just very intricate and well scripted, even on a large scale when the lakes and tsunamis are involved. And who can resist taking a large glob of lava and setting your village on fire?			"

												The actual game play is minorly interesting. Can be very pretty. However I'm glad the game only cost me $6 ... the UPlay Situation is obnoxious to say the least and even when I've closed the game out UPlay keeps the process running such that it looks like I logged 13 hours playing it ... which I certainly didn't.

												From Dust gives you a place you can design on your own. Throuugh the story you will unlock more powers and so you can shape the land stronger. The Story is perfectly told and hides many secrets you will uncover. A negative point is the lack of a Sandbox mode. You are in a quarter and you can only form the land in that quarter. In conclusion this game is worth buying though you shouldn't expect much from it.			"

												An amazing adventure, magical humble little game that puts you into role of a god that guides mysterious tribe on journey to discovery through the power of terraforming. Every mission is essantially a puzzle to solve and with increasing difficulty it results into about 10 hours of top notch entertainment. Some people throwing temper tantrums because of the uplay, I had no problems with it at all (I never had uplay crashing or anything those guys are ""experiencing""). The important thing is that a review that only lists problems with uplay is not a review of this game at all. The game is an overlooked gem, it has amazing aesthetics and so much charm most of the other titles would be envious. It's not a groundbreaking title, as this was done before, but it's done really well.Two reasonable criticisms - mouse controls are not that good, and while your villagers aren't exactly lemmings, they can be pretty dumb. Neither of those are serious issues and will only take a few moments to get used to it.			"

												From Dust is a brilliantly done, wholly unique... gosh what to even call it? RTS? Eh, I dunno about that. Simulator? Kinda?  You get to play as a god that shifts the terrain of a planet in order to benefit your people. That's what you do; I don't know what to call that kind of game, but I guess that's my bad.  Anyway, it's not only a gorgeous game but it's so well crafted in mechanics, character, and just overall design that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a game that challenges you, but does so in what seems like a nonthreatening way so your motivation as a player feels very organic and unforced. The soundtrack is jawdropping, and helps to draw you into the world like nothing else. In short, for those who want an immersive, unique take on the sim/RTS franchise, pick up From Dust. You will not be disappointed.			"

												The Uplay issue has long since been fixed! The game is perfectly playable from Steam.Now I got this game to fill the void left behind Black and White. There just hasn't been a god game to equal it despite it's flaws. This could have been a worthy successor, though it may be a little too eccentric for some players.I like the tribal setting, its not something we get to see very often in games and it gives this game its unique sense of identity. It starts to lose its edge however as most of the game is manipulating the enviroment in very puzzle like ways, to get your little tribe from point A to point B. There's really not that much more than can be said. It's seems addicting, but it's no Black and White. Unfortantly it got tedious fast. I just can't in good concience recommend it.			"

Posted: November 30, 2014
												While this is a recommendation in favor of From Dust, it comes with a lot of qualifiers. This is not a game that is worth full price. Yes, the graphics and production value are above average. And yes, this is a well designed God Game. And yes, because of the dynamic way in which the world behaves in reaction to your choices can drastically change the playthrough of any particular level. And ultimately yes, the levels (what few there are) are well designed.But that brings me to my first complaint: There are only 12 levels (not counting the finale which doesn't really count since you can easily win simply by not using anything but the Breath of Earth.) For a full priced game, this is scaled more as a tech demo and paying full price is outrageous. (And I mean that to be a bit dramatic, because Fromt Dust is offensively short.)It took me roughly 6 hours to beat the game (And I had to play at least three maps over.)Which leads me to my next complaint:  There are no saves. If you fail, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. That's not horrible, but it is made painful by the unskippable cutscenes and monologues at the beginning of each level. If you're not beating the level in the first or second try, the tedium of unskippable cutscenes is likely to drive you slightly mad. The cutscenes are ""cute"" the first time through, but after that they start to grate on your nerves. Your followers don't speak English. Everything is subtitled. While this seems like a novel idea at the beginning, people speaking gibberish at you on the start of each level (coupled with the fact that you cannot bypass it) quickly becomes annoying. This annoyance is mercifully mitigated by the short ""single player campaign."" (Of questionable value, since it also means there isn't much meat on the bones of this game.)My third complaint is that it requires Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM. Ubisoft's DRM is draconian. There are multiple features in many games that simply do not work if you do not have an active internet connection (as opposed to Steam, where that connection is only required on first activation.) Additionally, Uplay fails to install correctly when installed through Steam and you have to jury rig it to work (I put a guide together under From Dust for anyone who buys this and runs in to the installation problem and goes looking for the solution.) While Ubisoft has removed some of the other unpalatable elements of Uplay DRM, it still remains the poster child for ""what not to do"" among game producers.However, if you catch this on a sale ($5-10 tops) and you can tolerate dealing with Uplay, you will find yourself faced with a few (very few) enjoyable hours with Fromt Dust.The gameplay that derives from wielding god powers (water, warth, fire and life-- no air here) is enjoyable. The sense of urgency that derives from the interaction between floods and earth washing away, or between a lava flow steadily working its way into your followers-- these interactions are compelling and interesting.Unlike Molyneux's ""God Game Remake in Godus"" there is no farmville experience here. You really are left solely with Godly concerns. How do you unlock your next power?, how do you expand your followers across the world in the face of looming environmental disaster?, how do you help them escape the world before the tenuous balance you've maintained comes crashing down around you and your followers?The story is nothing special. It starts as a question, and it ends as a question.The graphics are pretty spectacular (for what it is). There's not a ton of individualized follower behavior (You typically zoom all the way out and do your best to stay on top of the floods, or the tsunamis, or the volcanos  that are poised to end your followers.) But the environmental effects are pretty interesting. Water that is volumetric and looks like water. It has waves, it feeds plant life, it cools lava. Lava that is equally volumetric, and which cools when it thins, leaving behind a layered rock strata on which the next wave of lava will rise over it. Each river, be it water or lava, is unique and behaves according to physics which seem realistic (so long as you don't analyze them too heavily.)The game performs well (one crash of the game, one crash of Uplay before I applied the installation fix I mentioned earlier). The audio is well designed, if a bit shallow and repetative. The digeridoo sounds are thematic and interesting (but if you don't like them, they become fairly constant in late game and that is likely to get on your nerves.)All in all, despite its many flaws, I would give From Dust a positive rating-- at a much lower price point.If you happen to see this on sale and feel like a few hours with a novel take on the God game genre, then give this a try. (But don't get it except on sale, because there just isn't much under the hood to justify the cash expenditure.)			"

												-Choppy graphics as its old and had poor support from the start. Use a controller. -limit your expectations, that way you won't be disappointed. Buy for $5 or less.-Only good for mindless building/destroying on the last level. The last level is a sandbox level.-Put 1,000hrs+ in this on another platform as it was something simple I could mess with while watching the stock market. It didn't help me make money.Had arid vegetation appear in sandbox level from a glitch. Carefully cultured the arid vegetation, its glitch seed was a small area spawned forth from a dead tribesman. I did this untill it encompassed all viable landscape. This required burning away the traditional tropical vegetation so the arid could grow, this took some time as arid vegetation growth rates are slow.Arid vegetation does not burn when in contact with lava or fire. Lost arid vegetation to accidental tsunami. Losing it was devastating.8/10			"

												This game honestly has to go down as one of my top 10 games. People that are looking for a Black and White clone this isn't it. Its a sandbox physics game and I found it highly addictive. The water physics are amazing and I have never seen a game with water this advanced. Basically each level is a puzzle (think Lemmings if you will) where you have to get your tribes people to the exit by claiming all the different sites around the map. Once this is done the exit will open and you can lead them to it. Obviously its not that easy as tsunamis, fires and even erupting volcanoes try to stop your progress. You can manipulate the water, lava, sand etc to help you along the way as well as being able to restart the map if you feel you f'd up because you wanted to see what happened if you diverted that river into that volcano..Sad for the people that had issues in the past with the DRM/Uplay stuff but it looks like Steam has changed that now and for me I was able to open the game right from Steam without any issue.For the hours of fun and cheap price of £7 I would have to give this 9/10			"

												This is a beautiful sandbox game in that it is literally like playing in the sand. I bought it on sale, and for whatever it cost me (maybe $10) it is one of by happiest gaming hours/$ spent. I got about 10 hours out of it at this point and am very satisfied.Visuals:Totally great. Sure, they could be better, but I loved getting down to the tribe's viewpoint and watching the tidal waves come, or the water rise. So neet.Challenge:Not too hard, but kept me on my toes even on low difficulty on the later levels. YMMV.Replay:The game is really attractive, and the challenges of each level ensured that I played each level through at least twice. However, beyond this once-or-twice level replay I did not feel the urge to replay. Partilly this is because on many levels while there are multiple ways to get through the challenges, but usually there is a clear optimal one. I know I'll pick it up in a few months and enjoy it again, once I have forgotten some of the tricks though. Imagination inspiring:Just amazing. If you ever played in the sandbox as a kid, or built sand castles on the beach, check this out. Some of the less obvious strategies can be fun to at least try!Uplay/copy protect:Whatever system other people have their legitimate complaints about... it didn't effect me. Maybe there was an overhaul of the system? It did not affect me in the slightest, so I consider this issue resolved. Note, I played on steam/pc.			"

												If you can get this without Ubisoft getting their incompetent EA-wannabe claws into it, do so. It's a really good game that has sadly had its reputation marred by Ubi's typical bumbling. Do bear in mind however, this is really more of a puzzle and skill game than the god game it looks like. If you're after a resource management style sim game you'll have to look elsewhere.From Dust plays like a very stylized physics puzzle game and is tremendously nice to look at, to boot. Admittedly I mostly grabbed the game because it was Eric Chahi's return to gaming, and I was interested in what he had to offer. The man certainly hasn't lost his touch - while I feel the game's concept certainly could have been taken further, it does what it sets out to do pretty well.			"

												Ubisoft have DRM. And a few weeks ago they changed their DRM so that I now have to not only log in to Uplay, but log in with 2-factor authentication provided by Google Authenticator and only Google Authenticator. But my Uplay username is not my Gmail address. If I install Google Authenticator on my phone, I will need to use Google Authenticator to access Gmail (which is not supported by the third-party mail client I use at work) so in short I can either have games working or email working. I chose email. I wrote to Ubisoft's customer support. They reset my Uplay password. They did not remove the Google Authenticator requirement so that I can actually log in. All of my Ubisoft games, including From Dust, are now totally inaccessible. Fortunately I didn't have many of them, they have not made many games I thought might be worth money. From Dust, one of the few exceptions, was a flimsy puzzle game not worthy to raise and lower the land under Populus' sandals. I do not care if Ubisoft never fix this, from now on they can shove their games up their DRM-loving jacksies.			"

												Controlling the power of good and evil.....no, wait....this is not Black & White. From Dust is not about training a creature and fighting other gods. It combines some elements of Populous and B&W but it is very unique in it's own way.The game is set in an extreme version of planet earth. Being a god, you must protect your tribe against the powers of nature by manipulating the world with sand, water and lava. Help your people to survive and expand. Besides the campaign, you can play several time-based challenges.Eric Chahi and his team created an intense god simulation game with a marvelous physics engine, a great contribution to a genre, which is unfortunately very rare and inconspicuous.

												This game requires uPlay and features virtually no PC-specific settings. My guess is this was a console port on a tight timeline/budget. It's a shame since the premise seems so cool that I could get virtually no enjoyment from this title.			"

												Don't let the beautiful pictures on the Steam shop page blind you; this is -in 9 of 10 cases- not what you'll actually see while playing the game. I'm not saying that the graphics of From Dust were ugly, they are not. But you watch the world from high in the air, and the tiny people of this world are just that: tiny, tiny people. But that's not the problem of the game. I admit, I was hoping for a modern version of ""Populous"". A proper God-simulation. But your powers as a God in this game are highly limited. Everything in this game is highly limited. Your tiny people have to discover or populate around certain obelisks before you can work wonders. Those ""wonders"" allow you to manipulate the world to a degree. I'd say 80% of the play time, you pick up sand and drop it somewhere else. This way you create land for your tiny people, or you dig ravines for controlling the flow of waters. It's actually quite fun for a while, but pretty soon it gets old. You are doing pretty much the same all the time. From Dust clearly is not the new Populous. The old hit from 1989 beats From Dust in the categories fun, length and complexity. The world of From Dust provides only roughly one dozen maps, and those are not really huge. Between the maps you watch the same boring sequences again and again, you do the same things again and again, move tons of sand from A to B so that after some settling you can get your tiny people to make it to the exit of the world. Maybe that's why we only got a dozen or so maps (of which the first few are pretty much meant as tutorial maps...), because the developers realized that the game concept is simply not complex and entertaining enough to motivate for more than 10 or so hours. French games are often pearls of innovation and creativity, but this one sadly, is not.			"

There's a really cool idea at the core of the game and it's ruined by terrible AI and imprecise controls. If it's on sale and you're ok with a casual game with no worthwhile story and little replay value, then go for it. Otherwise, just watch some gameplay and move on after you've seen the mechanics.

												From Dust is a very interesting game.First of all for an indi game, the graphics and the physics are overdosed with awesomeness. I got very amused by the way the elements interacted with each other. Also the water dynamics and physics were very good for a game like that.The main campaign is kind of short with not so many maps, but stil you get to have much fun antil you finish it.The only problem i faced was the AI. trying to save your people sometimes gets hard while you open up a way for them to move safe from the elements of nature, but for a stupid reason they just stay there or why wanna follow a different way lol.In general the game is very nice and fun to play.The price is low enough and i'd say its worth it.Be advised that there are no graphics settings though, they generate automatically depending you GPU aspects. However the graphics are very satisfying as they are.fun and relaxing. what you need after a hard day of studying or work.Recommended!			"

												This game is very creatively made. It's not one of those games where theres just one way to solve a problem and you have to find it; rather, you are given tools to shape the environment that cause gradual butterfly effects that are sometimes not what you expected and no two soltions will be exactly alike because the environment is constantly changing and adjusting in response to your actions. This creative platform tickled me a lot; I've never seen another game quite like this. Some levels were challenging and frustrating but satisfying in the end; others were a little easy but over all it was well balanced. It was a joy to see what creative challenge came up next each time. My only complaint is that the game is short -- I would love to see more! Also its replayability is limited. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for something different and/or short and sweet.			"

												Predstavte si, že ste niečim, ako boh a máte vo svojich rukách osudy primitívnej populácie v období, kedy ľudské pôsobenie na zemi ešte len začína. V tomto originálnom koncepte realtimovej stratégie sa doslova môžete zahrávať so životmi praludí a to ničím menším, ako rovno zosielaním skázy formou prírodných živlov. Sledovať malé postavičky snažiace sa bezmocne úkryt pred obrovským množstvom valiacej sa vody, či na opačnom konci rozmáhajúcej sa žeravej lávy, je vážne zábava. Vašou úlohou je ale životy nič netušiacich primitívov previesť cez všetky nemilé prírodné katastrofy a zachrániť tak našu civilizáciu pred neštastným osudom, aký postihol vyhynutých dinosaurov. Dostanete do rúk vlastne sandboxové pieskovisko, do ktorého sa Vám nikto babrať nebude a zostava len na vás, ako jednotlive úlohy splníte. Je potrebné priviesť malé postavičky praľudí na druhý breh silnej rieky? Môžete sa pokúsiť pritekajúcu vodu zastaviť pieskom vytvorením hrádze. Púštny piesok ale silný prúd vody nemusí vždy udržať a skôr či neskôr prerazí a vaši zverenci skončia v dejinách vyhynutých tvorov. Čo tak ale nasmerovať lávu z neďalekej sopky priamo k rieke? Ta potom prudkým ochladením vodou začne náhle meniť svoje skupenstvo a razom mame základ pre pevnú hrádzu, ktorá divokú rieku ďalej nepustí. Lenže ona rieka stále priteká a naša premyslená lávova hrádza nemá neobmedzenú výšku. Voda časom začne pretekať a svojou neúprosnou silou zastihne nič netušiacich praľudí snažiacich sa po novovzniknutej cestičke prejsť na druhu stranu, bez akejkoľvek šance na útek. Logika by v takom prípade našepkávala docieliť nejakým spôsobom menší prítok vody k hrádzi, aby nezačala pretekať. Pripadne sa len snažiť spomaliť tento jav na dostatočne dlhu dobu, aby bolo možné osadenstvo neďalekej dedinky bezpečne previesť k novým zážitkom. Opäť máte niekoľko možnosti, ako toho docieliť. Jednou z nich je časť valiacej sa vody presmerovať vytvorením provizórneho koryta v piesku a odviesť tak určite množstvo nechceného živlu inam. Teraz už naši spokojní zverenci môžu bezpečne prejsť na druhý breh rieky a spoznať tak opäť další kút našej budúcej zeme. Takýchto rôznorodých úloh budete plniť veľa a neustále a bude len na vás, ako s ďalšou a ďalšou výzvou popasujete. Časom ale cela hra skĺzne do opakujúcich sa postupov a prestane ponúkať nové možnosti skôr, než si budete sami želať. Stáva sa tak postupom času mierne stereotypnou záležitosťou, ktorej až príliš skoro začne dochádzať dych. Tento koncept hratelnosti je ale tak iný a tak unikátny, že nedoporučiť tých pár hodín nenahraditeľnej zábavy, by bolo snáď ešte väčším hriechom, ako svojou nerozvážnosťou zapríčiniť vyhynutie našej rasy predčasne.

												This is a pretty decent and fun god game where you get to help a tribe of people regain their lost knowledge and grow as a civilization but due to the constant crashes and glitches I have trouble recommending it. You take on the form of a deity known as the breath and have been bestowed the power to absorb and spit out the various elements of the land water and earth. Using this you can form land bridges or small lakes to help your tribe survive; it is a lot of fun.This game is a good game but the port has something to be desired. I managed to play it through to completion a few years ago but even then it crashed repeatedly and now it is almost unplayable. If you can put up with the technical problems or are lucky and don’t have any then this is a real gem and worth playing but if not then I wouldn’t recommend it.Oh and Uplay... enough said.Have fun ːMMForFunː			"

												From Dust presents an interesting way to sculp the Earth, though with a poorly made PC port.In From Dust, you control villagers like in Populous. You can manipulate earth, water, and lava to reach village points and to reach the next level. The goal is to find out where these villagers came from. As levels progress they start in island places with lots of water, next to big volcanoes, or in a stretch of dry desert. The villagers have a unique appearance to them, along with their art and music being of unique looks. Controlling matter is easy and the land and water physics is handled very well. These points add for a special experience.The problem lies with the later PC release. As this was made for consoles it wasn't well optimized. Ubisoft requires to use their DLC along with Steam just to use it. The performance is abysmal, but the art and music are sure to please. While the game has a unique artistic and realistcally amazing design, the PC framework just doesn't do justice.			"

												This game has good visuals but that is all about it. The overall experience is dull. I couldn't take any more than 2 hours. DRM, terrible controls, stupid AI, nuff said... Seeing metascore of 76 I decided to give it a shot but I regret paying for it. If you like picking up and dropping dirt then this game is for you. If you like to have fun - look elsewhere.			"

												The game works fine and has interesting game mechanics, primarily the control of natural elements like fire, lava etc. but the novelty of the levels wear off and it just doesn't feel like an accomplishment when you finish a level. I was left more infuriated at the lackluster controls, which seem like they were made for controllers not a mouse, and the repetitive nature of the game. There are challenge modes aside from the main missions but there is no definite ""zing"" with anything this game does (aside from the awesome sound and ambient music). It seems more like an experiment than a full-fledged game. This was definitely originally intended for console gaming and not PC. You'd do well to watch some gameplay videos before going for a purchase and even then I'd recommend waiting for a sale. Also, UPLAY DRM ALERT!! Functional, but shallow and uninteresting.			"

												A rather short game but fun all the way down. It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.A real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes.It has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.So it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.			"

												It's no ""Populus: The Beginning"", but it does well.Some interesting puzzle mechanics, but it just doesn't feel too deep, and certainly feels to short. So if it's something that's somewhat challenging.Artwork is great and is probably the strongest point of the game. It's a shame that you often can't appreciate it as you're mostly staring at it from afar.It's certainly worth your time and money for an update of Bullfrog's epic ""Populus: In The Beginning"", even thought the reworking on shines a veneer rather than get anywhere near the depth of its spiritual predecessor.

												This was a pretty terrible game. I got it mostly because it reminded me of Black & White, but that should have warned me as Black & White was also released a barely functioning sandbox as opposed to a game. I got through everything the game had to offer in less than five hours, but that is because all it has to offer is environmental sandbox manipulation and no matter how much you call them puzzles that doesn't make them puzzles. I concede that the game looks and sounds beautiful, but its an extremely shallow beauty with no depth whatsoever. This is of course aside from the issue with Uplay that might render the game unplayable for most people. This is of course aside from the fact the game is meaninglessly locked to run at a lower frame rate to match those of the console versions.You can find the full review over here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/07/from-dust.html.

												As many great things as I have heard about this game i would love to give it a great review. That is if I were able to play it at all. My cumputer has a substantial amount more of all of operating system requirements needed. But the game will only run through Ubisoft's Uplay launcher, which has crashed everytime. I have downloaded this game 4 times now in an attempt to play it at least once and to no avail.

												Oh man, this game is excellent. You're a giant snakey thing and you slide around being helpful!I have such a way with words don't I?No but seriously, you get to play as a god of some kind, using your elemental powers to alter the land and help your villages survive against volcanoes, tsunamis and floods. Some levels are frustrating, but the game never stops being fun or exciting. The final level is pretty much free mode, you get a big blank slate and all of the important powers (water, lava/stone, dirt, plants) and they let you go nuts.

												Going in, I was a bit intimidated by ""From Dust."" I was worried that I'd get overwhelmed by a complex, totally freeform sort of experience where deep mastery is required to have any fun at all.I'm pleased to say that this title avoids that problem. You're generally allowed to ease into the mechanics quite gently, and you also tend to get a lot of warning about things potentially getting away from you. Thoughts like ""Oh...what I'm doing with this volcano won't be very helpful in a minute"" are much more common than ""What the heck just happened?"" Your goals are easy to identify, and mistakes are usually correctable. Even when you completely fail, you can usually see where things went wrong.I also felt that the general mysteriousness of the game world was highly compelling when combined with what you do find out. It all left me wishing that I could have discovered more regarding the goings-on.It's true that the behaviors of the people you're trying to help can be a bit less than helpful, especially given their tendency to be finicky about where they can and can't go. (There's also the whole problem of them managing to drown in something like one foot of water.) Even so, the quirks aren't so bad as to ruin the game.""From Dust"" is a slightly quirky but ultimately interesting ride. I think it's worth trying.			"

												Installed this again to see if Uplay/Steam is broken as some say. (Oct 2016)Answer is nope, installed, autoupdated, started,, no problems at all.Feel bad for ppl with all the problems, but it's not broken and worth a bad review based on that imo.But Uplay being Uplay I'm not really surprised there's problems around, but it's Uplay in this case that should get the thumbs down,,not Dust.With that said.It's a fairly short game with a bit (sometimes) clunky controls.And it totally lacks setting for graphics. But that's ok, it looks fine on it's own.But I really like this one, it's giving me flashbacks to Black and White and I loved those games.Mold the earth to your liking, help natives get from point A to B. Be a nice ""God"" and put out that fire, build a brige,or not.Grab a fist full of lava and dump it on that villager that's been eyeballing you last week?,, it's all good.I like to play around in the game, rather then just do this,,and done, game lasts longer if nothing else ^^For me it's a game I'll return to now and then and play a bit, just for fun.For 10€ you get your moneys worth, at least i think so.

												First and foremost, as of this review I had no issue installing or playing this game on PC. I played the game on Xbox 360 prior to purchasing on PC.The engine behind this game is something spectacular. The ability to manipulate sand, water, and lava is definitely a really fun mechanic. Rivers will flow dynamically in sand, creating their own path and carving their way into the world (with or without your help). Lava will flow and harden into rock which allows for various other uses throughout the game. Sand will spread out over the terrain in a natural soft and smooth manner.The game is pretty simple, your ultimate goal on each level is to move to the next level. In order to move on, you need to unlock totems. The totems grant additional powers as well as more villages and people. Of course, each totem may have their own challenge to obtain, such as raising the land out of water or using lava to help secure it from threats. There are side objectives to the game, such as collection these minor totems and filling the land completely with vegetation.Although manipulating the elements is fun, it leaves a strong desire for more. Thinking back to games such as Populous: The Beginning, this engine could be so much more in the right hands and it's sad that it's not being used for something greater. Ultimately, expect to get several fun hours of this game, but if you're like me, you'll thirst for something more. If you haven't played Populous, it's over on GOG for $6, which may give you many more hours of a God game experience for less dollars spent.			"

												Really awesome until the last few levels. Before the later stages, it was relaxing, like playing in a sandbox, yet reasonably challenging without being frustrating or punishing. Unfortunately, as I got to the later stages, difficulty arose due to a certain totem being placed in a very tricky, high and near-lava location. You have to rely on the individual pathing of the AI, but there's not much indication if they'll be able to get up slopes (when there's multiple potential routes to a location) so trying to get them to this totem without having them try to cross lava is an exercise in frustration. The AI pathing tends to be annoying to deal with as the stages get harder. Also, depending on how you may have tried to build walls in stages with lava, you may find yourself having spent a lot of time on a stage but in a sitation where you'll have to try to destroy some walls to let your villagers get to a totem. Doing this is tedious because you need to use explosive plants (if you made rock walls). I don't understand the point in letting players manipulate something in such a tedious way instead of providing a less time-consuming method.Overall, dealing with the lava is quite frustrating, especially with how it can completely wipe out villages if so much as a particle touches some of your greenery. I understand having a challenge makes things more fun, but the way this challenge is presented is more frustrating than entertaining, because a small mistake can reset your entire stage progress. Slight variation on the level design and the lava mechanics would've probably made the game fun, but as it is I can't recommend it because of the unpleasantness of the later levels. Challenge should not come from dealing with the stupid AI, and mistakes shouldn't make you feel like you've just wasted a bunch of time, because that's no fun. Towards the end it just became not pleasant to play anymore. It's a shame because the sandbox mechanics are very entertaining to interact with - it's almost like they weren't sure whether they wanted to frustrate players with hard challenges or provide a relaxing, slow-paced sandbox game.

												I hope the review feature had a neutral finger. From Dust is a decently good game with some shortcomings; like the poor performance and few stages. Overall, it's okay.But the DRM, oh my god the DRM. It's complete and utter garbage, VERY annoying and a chore to setup. I really hate this uPlay♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really do. If you want to support the devs, buy it on Steam but pirate the DRM-free version.I cannot stress how bad the DRM is.			"

I spent a lot of time playing the demo on my Xbox 360, and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to finally get the game for my computer. The AI is decent at path finding, but can get irritating at times with them getting stuck going up a hill when they could much more easily go around. The gameplay changes from stage to stage, adding a new element for each stage. I enjoy that they do this. Diversity really helps this game. I think I may be getting to the end of the game, which is disappointing, but there are challenge modes to tackle after you have completed the main story.

On maps where I’m not forced to take action quickly, I sometimes catch myself sitting there and messing with the physics of the land, watching how one change would affect all of the other elements on the map. If you’re familiar with the concept of cause and effect and enjoy what if questions and scenarios, then you’d probably get a kick out of this puzzle game.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/from-dust/Gameplay Video:

												I DO NOT recommend this game. Ubisoft makes you create/use a uPlay account to log into this game, which is just annoying.. I already log into an account via Steam (Yes I know it's a seperate network, but still.. 'user experience' much?)It IS NOT a spiritual ancestor to Populous because the title itself is fairly limited. It reminds me somewhat of the Black and White series (and a similar one-gimmick game play). If you like pretty graphics and pressing Space Bar, then you'll like this game though. It is about right-priced if you're OK with annoying.Also see: http://www.1up.com/news/from-dust-drm-removal-steam-give-refund "

You move dirt and lava and stuff around to make a way for your people to reach new village spots. That's it. Oh and there's no real progression between levels. If that sounds fun, have at it.I expected more, and I guess that's my fault for not reading enough reviews.BUT, the mouse controls suck. I'm four levels in and I still hate how the mouse controls. I regularly pick up water instead of the dirt I want that's next to it. Directing my people to a new spot is hard because getting the mouse to settle on that spot is hard. There's some really weird acceleration going on. And the game forces me to use uPlay. Despite my admission that I shouldn't have bought this game, I think this paragraph still warrants a thumbs down, because I tried to enjoy it for what it is and these frustrations stopped that.			"

												I'd recommend this game but with a couple of major reservations.First off the good.I think the core mechanics are neat and well executed. Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.Now for the badFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.Second, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.In conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.

												It's like a smaller scale Black & White, without a giant animal. The goal is to guide your tribe to the right place(s) while protecting them from natural disasters. This can be done by changing the environments. So, for example, you can create walls to protect them from lava or you can create a hole in the ground to keep the water in. It's all up to you, as long as you can protect them. But it gets challenging pretty fast.The graphics are pretty sweet, especially for a downloadable game. It definitely has a nice style. The sounds are very well done as well.All in all, it's a game I would recommend. There aren't that many 'God sim' games around these days, so From Dust is a great addition to anyone's collection.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Worst game I've played in a while. The controls are just completly awful. No matter how you set it up. Change the terain sensativity and cover area. (this tip is for the developer) If you dont change that then your making mountains the whole damn time and that gets annoying on a level like the sea one. They obviously didn't think it through and I might even think they didn't even play through it themselves before putting it out. The point in making a game is so you enjoy playing it while having a bit of a challange. Not play a game that has a very strict way to win in short time with terrible controls to work with.			"

There aren't that many 'God sim' games around these days, so From Dust is a great addition to anyone's collection.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												I'd recommend this game but with a couple of major reservations.First off the good.I think the core mechanics are neat and well executed. Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.Now for the badFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.Second, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.In conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.

												Worst game I've played in a while. The controls are just completly awful. No matter how you set it up. Change the terain sensativity and cover area. (this tip is for the developer) If you dont change that then your making mountains the whole damn time and that gets annoying on a level like the sea one. They obviously didn't think it through and I might even think they didn't even play through it themselves before putting it out. The point in making a game is so you enjoy playing it while having a bit of a challange. Not play a game that has a very strict way to win in short time with terrible controls to work with.			"

I should not have to support your platform.Get off steam see how well you do.I don't dislike alot of game companies; but you're screwing the people who pay you.Becuase of the people who don't.

												Never worked for me. Bought this game through Steam and it installed the Uplay client, which it then asked me to create an account. After creating an account, it asked me for a product key. I entered the one Steam gave me but it rejected the key. Contacting Ubisoft and providing them proof of my purchase, after about a couple of weeks I never heard a reply from their customer support ever again, meaning I wasted money on a game that never worked for me due to Uplay problems.

												From Dust is the last game from Eric Chahi (known for Another World and Heart of Darkenss). COntrary to his most famous creations which were side scrolling adventures, From Dust is a God-game. To make this review short, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I spent about 18 hours with the main missions, not touching the challanges, so it has plenty of content to keep you satisfied. Plus the game looks amazing. The only gameplay-related minus is the lack of a sandbox mode, but that's alleviated by the fact that the last mission is exactly that: a sandbox mode. Though I think it should have been a separate mode, not locked at the end of the campaign.Now, to speak a bit about its technical problems. I will start by saying that I had absolutely no problem with any of the problems most people bring up when talking about From Dust, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.Its most common problems are:- bad mouse and keyboard controls. I was not affected as I played with a gamepad. If you own a gamepad (and most PC users do nowadays), do yourself a favor and play this game with it. It wills ave you a lot of frustration and it will help you enjoy the game.- locked framerate. Yes, the game is locked at 30fps and there are no excuses but: it hasn't bothered me at all since this is an incredibly slow paced game. In this case 30fps is completely acceptable and doesn't realy break the game or the immersion in any way.- uPlay. Everyone and their mother are complaining about uPlay. It didn't bother me at all, and to be honest I don't see how anyone that isn't a kid would be bothered by it. It is just another UI layer that didn't bother me at all. It just loads with the game and remains in the background while I play. Just like steam. To be bothered by one but not by the other is completely immature in my opinion.- Always online DRM. By the time I played this game, Ubisoft removed always online DRM so right now this is a non-issue.If you like god-games, do yourslef a favor and play From Dust. It's not really as good as the pold Populous games (nostalgia may be a factor in my case), but it is still pretty good and offers a lot of content. The game is also pretty cheap nowadays (you can get it in a sale for 5 dollars or euros).			"

												Aside from Uplay, it's a good game.  Short, but good game.A lot of it isn't challengeing as it is a puzzle. Going back through the challenges is really fun but frustrating.  The challenges usually just require though and or patience.A few challenges however require percision, which thiis game lacks percise controls.			"

												I had a good few days invested into this game because, you know, I like to take my time with new concepts, especially if they are pretty.  This game has a lot to offer in terms of beauty and inspiring animations where it comes to the forced generated into the environments.The problem is that this game feels like it was supposed to be more, couldn't reach its high-end goals, and so settled for being a simple puzzle game.  I wanted to care about the little tribes people, but, because I could really do nothing more meaningful with them than build them paths and tell them to go somewhere, they never really became all that endeared to me.  I mean if they had even been better programmed to be more interactive just with one another and their environments, it would have been sufficient for me to feel like an actual all-powerful god watching over my people.  Fact is, they just threw up cookie-cutter village spheres and then sat around waiting for me to do something.  I would have greatly enjoyed watching them fish and farm and hunt or just about anything which made them feel alive to the gamer.  I really think that, with the bare bones nature of your godly influence in the world of From Dust, this game needed more content and variety within its little living world.Anyway, going from scripted event to scripted event works well enough for a FPS or arcade modes in other genres, but it does very little for a game like this, in my mind and while many of the natural disasters you are trying to aid your little pointless people in surviving are rather glorious, they actually leave you, a god, feeling rather small and futile when faced with their might and splendor.I wouldn't really recommend this game for more than a cursory playthrough and a few moments of drooling over the fluid physics.  It's pretty, but its pretty blank as well.			"

												This game is a bit deceptive in it's marketing. It looks like an immersive RTS where you manage a tribe and develop them into a civiliazation whilst avoiding the plagues of nature.... But realistically it's just a puzzle game where you try to get villagers with no story, personality, individuality, or unique characteristics whatsoever from point A to point B utilizing a physics based, fully manipulatable environment.The game: You build sand castles and bridges, try to keep the water and lava out. No enemies, no plot, no advancement, just different levels with different scenario puzzles.Yes it's kind of fun, but not a great game, it could have been a lot better, like Black & White was.			"

Terrible.. abhorant service model.LOL and I couldn't post the above because I hadn't had more than 5 minutes of game time.. Thats because the game doesn't work. Hold up.. I just clicked to launch the game another 5 times.. Now I can post this as apparently the 'spinning mouse cursor' counts as gameplay.. Best game ever!			"

												This game's rating is criminally below what it deserves.  Yes, it requires UPlay but at this time and age UPlay is just a minor inconvenience and the lockup issue is well documented and easily fixed.  Eric Chahi is a gaming genius and I wish he made more games.  From Dust is a worthy entry in the sandbox god-game genre.  It's not another Populous if that's what you're looking for here, it's a game about a deity that protects its tribe against the forces of nature as they trace their heritage across a harsh world.  It's admittedly short but that saves it from overstaying its welcome.  It's novel and fun, and the visuals are something you just have to experience.  You will not regret playing this game.			"

												In order to enjoy this game, you must give it some time at first. This is a God game where you can manipulate elemants, you manipulate these elemants in order to get your tribe settled to a village. You manipulate the ground below them in order to clear paths for them, so they can continue spreading their knowledge across the land. I would have to say that this game has fantastic replayability due to the fact that you can finish a level differantly each time you play it.The description of the game I've given in the review is a very basic description, give this game a try yourself, you must see the beauty this game has to offer with it's stunning visuals.

												Even though I personally like this game, I will try to stay as objective as I can.I am recommending this game because there is nothing like this out there and it is worth experiencing. BUTThere are lots of CONS:-	Game is super short.-	The controls are unfriendly.-	Can’t skip scenes.-	No depth, no challenge.-	Only thing worth seeing is the physics.Seems that this game was a let’s-release-a-game-with-cool-physics” but nothing else. It is a lot of fun to play with the elements and see how you can affect the world. But that’s it.As far as all the negative comments concerning UPlay: ignore them. UPlay is UPlay, and From Dust is From Dust.  Even if UPlay were so bad (entering a key and logging in, not a hate-trigger for me), they are two completely unrelated things. So, if the game is on sale and you enjoy god-like games, physics/cause-effect, give it a go. I personally felt like “is that it?” at the end. So expect that if you like these sort of games.But still, the concept is good and this is the only game out there where you can manipulate the world like this, and it’s fun. So + for me. "

From Dust is infected with it, ruining the entire game. Ubisoft will tell you that it's okay, now the game is patched, you can play offline and never expeirience a breakout or interruption. What they don't tell you is you must keep Uplay installed and authenticate all the time. The last time I signed in after a long absence ""From Dust"" was no longer in my games library on Uplay... as much as I enjoyed the game it simply wasn't worth the time and frustration for me to deal with Ubisoft to fix it.Until you can trust Ubisoft to release a copy of From Dust without UPlay AT ALL... it simply isn't worth your time.

												Brilliant.  Different, innovative and most of all fun.  If only they had no made it so damn linear.   The limited enjoyment from this doesnt come from the concept itself, just very linear progression and ""level based"" gaming.  Having said that, I dearly hope that someone will take this and unleash the potential.  This is a good game, it could have been so much more.			"

												While it may look like a god game on first glance the mechanics of it remind me very much of puzzle games. You control ""The Breath"" which allows you to manipulate earth, water and lava and do all sorts of crazy elemental stuff, but it all boils down to getting the tribe people to the next village and protecting them from other elemental forces like tsunamis and volcanoes. It's puzzle solving rather than world building.It might not be the god game you're looking for but it's still fun and worth a try.			"

A true gamer fear no obsticle. A true gamer always finds a way.Anywho... ""From Dust"" is a pretty decent and well-rounded god-sim game where you use your powers to help guild the villages to where you want them to go. It's a bit old but graphics are still pretty nice even for an old game. The game is as simple as it can be and is really well done.8/10 Nice game but Maybe wait for a sale.			"

												Please keep in mind that I am probably not being fair to From Dust. I loved Black & White, and that is what I wanted From Dust to be. That was sort of how I interpreted the game's marketing. Instead of being like Black & White, this game felt flat. Level after level I kept wanting the game to open up, instead I got a series of small challenges. Maybe I didn't give it a fair chance, maybe it just wasn't what I wanted.			"

The real star of this game is the amazing physics . If there is water in the way , build a passage by moving earth from another part of the world and marvel as the water parts . Is lava troubling you ? Why not surround it with a lake or use water trees to control the flow of molten rock.Although the game is only about 15 maps long but you will find yourself replaying them over and over just for the sheer fun of it.

Requires analytical skill in order to access best way to get the job done. Play gets progressively harder as different dangers from land, sea and plants appear. You must settle new villages next to the totems in order to unlock new powers for your avatar.  Lead your people across the land following the path of the ancients while gaining power and abilities.

												One of my all-time favourite games. Buy it buy it buy it.+ Gorgeous looking, slow and mesmerising. If you like god games this is one of the simplest and best... no numbers, no birth rate charts, no 'we require more food!' You are a spirit that can pick up earth, water and lava. Using these you must guide a tribe across a dozen levels that are basically physics/logic puzzles wrapped in a stunning 3d terrain simulator. Rivers wash earth downstream and create deltas, lava hits the sea and cools into rock. Like I said, mesmerising. Nothing quite like it.- Essentially a sexed-up tech demo for the terrain engine, not bad in itself but this is definitely not a full-sized game. Leaves you wanting more.- There is a bolted-on challenge mode that offers exactly zero fun.- All the levels are slow-paced and easy once you know what to do... except two that require decent planning and very good timing. Again not bad in itself, just a bit of an awkward step up from the laidback gameplay of previous levels.			"

												This game is very interesting, although a bit short it seems. Watching the earth engine work with the land and water effects is total eye candy though. I could honestly sit there for an extended period and just watch the volcanos create landmasses on the islands. It's a good game, but the price is a bit high I think. I got it on sale, so I'm good.Just wish I had the options to bump up the graphics.			"

												Let’s face it. None of us would be very good Gods. When given control over the elements in this game, the world literally becomes your sandbox, in which you’ve got to construct a veritable paradise for a bunch of asthmatic tribal folk. Well, I assume they’re asthmatic, or lazy, as they refuse to climb any hill steeper than a council estate speedbump.The environmental physics on this game are amazing, but the AI pathfinding is a major letdown. None of your tribal folk seem to have any sense of urgency when a wave of lava is about to vaporise their town and don’t want to escape over the bridge you just built for them because the gradient is not to their liking.Me? I'd be a clumsy God. The amount of times the foliage around my villages has caught fire, making me panic and dump 500 tons of water ontop of it. Instead of burning to death, my villagers get washed away in a flood. Keep worshiping, or I will perform MORE deadly miracles!			"

												Fun for a four dollar puzzle game. It skirts the line of being a tech demo instead of a full game though. There's only one, fairly long and unskippable, cutscene after every stage. I would have liked to see at least twice the number of story missions, some variety in people, and a mind bender or two for the puzzles.Overall, good buy when its on sale, not so much for full price. There's little story, limited variety, and irritating controls at times. On the other hand, it's absolutely beautiful and fluid dynamics play very well into eachother. The challenge mode adds much needed objectives to test your understanding of the mechanics.			"

												Very innovative game. The nature effects, such as the crashing of waves on the shore, flow of water down a natural river, and flowing lava are amazing. The story mode is challenging and requires you to spend extra time on the map to fully unlock all the story/challenge 'memories'. Sadly, this suffers from bad console port syndrome, as there are some graphical anomolies, sound weirdness, cutscenes abruptly ending, and some control weirdness. The game is still very playable and lots of fun. I would've liked to see a sandbox mode, where you can start with a blank slate and just start building your own land mass and/or make your own maps to challenge friends. Definitely worth the price point. I estimate the game story mode takes about 4-5 hours to complete.			"

												Sure, you might say that this game is a little pricey, but Ubisoft could have charged so much more for it and have got away with it, From Dust could have been at the really high end prices, but it didn't need to, as they knew it would still make so much money.Steam did have some problems with it in the past, but to my knowledge, they are fixed now and certainly it is worth jumping in and getting it.You will be pleased with what you have bought, the graphics arent perfect, but that doesn't matter as long as you don't zoom in on your people, otherwise you won't even notice, you should at least watch Flabaliki's letsplay it's quite good to get to have a look at what you're going to buy, it is a God game, which I only found out when I watched the letsplay, so it's allways good to have a look at YouTube to see if there are any letsplays.It's a lovely game really, it has some grat reviews so if you have a birthday coming up soon then it is worth looking at it.Well done Ubisoft			"

It's just a simple little physics celebration.  I don't know how the guy that made Out of This World ended up making something so drab.Ubisoft installs ""Uplay"" which is a wannabe Steam browser that runs on top of everything to play this game. I'm going to avoid all Ubisoft games from now on.  You need an account name and password, and it tries to keep track of games you've purchased, except half the time it screws up or bugs out.  It was designed by a team of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys and doing a quick google search nets you thousands upon thousands of hate filled sites, blogs, and forums full of people boycotting Ubisoft.  I already bought the game on STEAM.  Why do I need yet another spyware ridden DRM pile of crap running on my computer?			"

The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you♥♥♥♥♥that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that. Still a great buy for it's fun value but nothing on replayability.			"

												This is a unique game which conceptually is very good. Go to YouTube and look at some gameplay and see if you like what you see. The story and idea are unique. The I will say this, the camera mechanics are horrible, and there is little you can do from the configuration to change it. Your screen wil start wandering if you don't heve the retical in dead center. It is a shame it was not more popular, as this probably would have been fixed with a patch. It is still a fun game.			"

												Awesome game. You manipulate the land by gathering or releasing in order to help your followers traverse the land. Decent enough graphics and good controls. Campaign is rather short. Probably not worth  the $10 asking price but i grabbed i for 5 a few years back and that was worth it. Unfortunately, I have to dock this game because it uses U-Play. The first time i tried playing this game it worked fine. Then 3 more times  I couldn't boot the game because U♥♥♥♥♥♥would crash. Finally got it working by reinstalling U♥♥♥♥♥♥ Apparently Ubishit doesnt want you playing their games.			"

												This game is easily a good time killer but watch out for losing site of your priorities having fun with the sand and water mechanics. I spent a lot of time making pools and lakes and making them drain from one place to another for pure entertainment even though it was not my objective. Basically you have to get your tribe memembers  from point to another to create small villages, make sure the land becomes lush with greens, and finally getting them safely to an exit. You use your powers as a god to take control of the elements to change the very shape of the land your tibe member are currently inhabiting. Pick up and drop sand to make a crude land bridge or drop water on some vegitation which has caught fire due to the constant lava flow from an active volcano or have your tribe members grab totems to protect you from raging a tsunami. There are intricate ways the game dev make use the landscape and element mechanics to insure getting your tribe memembers to saftey will not be easy.			"

This game is really great if you just wanna sit there and watch a landscape change. Lava cuts canals through the land like a fifteen year old with a razor blade, Tsunamis wash in and drown countless masked villagers like so many forgotten toddlers and fire tears through bark huts like a fat women at the buffet. its also got a neat puzzle solving aspect to it. The only problem with the game, however, is that unlike other god simulators (Black and white 1 & 2) you can't directly interact with your villagers. Where in Black and white you could cathartically hurl idiot villages against♥♥♥♥♥♥because they angered you, in 'From dust' all you can do is sit and watch and hope they dont develop better path finding before the next tsunami hits.

												Let’s face it. None of us would be very good Gods. When given control over the elements in this game, the world literally becomes your sandbox, in which you’ve got to construct a veritable paradise for a bunch of asthmatic tribal folk. Well, I assume they’re asthmatic, or lazy, as they refuse to climb any hill steeper than a council estate speedbump.The environmental physics on this game are amazing, but the AI pathfinding is a major letdown. None of your tribal folk seem to have any sense of urgency when a wave of lava is about to vaporise their town and don’t want to escape over the bridge you just built for them because the gradient is not to their liking.Me? I'd be a clumsy God. The amount of times the foliage around my villages has caught fire, making me panic and dump 500 tons of water ontop of it. Instead of burning to death, my villagers get washed away in a flood. Keep worshiping, or I will perform MORE deadly miracles!			"

												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												I was quite excited for this game, even though it is from Ubisoft.  I was hoping for something creative and sandboxy, but it ends up being extremely linear and you can only play with what they want you to play with.  There is no sandbox mode, just a somewhat frustrating story (Like when you get to the fire tree level) and challenges (which are only unlocked by playing the story mode.The game looks terrible on PC..  Very limited graphics options and 30fps cap.  It doesn't seem to run very smooth for me either.  My biggest issue with From Dust are the controls.  It doesn't have the typical RTS type feel.  Your curser is very sluggish with all the objectives that require quick mousemovements, it is very frustrating to get your ""breath"" from point A to point B.  Also, you move both your curser and the entire screen with the WASD keys, while moving your mouse only gives you a small amount of room to play around before the entire screen moves.  Wait for deal, no more typing room.			"

												From Dust is a very neat puzzle/simulation game where you manipulate earth, lava, and water to shape the land, making it livable for the tribe you're protecting.The engine driving this game is really neat. As you tame the wilderness, rivers will change paths, hills will erode, and the lava shapes new land. It's definitely fun to play with, and it's very rewarding to see a ruthless wasteland turn into a peaceful grove once you correctly divert the hazards.This game's weak point is everything else (except the game's mythos; that's cool too). The story is way too short (beat it 100% in <3 hrs) and rather easy. With such cool tools to use, I really wanted more of the sandbox-type story levels, to really show off what I could do. Huge disappointment. There's a challenge mode, which I beat in about another 3 hours.I'd still recommend this game at $15, but be prepared for the short length. Also watch out for Ubisoft's wicked always-online DRM. Definitely get it if it's on sale.			"

												From Dust is a prime example of a great game ruined by a terrible publisher. Ubisoft has continued on their quest to show the world how little they care about PC gamers and From Dust is one of their worst showings yet. From Dust lacks any sort of graphics customization, only giving you the option of changing your resolution. Another huge flaw is the lack of mouse sensitivity option, causing you to have to manually go into your mouse settings and change your sensitivity just to be able to play the game (and of course you also have to change it back when you finish). The worst part about being a direct console port is that From Dust is locked at a maximum of 30 FPS for seemingly no reason at all. The only plus I can think of is that the game is reasonably priced (15) though I highly suggest to not buy it, the developers have already been paid and giving Ubisoft your money only influences them to continue abusing PC gamers.

												I was so excited about this game, god game where you can modify the world move around water, lava, and sand everything was so awesome about it. Well how you modify the world is very great but the problem is the actual game... It feels like they totally wasted all the possibilities they had with so awesome system and didn't even make any real missions to use all these great tools  I maybe expected too much and that is why I feel so disappointed.If the lack of gameplay is not enough you have to also deal with Uplay, still even after all these problems I have to give it thumbs up.

												I cannot reccommend this game because Ubisoft went back on their decision to remove the always online requirement from it. The removal of said requirement was what prompted me to purchase the game. It was a good and challenging game, but when I went back to play it some months later I found that a patch had been released and logging into their platform Uplay is now required in order to play it.As it stands, I no longer have the ability to play this game because of the Uplay barrier they have put in place post-purchase. Do not buy this game. Do not waste your money.			"

												From Dust is a gorgeous game with an interesting concept of playing god and encouraging the growth of your tribe as it recovers its memories and re-establishes itself.  The controls are a bit difficult to get a grasp on at first but are easy to use once you have the hang of it.  The game itself is visually stunning with detailed shots of the landscape and your tribe.  However, the game has been difficult to play for longer than bursts of ten or fifteen minutes without those same beautiful visuals slowing and eventually freezing my computer until the game shuts down or has to reboot.  My computer has never had these kinds of problems with games before and I am usually patient enough that if I can get a good amount of play time in then I don't mind.  From Dust, however, shuts down too frequently to really do much in a playing session.			"

												This game is a great experience, I think that's what it is.It's not the game of the year. But it's really something new, the control scheme is a bit akward, sometimes you have to play with your camera a lot because YOU ARE and your camera is tied to you. So yeah it can be slightly frustrating in a couple of levels however it's all part of the design.This game is not difficult at all, this game is a refreshing experience, a new way to see god games.  Two third god game, one third puzzle game maybe. 7/10 worth buyingNB: I see some people talking about problems with Uplay. No issues over here and you can play offline.			"

												From Dust is a god game, but not in the way that you might think. Instead of leading a civilization into expansion, you're instead trying to guide them through the world, ""fighting"" against the forces of nature themselves.Tech-wise, the game looks gorgeous, and more importantly has this fantastic physics system in which fluid and dust settle realistically. This is important, because those are what you'll manipulate most of the time, be it to open a path, to let forest spread, to stop fires, whatever is needed. It's an experience unlike any other game out there.However, as much as I like it, I have to say that it's best to pick up the console versions. For a very simple reason, the PC one brings the uPlay DRM, a highly incompetent piece of software developed by Ubi that has a 50/50 chance of denying you the game you just bought. Myself, I had to spend just under an hour tinkering and watching ""update"" bars fill up before the game worked. Even if it was worth the trouble in the end, this sort of abuse with your honest customers is simply ridiculous.If you do want to pick it up on PC anyways, good luck, and have a pad ready. K&M controls here are a love-or-hate thing, and you might want to try both out to see which suits you better.			"

												This is a beautiful unique little god-mode game with a rather original concept and interesting mechanics and bit of puzzle in it. I haaaate uPay, but luckily I had no problems with it. (tip, try giving uPay administrator rights, it worked for me with windows 7 crashes, and with windows 8.1 it's been just smooth sailing with the bugger).Anyway I wish not to give a bad review to a good game because of the horrible DRM, which may have not even been the choice of the developers but forced on it by Ubisoft by default.My only grief with the game was that it was very, very short and overall small. The campaign is done through in couple hours, and then you have bunch of very short challenge scenarios (don't trust my hours I tend to leave games open in the background). It lacks longer play scenarios and depth in many things, like the frequent discoveries don't really bring anything to the table, and there is _no_ long world building and evolving sandbox mode of proper type, part from maybe repeating levels of the campaign which are quite linear whatsoever, and the last bit free build if you really, really like just sculpting scenarios for no other purpose. I find it weird it is advertised as such.I could easily see myself going for ~100 hours with this game if they had extended it and gave it bit more depth, growing possibilities and more interaction in features. Alas, now you prolly get around 10h max out of it.Considering how small the game is and not very new anymore it is a bit overpriced. However it truly was very enjoyable and I gulfed through it quickly and exitedly. Do give it a try if you have spare money, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Dear Ubisoft,From Dust is a great game. I've been played it on Xbox 360 and loved it, but it crashes on the harder levels almost every time. Now I bought the game for PC over Steam, thought I could now enjoy the game to its fullest. But not with you Ubisoft, you got a nice trick to keep me from playing called uPlay (how ironic), which crashes EVERY time i want to start it.TL;DR You want me to install and use your DRM, which is idiotic, but i can live with it. But then your Software did not even work, what makes it impossible to play the game I purchased. Sincerey,a concerned user			"

												Haven't played in a long while, and decided to give it another go - game now crashes on start. There's probably a fix if you dig deep enough, but from what I remember of the gameplay, it was a fun time waster but not worth putting in extra effort to try and find and implement some workaround. Can't possibly reccomend a game that doesn't work on a system that doesn't experience any compatibility issues with any other games I own.			"

												The single main negative point first.... this game does use Ubisofts online DRM service, but beyond initially registering your key (which itself is a simple ""Enter key here"" box so not an elaborate task), you just need to be online to launch.The game itself can be summed up in alot less words than the DRM system, ""A lot of fun, providing you got the imagination to enjoy sandbox games"". If you can't play a game without some gruff chap on the radio going ""Get your♥♥♥♥♥to the neon pink arrow scum!"", don't even bother thinking about this game.The physics on the geology shaping is well done, the graphics are fantastic in places, not so great in others (Console port after all) and regardless to what the trailer may give the impression of the weather sequences are NOT cutscenes, they're realtime events going down that interact with the world as you have shaped it.Just don't go experimenting with volcanos... that often leads to everyone dead in fiery badness :\			"

												A very quirky god game which I bought on the strength of the author's nostaligc back catalogue. Its a god sim in which you rise and fall the earth/rocks/water to build small civilisations but are at risk of fire, floods and natural disasters. In many ways, the technology behind the game is more impressive than the game itself which is kind of odd and perhaps a missed opportunity? It's not a game that will thrill you, but if you like unique and different then its worth a look if the sales are on. There are some annoyances, like the inability to skip the cut scene intros to each level, but its a solid 7 out of 10.			"

												Bought this after having played the Xbox version (yes I know that I've said this before), which was a whole ton of fun. The whole idea that you help a group of villagers as a powerful spirit is a fresh concept. However, the problem with this game is that I had a lot of difficulty with the controls for the game. Either the avatar would move too much for delicate movements and then hardly at all for broad movements. This makes manipulating the environment exceptionally difficult, especially in areas with running water. Overall, great concept but poor implementation. 1.5/10(June 11th edit)I'd like to make a note here that I tried playing this game again, but only with a controller. As soon as I began using that, I noticed that the sensitivity issuses disappeared. It's now obvious to me that this game was developed with XBLA in mind and not the PC. That being said. It's still kind of fraustraing.			"

												Found this to be quite an enjoyable game. The aim is to help the tribespeople establish villages in each level with you playing as a godlike figure who can pick up and deposit earth, fire and water to help them. Its quite interesting because theres no traditional enemies but rather nature itself is the enemy with tsunamis and volcanoes etc making your progress difficult but you can also manipulate them to your advantage. Some levels are quite challenging without ever being punishing.Good points:- Interesting idea where you have to fight and manipulate nature itself to beat each level.- Theres also a challenge mode where you have can beat challenges in the fastest time possible.- The game has a nice look and feel to it and reminds me a lot of the Populous game.Bad Points:- Requires Uplay- Gameplay gets a bit repetitive towards the endOverall this is a decent game might be worth picking up if you enjoy godlike or puzzle games. Though the Uplay factor might put some people off.			"

												From Dust (  ) was on sale on Steam the other day and it looked interesting enough to pick up for $5 and so far I’m really enjoying the chance to play around with dirt and water without getting gunk under my nails.Some levels have you rushing to accomplish things in a hurry under a time limit, but most (so far) seem to allow one to play around at one’s leisure. I love making rivers and helping the plants grow across the maps. The tribal lore is interesting too, I rather like the tales of the plants and animals.On the down side, the levels load before the dramatic entry music finishes, creating a jarring moment where it should have been a nice fanfare entry, and one can’t interact much with the tribespeople. I’m wondering if the loading time music cutoff is because I've got it installed on an SSD and it might behave better on a traditional (slower-loading) platter drive.These are relatively minor though. It’s really about playing with the landscape like a helpful, mysterious deity. If you, like me, enjoyed spending hours playing with dirt and water as a child, you might rather dig From Dust. "

												From Dust brings the term sandbox game into a whole new meaning.  You are literally dropped into a giant side box.  A sandbox that you can control and manipulate in order to help your tribesmen find the promised land.  Developed by Ubisoft, and release in August of 2011.  From Dust gives you god like powers over the elements.The premise here is simple.  With your various powers over the sand, wind, water and fire, guide your tribe from totem to totem in order to unlock a portal to the next zone.  Each level gradually introduces you to new powers and concepts.  The first few levels are pretty straight forward and act as tutorials to help you develop an understanding for the game's basic mechanics and controls.  You can literally take your godly hand and scoop up areas of terrain, or water, or even lava to mold and manipulate the land.As you proceed farther into the game, these powers are used not only to lead your tribe forward, but also to protect them from the earth itself.  Whether it's fire, floods, giant waves or massive eruptions, you must continually alter the earth in order to keep your tribe safe.  This is where the interaction of the various powers comes to fruition.  Though sand can be piled up and prevent waves of water from flooding the area, the force of the water can eventually erode the sand away.  Combining lava and sand can create rock to solve this problem, but accidentally redirecting lava in the wrong direction can be even deadlier.This balance of powers, and the addition of various power ups as well map unique quantities like hidden underground springs and other surprises keep you adapting often.  The maps often adapt as well.  Several levels in From Dust change part way through and throw new obstacles your way.  In a first play through these events create greater challenges as now your well planned out modifications to the world need to quickly be changed before your tribe is flooded, or burned alive.The look and feel of the earth and it's elements is also just a lot of fun to play with.  Terraforming the earth with your various powers is intuitive and the elements react in fairly realistic way.  Water and lava combine into clouds of steam, cooling into ever growing mounds of rock.  Rivers slowly cut their way through sand at the lowest points creating rivers and peninsulas.  It's truly a wonder to just play in the sandbox that is From Dust just to see what will happen.Throughout all this, a charming story of the cycle of life unfolds.  From Dust is definitely a game you want to give a full play through of to gain the full experience.  The beautiful graphics and physics hold up today against more modern games.  The story, though a relatively simple one of life and death is told mostly visually as you proceed from level to level.  This is a great game, and a gem to try if you have a chance.			"

												Summary: From Dust is an excellent gaming experiment of sorts that cycles back on itself with its brief yet enjoyable campagin.  You play the rold of a god-esque figure that controls the elements and minimally commands your tribe to do tasks (just some simple ""go here and go there"".  The gameplay is fairly simple at the core though in later levels there is more thinking and fast adjusting/reacting required to ensure the tribes survival.  The learning curve is fairly steady as it adds elements or powers into the mix but I will say near the last level is a bit of a jump in dificulty compared to previous levels.   Graphics:  This game came out 4 years ago from writing this (Aug 17, 2011) and the charm and style still holds up strong.  The dynamic effects are convincing and the character design is interesting.  I do wish they had more animals that appeared to diversify the map but since this is a fairly minimalist game it works as is.  Ocasionally the tsunami effect would catch my attention because of a steap drop off or rise in the water that looked bizarre like a wall of water instead a wave but it is what it is.  Gameplay: Simple and intuitive (played with a xbox 360 controller-needed to be enabled in settings each time)  mainly you are just picking up and putting down materials (sand, water or lava, ocasionally plants or totems as well)  The game is a lightly guided sandbox of sorts where you sculpt the land by changing the flow of rivers and lava flows in order to help a tribe of people reach the exit to the level, this must be unlocked by building all of the villiages on the map which are placed on totem locations.  The level design is spot on with these totems being placed in locations that require you to use different elements and tasks to navigate your tribe but the downside is the AI for these tribe members sometimes cripples gameplay.  I encountered them all to offten crying for help because they weren't satisfied with a path to take or a height difference near them requiring some extra sand raising or lowering until satisfaction.   These poor tribesmen (and women) would also freeze up in terror next to flowing water or lava instead of trying to avoid it which often lead to their demise.Story:There isn't a strong narrative here, essentially the tribe is wondering through different areas/realms with the story cycling back on itself toward the ened.  I will give them kudos for making it work though since the focus here really is just the sandbox gameplay and the minimal aproach they took works fine.  Note:Many slam this game for Uplay issues, I don't think this is fair because Uplay isn't the game.  I am not a fan of running through steam to run through Uplay but it just is what it is, the artists and creatives that shelled out heart and soul into this game created something worth experiencing so don't let the game industry politics soil it for you.

												Bare with me, its my first review.From dust was a quick game with a finishing time of 5 hrs. Get it on sale and start being a god! The levels are fun with them being easy at first then becoming a race against time to save your people. It is visually pleasing and a neat twist on a familiar concept. The only negative remarks for it is the ubsoft login and the controls, which can be slow and hindering at times on the later levels. If you can power through those 2 issues, then pick up this game! 4 out of 5!			"

The voice actor in the promo is not in the game and the voices in the game gets annoying as hell.Sold itself as an interesting gritty shamanistic tribal sim... it fails to deliver on all counts.

												Overall, this is a good, relaxing game with a good story and interesting set of characters. There are short periods of time pressure that make it fun, and I enjoyed interacting with the environment in the course of casting spells. I'm on the fence about recommending the game, because I eventually gave up on one of the later levels. Thinking back to when I played this game over a year ago, I recall most of the time was spent picking up water and dirt and wishing that I could hold more ""in my hand"" before having to dump it. It made it frustrating. I'm hiding the game from my library because I won't go back. That being said, I did enjoy the few hours I spent on it, and the graphics were thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												If you enjoy redundant layers of DRM/login/moreDRM then this is exactly what you are looking for. Ubisoft requires you to login to ‘UPLAY’, Oh BOY! Christ, will these products of incest ever learn that after we pay them for a game we don’t want them to crawl up our asses and demand 37 layers of DRM? Perhaps we could use some service that already is secure but not obtrusive, I dunno, something like steam. Boy, that would be handy to have a service like steam to validate a game.Is ‘From Dust’ good? Who gives a ♥♥♥♥, one more potentially good game ruined by a room full of fat old corporate sycophants who all slap each other on the back for a job well done. Ubisoft if joining my list of EA and THQ, well done jackasses!			"

												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												I think its a little unfair to judge this game simply by the shortcomings of Ubisoft and their terrible DRM. This game is wonderful.Thankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.So, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.From Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.You can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.The nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.) And yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate. Its not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).Dont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it. "

By the time I realized my error it was too late: Steam couldn't help (they have no control over Ubi's DRM) and UbiSoft just didn't bother. No refund, no account reset, nothing. UbiSoft is extremely customer-unfriendly and if things dont go perfectly for you, you will find you wasted all your money.			"

The AI was finicky and would get stuck or not do what I wanted, and the portrail of the tribal people seemed a little racist.  Apart from completing the ""story"" mode, the overall objective of the game isn't communicated well, and I didn't know if I finished or not.  It did sometimes have a soothing sandbox feel to it, but it was mostly tedious and it was hard to care about this game at all.			"

												From Dust is a prime example of a great game ruined by a terrible publisher. Ubisoft has continued on their quest to show the world how little they care about PC gamers and From Dust is one of their worst showings yet. From Dust lacks any sort of graphics customization, only giving you the option of changing your resolution. Another huge flaw is the lack of mouse sensitivity option, causing you to have to manually go into your mouse settings and change your sensitivity just to be able to play the game (and of course you also have to change it back when you finish). The worst part about being a direct console port is that From Dust is locked at a maximum of 30 FPS for seemingly no reason at all. The only plus I can think of is that the game is reasonably priced (15) though I highly suggest to not buy it, the developers have already been paid and giving Ubisoft your money only influences them to continue abusing PC gamers.

												I preordered this game years ago. I played it all the way through with 0 issues in the first couple days of release and loved every minute of it. The gameplay is amazing simple yet super enjoyable. It's a digital sandbox. There really should be more games of this type coming out. Until then, definitely try this one out. Sure, it requires UPlay but don't listen to all the complainers that say it's unplayable. I just redownloaded it an hour ago, had the UPlay crash bug and figured out how to play within 5 minutes. It took almost no effort. They're just being lazy. It's a fun game to mess around in and just relax. I completely recommend it even with the burden that is UPlay.			"

												Though I only have some 22 hours in on this game it's still one of my all time favorites. It is challenging at times, but also greatly amusing taking sand for instance until there's only rock left underneath then depositing it somewhere else maybe to change the flow of a river or taking water and dumpinjg it somewhere then watching it splash and flow as real water would. This game is very unique in that I've never played another game like it. The graphics are gorgeous as are the effects.My only complaints is that there isnt a sandbox mode(or at least wasnt the last time I played) which I think would be more entertaining than levels with an end goal. I also think it would be cool if they would have more of a society or city building aspect that you would then have to protect from the elements (There are villagers you have to protect, but their society doesnt develop much past small villages). Finally I'll say that while I like this game I would definitely wait until it's on sale because while it is worth buying it's not worth $15 especially considering I got frustrated with it after 22 hours ($15 dollars to me should give a person at least 96 hours worth). Though if you like a challenging game that will get you frustrated to the point where you have to take a break (like old school games from when I was a kid) only to come back with a new strategy and beat the level then you'll like this game. I personally prefer more relaxing, less challenging games, but there simply isnt any other game like this.Still it's a great game if you're a connoisseur!			"

Yes, that even includes reformatting and reinstalling the OS, doing all of the updates from scratch, and trying to install this.

												From Dust is an entertaining game that stands out from similar civilization-type games in that you have to craft the land to assist and protect your native people as they go from increasingly inhospitable locations in an effort to find their Ancients who created their world. The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.The real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.I also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.8/10			"

												Remember Populous? Probably not :P Anyway, this game is basically an updated version of that, and is, thus far, pretty entertaining if you like exploding plants and dropping lava on unsuspecting villages (which of course I do). Camera control is occasionally frustrating, and some of the powers I find could use a little more explanation at the beginning, but all told it's an enjoyable game.			"

												A bit of a god game, but more of a dust physics puzzler. Help your one tribe grow and flourish as they struggle against the environment to survive. Use the powers of picking up and setting down dust and water to interact with the desert plants and animals to reach objectives and clear the pathway in your people's journey. Pretty simple, but a good deal of fun and can be a little challenging with the various environmental interactions.			"

												An excellent game, but not for this price (currently 15 euro's). The imo very short campaign has very little depth and leaves you with a feeling that you're missing out on game mechanics that should've been there. No replayability of the campaign what so ever.Then there's the challenges, but they are very linear, and can only be completed in one way, by doing exactly as intended. These solutions are usually very easy to spot and don't require much efford.In hindsight, I wouldn't pay more than 5 euro's for it, unless they add more game depth, and more levels.Edit: Game uses Uplay launcher, and recently this keeps crashing for me. changing recommendation to no.

												From Dust (  ) was on sale on Steam the other day and it looked interesting enough to pick up for $5 and so far I’m really enjoying the chance to play around with dirt and water without getting gunk under my nails.Some levels have you rushing to accomplish things in a hurry under a time limit, but most (so far) seem to allow one to play around at one’s leisure. I love making rivers and helping the plants grow across the maps. The tribal lore is interesting too, I rather like the tales of the plants and animals.On the down side, the levels load before the dramatic entry music finishes, creating a jarring moment where it should have been a nice fanfare entry, and one can’t interact much with the tribespeople. I’m wondering if the loading time music cutoff is because I've got it installed on an SSD and it might behave better on a traditional (slower-loading) platter drive.These are relatively minor though. It’s really about playing with the landscape like a helpful, mysterious deity. If you, like me, enjoyed spending hours playing with dirt and water as a child, you might rather dig From Dust. "

It was a way to pass time, but there are many other games that are much more fun, so I moved on.

												Sure, you might say that this game is a little pricey, but Ubisoft could have charged so much more for it and have got away with it, From Dust could have been at the really high end prices, but it didn't need to, as they knew it would still make so much money.Steam did have some problems with it in the past, but to my knowledge, they are fixed now and certainly it is worth jumping in and getting it.You will be pleased with what you have bought, the graphics arent perfect, but that doesn't matter as long as you don't zoom in on your people, otherwise you won't even notice, you should at least watch Flabaliki's letsplay it's quite good to get to have a look at what you're going to buy, it is a God game, which I only found out when I watched the letsplay, so it's allways good to have a look at YouTube to see if there are any letsplays.It's a lovely game really, it has some grat reviews so if you have a birthday coming up soon then it is worth looking at it.Well done Ubisoft			"

												This game is easily a good time killer but watch out for losing site of your priorities having fun with the sand and water mechanics. I spent a lot of time making pools and lakes and making them drain from one place to another for pure entertainment even though it was not my objective. Basically you have to get your tribe memembers  from point to another to create small villages, make sure the land becomes lush with greens, and finally getting them safely to an exit. You use your powers as a god to take control of the elements to change the very shape of the land your tibe member are currently inhabiting. Pick up and drop sand to make a crude land bridge or drop water on some vegitation which has caught fire due to the constant lava flow from an active volcano or have your tribe members grab totems to protect you from raging a tsunami. There are intricate ways the game dev make use the landscape and element mechanics to insure getting your tribe memembers to saftey will not be easy.			"

												Nice graphics and original storyline, but a god sim this ain't, as it claims to be.  This glorified puzzler has some nice features and original ideas, but the levels are somewhat short and there's not much to do in them, fancy game physics aside.  All right if you're into puzzle games, but anyone expecting something along the lines of Black and White or Populous will be left disappointed, as I was.  Seen better, much better.			"

												Now requires Uplay! DRM protection now in place makes the game sometimes unplayable. As GQ83 has said below, you have to uninstall the Uplay application, and reinstall it from the internet to get it to work. After it's installed, in settings, you can disable cloud sync and allow uplay to start in offline mode. Disable the overlay and other annoying features as you wish. Please look for his original post to get the game working again.The game was much better before the Ubisoft DRM update. If you're thinking about purchasing this game, please remember how the updates wrecked its playability and startup.Also, the game is short on content, though fun once through. Very little replayability.			"

												I played this game when it first came out on a friends computer. I later purchased the game myself to play through the entire game. Other than being rather short, the game was a lot of fun. I wish they would develop a sequel or expansion but that seems unlikely. Simple gameplay and if you are interested in this game, I strongly recommend playing the computer version rather than a console version as the controls are easier to manage on the computer. Good Luck.			"

												Bare with me, its my first review.From dust was a quick game with a finishing time of 5 hrs. Get it on sale and start being a god! The levels are fun with them being easy at first then becoming a race against time to save your people. It is visually pleasing and a neat twist on a familiar concept. The only negative remarks for it is the ubsoft login and the controls, which can be slow and hindering at times on the later levels. If you can power through those 2 issues, then pick up this game! 4 out of 5!			"

Installation was a bit cumbersome, had to install the UPlay client (Steam like client from Ubisoft) from the original vendor page, the one that came with steam didn't work for me.Consider it if you are really into god games - unfortunately there are not much good ones relaesed these days - or if there's a good offer in Steam.

												From Dust is somewhat of a god game. You play as invisible force of nature that goes around sucking up things like sand and water which you can then re-distribute as you please. The object of this game is to save the village people from things like tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. After you save the village people, you must safely guide them to a totem, which they dance around for a bit, magically creating another village which you'll have to protect as well. I say ""somewhat of a god game"" because for a ""god game"", your powers are very limited and initially very cool, but as you dive deeper into the games mechanics, you'll wonder what is so god-like about your character. This is a game you will either love or hate. Keep in mind, there is NO GRAPHIC SETTINGS MENU in this game. You can't change the texture quality or shaders or anything of that sort. If your computer isn't very good. Stay away from this one. Fans of this genre will love this game, while others may not.			"

												This game is honestly really cool. The campaign takes you through the journey of the people that lost the knowledge of their ancestors. It's very fun creating your own islands out of nothing. The game also has a very intelligent environmental system. Rivers will carry sediment down stream and expand the land, lava will steadily flow from erupting volcanos and cool to create rock. You can also change the weather! If you add too much water at a very high altitude, it will actually start to rain! This game does a very good job at creating the ultimate living sandbox. I'd recommend this game to anyone.			"

												From Dust is an entertaining game that stands out from similar civilization-type games in that you have to craft the land to assist and protect your native people as they go from increasingly inhospitable locations in an effort to find their Ancients who created their world. The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.The real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.I also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.8/10			"

												God Games have always been one which you've have the overall power the wield the world at your fingertips, with each God Game type having their own different style to give, showing the emphasis of what type of god you are in that specific universe. Sometimes the wielding of nature (which is most common in god games) is used to a much greater advantage, one of which provides the player to have much more strategy that simply clicking on the environment. From Dust perfectly does this. From Dust developed by Ubisoft is a game where you play as a deity which has the power to shift the lands underneath the native people's feet for their own means of survival. From Dust's story synopsis is about a group of native in which their land is torn by the natural causes, until they summon their god (the player) to help them strive to a new land in which they may find a peaceful location to settle on with any nature causes harming their colony. The Story is told through a more native style tale which help give a more tribal and authentic feel to the games' art style, with such a story it can be consider to have contain a hidden message or parable. (Though I'll overlook that)The gameplay is pretty much like other god games. You have to move around the natural element of the world to help suit the needs of the native people, to get from point A to B, which 'B' is a tunnel to the next level. The native people set up camp near a tribal totem pole in which it gives you various additional power to prevent natural disasters or pave way to an exit. This is the games' strongest point: the powers that the player has. The game makes it clear that you can grab and bend the natural element to your will. Ubisoft was clever with this technique as each level gives a limited amount of supply of a certain element. This is to make you strategise the current situation and makes you focus on rationing certain elements. Sometimes they give too much of an element and its up to the player to prevent that specific element destroy the tribes people. Sometimes this can done through kites which give special powers prevent certain elements from destroying the tribe. The art style of the game is somewhat unique, in that it uses more tribal colours and texture which exist in more tropical environments, like Hawaii and Togo. The graphics are technically well designed with very little glitches or flaws that exist within the game. The flaws that exist within the game are the sometimes unfairness of a certain level, elements attacking the tribe too quickly and giving a game over. Another is the AI which has a lack of pathfinding when going to a location which is perfect valid with no obstacles in the way. Last but not least is the somewhat lack of a sandbox mode or more time to use your creative skill in building nature constructs. Personally I had a great time using some elements to create damns and bridges, changing the flows of certain elements is what is highly enriching besides the strategy element of the game.Overall From Dust is a great game which I highly recommend to anyone who loves God Games and want a bit more strategy as well. 7.75/10.0 (Very Good)			"

												Beautiful little game that's got some fantastic mechanics here. The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.The gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.The game is, though, far too short. It feels more like a tutorial campaign. What little is there is very nice, with great music and atmosphere. If in future the mechanic is expanded upon, that's something I'd definitely pick up. For now, this is a great game that's on sale often enough, and is definitely worth a shot when it's at about half the asking price.			"

												6 hours game time. Finished the game. It's sad, especially since this game is actually quite amazingly beautiful. The ebb and flow (and the destructive force) of nature is artistically rendered. I found myself cheering on my little settlers as they tried to outrun a tsunami and also yelling at them in anger as they stupidly run towards a lava flow - all whilst trying to scoop up some of the enivronment to delay their impending doom. I'd rate this 8/10 if the game was cheaper or a LOT longer, but unfortunately the hype, cost and length of this game gets it 4/10.			"

												In general I like the game. However, the gameplay is a bit repetitive: manipulating water or some other liquid that in more than a foot will stop your people. It seems the game is more about stopping the elements from killing your people rather than seeing what you can do with them. The concept is intriguing which was the selling point of the game for me. Not the best puzzle/god game I've played, nor is it the worst.I wouldn't mind whatever discussion comes about due to this review.			"

												I cannot reccommend this game because Ubisoft went back on their decision to remove the always online requirement from it. The removal of said requirement was what prompted me to purchase the game. It was a good and challenging game, but when I went back to play it some months later I found that a patch had been released and logging into their platform Uplay is now required in order to play it.As it stands, I no longer have the ability to play this game because of the Uplay barrier they have put in place post-purchase. Do not buy this game. Do not waste your money.			"

												Very fun in it's own right, very amazing gameplay but a story you won't even notice. The main story tries to fit in between levels and in bits that aren't shown as you play. The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you♥♥♥♥♥that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that. Still a great buy for it's fun value but nothing on replayability.			"

												Short and sweet.  This game keeps you on your toes as you try to keep your villagers alive in increasingly inhospitible locations.  Each village you settle unlocks a different power, and they're strategically placed such that more powerful villages are more difficult to hold.  Your only enemies are fire and water, but it's surprising how difficult it can be to contain the forces of nature (even as a being with more power than the average Greek God).			"

												From Dust delivers excellent gameplay that's easy to learn yet amazingly addictive, making it one of the best simulators out there. The story itself shows that the developers did their research, keeping things simple while showcasing the characters' cultural development. The main story has thirteen levels with an ending that fits; this seeming brevity is more than made up for by replay value and the challenge mode's sheer variety of levels. Thinking is definitely required for this game, as is good timing. Remember: it's okay to restart a level if you feel like you made a mistake - that's why the restart option is there.			"

												Ever since Black&White, I have waited for a new game where you get to be a god. I mean, who doesn't want to be the one who controls mother nature? The game gets off at an easy start, to get you comfortable in controlling, how to shape the nature. For example, by making a new path over a river by dropping sand. Throughout the game, you get to help these ""citizens""... (or whatever you wanna call it) ...to build villages. But in order for them to survive, you need to control and keep an eye on the nature, so they won't get killed by, for example, a flood.As you move on in the game, you get to control more and more elements of the nature, as the missions allso gets even harder.In the long run, this game is awesome! You get to be a god, with small people who rely on YOU to keep them safe on their journey.Downsides:There's only one (1) cinematic, that you get to see between every new mission/map.The camera view controls could be more sensitive.

I managed to get through the game to the end out of bloodymindedness and by that point you end up hating the little people you are supposed to be helping because of their irrepressible suicidal tendencies.

												From Dust is a gorgeous game with an interesting concept of playing god and encouraging the growth of your tribe as it recovers its memories and re-establishes itself.  The controls are a bit difficult to get a grasp on at first but are easy to use once you have the hang of it.  The game itself is visually stunning with detailed shots of the landscape and your tribe.  However, the game has been difficult to play for longer than bursts of ten or fifteen minutes without those same beautiful visuals slowing and eventually freezing my computer until the game shuts down or has to reboot.  My computer has never had these kinds of problems with games before and I am usually patient enough that if I can get a good amount of play time in then I don't mind.  From Dust, however, shuts down too frequently to really do much in a playing session.			"

												This game is a great experience, I think that's what it is.It's not the game of the year. But it's really something new, the control scheme is a bit akward, sometimes you have to play with your camera a lot because YOU ARE and your camera is tied to you. So yeah it can be slightly frustrating in a couple of levels however it's all part of the design.This game is not difficult at all, this game is a refreshing experience, a new way to see god games.  Two third god game, one third puzzle game maybe. 7/10 worth buyingNB: I see some people talking about problems with Uplay. No issues over here and you can play offline.			"

												From Dust is a god game, but not in the way that you might think. Instead of leading a civilization into expansion, you're instead trying to guide them through the world, ""fighting"" against the forces of nature themselves.Tech-wise, the game looks gorgeous, and more importantly has this fantastic physics system in which fluid and dust settle realistically. This is important, because those are what you'll manipulate most of the time, be it to open a path, to let forest spread, to stop fires, whatever is needed. It's an experience unlike any other game out there.However, as much as I like it, I have to say that it's best to pick up the console versions. For a very simple reason, the PC one brings the uPlay DRM, a highly incompetent piece of software developed by Ubi that has a 50/50 chance of denying you the game you just bought. Myself, I had to spend just under an hour tinkering and watching ""update"" bars fill up before the game worked. Even if it was worth the trouble in the end, this sort of abuse with your honest customers is simply ridiculous.If you do want to pick it up on PC anyways, good luck, and have a pad ready. K&M controls here are a love-or-hate thing, and you might want to try both out to see which suits you better.			"

												The bad: It's the laziest console port of last year, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and no graphic settings available, possible UBI-DRM, it's apparently pretty short and the beginning of the game is really meh. The good: Once it gets going it's actually pretty neat, it has the best water physics I've seen and it's really purdy and fun. The game isn't really like Populous, it's more like a zen garden thing where you build sandcastles on a beach and the tides come and muck everything up. Sandcastle shaman puzzler. Not bad for a fiver, but avoid full price.			"

												One of my all-time favourite games. Buy it buy it buy it.+ Gorgeous looking, slow and mesmerising. If you like god games this is one of the simplest and best... no numbers, no birth rate charts, no 'we require more food!' You are a spirit that can pick up earth, water and lava. Using these you must guide a tribe across a dozen levels that are basically physics/logic puzzles wrapped in a stunning 3d terrain simulator. Rivers wash earth downstream and create deltas, lava hits the sea and cools into rock. Like I said, mesmerising. Nothing quite like it.- Essentially a sexed-up tech demo for the terrain engine, not bad in itself but this is definitely not a full-sized game. Leaves you wanting more.- There is a bolted-on challenge mode that offers exactly zero fun.- All the levels are slow-paced and easy once you know what to do... except two that require decent planning and very good timing. Again not bad in itself, just a bit of an awkward step up from the laidback gameplay of previous levels.			"

Less strategy involved than you'd hope.  If it was priced at $5 then I'd recommend it, but not for the current $15.  Buy it on sale for a cheaper price and it'll feel like you got what you paid for. Definitely a fun game, but not for $15.			"

												Ever wonder if nature was ever in your grasp? how about within your control?Go back to ancient times once more to discover a lost civilization capable of moving lava, raising tides, planting plants (I know sounds ridiculous), and makeing land. Sounds fun right? Being able to be god and create nature with your grasp. Here's the catch, before your god your weak. A Pathetic little, nearly insignificant person who can't even control nature. So in order to become a so-called-god. (At least I think I was a god).One must verge onwards!Through raging tides!Mountainous volcano's!Unforgiving Floods!Horrifying Fires!Honestly, the dust at my shoes accumulated so much I find it so unappealling. But for this game. I highly enjoyed it, it offered a breath of new originality, gameplay, and most of all ingenuity. The story would be average at best, if you're looking for a small time get-a-way from AAA titles. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a new life, from the seriuos pace of high rated games. And just for kicks out there, The Dust at my shoes originated from somewhere, it's just I forgot where. Although... the game does provide a good measure of mental working through the brain into working out it's kinks (if you know what I mean). I wouldn't coonsider them really puzzles, like that of Portal, but it provides the brain with yet another mental work, that should at least be enjoyable to any Dusty New-comers.From Sea to Land to Fire and now Dust...7.4/10			"

From Dust is a game I absolutely have no clue how it was pulled off. The way everything works together is magic and brilliant.

												From Dust is a very neat puzzle/simulation game where you manipulate earth, lava, and water to shape the land, making it livable for the tribe you're protecting.The engine driving this game is really neat. As you tame the wilderness, rivers will change paths, hills will erode, and the lava shapes new land. It's definitely fun to play with, and it's very rewarding to see a ruthless wasteland turn into a peaceful grove once you correctly divert the hazards.This game's weak point is everything else (except the game's mythos; that's cool too). The story is way too short (beat it 100% in <3 hrs) and rather easy. With such cool tools to use, I really wanted more of the sandbox-type story levels, to really show off what I could do. Huge disappointment. There's a challenge mode, which I beat in about another 3 hours.I'd still recommend this game at $15, but be prepared for the short length. Also watch out for Ubisoft's wicked always-online DRM. Definitely get it if it's on sale.			"

												This game is pretty fun!You play as a godly snake-thing called ''The Breath'' summoned by tribes of little masked people to guide them through the dangers of nature and into new lands after their ''Ancients''.The language they speak in is quite charming, the story they tell is good, the AI is generally good although the path finding can be finnicky at times, and the physics are simply AMAZING.Moving around lava, water and earth is fun to do and the puzzles you solve with it are challenging, but not overly so.Lastly, the natural disasters some levels harbor and the way your tribes counter them if you did your job correctly are a sight to behold (and hear).All in all, this game is completely worth it.

												After getting the game to work, I'm changing my vote from No to Yes. Looks like the steam community bailed me out, they figured out a way to get uPlay to cooperate. Thanks guys! :) Now that I can safely say this is still working (uPlay is totally awful), I'm happy to report that this game is still as creative, beautiful and unique as it was in 2011. I've never played anything like it before or since. In fact, playing from dust when it first came out got me pretty interested in other simulation games like this, but none of them ever compared to what From Dust does. The way you manipulate water in this game is really what does it for me. The way water flows, builds up, carries dirt, interacts with lava, surges in tides, gushes from holes in mountains, it's just all so well done and fascinating. I just spent an hour on the first level, watching water from two river sources carve out an enormous landmass from nothing. This game is amazing, and it deserved far better than the treatment Ubisoft gave it. Bogging it down with uPlay basically condemned the game to a fate it didn't deserve. But it really is an amazing game. I've never seen it on sale, but for $15 you're buying a pretty unique experience. <3 So glad I got it working again!			"

												A very nice sandbox-game handling with water, lava, sand and rock. Growing vegetation and different types of trees can transform your terrain. Threats like tsunamis, forest fire, rain and erruptions are also to be considered. The forming of the the terrain is not static - it lives, it forms itself, you can influence quite everyting.All in one this mixture of populous and lemmings makes me feel playing a good old game BUT at the moment there some issues/negativ points (28.08.2011):- only a bunch of missions (5 hours)- grafix are not optimised for PC, no grafix options - you see poping up trees when you zoom in- no MP, no editor - I've read there will be an update, if the game sells wellNevertheless this is a refresher in that genre of game - it's a very enjoyable game with some moments hectic pace but not at all a stressful game.

I have not taken the time to beat this yet, as the later levels are frustratingly difficult.It's only downside is that the pathing of the A.I can be a little silly sometimes, taking a longer - and thus more dangerous - route simply because a little of the dirt you so carefully placed was too high for him to climb.I say that everyone should at least try this game and then decide from there if you want to buy it or not. :D			"

												On paper, the concept behind From Dust is filled with promises. A simulator where you can manipulate terrains on a whim? Groundbreaking! But despite its enormous potential, this title ends up offering too little.From Dust is no more a simulator than it is a puzzle. In its (short) story mode, you are tasked with occupying totems scattered throughout several islands. Your opposition comes from the destructive forces of storms, tsunamis, and magma. Against these, you must utilize your godlike abilities to construct a safe haven.Outside the campaign are dozens of challenge maps. Here, you are given a limited set of abilities with which you'll use to accomplish an objective, be it migrating tribes or saving them from extinction.Once the campaign and challenges are completed, that's it. There is little to no reason to replay this game unless you really enjoyed it. The unreleased map editor would've gone a long way to making this a lasting title, but alas, it isn't one.Grade: B-			"

												This game is very weird. Totally didn't expect it. You have your little villagers that you send to one of four totems in each world.  Once all four totems are settled, you can move onto the next level. What makes it hard is the tsunamis, volcanos, flooding, and such that destroys your villages. You have to pick up sand from around the map and create walls and pathways over rivers to get to the totems. The game is about not managing the villages themselves like a civ game, but more protecting them by redirecting the elements.It wasn't bad, but I only got a few hours out of it. If it's cheap, I'd get it. You don't get the 'free to create' sandbox by the end though, and I had enough of the game once I got there.			"

(tip, try giving uPay administrator rights, it worked for me with windows 7 crashes, and with windows 8.1 it's been just smooth sailing with the bugger).Anyway I wish not to give a bad review to a good game because of the horrible DRM, which may have not even been the choice of the developers but forced on it by Ubisoft by default.My only grief with the game was that it was very, very short and overall small. The campaign is done through in couple hours, and then you have bunch of very short challenge scenarios (don't trust my hours I tend to leave games open in the background). It lacks longer play scenarios and depth in many things, like the frequent discoveries don't really bring anything to the table, and there is _no_ long world building and evolving sandbox mode of proper type, part from maybe repeating levels of the campaign which are quite linear whatsoever, and the last bit free build if you really, really like just sculpting scenarios for no other purpose. I find it weird it is advertised as such.I could easily see myself going for ~100 hours with this game if they had extended it and gave it bit more depth, growing possibilities and more interaction in features. Alas, now you prolly get around 10h max out of it.Considering how small the game is and not very new anymore it is a bit overpriced. However it truly was very enjoyable and I gulfed through it quickly and exitedly. Do give it a try if you have spare money, especially if it's on sale.			"

												I won't lie when I picked up this game, I was kind of hoping to run into another ""Black Vs White"" type of game.  While this is similar, I shouldn't have expected it to be the same game.  It does provide it's own challenges, but I found it to be very boring.  Tell your people to go here or here.  Make sure they don't drown while they do their song and dance.  That's the gist of what I got with my few hours of game play.  No depth.			"

												A bit of a god game, but more of a dust physics puzzler. Help your one tribe grow and flourish as they struggle against the environment to survive. Use the powers of picking up and setting down dust and water to interact with the desert plants and animals to reach objectives and clear the pathway in your people's journey. Pretty simple, but a good deal of fun and can be a little challenging with the various environmental interactions.			"

												An excellent little ""god"" game, which I would gladly play again and again.The graphics are wonderful, and gameplay and controls are simple and well done. The foreign language used (I suspect Australian Aborigine dialect of some sort) lends a mystical, mysterious feel to the whole adventure. The ending, while slightly lackluster, was amusing. I won't spoil it though. :)Unfortunately for this wonderful little gem, it is way too short, although the challenge maps do offer some interesting plays. I kinda wish there were some expansions or DLC for it.I'll give it a 6.5/10 I think. "

												This was a fantastic experience. I was sorry it was over. The Uplay thing is a nuisance but I needed it for Far Cry 3 and a few other games that were good so I don't see why people make such a fuss and work so hard to drive other players away. From Dust worked fine for me. Shaping the terrain to change the flow of lava and such is a new kind of thing in gaming so I went to the many youtube videos that show how its done and got lots of good tips to finish all the levels. Other levels could be solved using logic. There's not much replay but there could be if they let people create their own levels in workshop.			"

												I thought the game would have more depth.  Honestly it gets boring fast.  It's a good casual timesink, but there's really not much of a challenge or story.  It's just a simple little physics celebration.  I don't know how the guy that made Out of This World ended up making something so drab.Ubisoft installs ""Uplay"" which is a wannabe Steam browser that runs on top of everything to play this game. I'm going to avoid all Ubisoft games from now on.  You need an account name and password, and it tries to keep track of games you've purchased, except half the time it screws up or bugs out.  It was designed by a team of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys and doing a quick google search nets you thousands upon thousands of hate filled sites, blogs, and forums full of people boycotting Ubisoft.  I already bought the game on STEAM.  Why do I need yet another spyware ridden DRM pile of crap running on my computer?			"

It feels like they totally wasted all the possibilities they had with so awesome system and didn't even make any real missions to use all these great tools  I maybe expected too much and that is why I feel so disappointed.If the lack of gameplay is not enough you have to also deal with Uplay, still even after all these problems I have to give it thumbs up.

The only issue I've had with it was the main menu not loading, and that's fixed with a simple game restart. I've enjoyed solving each level by creating mountains, dams, re-directing rivers and lava flow, and the water is very realistic looking, which makes this game all the more fun to mess with. I would definetely suggest getting this game.			"

												6 hours game time. Finished the game. It's sad, especially since this game is actually quite amazingly beautiful. The ebb and flow (and the destructive force) of nature is artistically rendered. I found myself cheering on my little settlers as they tried to outrun a tsunami and also yelling at them in anger as they stupidly run towards a lava flow - all whilst trying to scoop up some of the enivronment to delay their impending doom. I'd rate this 8/10 if the game was cheaper or a LOT longer, but unfortunately the hype, cost and length of this game gets it 4/10.			"

PRO:The primary mechanic of manipulating the land is wonderfully executed. Every level is creative and interesting and I never felt like I was just repeating the level before it. This game gets top marks for game design.Furthermore, the presentation is top notch. The water and lava flow beautifully and everything is tied together nicely with a distinct visual style.CON:The problem with this game mainly comes from the fact that it was designed for consoles and poorly adapted for PCs. The mouse vertical/horizontal axes control a little pointer that tracks the terrain rather than the screen, making it needlessly difficult to click things on uneven ground.The game is also filled with unskippable cutscenes. Between levels you repeatedly watch the same cutscene. The scene is only about 60 second longs, but it's still annoying. Also, periodically in a level the game takes control of your camera to slowly pan around the new objective, even if you've played that level before and already seen the cutscene. It breaks the flow of the game and, worse yet, the world doesn't pause for the cutscene. I've lost villages while my camera was seized from me. It's not the end of the world, but it's a ridiculous thing for a game studio to overlook.This combined with the mouse issue leaves me sorely disappointed in Ubisoft's user interface design. Do they have a QA department?There's also no real story to speak of. You just follow a tribe around different levels. The lack of story doesn't seriously detract from the game, but a quality story or just some kind of world building would have certainly added to it.SUMMARY:That said, the game is still engaging and unique. It's short*, but that's just because it's all quality content that they didn't pointlessly recycle (unlike 90% of all other games out there). If you really want more after the ""story"", there are challenge maps.You've probably never played a game like this before. It's worth it on that basis alone. Better still, it's actually quite engaging. This is the best game I've played from Ubisoft that I can remember.* I consider short a pro, since I don't have 100 hours to blow grinding. But I understand that other people feel differently. If you like long games, don't let this game being short dissuade you.			"

												I love this game.  It's so awesome to create the landscape and see how it changes under the influence of the elements.I find myself wanting to play this game all the time. Please working day, be over so I can go home and play this.There are a few hiccups in the controls. If you are holding a tiny plant or a tiny bit of water/sand/lava/whatever, you can't pick anything else up, which is not always obvious. I struggled getting on with precise aiming in the beginning, and I don't like some of the camera controls.This is all made up by the fact that I can throw lava at my villages.As far as the storyline goes... I don't really care about the people and I'm not sure why I should be helping them, but I like progressing through the game nonetheless. Every level is like a little puzzle. I have 2 more to go to finish the story mode, and then I'm moving on to the challenge mode. I played on one computer until halfway through the game in about 6 hours, then installed it at home to find that there's no cloud saves.I didn't mind playing through it again though, as I understood the puzzles it took me about 1.5 hours to progress to where I was before.Booo uplay, and booo no cloud saves. Yay being a god!			"

												The gameplay is decent enough, but there is almost no PC support. Mouse/KB are unplayable, 360 controller is basically required. Game is locked at 30 fps and there are no graphics options aside from resolution. Also Uplay is required. The game could look and play so much better but it's clear no effort was put into it. Not even worth it when it's on sale.			"

												I've previously enjoyed playing From Dust, back before UPlay was imposed upon it. Now, because those clowns've decided to retroactively ruin it with their ill-conceived & awfully-implimented launcher, I can't play. The launcher just won't run. So, I guess that, having destroyed my property, they'll be paying for it, right?Of course not; they are ♥♥♥♥ing scum.			"

												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												Excellent and challenging non-violent game. You must figure out how to provide for your tribe and how to lead it across various terrains  and avoid numerous environmental dangers. Requires analytical skill in order to access best way to get the job done. Play gets progressively harder as different dangers from land, sea and plants appear. You must settle new villages next to the totems in order to unlock new powers for your avatar.  Lead your people across the land following the path of the ancients while gaining power and abilities. Non-violent and age appropriated for the entire family.			"

												Haven't played in a long while, and decided to give it another go - game now crashes on start. There's probably a fix if you dig deep enough, but from what I remember of the gameplay, it was a fun time waster but not worth putting in extra effort to try and find and implement some workaround. Can't possibly reccomend a game that doesn't work on a system that doesn't experience any compatibility issues with any other games I own.			"

												This game is kinda a cross between a sim game and a puzzle game.  You have to manipulate the environment in order to allow your little people to build villages and ultimately unlock a doorway to the next level.But you have to protect the villages and villagers from all sorts of natural disasters like errupting volcanos and tidal waves by building walls with rock and sand, or helping your shamans get protective songs for the villages.My only complaint about the game is that the campaign mode seemed a bit short.

												Very innovative game. The nature effects, such as the crashing of waves on the shore, flow of water down a natural river, and flowing lava are amazing. The story mode is challenging and requires you to spend extra time on the map to fully unlock all the story/challenge 'memories'. Sadly, this suffers from bad console port syndrome, as there are some graphical anomolies, sound weirdness, cutscenes abruptly ending, and some control weirdness. The game is still very playable and lots of fun. I would've liked to see a sandbox mode, where you can start with a blank slate and just start building your own land mass and/or make your own maps to challenge friends. Definitely worth the price point. I estimate the game story mode takes about 4-5 hours to complete.			"

												A decent-enough game in the spirit of Black & White minus the village building (the villagers do that themselves around totems when you tell them). Each level requires you to found a village around each totem and spread vegatation for bonus materials all while dealing with whatever potential hazards the level may have. Whether that be torrential rains, tsunamis, or volcanoes or some combination thereof. Due to the initial outcry at launch, Ubi made it possible to bypass Uplay and play it offline; in updates since, they quietly edited that bypass back out again. As a result, I can't recommend the game due to them pulling something backhanded like that, let alone changing their original stance on its DRM from the original launch to begin with.			"

The voice actor in the promo is not in the game and the voices in the game gets annoying as hell.Sold itself as an interesting gritty shamanistic tribal sim... it fails to deliver on all counts.

												As far as ""God"" simulation games go, From Dust offers a unique twist on the genre. The physics based environments and puzzles offer a great variety in gameplay, allowing you to choose how YOU want to finish the level. The graphics are lush and amazing to look at, I'll find myself just admiring the scenery sometimes rather than doing what I'm supposed to do. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who's open to this kind of game. The only hangup I'd say there is would be that sometimes the AI doesn't quite understand that you've laid out a perfect path for them, and the oftentimes take the much more dangerous route. All in all though that's just a minor hindrance to a great game, especially for only $15!			"

Perhaps we could use some service that already is secure but not obtrusive, I dunno, something like steam. Boy, that would be handy to have a service like steam to validate a game.Is ‘From Dust’ good? Who gives a ♥♥♥♥, one more potentially good game ruined by a room full of fat old corporate sycophants who all slap each other on the back for a job well done. Ubisoft if joining my list of EA and THQ, well done jackasses!			"

												The single main negative point first.... this game does use Ubisofts online DRM service, but beyond initially registering your key (which itself is a simple ""Enter key here"" box so not an elaborate task), you just need to be online to launch.The game itself can be summed up in alot less words than the DRM system, ""A lot of fun, providing you got the imagination to enjoy sandbox games"". If you can't play a game without some gruff chap on the radio going ""Get your♥♥♥♥♥to the neon pink arrow scum!"", don't even bother thinking about this game.The physics on the geology shaping is well done, the graphics are fantastic in places, not so great in others (Console port after all) and regardless to what the trailer may give the impression of the weather sequences are NOT cutscenes, they're realtime events going down that interact with the world as you have shaped it.Just don't go experimenting with volcanos... that often leads to everyone dead in fiery badness :\			"

												A little dissapointing, but still a half decent puzzle sim The same cut scene everytime you finish a level gets annoying after the 3rd or 4th time, the controls are awkward at the best of times. And getting it to run smoothly is more challenging than the game itself. The voice actor in the promo is not in the game and the voices in the game gets annoying as hell.Sold itself as an interesting gritty shamanistic tribal sim... it fails to deliver on all counts.  A dull, childish, puzzler that has more in common with lemmings.2.5 / 5			"

Aside from that, its a game where you play a god like being. without the whininig of human natures. Controlling the elements and forming the world to a purpose is fullfilling even though the games pace is quite slow...The reason I'm not guna recommend this though is because I'm starting to think this is more a cash grab then anything..

												From Dust is a very neat puzzle/simulation game where you manipulate earth, lava, and water to shape the land, making it livable for the tribe you're protecting.The engine driving this game is really neat. As you tame the wilderness, rivers will change paths, hills will erode, and the lava shapes new land. It's definitely fun to play with, and it's very rewarding to see a ruthless wasteland turn into a peaceful grove once you correctly divert the hazards.This game's weak point is everything else (except the game's mythos; that's cool too). The story is way too short (beat it 100% in <3 hrs) and rather easy. With such cool tools to use, I really wanted more of the sandbox-type story levels, to really show off what I could do. Huge disappointment. There's a challenge mode, which I beat in about another 3 hours.I'd still recommend this game at $15, but be prepared for the short length. Also watch out for Ubisoft's wicked always-online DRM. Definitely get it if it's on sale.			"

												I really like the idea of this game but it has graphical and longevity issues.First off the textures are beyond bad on this game. It's like looking at a 640x480 game zoomed in to a 50'' screen, that's how bad it is, so it will be really noticeable if you look attently (fortunately you don't have to play a lot of time, it's short), that being said it's a straight up port from the consoles.The game concept is really interesting, but it's really simple, for a god game if you have almost no power at all over the world. Basically controlling the ""forces of nature"" (lava/water/land) around your island, e.g. building natural barriers to block tsunamis/volcano eruptions, creating bridges to block rivers.It has a simple campaign format where you play maps with an increased number of powers each, but there's not much of a change in between each, and almost no interest to move on.After a while it just gets old and tiring and the lack of good sandbox game features make it pretty stale, I'd say get it if you like the idea of the game, which is pretty much terraforming an island, but don't expect a sandbox game like black&white.

It's pretty to look at, has a lot of flair and some nice extra things to find that give you a little blurb of text full of pathos, but the core game is.... well, there's very little game here, since, again, the puzzles are shallow and its all in the menial ""work"" of executing what you want to do.

Changes your visionFrom Dust contains great part of the world vision used by mankind to explain its surroundings in pre-christian era: the spoken tradition. Hidden within its storyline and in the bonus tales unlocked, one is able to understand how some of our ancestors saw the world and how they believed they could control it: how their traditions of music and ritual kept their minds tranquil against the perils of natural catastrophe and wild dangers.Not only that, the game is work of art, comprising beautifully executed music, masterful narrative and astonishing visuals, all capable of arousing a sense of longing, of belonging to that ancient past.

												TL;DR: *DO NOT BUY THIS GAME*The game is brilliant, it's a lot of fun and the main game mechanic is fresh. It really revolutionized the repetative RTS schema of gameplay. While I could play it (pre Uplay) I had a lot of fun. I can no longer play this game, it won't load past Uplay crashing.UbiSoft's ""Uplay"" DRM makes the game unplayable (as in IT WONT START). I bought the pre-order and have recently re-installed it to check out the flak that Uplay is getting. It doesn't run because of UPlay. UPlay crashes immediately, I can't even log in to it. If you were also bent over the table by Ubisoft, please join me in a boycott of all future Ubisoft products.			"

Product received for free
												Interesting game, but with one major drawback - each stage (save poerhaps the last) will not stay stable no matter what you do, eventually the environment will ""win"" and your stage will be destroyed.  You have to complete things under a certain unknown time limit (variable depending on how well you delay inevitable disasters), while constantly battling the environment and then run to the next stage before it all goes to heck.  A few minor tweaks might help (an update perhaps?) that would ease off the time and damage pressure so that one could actually enjoy each stage and simply watch it flourish stably, moving on only when you feel like it.  Can't really recommend the game, but can't decry it either - neutral.			"

I haven't managed to get to the actual game part yet thanks to all the Ubisoft crud and hoops they want you to jump through before they will allow you to load the game.(And yes, you will see three separate ""Now patching..."" prompts with progress bars before you get to the UPlay login screen.)As a side note, the UPlay username ""WhyDoIHaveToDoThis?"" is already taken. So are ""WhyGodWhy"", ""WhyDoIBother"", ""UbisoftAreIdiots"", ""UPlayIsStupid"", and ""KillMeNow"". At that point I got bored and mashed the keyboard. So look me up, I'm sazwethiujolk on UPlay. (Also, UPlay requires your birth date but limits it to an earliest year of 1910, requiring those of us born before that date to lie in answer to the question.)			"

												This game is a technological masterpiecePart Black & White, part work of artYou play as a Godlike figure, guiding your people from one end of the map to the other, while avoiding natural disasters by manipulating the physical environment by essentially terraforming what you canShort, but sweet, and does not offer much replay value but I did enjoy playing through it a second time a few years later.If you're a fan of Godgames, and like the sound of manipulating the physical environment in order to help save people from their ultimate demise on their way to some ""promised"" land, give this game a try!

												Only a few hours in but so far it is very enjoyable, mechanics can be somewhat repetitive but it is a vidya game, over all though engaging and fun!			"

												An overlooked Gem of a game. As a god you're in control of transforming a landscape to help tribes settle habitable areas. The idea is novel and its execution is successful.			"

												Great atmoshpere, great designs... But optimization, graphics and controls comfort are really bad. If it is was good, it made god-game feel better.. 6.5/10			"

												A really enjoyable little game. One of the few where it's worthwhile making it to the final level.Playing with the tools on offer in the game is very relaxing and calming...  the kind of geography creation that will keep you up till the early hours. 8/10 - lost 2 whole points for not having a pure creation mode. ***Spoiler***: The last level is basically a creation tool... but it's not truely free form and you have to have the villages... which I'd very much like to leave out!

												If you like Black & White, this is the next best thing. Its more of a puzzle game with some god game elements. It's short. VERY short. You finish it in a day or two. I would recomend it, but the Uplay BS you have to go to is not fun and takes a long time. If you didn't have already a Uplay account , you'll have to make one, then do a two-step verification. It's a little too much hassle to play a game that would take a few days to finish.			"

												Ya know, I struggled for a while to get this game to play on my computer.In the end, it ended up logging 10 hours of my time before I realised, the ads for the game were moreentertaining to me than the game play.Such a shame.			"

												Nice little sandbox that is good to idle away a few hours. In story mode you lead your tribe through a number of terrains trying to populate totems, which grant certain powers and which you need to complete the level. Once you got all the totems, you can continue to the next level. There really isnt a story as such though, but sust some cutscenes (which you cannot skip) with some esoteric blah blah. There is also a challenge mode in which you have to reach certain objectives which I found rather boring. But still, worthwhile enough to buy.			"

												I honestly enjoy this game. The transitions from stage to stage are annoying though - it would have been nice if each time the transition showed something different. It's an older game, but it has a very interesting concept. I've replayed it a few times and I find it interesting every time since I try to play differently and find new ways to solve problems.			"

												The UPlay and DRM is annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also with other people had heaps of issues getting it to run, but followed some online FAQ/tips about the issues and was able to get it to work with some effort. Don't get the game if this is a deal breaker for you as you're most likely going to have DRM issues.The game mechanics are cool, and some of the maps are frustrating and then you find a way through it. It is a very short game, but the challenges are also pretty cool too. Getting the game on sale is probably a good idea. "
