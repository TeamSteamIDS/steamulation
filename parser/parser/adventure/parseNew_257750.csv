												I'd like to say before listing the pros and cons that I absolutely love this game. Definitely worth getting.Pros : -Simple yet very challenging campaign.-Multiplayer is utilised well(you can't get into secret levels unless you co-operate with teammates)-Secret levels!-Fluid gameplay, nothing really strange happens under normal conditions.-Very nice graphics and in-game music-Almost zero random events which kill you like in most platformersCons :-Multiplayer can be very glitchy when the ping between you and the player is higher than let's say 100ms(bullets curving from their paths rather than being delayed...)That's all that I can think of for now! Also, one thing to note. You should definitely play this in multiplayer. I found myself playing the game and enjoying it a lot more with others. Sometimes it isn't fun failing over and over unless somebody is doing it with you!			"

												Fun, simple game with a good feel on the controls, that requires paitence and timing.The game is single player and multiplayer, local and online, which means you can do the adventure mode in a cooperative sense. (You'll probably be killing each other more than helping each other). Other modes are Race, and Deathmatch, so you don't always have to do the same thing.If you are interested in the slightest bit, it's worth the price when it's on sale, and if you enjoy a good challenge, then it's worth the full price.  The game even has a level editor, so once you complete all the levels, you can make your own, or download other people's levels and die even more.			"

												Do you have three close friends that like to play games? Do all of you like platfomers? Do you like the multiplayer chaos of New Super Mario Bros Wii? And finally do you want a game to ruin those friendships? Then this is the game for you. With some of the hardest platformering I have ever seen, plus up to three other players to either work with or against you as you try to go on a grand adventure and do whatever else token cats like to do. Staring Jack the badass one, Blanky the sweet and inocent one, Henry the bristish one, and Jazzy the ""groovy"" one. There will always be that one more level you just can't beat... So whether you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself off, or destroy friendships, this is the game for you!			"

												This game is like Super Meat boy but with friends. Fun by yourself, but it's better with friends. Some secret levels you NEED a friend to reach. Some levels are made easier with a friend because you can jump off their heads to reach higher places and you can use them to mess with the trap's timing.For a platformer, controls aren't as tight as I'd like, but they're not unbearable. This game is harder than super meat boy, in my opinion.Public multiplayer is pretty dead, but I don't exactly play during steam's peak hours. It's better with people you actually know, anyways. It has online AND/OR local multiplayer, meaning if you have some gamepads lying around you can connect them and have some buddies play with you in your house/their house while you play with some buddies off in Sneedville, all on the same screen and in the same game. If you do decide to play with friends online, be sure to set a password for your lobby. Learned that the hard way. Online multiplayer also seems a bit laggy for the host, but my internet's subpar at best so beware, those with average connections.Very fun with some minor issues that don't detract too much from the overall game.9/10			"

												This game is a cute little hardcore platformer. If you're a fan of pure platforming, this game is decent, if a bit frustrating at times. It is not on the same level as Super Meat Boy or the I Wanna Be The Guy games, especially with it's lack of any sort of boss battles, but there is still fun to be had here.I played through this game in co-op with one friend. The 'co-opness' in this game is somewhat nullified by the fact that you can easily kill the other players by jumping on their heads, so you end up just taking turns attempting to complete each stage, making sure you don't both reach the same section at the same time and accidentally kill each other. It can be a bit fun repeatedly killing the other play to vent your frustrations at times, though, and the frustration of dying in this game is mitigated by the fact that your character instantaneously respawns at the start of the stage when you die.All in all, an okay game if you enjoy hardcore pure platformers.

												This game is most comparable to Super Meat Boy in that you'll die hundreds of times trying to beat levels that require very precise platforming. Like Meat Boy, the load times after deaths are non-existent which is a big plus for this type of game. This game's main draw however is the competetive/co-op. I played through most of the game first with a few friends and then I played all the way through solo. The multiplayer surprisingly never gets too frustrating even though most of your deaths come as a direct result of playing with others. Playing with more than 2 players on the last two worlds can seem ridiculously impossible, as I had  a much easier time playing later by myself.My one complaint is that we encountered a few annoying bugs later in the game. One was a case where momentum didn't reset at a particular point after fans in a level. Not too bad, but slightly annoying. The other bug was on a few levels where the spawn was located on top of the door to the previous level, we would constantly enter that door upon death. Overall this is a fun party game that includes a few other multiplayer modes alongside adventure, giving it some decent replayability. Worth a couple bucks.			"

Jump 'n Bump 2 (with cats)Level designs aren't astonishing but still, it's fun hardcore platformer which reminded me Jump 'n Bump and Super Meat Boy with cooperative mode(s). But it has also some flavor from ""Jinsei Owata Daibouken"" and ""Shobon no Akushon"" in some levels.Art style is good and reminded me 90's cartoons. Game itself represent a DOS game with clean visuals. Blood effects are awesome. Tracker musics are great, my favourites are menu music, first level and castle themes.I read the negative comments about online problems but it seems like online play a little bit fixed since last year but it still has some problems like connection timeouts or connection fail errors (i don't know if it is my dormitory internet or not though). There are enough amount of players and rooms but mostly they are private and they don't play Race or Deathmatch but Adventure mode; i don't know why. Hotseat (local) play is always available.Cooperative adventure mode is a little bit chaotic. You accidentally (or purposedly?) bump and kill your partner and/or prevent them to reach their goal or they do the same to you. Also they distract you because, you know, there is something moving over there or something funny happens. Time by time you or your partners activate a trap and you can't handle the timing of it and die. But these kind of incidents make the game more funnier.There is also a level editor named Aftershock but there are no guides about it and it's not so user friendly. You can find custom levels to play on Steam Workshop. Just hit the green subscribe button.I bought it for 2 bucks and i can recommend it to you if you like hardcore platformers.066 108 111 111 100 121 084 114 097 110 110 121 108 097 110 100 046 109 112 052			"

Instead of killing your friends when you jump on their head, it would pace the game up greatly if you could just stack on eachother instead. Also when the level is done instead of going to the next level, it could be more fun for the other players to let the other players finish the level and meanwhile give the player who already made it something to do.I would recommend this game if you like a challenge.Click here to check out all my multiplayer game reviews.

Also when the level is done instead of going to the next level, it could be more fun for the other players to let the other players finish the level and meanwhile give the player who already made it something to do.I would recommend this game if you like a challenge.Click here to check out all my multiplayer game reviews.

												This game has been out for a while now and with Bloody Trapland 2 almost ready to release, I figured it was time to drop a quick review.While you can play this game single player, it is clearly designed with multiplayer in mind.  In the time I've spent playing this with friends I can guarantee you'll have many laughs and most likely rage a little.  There are a lot of levels in the base game and will keep you busy for many hours, but the addition of the workshop levels (level editor) gives this game an almost infinite replayability.One thing I would like to point out are the achievements, while plenty of these can be done single player, a fair amount of them will require you to play with at least one friend in order to access ""secret"" areas.In keeping this short, yes, I recommend this game.  At the time of this review its on sale and like I mentioned at the beginning, the second game is almost ready to release.  So, why not add this game to your library and give it a try, and if you enjoy it, maybe you'll pick up the new game as well.			"

												It is a very fun way to interact amongst friends, in game or in real life, and can be at times frustrating.

												Rage Quit Simulator 2016This game has more blood than an average Tarantino movie, and can f*ck your mind up easily. Levels are sometimes so hard that you will just get tired and stop playing. But if you convince a few friends to play together, this game is actually fun. Mostly because you can kill your friends prevent them from complete the level. The menu is a bit messy, for me finding how to play multiplayer was a pain, joining through Steam doesn't work. Overall it's a nice game, if you see it on discount it's definetely worths to buy, but don't play it alone.			"

												A nice, easy platformer game. Until you realise everything is made to kill you in the most frustrating ways imaginable. And then once you master the super hard, almost impossible levels, the easy stuff comes back to bite you when you forget how to jump over a gap and die right before the end of the level. Fun and rewarding, but only for about 5 minutes at a time.			"

												I just had to stop playing this to write a review. And I'm not doing those very often, let alone getting such urgent impulse to actually close the game for it. But this game deserves it... I guess. Well, I'm just an hour in, reached only W3-1 but oh boy, it gives me some sweats – sweats of joy!Never have I played such a challenging yet achievable plattformer.  Admittedly it's not my preferred genre of choice on my computer, and console gamers could eventually prove me otherwise, but I'm having a blast!The gameplay is as easy as it gets – jump, run, duck, avoid deadly objects, just don't die reaching the exit. One lvl is merely one screen, no scrolling. One world has ten screens (plus some bonus stages), as far as I can tell, I'm in the last lvl of the 2nd world. For the adventure mode that is. There are also a race and a deathmatch mode which are obviously multiplayer modes. I've only tried adventure so far, as I'm testing candidates for the next local gaming party, but lacking a buddy right now. And this one looks very promising although you might gather a more experienced crowd. Now, it is hard as stated before and on entering a lvl you might think “how I'm ever going to make this?!”. But you are! It may take a while though*g* It's always doable, never unfair. It takes some plattfoming skill and timing. Controls are precise and responsive. Levels are riddled with – well – traps... where some of those aren't visible when you enter a new screen. But you won't succeed on your first attempt anyway... so.The graphics are – as you can see on the screenshots – retro styled, inspired by the 16 bit era. They're not particularly unique, but by no means dull or ugly. The gore effect which covers the environment with more and more blood as you're being constantly crushed by the fist of doom or saw blade of horror gives a weird sense of accomplishment. It's got a great soundtrack, I don't like the soundeffects though. Often they don't fit or sound awfully generic.I definitely recommend Bloody Trapland for solo players and I will vote for it on the next game night with friends.			"

Briefly: Bloody Trapland is a precision platformer of distinct levels. Alright game, yet some game design choices are rage-inducing in a mixed way.I bought this to a group of friends a couple of years ago to play together. We played it a couple of times (a few hours) and had fun trying to beat ""the story missions"". I forgot about it for a long time before coming back on a couple of occasions to beat the rest of the levels by myself. I consider it one of the hardest platformers I've played.Bloody Trapland is perfectly described by its name. It's a precision platformer where a tiny mistake means death and you may die hundreds of times before beating a level. The traps are everywhere and deaths paint the levels red (unless you turn off the gore). Adding some chaos, you can play it co-operatively or competitively with your friends.Action multiplayer madnessPlayed multiplayer, like it's probably meant, Bloody Trapland is good fun for a while. The bipedal cat furry humanoids run through the obstacle course that is the trapland and try to reach the door to the next area without dying. Jumping on a fellow furry kills them in a bloody pop, similar to the obscure multiplayer deathmatch Jump 'n Bump[en.wikipedia.org].There's also a deathmatch and race modes with their own levels. To perfect the game, a par time has to be reached in the race levels that may benefit from or even require playing co-operatively.Level design is nice, levels are fairly complex or sometimes there are two alternate routes to the end. The story mode also has several routes through it, some requiring co-op to beat.It's too bad controls cannot be changed, and only one local player may play on keyboard with arrows. Up to four players may play with controllers though (I've tested and played it with Xbox controllers).Embrace the respawnName fits the game very well: Levels are filled with traps. Sharp traps, squishing traps, and surprise traps. Bottomless holes, guns, aiming cannons and bouncing fireballs. There are the classic spikes and sawblades, both moving and retracting ones and they come in several sizes. Occasional teleporter makes it initially impossible to tell how the level should be played out.Fundamentally, the traps are of four types: stationary, moving, periodic and reacting ones. The moving ones usually have a distinct pattern of some kind (however see below). Periodic ones usually go off at set intervals (again, see below). Reacting ones are mostly fine: there's a gun, it's going to shoot when you go in front of it, and there are falling blocks that go when you step under them and get squished. These are all fine if initially surprising.However, Bloody Trapland hosts two kinds of traps that I absolutely abhorred: Hidden falling blocks Jumping lava ballsThe hidden blocks are literally inside the wall, impossible to see before they first strike. The jumping lava balls bounce from the lava at quasi-periodic intervals at various different heights, impossible to anticipate.Both of the above traps can be kind of fun when playing with friends. When playing solo, they become extremely frustrating. The blocks because they artificially prolong the levels before you know to even try to avoid them, fire balls because they cause totally random deaths. You can pull a perfect speed run (required in the race modes for gold status), taken away from you at the very end through sheer chance by a fire ball that jumps at the same time as you, it's rage-inducing.ConclusionsI spent 19 hours with Bloody Trapland before beating every level. That includes about 5 hours of co-op play with friends. Hardest levels/challenges were likely those that required co-op play because of the inherent requirement of coordination.I am left with mixed feelings of the game. With friends it was quite fun, and many levels were pretty fun even in solo play. But some of the lame traps made solo play incredibly frustrating and that utterly ruined some levels for me.So if you can live with that and/or you and your friends are up for Nintendo-hard platforming, Bloody Trapland might be an alright investment. And if you really dig it, there's a level editor and so an infinite amount of custom content, if the extremely challenging original levels are not enough. Still, because of the above qualms, I'd wait for a sale.			"

Review on Bloody TraplandWritten By: Rias GremoryPros►This game was gifted to me by one of my close friends, I decided to play the singleplayer for around 15 mins to get the feeling for it, and I have to say I enjoy it! The art style and the amount of blood and gore is just simply amazing, a lot of time has been put into the AI (As is quite obvious) The controls are ok, and they can be dealt with accordingly ;). also enjoy the menus, I know that may not be normal, but they are simple, include what you need, and when you need it, it will provide advanced options, (by opening tabs)Cons►I have had MANY problems with the multiplayer, at first trying to use Hamachi didn't work at all, I couldn't connect to either of my friends, then it worked for one, then cut out as soon as I started to play, next we tried port forwarding (The process where you add the game ports into your internet access) that was just a waste of our time and effort. This may have just been our clients, but I haven't a clue myself, I haven't really seen any 'problems' on google or the steam forums. Moving on swiftly, The controls, having to use the arrow keys were really awkward for me, as I am used to FPS games there WASD is used. There is most likely a way to change them, but I didn't really have the time to check. There was one minor problem, that I couldn't get my head around though, that was the menu not supporting mouse control, this is purely lazy, and more effort could have gone into allowing a mouse to be used in the menu's, but that is the only hiccup I had with the menu's, they may be hard to navigate, but that is fine.Overall Review►I enjoyed the plat-former/death system, and had a lot of fun jumping around in the air, straight onto the death blocks, but I didn't really seem to achieve much doing so, but I digress, The way the game is layed out is beautiful, and I could spend a lot more time playing this if I had the nerves...Extra InformationDeveloper(s): 2PlayPublisher(s): 2PlayPlatform(s): WindowsRelease Date: October 27th 2013Source(s)Personal ExperiencesSteam ForumsSteam Store PageWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group	 "

												Well, it's a platformer, so you know what to expect. It isn't a ""bad"" game per say, it's just that the game in general is somewhat lacking. The levels aren't very difficult or too different from one another. They have added a level editor, which is pretty nice i guess, but there are much better platform games to do this in. The music is pretty great, i'll give them that. There isn't anything about this game that makes it stand out from any other platformer on the market currently. The controls are very simple: Jump, move to the right, move to the left and crouch. The options menu is also very lacking, not that the options menu needs to be grand for a game like this, but it helps if some things can be tweaked. The only things that could be changed regarding graphics was the resolution and ""effects"", whatever that entails. However, you could turn the effects all the way from ultra to off, with no noticable difference, so i am still confused as to what it actually does. The texture quality makes this game looks like it should be on a flash games site, like Newgrounds or Mousebreaker, not a site like Steam.Overall, this is a game that could be played on co-op with a friend, but it doesn't have much about it that is compelling. It's more of a ""Get drunk with your friends and bugger about on a game"" kind of game, if you get my meaning. Anyway, mediocre game with nothing that sets it apart from other platformers. This game was the winner of the Game Concept Challenge 2011, but it doesn't seem like the devs have added anything much to the original game back in 2011.(This is the opinion of someone who doesn't enjoy or play many platform games, so take my opinion with a barrel of salt.)

												EDIT: this game in a nutshell - screenshot http://i.imgur.com/EG9KAlj.pngOk, that's it. I just tried to make game screenshot, because all 4 of us managed to get to harder part of level, but when I pressed F12 game CRASHED. This title has potential, if it was on Early Access it would deserve recomendation, but now?Here are things that are in my opinion UNACCEPTABLE for a ""finished"" Steam game:- buggy, sometimes cannons stop shooting, game doesn't recognize that you finished level, taking screenshot for some reason clears level blood or even crashes game- NO KEY BINDING CONFIGURATION AT ALL and moving with arrows on my keyboard is not comfortable- only XBox controller is supported, I tried using emulator x360ce and it doesn't work- on game chat you can't use special characters such as question mark - why?- it's hard to find online games, because:.......1) list shows both passworded and open games and you can't filter it .......2) most open games are impossible to join, because you get ""timed out"" error, also game doesn't ping such rooms, most pinged (so I assume working) rooms are password protected, very few open games are pinged and working.......3) there's no refresh button on list, to do it you have to go back and open online menu again- with 4 players in game, most of the time you die, because somebody jumped on you, people often do it on purpose, it's irrtating


only pinged servers are possible to join

I guess it won't surprise you that I think this game is frustrating. But the problem is, it's not dying or difficulty that is causing it, but lack of features and bugs. This game is not finished and I can't recommend it. Just look on game forum and see how many people got problems with it. And it's a title from 2013.			"

If you are a calm easy going gamer that doesn't like to rage quit then this is totally for you. Just dodge spikes, fists and bullets to get past the stage is no problem. Actually that's a lie, you rage, rage and then more rage once you get to like world 3. These can be easily passed with friends but then you're stuck at world 5 and you are all raging on Skype/TS3/Curse together and it is really fun. I got it for the very purpose of helping a friend out and 5 hours (to date) later I took it to college and showed more people how addictive it can get yet very frustrating.Jerma985 & STAR_ on Bloody Trapland2nd part to Jerma985 & STAR_ on Bloody Trapland "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Bloody Trapland is a game developed by 2Play.se, the game is simple yet offer a very challenging campaign. The multiplayer is utilised well however you can't get into secret levels unless you co-operate with teammatesOh and by the way there are secret levels!The gameplay is very fluid and nothing really strange happens under normal conditions. The game offers very nice graphics and the in-game music is good and almost zero random events which kill you like in most platformers...However, the multiplayer offered can be very glitchy when the ping between you and the player is higher than 100ms such as bullets curving from their paths rather than being delayed...However, Bloody Trapland is a fun yet challenging to game alone or even better with your friends! RECOMMENDED :)  Also, best to play with a controller  "

												This is a game that falls into the category 'if it doesn't exist - it would have to be created sooner or later'. Game is a good follow up to the success of Super Meat Boy and Escape Goat etc. Play singleplayer obstacle course - which basically works as training for the real deal: Up to 4 player multiplayer mayhem. Lots of rage and also lots of good times and laughs. I would not change anything in this game except the MP game listing that shows games that are left hanging and give no ping (i.e. they dont exist). Good luck trying to beat the game solo or with your 'soon to be ex-friends'. 9.8/10 "

												This game is really damn hard.  I wouldn't say its as hard as some of the sections in I Want To Be The Guy or Boshi or anything quite like that, but its hard as nails.  It's also one of the best co-op games on Steam bar none.  It's an experience best 'enjoyed' with another person and the amount of frustration adds up to a lot of hilarity and the eventual release of success is a huge payoff that you really do all feel together.  Really something.  A sequel came out recently, that looks fantastic as well, but even if you did play that, this game is still worth coming back to.			"

												I LOVE this game lol it's addictive and funny, just amazing. Challenging yet it's also hilarious watching your friends or randoms get frustrated ""dying"" in it lol. It has lots of gameplay and I can keep doing the same levels in online multiplayer without getting bored yet :) definitely worth a play!			"

												This is another game that there should really be a neutral button. It's not a bad game although it's not the best either. The soundtrack is really amazing. It sounds like something that would fit in an old school Mega Man game. However there are only a couple of tracks. Online play is just awful, the community is dead on arrival. The only way to play online with friends is if you host the game. It doesn't have Steamworks so it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to set up if you don't know how to host a game. Luckily you also have the option of local multiplayer up to 4 people. The gameplay is ok, it's one of those games like They Bleed Pixels or Super Meat Boy style games where one hit instantly kills you. It's boring by yourself but with friends it's loads of fun. It's an ok game. I can only recommend this game if you have friends willing to play. Another thing is this game for $10 is asking too much. Get it while it's on sale. Otherwise I give it a pass. 5/10Please note, don't use Hamachi! It's a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and is loaded with adware/malware. To host the game online just type in your IP address on your browser. The port number for this game is 6883.			"

												This game....To start with you will enjoy the hell out of it, finding it fun and challenging and a bit rageworthy when you die, but then as you progress it starts to slowly eat away at your diginity and your soul making you smash your keyboard everytime you die because you didn't notice that you were a few milimetres closer to a spinning blade of death than you thought. But in all seriousness this is a brilliant co-op game which breaks down the boundaries of friendships due to the ability to thwart your teammates progress by bouncing on their heads			"

												It was fun by myself but the game is ment to be played with friends. Unofrtunatley this game doesn't let you connect through steam or anything so you have to download other software to play with friends. However, even  that doesn't work so until this game can understand basic multiplayer then no thanks I would rather not play it.			"

												If you feel like you've been having a much too pleasent week, hop on this game and let the addiction slowly drive you into inevitable insanity. On a serious note, it's extremely addictive and is great to pass time. Was worth picking up, as it was on sale.It is NOT, however, worth the money, if it's NOT on sale. Why?Well, for one the multiplayer system is extremely flawed. To connect to a friend without getting connection errors one must either port forward or use hamachi, which for a steam game just isn't acceptable. And even then, there are constant time outs and if you're playing with three or more players one or two of them WILL lag out and spazz around the map, which is extremely disorienting and just plain annoying. Playing alone just isn't fun. So connecting these two points makes for a kind of mediocre game. Were they to fix the connection issues, however, then the game would be 100x more amazing and I'd definetely play and record some of this for my channel.I'd give it a 6/10.			"

												w0w.Just sent a mail to the devs with the picture: http://prntscr.com/5r6gxlFinally beat the game with a friend.Pros:- IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING HARD!- Gameplay is very sharp and precise; just what you'd expect from a good action platformer.- Tons of laughter and fun to be had if you play with a friend.- Beat a level? Such satisfaction, much scream, w0w.Cons- IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING HARD!- Some very strange bugs occur at times. Sometimes the game hiccups and the order of things gets messed up. A little unstable, in general.- If you want to beat the game, be ready to put in 15~ hours to it.- I wouldn't personally enjoy this game by myself on singleplayer. There's no story or characted development, it's pure action platforming.- The music gets a bit repetitious.- Playing with a friend is not co-op. Each player is trying not to step on the other's head, since that means death for the one being stepped on. So, it's more like two people are playing a single player game on the same level. But still fun, nonetheless.I think we died a total of 50k times during our 16 hours of gameplay. 7/10, would die again.			"

												Engaging, frustrating fun!It's a simple platformer where you have to get past the traps to the exit of the screen, similar to the Meat Boy franchise. You have endless lives and just throw yourself at the traps until you can get through. You can play up to 4 players on the same map, but there is little you can do to help each other. Instead, if one of you beats the level, you all advance to the next level together. So sometimes it can end up as a bit of a race rather than cooperation.Fun in short doses. Can be too frustrating if you play several hours in one sitting.			"

												At first, do not take the hours i spent for full, i played it with 3 other friends on an other account. So i was looking for a challenging game on Steam. The problem is that there is more crap than anywhere else. But i still kept looking and I finally found this. I already saw that a year ago on youtube but back then it wasnt on steam so i ignored it. Took me quite a long time to accept that the price was really high, but i took the risk. I have to say that the first world of the game is realy easy and you should not take it as a full reason to judge the game. But if you continue this game, it will kill you mentally. Seriously, world 5 and 6 destroyed us beyond our imagination. I see myself not as casual player and i still had some trouble in 5 and 6. There was one level in world 5 where we needed 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours to complete it. I personally think that you get a lot of good challenges for the relatively high price. If you are really looking for some good old classical♥♥♥♥♥♥ get. this. game.			"
