												i remember playing the original motherload back in the day and enjoying the heck out of it. i remember enjoying the progression of upgrading my little drillbot, the feeling of discovery and exploration, and the true fear i felt when i was low on fuel flying up to the surface.super motherload fails to entice me in any way, and it fails to build on what made the original motherload fun. i dont feel fear any more because when you run out of fuel you just move slower instead of dying. i dont enjoy upgrading my vehicle because the game stops you from doing so until you arbitrarily reach a new chunk of story (story which i also find really tedious and boring). and i dont get much joy from exploration in super motherload. everything is more or less the same, there arent any novelty ores to discover, there aren't many ancient artifacts or items to find (unless they are pertinant to the story, again, i dont care) and the puzzles are kind of bland and rudimentary.so what am i left with? well most of what i feel when i play super motherload is boredom. i just want to dig to the next area, increase my fuel tank because it's ALWAYS running out, get some OP combination of gems so i can... i dunno upgrade my fuel tank some more. there's no excitement, there's no surprises.i was looking forward to this game, i'm pretty dissapointed honestly.

												As one who have played the original flash game for more hours than I dare admit, naturally I have been hype for this game since I came across it when it first got on greenlight and was very excited when I saw it pop up on the steam front page.I was dissapointed, I got in the game and started digging, and the digging felt weigthless, the blocks just disappeared as with the old one you could see that you were digging through the blocks. And when I went to get upgrades there were no tooltips, no flavor text, only generic names and a set of boxes for each upgrade. It just felt empty.Also the world feels too bright, this might just be an effect of playing on a high resolution, but it kind of ruins the atmosphere  for me.Other than that, They did a good job with the music and the fact that you can co-op (even though it's only local right now) is sure to be a big plus if you happen to have someone to play it with.This saddens me, and I hope in the future they will do something to the game to make me want to give it another shot because it's such a good game and I know they can do better than this.

												I played the original Flash version of this when I was younger, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Because of that experience, I went into this game with high hopes. Sadly, the game does not meet those expectations. The digging feels weightless, blocks simply disappear with no animation. There are no novelty ores in the different layers of rock, the same ores are present through the entire game. Deeper levels become tedious as there are ever-increasing amounts of hazard blocks that require bombs to blow through, and it is no longer possible to freely mine your own path through the dirt. Upgrading the drillbot is not gratifying, many upgrades are gated by story progress, and there are no tooltips for most of the upgrades, making it impossible to see exactly how much you are improving. The voice acting is decent, but the story is not interesting in the slightest, and the final boss fight is uninspired, and requires a copious amount of bombs to defeat.			"

												(日本語レビューはしたのほう)I've played loads of Motherload since the original flash version, and been waiting for the release. I also backed it on KS(though it failed).I was sad by the early PS4 release and later PC release on this game, but it worthed a wait.You do the digging for resources, sell them and upgrade your digger. Deeper you go, richer resources found.It contains more puzzles than the original, requiring you to plan your routes, and use of bombs(Dynamite, TNT, Shaft Bomb, etc) for better profit and faster progress.If you dig resources in certain order(or combo), you get more profit. like ""Platinum + Iron"" = Rare Earth Magnet and is worth 2500, which is far more than those resources dug alone. These combos are unlocked with Smelter upgrades.Be careful with terrains(landing/hitting hard will damage you) and fuels to stay alive. on death you'll lose collected minerals on that run(on normal, Hardcore sounds like a permadeath but haven't tried yet).There are several characters and some unlockables have different stats than 4 main characters. Upgrades are saved on them except Radar upgrade which is tied to the world save. So, if you're stuck just go ""New Game"" with your previous character(You only lose radar upgrade but the world is renewed, so it won't be too hard to re-upgrade it).I know it's in Early Acecss, but there's stuttering problem on my computer. Particles and stuffs are not too optimized yet it seems.It has multiplayer, but LOCAL only. And the game is designed for local multiplayer(with shared screen and stuffs). If it really had online multiplayer, it would be instantly GOTY, <b>all the time</b> for me.9/10, -1 from performance issues and no online multiplayer. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.The Good:- Dig, Sell, Upgrade. simple and fun.- Still faithful to the original- Good controls(with Xbox360 pad).The Bad:- Performance problem- Radar could be bigger on singleplayer(or non-4 player games)-------------------------前作(2004年)Motherloadに凄くはまってた私は、この続編に凄く期待していたしKickstarterに寄付もしてた(失敗したが)。PS4版のリリースが先で、PC版がかなり後になるという話はうれしくなかったけど、待つ価値はあった。基本は「資源を採掘＞資源を売却＞その金でアップグレード」を繰り返し、火星の奥深くまで突き進んでいく。前作よりもパズルめいた地形が生成されることが多くなり、ルート構築(前作と同じく、上へ掘ることはできないし空中採掘もできない)や各種爆弾の使用を考える必要もある。資源を特定の組み合わせで掘ると、コンボとしてより高価な資源が手に入る(例：プラチナ+鉄=レアアースマグネット、2500の価値)。溶鉱炉(Smelter)をアップグレードすると使えるコンボの種類が増える。ダメージバランスは前作より厳しく、落下以外にも横方向や上方向に強くぶつかってもダメージを食らうので注意。ノーマルなら死んでも今持っている資源を失うだけですむが、ハードコアはワールドセーブが消されるのではないかと思われる。キャラクターは初期４人＋アンロック数人といて、アンロックキャラは初期とは異なるアップグレード上限と特殊能力を持っている。アップグレードはキャラクターごとに保存されるが、レーダーだけはワールドセーブに保存される。資源を採掘しつくすか詰んだ場合は「New Game」で前のキャラを使えば、レーダー以外のアップグレードはそのままでプレイできる(レーダーアップグレードもそこまで高くないので、すぐに買いなおせる)。早期アクセスだからバグやその辺は仕方ないかもしれないが、頻繁に動作が重くなる。その辺の改善を期待。マルチプレイヤーが目玉要素として挙げられてるが、ローカル限定なので注意。ゲームデザインもローカル前提なのでほぼ絶望的だが、オンラインマルチが実装されたら永年人に薦められそうな名作と評価してた。パフォーマンスとオンラインマルチ不可と言う点で減点して9/10。超オススメ。良いとこ:- 採掘・売却・アップグレード。わかりやすく楽しい。- 前作の雰囲気とスタイルそのまま。- 操作感良好(箱○パッドでプレイ)悪いとこ:- パフォーマンス問題- レーダーもう少し大きくして欲しかった			"

												Your adventure in Super Motherload begins as Employee 1001 - a miner working for the Solarus Corporation on Mars. Solarus is hungry for precious minerals, and it's your job retrieve them. Aided by Mister Fix-it (your AI partner), you descend deep into the planet's crust to find minerals to exchange for cash to upgrade your rig. Refueling, repairing, and buying upgrades are the main staples required to continue the descent into the unknown.The further you dig, the more you begin to learn about the secrets of Mars and the strange occurrences happening throughout the various Solarus bases. Excerpts of video logs and sound bytes come through occasionally throughout the dig, and as a result you’re sometimes left with a fetch quest. The interruptions are interesting but brief however, allowing more time to do what you do best: dig.Digging and refueling is a very simple gameplay mechanic, but despite the repetition the game is somewhat complex. Mostly, this is due to the fact that the deeper the dig, the more complicated the soil gets. For example, after hitting the third base I started to notice less open space and more metal plates blocking my path, forcing me to find a way around (or through) them to reach valuable gems.The game ramps up its presentation as well, with more and more complicated systems. At first, the Motherload starts off with a smattering of minerals such as “bronzium” and “goldium” which are fairly easy to obtain. Soon enough, the treasures become more valuable deeper into the descent, from rubies all the way to “unobtanium.” Eventually, upgrades can be bought to automatically “smelt” minerals together which make interesting combinations like “katana gold.” Smelting adds a bit more variety to the mining gameplay, allowing for the crafting of bombs and forcing players to think more carefully about the order in which they collect minerals.Gameplay isn't restricted to just ""digging"" though, as there are a number of different bombs that are made to blast through different types of elements, as well as some interestingly shaped bomb explosions to help navigate through barriers. For example, a “T” bomb will help blast the area directly above and one space to the left and right, creating said ""T"" shape. Some valuable minerals are trapped within rock or metal barriers that players must explode properly, without destroying the loot. I really enjoyed these short challenges but longed for a bit more complexity and variety as the same puzzles showed up over and over again.Despite the repetition in bomb puzzles, maps are randomly generated upon each new game making it so you’ll never play the same map twice. Characters also have a different set of upgrade levels and abilities, making gameplay a bit different depending on which character you choose. For example, the unlockable character Laika is a ghost dog who doesn’t take any hull damage, and another extra character, Demitri, has unlimited electron bombs.I also noticed that stations have different abilities and items for sale upon each new game - in one game I purchased an ability to turn magma into money but in another game I found the same station selling an ability that makes “ironium” turn into fuel. Some of the upgrades can feel like downgrades at first - like increasing the rotor speed is potentially dangerous as you can quickly damage your digger. However, once you get to the endgame these speed upgrades come in handy.About three quarters into the game though, I found a lack of plot movement and an increased difficulty in navigating around blockades. Even after purchasing all possible upgrades for my character it still took quite some time to get to the end and I was not prepared for what I had to do next. After spending hours digging through Mars, the endgame delved into new mechanisms that took me by surprise. However frustrating, I found it rewarding to complete it in the end.Local co-op is available, but to be honest I found it to be more stressful than playing alone. Players share a fuel tank, which means that fuel gets wasted a lot more easily so it’s a bit harder to progress. Everyone also shares a single screen - all players have to be in the same area for the game to function. If you leave your controller sitting for more than a few seconds, the game automatically removes your character from play. I can see how co-op could be fun with the right group of people, but I personally prefer the single-player experience.And what a fantastic experience it is, despite its flaws. Super Motherload is simple enough so that anyone can pick it up and play, but complex enough for mining veterans to keep coming back to fully upgrade characters or even risk playing in hardcore mode. The sci-fi ’80s vibe is delightful and the perfect setting for this ridiculously addicting game. I find myself coming back to it at the end of every day, ready for a new adventure underground.			"

												The Developer(s) behind this game have been great. A little after release, I found a minor problem/bug within the game. I asked if it could be fixed. Developer responds immediately and a patch is thrown up within an hour. I was absolutely amazed by that. Developer clearly puts in a lot of effort and I applaud that.In terms of gameplay there are other reviews out there and all I really can add: I enjoyed it, my father who is 30 years older than me enjoyed it, and It was really worth playing for a family game night.

												I played Motherload, the flash game on XGen's website years ago.  What kept me playing was the fact that I was making progress despite starting from the top again at times.  Digging into the earth, harvesting minerals, returning to the surface to sell, repair, refuel, and upgrade is the norm for the game.  For others it's tedious and mindless because it is just lather, rinse, and repeat.  For me, it kept me entertained when I had nothing to do.Super Motherload brought that formula and gave it an overhaul.  Everything was updated and upgraded.  There are even outposts to reduce many needs for a teleporter, which is commonplace for Motherload.  The basic mechanics were still there but there are no longer those pockets of gas that instantly destroy your pod.  Replacing it is magma and metal blocks which require certain explosives to do so.To be honest, this game felt a little shorter than Motherload.  However, the reason Motherload was longer is likely the lack of those outposts and the gas pockets.tl:dr This game isn't for people who like tedium, like Minecraft and Terraria.  For the others, I'd recommend checking it out.			"

If not for this, I would reccomend, otherwise, don't waste your money.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. Unfortunately super Motherload simply lacks the charm and emotion of the original flash game. It just doesn't elicit the same response. Before I get to the negatives I have to say I quite like the aesthetic of the game... Mostly. There are still some aspects of its style that I'm not too keen on, but it can pass. Now what really pisses me off is death. It never bloody happens! When I remember playing the original I remember getting so aggravated because I didn't keep track of how much fuel I had left and blew up half way to the surface. This doesn't happen here. You just can't drill, and because of that you don't even have to keep track of your fuel. And that was part of the fun of Motherload, getting a good way into the game and stupidly killing yourself after going thousands of feet down, losing all of the stuff you managed to collect because you stupidly forgot to save. You don't get that here. My other problem is with the upgrades. Simply put, they're absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥and completely soulless. Part of the fun  of Motherload was having to save up to buy the energy shield hull that you've been eyeing up through half of the game of the jag engine, or whatever. But you don't have that in super Motherload, just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing upgrade bars. No pictures or dumb names, it's boring and far too serious. Probably the thing I miss the most about the original was the feeling of depth. Every time you needed to refuel or buy upgrades you had to go to the surface and to drop down you had to have dug a path this meant falling thousands of meters and seeing through all the colourful layers, it was awesome, and that sense of depth just can't be felt in super Motherload because of all the bloody bases. Maybe as a standalone title, I could have a more fair review, but as a fan of the original flash game I just can't recomend this.			"

												TLDR: If you're looking for a good mining game like this but done right, check out a game called ""Dig It"" on the apple store.As for this game, I'm not sure what's ""super"" about this other than the graphics when you compare them to the oeiginal game. 1. As you get to the bottom you'll find it almost impossible to get minerals without spending more money on bombs than what the minerals you mine are worth. 2. The further I got to the bottom the more my game crashed. Quite annoying considering the time it takes to exhaust cargo and fuel is about 30 mins at the point where I rage quit this game.3. 6 million dollars for the ability to detonate bombs in mid air? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing high? Thats a basic requirement to get a lot of the minerals.4. The minerals are boring. After 1.5 hours play you won't see any new minerals - just annoying yellow and black boxes which you can't punch through.5. The story is meh. Didn't have the interest to get to the end. In fact, from as far as I saw it just looks like a copy of the original game.As a real fan of the original game I am very disappointed. This was nowhere near cheap for a game of such poor quality.

												Won't play properly in fullscreen for me? Text is illegible.  Fun (for awhile) but not much to it: Drill for resources. There's no enemies, there's not much in the way of being a puzzle game. Just work. Drill, drill, drill. The story and art is good but there's not enough there - I wish there was shorter level areas, why not endless computer generated levels? Spend SO much time just going back and dropping off your mined goods to your base. (bases are few and far between) Game is short as I bought this yesterday and I'm at the end. The game is slow and peaceful all the way until the very end where it then turns into a race/battle game? I dunno...  :(			"

												This game is truly addicting.A game that is truly addicting is a rarity. Smotherload uses textbook skinner box incremental numbers to keep you playing, but it does it so well and so flawlessly that you barely notice. For once, making those numbers go up is truly fun. It's FUN.Too bad it only has a lifespan of about 2 hours, and very little replay value.Motherload is a pseudo-rogue-like game where you dig down down down and collect ores ores ores in a randomized crust of minerals on Mars. Sell the ores, upgrade your miner, mine more ores, sell more ores, upgrade more parts untill youre strong enough to dig to the core and uncover a conspiracy. It's great, incremental gameplay with a solid ending.The game plays like butter, which is strange because there is not really any call for tight controls in this game (apart from the pitiful boss fight). The game is all about thinking laterally and not getting greedy. In the original motherload the entire point of the game was not to get greedy, because there is SO much ore to collect that it blinds you to your health and fuel reserves. So many gems and minerals... calling for you. You can spare the fuel to go get that last ruby right? No, wrong. Stop it.The game expands it's lifespan via randomly generated puzzles that spawn under the surface, you have to think long and hard about how to get the valuable gems without blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and causing them to be unattainable forever, it's rewarding gameplay and a good player can use them to help speed up the grind. Unfortunately the game hits a wall only 1 hour into gameplay. After the first hour of solid fun, the game turned into a long, wet fart as I grinded ores to upgrade my miner to get to the bottom, at which one of the stupidest boss fights was waiting for me.If you played the original motherload you'll want to get this. There are no longer random deaths from gas pockets, running out of fuel doesnt make you explode anymore (seriously what was even with that?) and it's a lot harder to die. These changes go together to make a much better feeling game... it also kind of took away the challenge, somewhat. The game is not very hard. I'm glad the changes were made, but not enough was added to make the game's difficulty curve up.At the end of the day though, I was enamored by this game, it's short and♥♥♥♥♥♥in spots, but the gameplay, the story and even the graphics are wonderful. If it were any longer it would be in danger of being far too grindy. I'm sure this game could have been far better, but as it stands, it is still a fantastic way to waste an afternoon.11/10 would drill again. "

												I have not died once playing this game so far.the graphics, music and overall presentation is actually stunning, and the controls are really smooth and nice, but it all falls apart on one single mistake; when you're out of fuel, nothing happens. In the original web browser game, an empty fuel tank resulted in death, which meant that going deeper to find more valuable resources was riskier, but more rewarding for the player. Now, all that happens is that your spaceship/drilling machine just goes a bit slower than usual and you cant mine anymore until you fill your tank again. You could die from taking to much damage by slamming to hard into the walls, but even that suffers from this puzzling game designing choice. In the original game, an almost empty tank meant time pressure, which resulted in that you had to get faster to the surface in order to not die, while still managing to not kill yourself my slamming into walls as you go faster. Here, that element is completely gone! You can take all the time you want in the world to be as careful as you like, which make everything a slow paced uninteresting grindfest. Its truly sad, that this one little mistake of leaving this mechanic out just completely breaks an otherwise fantastic remake of the original. As ive already said the graphics are awesome, and hints to a soviet union space rocket type of style and the warm red against the cold green are excellent use of color palette. The soundtrack is also really nice and marries the estethics and story into a great feeling game. I highly suggest that the developers release an update where the empty-tank-death mechanic has been reimplemented, as i see here that im not the only one complaining about it. Couldnt be to hard to do could it?			"

												It starts out being a fun way to grind -- dig up materials, go back to the top, sell those materials for cash, repeat -- but it becomes too much of a grind. It takes too much time and is a hassle to have to go back to the stations. I'm not sure how they'd change that in a future version of the game, but otherwise, it's fun.I'd also imagine co-op to be insane, but in single-player, it's tedious; and the skeleton-like story isn't enough to motivate me to deal with that.

												A 3/5 for this one I think.I was a big fan of Motherload back in 'the day', and this version brought around some refreshing nostalgia of digging holes and turning in ores. A few new features peaked my interest, and I managed to get through to the ending within a couple of sessions.Up sides were that the game seemed pretty polished, and I feel I missed out by only playing solo. The story had me interested as I delved deeper, intrigued to see how it developed. As a resources hoarder in other similar games, I was given ample ability to hoard and upgrade to my heart's content.The downside however was that 'developed' seems to be a word that was a little lacking in the game as a whole. The ending seemed half baked, and I couldn't help but feel like the interesting item combining system basically devolved into a much simpler mechanic than it could have been. I didn't feel that mentally exercised by it, and my early hopes were left feeling a bit flat.Overall, if you enjoyed Motherload as a casual time killer, this will probably give you the nostalgia you're hoping for. Otherwise however, don't expect to get much more than an afternoon or two out of this before it joins your other 'I'll play this if I'm bored' titles in your steam library.Also, being totally petty... I kinda miss the different names for upgrades (ruby drill, diamond drill etc), this version having a 'it's this many levels good at digging' alternative.			"

												Great game!I feel its even better than the original however, like almost anything, there are downsides.The multiplayer is local co-op, no option. Thats not too bad, plenty of games function fine local like Magicka and Gauntlet. I feel Super Motherload behaves the same in that aspect, especially with controllers (Plays best with gamepad, Comrade!). The game also seems to lack in content to me but thats remedied by the high replay value. Honestly, thats the only real downside I see and I feel they can easily make it online multiplayer and may even be planning on it.Many complain about the game being too easy and actively ignore hardcore mode or complain about the storyline and how its different from the original. Of course it is, they don't want it to get stale.The graphics are improved of course and I LOVE how it has clever little puzzles that you can solve with different bombs. Nothing feels better that getting a Universe Chain of unobtainium.My brother liked the smelter, I didn't care for it too much.The transmission cutscenes are fully voiced and I absolutely loved that.Honestly, this is one of those games where if you like this type of game but you don't like Super Motherload, its your own damn fault. Many complain about broken textures or black screen and say the GAME is bad for that. Don't listen to them.Great game, great music, great graphics, great replay value, can't really ask for more in a game.BONUS: It comes WITH the original Motherload Goldium edition as well for the nostalgia. Cool.			"

												Simple, addicting time waster with a lovely atmosphere.I could sit around and dig for minerals for hours.Digging/Mineral Gathering game done well before it was recently popularized by games like Minecraft and Terraria.A reboot I've been wishing for for a long time.The soundtrack is proper good, too. Something I didn't expect going in.This is incredibly nostalgic to me, taking me back to days of school computers and free flash games on sites such as Miniclip, Armor Games and the likes.It's more of the same, so if you liked Motherload you will definitely love this.Thank you so much for bringing this game back, XGen Studios.

												In this game, you play as a mining robot. Your goal is to get as far underground as possible. But to achieve that, you have to dig up ores, sell them, and upgrade your mining robot.As simple as this game sounds, it's really hard. There are two bars you have to watch: Your 'Hull' and your 'Fuel'. Your fuel goes down as you move your robot around and díg ores. It goes empty EXTREMELY FAST at first, so you have to watch and upgrade it. The hull of your robot is weak at first: One single bump and it explodes. Same goes for the fuel tank: If it's empty, your robot just explodes and it's ""GAME OVER"".I used to play this game back in the day as a 12-year-old and was so glad to see it again on Steam. Go get it!P.S.: Play the Goldium Edition.			"

												2D dig 'em up where you mine minerals for cash. This game is a lot like SteamWorld Dig except this game's platforming and story is little less interesting.  I recommend you use a gamepad but they aren't necessary. It seems that you can do 4 player local although I haven't tried. Recommended when on sale.			"

												A very fun and enjoyable upgraded version of the original 2D flash game. This game is nothing like Minecraft, it feels a lot more like SteamWorld Dig. You just dig, deeper and deeper, farming money to pay for fuel and upgrades, wondering what you're gonna find under your feet. It's never boring because you always find something to try and before you realize you have done every possible achievement.			"

												years ago i was hooked on the original flash version, so naturally when i saw this i thought ""what could go wrong"" and i purchased it, and well...... there was nothing to go wrong..... almost literally, no fear for earthquakes collapsing your tunnels, no fear for low fuel, no mystery in the background story, just a long and safe grind to get to the next underground station.i did like the addition of the bombs and the multi player, plus the better graphics, but to be honest this game is a lot less exciting, and dark than the original.

												Excellent little local co-op game!Me and a friend just spent 3-4 hours drilling to the core of Mars! Really enjoyed the whole thing, at the moment the game is in alpha for PC, there are only a few installation/launch issues and I was disappointed I couldn't use my PS3 controllers to play with. Once I got it working, I plugged a monitor into my laptop and we played side by side with two keyboards with little to no issues! The original motherload game was wicked - can be found on Miniclip - but this is far superior! More upgrades, co-op gameplay is unbeatable, unlockable characters and in game puzzles to make your brain work! 10/10			"

												Did you like the original Flash version of Motherload? Me too.Now picture a more streamlined version of that game, minus the redundant menus for simple tasks like refueling and selling your minerals. It has local 4-player co-op, some new puzzle elements that showcase a new, wide variety of explosive types, multiple endings and a more involved scoring system - All while still managing to maintain what made Motherload so fun in the first place.It sounds good because it is. It's a well crafted love letter to the original, staying extremely faithful to the first game, and is oozing with love, care, and personality from the devs.It's worth your time and money.			"

It's one of those games with simple mechanics, very intuitive, well designed that just gets the player in that ""zone"" were time flies in an instant.The ""story"" fits well in the gameplay, and it manages to be engaging without being too pervasive.Definitely recommend!

												This game and amazing and has a worthy price. It shows once again how great Xgen is.    How the game ImprovesThe game improves in numerous ways besides removing death from running out of fuel. (Still on of the best improvements) The new smelter and combo feature just made the game feel more fun. Now instead of just digging up random minerals, It makes you want to dig up minerals in a certain order, as well has harvest chains of minerals. Speaking of which, the ground isn't exactly random anymore. Now you can somtimes find caverns, whole motherloads of resources, tunnels making different shapes, and puzzles. Yes, there are now puzzles. You can sometimes find special areas with valuable resources that are blocked by a puzzle, which you must solve by bombing it a certain way. This made the game have much more to it then just digging. But you can't just carelessly bomb the puzzle to get to the center. Instead you get more bomb types. Bombs can also be made underground while mining. The world feels much deeper than the last game. To solve this there are now underground stations to make mining easier. No more long trips back to the surface!     Story:Im not supprised that the story is much better because they hired a proffesional comic book writer to do their story. Still, it is fantastic! Much better than having a boss who's name is satan when spelled backwards. LIke the last game you are sent to Mars. This time you are working for the Solaris corporation in an alternate cold war era as the minerals have almost run out on Earth. Within the first year of business, connection with Earth was lost after it was sabatoged by rouge miners. The story progresses as you dig deeper with fully voice acted transmissions. I can't say much from here because I don't want to spoil it.     Graphics:Don't be turned off at the fact that this game is 2d. The artwork is beautiful and full of color. Also at 1080p and at 60 fps! Also, Mars is actually red this time!    Anything bad? There aren't to many issues. There arent really any that get in the way of gameplay. First I felt that it was confusing to try and start new games and switch characters but mabye that was just me. Second, I had issue's with the key configurations. I wanted to swith movement to WASD. Everytime when I would open the game again, the keys would'nt save. It was a bit annoying to keep switching everytime I would start. When It comes to the game, I just felt like the game progressed a bit to fast. I also felt some upgrades were insanely expensive. But thats pretty much it.   Final thoughts.Xgen did a very good job at the sequel. It improves in so many ways and has so much more meaning. It's very well suiting for their console launch.

												For those who have played the original Motherload, I can assure Super Motherload outdoes it. With adding chains, combos, special items such as turning magma into cold-hard cash, and unlockable characters(The first four share the same unlocks, the locked characters have things like take no hull damage), there's more to do in Super Motherload. It also doesn't have some of the bugs that plagued even the Goldium Edition(I vibrated off into unmined territory. While hilarious, it was confusing also).Super Motherload still keeps core what Motherload established. It's a puzzle digging game where you get copious amounts of cash for digging. It feels almost exactly like the old one, with the addition of looking pretty and having a solid soundtrack. Althoguh the game on the normal difficulty is a lot easier than the original game, the Hardcore difficulty is...actually difficult. God save you if you explode three layers in the setiment and then have to select a new character(THE MAP DOESN'T REGENERATE ORES because you gotta man up sometimes).If you're a fan of the old Motherload, it's totally worth the asking price. This is keeping in mind that I never was able to co-op with anyone also, since it IS local co-op only. That is the only fault with this one, really. And maybe that the difficulty ranges from baby to death.			"

												Super Motherload is very underwhelming.First off; I really liked to original back in the day, and while this game has some advantages in that the visuals are much better than the original, it also does a lot of things worse. First of all the start of the game is rather overwhelming in that there's so many blocks at once, which of many can't be destroyed which is very annoying (in a larger extent than the original). Furthermore  the upgrade screen is a major downstep as you can't skip upgrades or see the numbers to an upgrade (I want to know how many litres different tanks hold, how fast different drill speeds are etc). There's also no way (at least I found none) to open your inventory to overlook what you're carrying and also to drop certain ores. You take much more damage from crashing in Super Motherload than in the original, and it really is annoying to have to micromanage every foot you travel, both going down AND up.There are some quests and the first half of the game is decent gameplay this way, although the Quest-boxes being invulnerable initially (as in before you knew what they were) was yet another confusing element. As you approach the end game you come to the realization that there really aren't many high end resources available as you'd expect when you go really deep, and even to the end the world is dominated by mid-tier resources.And then you decide to go all the way down there anyways despite being unable to farm enough to max out all your upgrades. You have no idea what the boss is going to do and perhaps die a few times (it will one-shot you in phase 2 as well). You respawn at the station, which means you're in for 5 minutes or so of really boring travel just to have another go at it.In sumary, the game it really does feel underwhelming in terms of content, as the asking price is 14.99€. The quests were decent, but there's only three of them! The game should definitely be at least twice as long. There defeinitely could be much more imaginative upgrades available late game; being able to drill through different kinds of previously invulnerable materials for example. There should be more kinds of ores and generic (fuel, drill speed etc) upgrades available.At least you don't have to deal with the earthquakes from the original in this one, but the original still reigns supreme by far in comparison because of the reasons above, and because it's free.

												It would be an amazing game with a few shortcomings... if it weren't supposed to be the successor to flash Motherload.The Good:- Played like Motherload. (Check it out. It still is an amazing game.)- Brilliant artstyle. The game looks beautifu in almost every way possible.The Bad:- Local only coop. I get it. But wouldn't it make multiplayer so much more viable if it wasn't local?- Pacing. The original Motherload played like this game on Hardcore. However, the added mechanics took away the fun on Hardcore and the pacing on Softcore just doesn't feel fun. The catch 22 is: There is no intensity in Softcore, but the intensity in Hardcore comes with the absence of sense of progression.Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I still see Motherload with tinted glass. Playing the gold version of flash Motherload (which you get from this purchase) does feel nostalgic, but also tired.Get this if you miss Motherload. Don't get it if you aren't prepared for disappointment. /endrant			"

I highly enjoy the game.If you are weary about purchasing the game, go to xGen Studios' website and play the original. If you end up liking it, then you'll love this even more. Super Motherload has the core mechanics of the original with some new features including somewhat of an objective system, improved fuel and repair systems, and an AMAZING soundtrack.REMINDER: At the moment of posting, the only multiplayer for the game is a LOCAL Co-Op and cannot be played online. This may change later but for now, don't purchase it expecting to play with online friends.			"

												It's like a big ol' bag of potato chips- looks appealing on the shelf, easy enough to tear into, big enough to share with a few mates, possesses about as much depth as a bag of chips has nutritive value. You'll get the same flavor every time you open the bag, and (with a little bit of guilt) you can finish the whole thing in one sitting if you're inclined. The storyline is a blurb on the side, a little bit of flair on the packaging, but really doesn't affect how the chips taste.I don't recommend Super Motherload because I can't fathom spending fifteen bucks on a bag of chips. I got my copy for three bucks out of an indie game bundle and thoroughly enjoyed downing the whole thing in one evening. Grab it if it's like 80% off or you find it in a bundle.			"

												The game at first seems interesting, and has addicting aspects, but its very shallow. This game plays like a mobile game. You just grind and perform the exact same reptitive task for incremental bonuses and go back to doing the same thing. All you do is mine or, block up blocks, then get upgrades for mining more ore. You find new materials that make more, but then everything costs exponentially more so it doesn't really matter. Was basically doing the same thing after 3 hours that I was from the first 30 min. There's a little bit of story but its under so much grinding it doesn't even seem worth it. You have to find random items hidden around big carbon copy areas. There was 1 that the item had unbreakable boxes above and I accidentally blew out things under it so was unable to get to it, which basically means it was game breaking.

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/super-motherload-first-impressions/Super Motherload certainly nails the progression aspect of its gameplay. Progressing in the game is very satisfying and the game itself is very fun.The addition of local co-op was fantastic. Being able to dig twice as fast and all. This is only local, however. Online multiplayer, especially in this day and age, is a must. If you’re going to include local, online should be included as well. Although I do appreciate the addition of local co-op (very few games seem to have it these days), it’s unacceptable to ship a game with only that.The gameplay itself is very good, mostly due to the immense amount of focus placed on your progression through the game. It became rather addicting, wanting to upgrade that little cart with everything available, and that’s a good thing. Aside from the game’s progression, the gameplay is very simple. Just dig in the ground for ores and other goodies (like fossils!) to get money and upgrade your cart with that money. You’re also able to purchase explosives and other fun tools to help you dig further.Overall, Super Motherload is a fantastic game. With its great sense of progression, simple gameplay, and charming graphics, it definitely earns my recommendation.			"

This game lives up to its predecessor, and even if it is quite repetetive, the great soundtrack, artwork & storyline completely make up for it. I recommend this game to absolutely anyone. As a side note, I recommend oldschool players of Motherload to take the Hardcore mode of the game, since that is how it was originally supposed to be played.			"

												There's a genre of games where the point is to dig up stuff, sell stuff, buy upgrades, and dig up more stuff.  Not sure if it started with Motherload, and there are quite a few games with very similar concepts - but Super Motherload is the best of the lot.  It's a great timesink, and I've got almost 34 hours on it, have played it through several times, and it was well worth the price of admission.  Sequel please!			"

												I've spent hundreds of hours playing the original Motherload Goldium. I bought a stop watch just for the game since the only real fun for me is trying to beat my best time digging to the bottom.  The reason I play is because it's something mindless to do when I want to relax. The new Super Motherload is way too complicated. I hate taking damage when I'm trying to climb and trying to race to the bottom is an exercise in frustration.  The new Motherload sucks.			"

												The only appealing quality of this title is its soundtrack. The retro-future space-russian-whatever character aesthetics, the barely-existing joke-of-a storyline and repetitive, improperly explained gameplay mechanics do not really help. There are far better digging titles out there (e.g. SteamWorld Dig) and even some free flash games.			"

												To all original motherload fans who are scared of trying this because of the negative reviews of other fans, please try it because:- First of all, it has a hardcore version, which means out of fuel/armor = permadeath. It makes digging even more thrilling even with the substations. Also damage is more realistic: in the original motherload momentum dammage could only be done by falling. In this game you can dammage your pod by flying too hard in any direction.- It also has a casual mode (= normal mode) which is fun to do with some other players.- It has the original motherload goldium.- It has a puzzle factor by adding various types of bombs.

												I felt like in old times, when I was playing first Motherload game as flash game, when I started to play Super Motherload. It probably have almost everything you could expect from new Motherload game. Starts really fun, and continue to be so until very end. Sure, maybe when you are comparing it to old Motherload, it doesn't shine this much. There also are some bug in game which will either froze your game totally, without any way to fix it, or it will drop fps to really low number. Maybe there is really low chance to encounter this problem at begin on game, but at the end it's really annoying - it took me 3 times just to finish game for the first time. Despite all of this, it's really worth to give it a try, and if you won't become fan of Super Motherload then there is a good news - this game comes with old version of Motherload, so if you are fan of this game alone, then you won't regret buying it.

												Well, XGen did outstanding job there. Game hooks player up easily, soundtrack helps with that alot. It's great and fits the game nicely. Mechanics work well and are greately improved in comparison with original online Motherload. Little random generated puzzles, underground bases are really nice addition.Couch co-op is really nice as well, as it's always more fun when you can play with your friends and be able to punch them when they die with full cargo of gems.All in all Super Motherload feels complete, it have everything that should be in it, spirit of original is strong, I'm unable to point out any issues with it. Basically, great game, go for it if you have some money!			"

												Quick review based on my current progress (~2:30hours), and my opinions. I haven't tried multiplayer.Pros:-Like the original, but better. The feeling I recall seems to be there.-Good 2D Graphics. Not demanding, an integrated gpu should do well.-Bugfree so far.-It comes with the gold edition of the original flash game! (there's a free version and this is the otherwise paid one)Cons:-Flying upwards back to base seems a bit twearky for me, as I take quite some-Upgrades & items do not have icons like the original did.-Some underground structures and formations seem too artificial and out of place. I prefer the more ""natural"" underground.-Random explosive gas pockets are gone. (I liked the danger they brought)-When flying (up) back to base, I often have a hard time no taking hull damage...-Overpriced (I say this about most games though)Conclusion:I would recomend you try the original flash game first (which is free) (just search for ""motherload flash game""). If you like it, chances are you will like the new one.Notes-I'm looking foreward to try ""hardcore"" mode, since on normal, running out of fuel is not a problem			"

												A great sequal to the original online version of the game. A lot of things have been updated, like the  general UI and graphics. The local multiplayer can be a big plus for some people (very fun, but it gets a bit too crowded if there's 4 people playing on a single keyboard, imo). Upgrading has been changed (no more images for the different parts, something I enjoyed in the original game). There's the general bug or two encountered (this was written during Early Access), so the controls can get annoying sometimes.Overall, this is a great continuation of the beloved mining game that was online.

												Super motherload is absolutely one of my favorite games. I played the flash version of motherload when i was younger, and this is all that and more. More varieties of bombs, fun puzzles to solve, and an intriguing storyline make this a game that you can really get into. I have not tried the co-op multiplayer, but i have heard it is great, and that having 4 players adds to the experience. My only complaint is that it does not currently have an online multiplayer mode, but who knows, its still early access. I am greatly addicted to this game, and i hope to see an online multiplayer in the future :)			"

This may be in Early Access, but as long as you only want to play local multiplayer/singleplayer, it's worth a buy right now.  I hear they are going to have online multiplayer soon, and i'm super excited for that. 8/10			"

												overall a great game. if you liked the original motherload you will enjoy this game. at first i had a few problems starting the game, getting the error Super Motherload has stopped working, but if you change from open GL to direct 3d it will work. As for game play they have added a many new things but i would still like to see an online multiplayer(currently only local). the story is very fun so far and cant wait to see what happens. have fun!

												A mildly more interesting version of SteamWorld Dig, but everything I said about SWD still applies here. So I'll just c/p my review for it.---The best word to sum up SteamWorld Dig is ""transparent"".The game loop consists entirely of going into the mine, collecting ore, going back up, selling it, buying +1 to your pick, and repeating. It is an extremely mindless and unchallenging way to spend 3 hours. It's not fun or interesting at any point.I get it. All games require some sort of loop to keep you playing it and keeping the feel consistent. But SteamWorld is, as I said, completely transparent. Nothing exciting or shocking happens, there are no interesting puzzles to solve, challenging monsters to battle, or interesting characters to talk to. There's nowhere to explore, and nowhere to go but deeper into the mine, where the gems are a new color and the numbers are bigger. If, like me, you play this game to the end, you will hate it and yourself all the way through for being so obviously manipulated into dull, glassy-eyed complacency by a skinner box's ""reward"" of a bigger number next to your mining pick. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it - and if you have bought it, just say no. Life's too short for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. "

												Disclaimer: Reviewed using press copy provided by developerI like this. A lot. It's like they took Motherload, and made it super. I hope this is updated often, I'm definitely enjoying it more than I anticipated! The game is very simple and has a solid art style, for the most part it feels solid and extremely high quality. Some things are either broken or I'm not understanding (blue science cubes not breaking? not sure what to do about them, apparently nothing). The feeling of Motherload is still there and doesn't miss a beat, this expands on the concept and takes it much further than I expected. I like ittt. Definitely recommended if you were into Motherload, this is not a disappointment.If you haven't played the original 'Motherload' browser game, it's free and basically the same concept. One of the greatest flash games of the generation if you like hottness. http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/motherload "

I realy like this type of games (collect and deliver ressources to level up and go deeper). This game does the same and you can upgrade your vehicle to have more fuel or a better hull. You can play this game in Coop too which should deliver many fun :)So if you like this type of games than there is no reason to do not try this one! :)Above is a video from me about the first minutes of the game so you can see some ingame experience			"

Planning is key to survival as you purchase better equipment in your quest for the motherload.Also as a bonus, it comes with the orginal Motherload game.			"

												Set on Mars in an alternate Cold-War era, Super Motherload is a 1 to 4-player couch co-op digging adventure with storyline by Image Comics' Kurtis Wiebe, a fully voiced cast of Soviet and American characters, and a procedurally-generated world that changes each time you play.

												As far as PC couch Co-Op games go, this is a great one in my opinion. Super Motherload is the sequel to Motherload, a flash browser game made in the early 2000's. Though there has been minor refinement to some of the original title's systems, the gameplay at the core of Super Motherload is largely the same. You're the pilot of an underground/aireal digging machine and you've been tasked to aid the Solaris Corporation in excavating the planet Mars for precious metals, gemstones, and other rarities. The sequel has allowed for up to 4 players on screen simultaneously, and the result is a much more chaotic session of play. The soundtrack is lovely, having an industrial techno feel to it. The story is interesting as it deals with something many people today deal with themselves; corporate greed, and how it leads to ruin. There are multiple characters, even some hidden unlockable characters to discover. There are two modes in Super Motherload as well: Normal and Hardcore mode. Fans of the original flash game will find all the challenge they've become accustomed to in Hardcore mode, where your ship will immediately explode in a firey deathstorm, should your fuel ever reach 0.My girlfriend and I love to kick back after an exciting day and chill out underground with Super Motherload.8/10 would dig again.

So I loaded it up again and was greeted by a save with the first character in the list which I did NOT choose. When I loaded it up my map was completely correct and I had all my drill upgrades/radar upgrades - but my money was gone, my bombs were gone and all the other upgrades were gone as well.

It's got everything from the old Motherload that I absolutely adored, but lots of cool new mechanics and needless to say lots more things to explore and uncover. The occasional lore-based communications that you recieve can actually be creepy and intriguing.Overall I'd say this is a great game, that I'm definately going to be playing a lot of. The £11.99 price tag does seem quite high for the type of game that this is, but personally for me it's far worth it. Love it.			"

												I spent a massive chunk of my childhood on the original flash-based version of this game, it was super fun and you become enveloped in the entire game. Like many people, I highly anticipated this game, hoping it was better in every way. Unfortunately I feel this was not the case. They've missed alot of key points that made the original motherload so fun, process of upgrading your drill bot and buying consumables are very dull and automated. The mining itself has become more of a puzzle game, you use a variety of bombs to get to very awkwardly placed ores. The joy in finding rare ores in the original game is not present in the newer version, pretty much everything is abundant. Besides that, the game has a very intriguing atmosphere that is really fun, the artwork and music are really well done as well. One thing that Super Motherload also does really well is the storyline, it's interesting and ties the whole game together well.The game is still in Beta, and besides a few rough spots it is still a decent game worth the money.

Be prepared for a lot of farming upgrades/strategic tunnelling and generally 'working for your rewards' - esp once you've beyond the final 'base'.Note: You get the original Motherload to play too - not as pretty but perhaps more playable?

												Keep in mind I didn't play very deep into this game; it didn't grab me at all, so maybe some of my critiques become invalid further into the game.Motherload's main mechanic really isn't all that terribly interesting -  it's not *bad*, but it's not good enough to hold up the experience on its own. The original Motherload held it up with the character progression elements and the story, such as it was anyway. The need to upgrade your capsule kept you mining, and the curiousity as to just what the heck is going on keeps you interested.Super Motherload doesn't have that. The character progression is there, but it doesn't feel as satisfying; it's too fast, too easy, and upgrading your engine or your drill no longer feels like an accomplishment, nor does it feel satisfying when you actually get the upgrades. In the original each and every upgrade made you feel like you were riding a substantially more powerful mining machine, digging twice as fast or staying under twice as long - but in Super Motherload I'm not sure what the effects of the upgrades even are!  I honestly think the UI streamlining detracted from the experience; in the original, going through the motions of refueling, repairing, restocking, and finally checking the upgrade vendor to see what you can afford made returning from the pit each time feel a little bit refreshing, a ""yes! I made it!"" experience and a breath before you go back to the main gameplay - which is, after all, literally nothing but grinding (well, drilling, but that's close enough). In Super Motherload you literally just swing past the dropoff, fuel, and repair vendors and then it's right back into the pit with you, feeling less like an accomplishment and a break from grinding and more like a pointless ""do you wish to not lose the game"" prompt that comes up every five minutes. The fact that the resource indicators are less obvious and harder to read, and there's no audiovisual cue that you're about to run out of fuel doesn't help either.The story in the original definitely isn't going to win any Pulitzers, but it was simple, clear, and served its purpose. You're a miner on Mars. You dig for a bit, your boss occasionally congratulating you on your successes, and then you pick up a transmission from another miner just like yourself, except he's trapped deep underground, and there's something there with him... followed by your boss telling you that it was probably just a radio glitch. Things progress pretty predictably from there (did I mention your boss's name is ""Natas""? Yeah...), but it's an interesting enough mystery to keep you engaged, and there's a clear situation (you're a miner on mars and your employer is Up To Something) and a clear goal (find out what he's Up To, or else you might well be next!).Super Motherload may have that eventually, but not in the amount I played. Instead you first get a few minutes of a robot literally just text-dumping you the game's instructions (which can never be called up again, of course) and then as you dig you intercept a message from some underground base that their life support has been sabotaged, demanding your employer send help. Maybe I screwed up or something but there doesn't seem to be a way to get to them and help them - the message is literally pointless to you. And then you get a call from another base telling you ""base xyz isn't a ___, it's a laboratory, they're experimenting on us!"" ""They"" is presumably the company you work for but... so? The player character can't do anything about it, no-one's asking them to do anything, and there's really no mystery; the company is doing evil♥♥♥♥♥♥ okay, yeah, so what do I do? Apparently nothing. So the story is more annoying than compelling.I wanted to like this game; had good memories of the original. But the new additions add nothing of value and ultimately, all the good parts are the ones copied over from the original Motherload, except oftentimes not even as good. Super Motherload has little to no redeeming value; go play the original, it's better and it's free, or indeed any of XGen's old Flash games. "

												At first, the game is a lot of fun. You dig around, collect stuff, upgrade. About exactly what you'd expect. Unfortunately, the upgrades in the game are underwhelming...especially the fuel upgrade. It seemed to me that no matter how many upgrades I got, I was still rnning out of a fuel in frustrating moments. There was a ton of backtracking, especially near the end. The plot buildup to the last boss was constantly interrupted by having to backtrack...and if you lose to the boss you have to backtrack the whole way down again. Frustrating.			"

												I played the original motherload ages back when I was a lil' lad back on Miniclip, it took me years to find out there was an actual ending and the story griped me more and more as I eventually came across hell itself and an unexpected boss battle.Super motherload is a lovely sequal and it feels if like there is so much more added such as the ability to make alloys, more interesting upgrade scheme, 'quests', etc. Slightly different story but completely different vibe (not finished yet as of the posting of this review, but I'm getting close!). I love seeing all the things it has in common with the older game, but also all the new stuff! Played motherload and thinking of buying super motherload? Go for it!Never played it and wounder if this game is worth it? well personally I think it's unique. So this isn't going to be some game you probably felt like you played already unless that earlier game was motherload itself.			"

												This game is like a book you absolutely love, and then the final chapter annoys so much you feel a little cheated and no longer know if you can recommend it.To give this context, I was playing the game on ""normal"" difficulty and it was a very relaxed, zen like experience to mine ever downwards, always looking for good paterns to maximize my profits. There were no enemies, just ore to drill and a martian mystery deep below. 6 hours of gameplay bliss.  Then I reached the final part of the game.  Without spoilers I will just say the gameplay changed entirely, and suddenly everything was very immediate, very stressful, very reflex orienated.I died.  Then again.  Then again.  I grew weary of Super Motherload.  I was no longer enjoying it.  Time to leave.			"

												Keep in mind I didn't play very deep into this game; it didn't grab me at all, so maybe some of my critiques become invalid further into the game.Motherload's main mechanic really isn't all that terribly interesting -  it's not *bad*, but it's not good enough to hold up the experience on its own. The original Motherload held it up with the character progression elements and the story, such as it was anyway. The need to upgrade your capsule kept you mining, and the curiousity as to just what the heck is going on keeps you interested.Super Motherload doesn't have that. The character progression is there, but it doesn't feel as satisfying; it's too fast, too easy, and upgrading your engine or your drill no longer feels like an accomplishment, nor does it feel satisfying when you actually get the upgrades. In the original each and every upgrade made you feel like you were riding a substantially more powerful mining machine, digging twice as fast or staying under twice as long - but in Super Motherload I'm not sure what the effects of the upgrades even are!  I honestly think the UI streamlining detracted from the experience; in the original, going through the motions of refueling, repairing, restocking, and finally checking the upgrade vendor to see what you can afford made returning from the pit each time feel a little bit refreshing, a ""yes! I made it!"" experience and a breath before you go back to the main gameplay - which is, after all, literally nothing but grinding (well, drilling, but that's close enough). In Super Motherload you literally just swing past the dropoff, fuel, and repair vendors and then it's right back into the pit with you, feeling less like an accomplishment and a break from grinding and more like a pointless ""do you wish to not lose the game"" prompt that comes up every five minutes. The fact that the resource indicators are less obvious and harder to read, and there's no audiovisual cue that you're about to run out of fuel doesn't help either.The story in the original definitely isn't going to win any Pulitzers, but it was simple, clear, and served its purpose. You're a miner on Mars. You dig for a bit, your boss occasionally congratulating you on your successes, and then you pick up a transmission from another miner just like yourself, except he's trapped deep underground, and there's something there with him... followed by your boss telling you that it was probably just a radio glitch. Things progress pretty predictably from there (did I mention your boss's name is ""Natas""? Yeah...), but it's an interesting enough mystery to keep you engaged, and there's a clear situation (you're a miner on mars and your employer is Up To Something) and a clear goal (find out what he's Up To, or else you might well be next!).Super Motherload may have that eventually, but not in the amount I played. Instead you first get a few minutes of a robot literally just text-dumping you the game's instructions (which can never be called up again, of course) and then as you dig you intercept a message from some underground base that their life support has been sabotaged, demanding your employer send help. Maybe I screwed up or something but there doesn't seem to be a way to get to them and help them - the message is literally pointless to you.

												DISCLAIMER: I give this like a 6/10, not a No/10 for reasons explained below. I can't in good conscience recommend it but there's fun to be had, so don't dismiss it immediately.Super Motherload is a game about digging downward and hoarding materials.Pros:+Fun gameplay+Couch co-op+Great graphics+Material rarity is well balancedCons:-Repetitive music randomly triggers-Some controls/mechanics unclear from the start-Horrible bossfight-If a player stops moving for longer than 5 seconds they disappear and have to rejoin.-The bossfight is truly terrible-One of the worst bossfights I've seenInfo:This game supports local same-screen co-op, with controllers, which is great.Explanation:Really, the biggest issue with this game is the ending. If you don't want spoilers stop reading now.For some reason, the developers decided to end a game with no enemies with a bossfight. Not only a bossfight, but a grueling minutes-long escape sequence during which you can easily die at any second. Quick reflexes aren't required for any part of this game until the bossfight. The bossfight is sudden, and not very well explained. You essentially have a choice of two bosses, who behave exatly the same. I played this game all the way through to the end with my girlfriend, but at the bossfight we had to quit after four or five attempts because it just wasn't getting anywhere. It's like we were playing a soccer tournament and then for the last match they decided we had to play tennis instead. Bad decision on the devs part.Once you get to the bossfight you won't want to play anymore. Other than that, it's really an enjoyable game. There are a few nits to pick here and there. The amount of idle time you're allowed in co-op before you get unspawned and have to rejoin isn't enough. The music seems to trigger at certain depths or something, but ends up starting at random since you're constantly changing depth. Your goal is pretty unclear when you start the game. But for the most part it's pretty enjoyable up until the very end, when it's discouragingly difficult and infuriating.			"

												I love how this looks, the music and the story are all great and I enjoyed the first few hours.Problem is, it gets grindier and grindier - which leaves me wondering whether to recommend it or now.End of the day - I'm going for 'Recommended' because it does a lot of things right.It comes with a warning tho - it really does become a slog before you get to the end.  Be prepared for a lot of farming upgrades/strategic tunnelling and generally 'working for your rewards' - esp once you've beyond the final 'base'.Note: You get the original Motherload to play too - not as pretty but perhaps more playable?

												It was alright. I wish you could actually see the parts that you could upgrade like in the old game, or that the parts would impact the look of the ship. Upgrading isn't quit as fun because of this. This game also needed some element of danger like with the earthquakes of the original game.Puzzles were okay, but some of them really needed better/more interesting rewards for the amount of resources/effort you might put in solving them. Sometimes you might barely break even on the profit, which is really the main goal of the puzzles since the solutions of the puzzles are always obvious. I might even have taken a loss on a few puzzles.The smelter was alittle too cheap with the value of smelted ore. Expecially considering you have to get 2 in a row to get a smelted object which might mean avoiding other sources of income to get the combo. I'd say the value of the smelted ore need to be 50 percent more and they should have given you 2 bombs for every smelted ore combo.Artstyle was nice. Soundtrack was very good and is easily the best part of the game.The boss at the end was kind of cheap. You have to fly all the way from the bottom to the top through a tunnel he makes, and fight him at 3 chokepoints while you do it. The screen moves very quickly and the boss can sometimes troll you and make an unexpected turn and if you hit a wall once it is very difficult to recover. If you die at any point, you have to start all over.  It's very easy to mess up. They should have made it only 2 chokepoints, one at the bottom, one at the very top. Especially since you have to fight him over and over again if you want other endings.Pretty much no post-game content that I can remember, so no reason to continue mining once you get a couple endings.Worth trying it out if it's on sale anyway, especially if you haven't played the original game.3.25/5			"

It's definitely worth getting because as it includes both versions of the game, you can just stick to the one you prefer.As beautiful as the remake looks, I still prefer the old one. The new one has the pro that you don't die if you run out of fuel, but imo it overcomplicated the plot and made it a touch too gritty. The old one is harder, but also doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it funnier. I don't know, maybe it's nostalgia talking :P			"

Motherload/Goldium EditionI'm a longtime fan of the original, just like many of the people posting reviews here. While I admit this version of the game is a pale shadow of the original, but it still can be fun. You have to remember that back when the original first came out and I was playing it flash games were in the golden years. It was everything a game needed to be: FreeSimpleAddictingEventually they did release a ""premium"" version of the game called ""Goldium Edition"" which at the time I didn't think added enough value to consider the purchase. (I think it was like $7 USD). You have to remember this was back in the pre Steam pre Smartphone age where most kids got ""allowances.""Motherload did have a shelf life though, so despite how amazingly fun it was you could only play it through a couple times before it did get boring, despite how satisfying that BZZZT drilling sound was. It was one of those games you remembered and thought back on ""Oh yeah that was a great game"" and then went on with your day. Memorable but not so much that you went to go pick it up again you know what I mean?Super MotherloadTo be honest I didn't even know this game existed until it showed up as a featured sale item. I did not purchase this game at full price and honestly I can't recommend anyone to do so. This version really only waters down the original and while the new powers are interesting the fact that the map is the same everytime means you will never be able to afford them. All the characters with unique abilities are also neat, but don't add enough to the game to make you want to try them all.While I understand the want to add a ""story"" to the game I feel that Motherload really didn't need it. I think it stems more from the fact they couldn't leave the final boss as SATAN HIMSELF due to obvious reasons. Thus they had to find a ""new"" final boss and therefore had to create a story to explain it all. Personally I think THE LITERAL DEVIL hanging out on Mars and exploiting humans for profit was pretty amazing. But keep in mind the original was made before ""PC culture"" even existed so they could get away with that. Big Bird with a pirate hat does not cut it in my book.Also on a side note: While I did enjoy the final boss fight I feel that it should have had a sequence at the core before the surface race began. You two duke it out and then have to escape the rising magma and the destruction of the planet is due to your climatic battle for the planet. The whole Death Star laser was just in bad taste I think.IN CLOSINGPROSDecent voice actingFun special abilitiesCo-opStill addicting gameplayInteresting final bossCONSProgression is much more streamlined and oversimplifiedUpgrades cost WAY too muchThe map is the same every time. No random generatingStory is uninterestingInsane volumes of the same 2 hazards = ""difficulty"" Not worth it for full price.Get it on sale and its a great purchase. Besides it comes with the Goldium Edition of the original so if you hate the new one you can live it up with the classic.**Edits for typos I missed			"

												Super Motherload is a game in which you mine resources balance cargo, fuel and upgrades. Throughout you have a storyline forming in with rescue missions from far below the planet Mars. It is a very fun and addictive puzzle game, where you have to figure out how to get to different locked ores and progress downward to see what is below. I am creating a video series on this game if you want to see actual gameplay then take a look and see what fun awaits!Gameplay of Supermother Load:

												I've only played a little on PC but I have many more hours on console.MechanicsThis is a game where you dig, find valuable minerals, and return to the surface to deposit said minerals and refuel. You spend your funds on upgrades that allow you to go deeper and deeper, receiving cryptic transmissions along the way - eventually reaching the center of Mars.That might sound boring but this game does a pretty good job of keeping it fresh. Soon you will encounter rocks that block your way, find upgrades that reward you for picking up specific minerals in order, and lava that you can drill through at the cost of a good portion of your health. Soon, the game becomes a puzzle, trying to figure out the most efficient way to drill in order to reach the valuables.If you want a basic idea of how this game works, look up Motherload. It's an old (free) browser game this one was based on.PresentationThis game's presentation is fantastic, featuring a powerful and atmospheric soundtrack by Eric Cheng and beautiful art by Scott Carmichael. Despite being a simple digging game there is crazy amounts of atmosphere.The voice acting ranges from ""good but weird"" to ""unintentionally hilarious"". It can break immersion but usually it's not a problem.Hardcore modeRegular mode is fun for a while but it gets boring when there's no consequence of being stupid. Enter Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode is not for giggles with your buddies.If you die, that character is dead forever. You'll need to start a new save to use that particular character.If you run out of fuel, you die. Also, all players in the session share fuel so die, die, die, and die.I love it.The storyIt's pretty good. It's not absolutely captivating, but it's... reasonably compelling. You are an employee of Solarus corporation, mining into Mars. As you drill deeper and deeper you hear strange transmissions from the other miners and discover that something's gone wrong - and that's not Solarus talking to you.OverallIt's a good game. It isn't fun in the same sense that some games are, but it's absolutely worth playing. Again, if you're on the fence, look up the original Motherload.			"

												First found this game at a Best Buy last year when they were demoing PS4's, came home, bought it, played, And as  I expected, It was amazing. Whichever platform you play this on, It's a great game. One of the things that really sold it for me was the soundtrack, paired with simple, calming but immersive gameplay, and a story that gets deeper the more you play. Really nice game to play to chill out, relax, and have some fun.  I strongly recommend this for anyone.			"

												Lovely game. Surprisingly relaxing, aside from the final boss(es). The gameplay is great, paced, and balanced. It's also a helluva lot of fun to play couch co-op with others. And the voice acting, art, and style of the game are all just so...capitvating.My only complaints are that the final bosses are too simple, the endings are too short/rushed, and that there are performance issues with any resolution above the minimum (even on my above-average PC with 3.6GHz and 8GB RAM).

												It was alright. I wish you could actually see the parts that you could upgrade like in the old game, or that the parts would impact the look of the ship. Upgrading isn't quit as fun because of this. This game also needed some element of danger like with the earthquakes of the original game.Puzzles were okay, but some of them really needed better/more interesting rewards for the amount of resources/effort you might put in solving them. Sometimes you might barely break even on the profit, which is really the main goal of the puzzles since the solutions of the puzzles are always obvious. I might even have taken a loss on a few puzzles.The smelter was alittle too cheap with the value of smelted ore. Expecially considering you have to get 2 in a row to get a smelted object which might mean avoiding other sources of income to get the combo. I'd say the value of the smelted ore need to be 50 percent more and they should have given you 2 bombs for every smelted ore combo.Artstyle was nice. Soundtrack was very good and is easily the best part of the game.The boss at the end was kind of cheap. You have to fly all the way from the bottom to the top through a tunnel he makes, and fight him at 3 chokepoints while you do it. The screen moves very quickly and the boss can sometimes troll you and make an unexpected turn and if you hit a wall once it is very difficult to recover. If you die at any point, you have to start all over.  It's very easy to mess up. They should have made it only 2 chokepoints, one at the bottom, one at the very top. Especially since you have to fight him over and over again if you want other endings.Pretty much no post-game content that I can remember, so no reason to continue mining once you get a couple endings.Worth trying it out if it's on sale anyway, especially if you haven't played the original game.3.25/5			"

												9.9999999/10: A faithful re-creation of the original flash game I killed hours and hours on in the library in elementary school, Super Motherload was one of my best purchases... on sale. Keep that in mind for this review.No, I don't think it was worth $15. I bought it when it was about $3.99, and I still feel like that was cheating the developers, but I wouldn't have paid $15 for this.I noticed a lot of people were not happy with this game, and for some reasons, I can see why: the minimap is really tiny, especially when playing on a big screen. Sometimes blocks just float a little strangely, don't break in the right way. The controls sometimes get a little soggy feeling on the keyboard (so it's worth shelling out for a controller!), which can lead to some enraging drops, and upgrades process doesn't really keep you updated on what you've actually bought, and what that does. Some of the explosives challenges are annoying, and can lead to some aggravating situations (That one unobtainium up on the top edge! Damn it!)But. For a game that brings back my memories of the original Motherload (which is included in buying this, by the way!), I couldn't think of anything better. A beautiful world, spectacular design, a great update to the filling/selling/upgrading process (just... driving over the buildings? Holy cow!), the checkpoints and bases system, the smelting/combining system, which totally revitalised my joy of mining... the list goes on. The music is amazing, though I wish I could have had that original jam updated... could have listened to that on repeat for days! The replay value is... okay. For some, getting to the end is all they wanted. For  me , the replay value was through the roof: I could drag a few friends over, throw the game up on the TV, and have a hysterical time. I could put it on my laptop and kill some time mining instead of writing press releases. I could put it on my screen in my room, and play it before going to bed. I enjoy mining way too much. I have issues.So it's a good purchase. Play it with your friends. Play it by yourself. Go mining.			"

												Fans of the original flash game will have a lot of fun with this. I know I did. More mining mechanics such as chain bonuses, smelting together different metals by mining in a certain sequence, and bombs, with a few quests and a much better boss make this from beginning to end an improvement on the original.I ran into a few crashes when I spammed bombs frequently (every 4 or 5 hours), but the autosave prevented this from being more than a small annoyance.I recommend you check out the flash game. If that holds your interest for more than an hour this game will be an endless mine of fun.			"

												I was a big fan of the original game on newgrounds, so I had to support the devs by paying to play the refined (ahem) version of the game. Still fun and addictive for the same reasons... though I found the new one to somehow seem more disjointed... usually games try to provoke you into making meaningful choices at critical decision points... at the end of the game you are offered the most ridiculous final choice I could have imagined. If you don't take the game too seriously, it's a fun timesink, one I'd enjoy even more potentially with multiplayer co-op... I just can't imagine a lot of people getting together to play such a casual game co-operatively! Overall, no regrets -- though it could have used a little polish, here and there. As it stands, the gameplay is great... the story behind it? It's a MESS.Still recommended.			"

												The game is very familiar to that of the original freeware game of Motherload. I cannot say that there are extrodinary differences between the two, but I admit that I have not completed the game. Its nice to have for a timesink when you don't want to think too much but it does get repeditive after a period. The element that I did like the most in comparison to the original is that there are bases that one can visit at lower levels so one does not have to go ALL the way back up which did take a fair amount of time each way. So I do give it that.While I do recomend this game ultimatly, its not for everyone. Mostly for those who liked the original and wanted to support its creator.			"

												if you remember the old game, this will bring back great memories!there are quite a few changes that have happened. to name a few there are bases beneath the surface, cargo weight no longer matters, and if you run out of fuel you dont die, you just move slower and can no longer drill. and you need to complete a few missions to continue drilling deeperpersonally i dont really mind the changes, it sort of makes the game easier which is nice, but also it takes away the fact that you had to plan your digs more carefully.there are a few different types of blocks as well but most can be destroyed with certain bombs. there are a few less varieties of minerals, but also you have smelter which can combine 2 different ores to create a more valuable one. i dont think i have figured out all of the ""recipes"" yet, but it is still fun!all in all, if you are looking for a more polished version of your old favorite, look no further and enjoy digging up the ground in search of treasure once again!

Motherload/Goldium EditionI'm a longtime fan of the original, just like many of the people posting reviews here. While I admit this version of the game is a pale shadow of the original, but it still can be fun. You have to remember that back when the original first came out and I was playing it flash games were in the golden years. It was everything a game needed to be: FreeSimpleAddictingEventually they did release a ""premium"" version of the game called ""Goldium Edition"" which at the time I didn't think added enough value to consider the purchase. (I think it was like $7 USD). You have to remember this was back in the pre Steam pre Smartphone age where most kids got ""allowances.""Motherload did have a shelf life though, so despite how amazingly fun it was you could only play it through a couple times before it did get boring, despite how satisfying that BZZZT drilling sound was. It was one of those games you remembered and thought back on ""Oh yeah that was a great game"" and then went on with your day. Memorable but not so much that you went to go pick it up again you know what I mean?Super MotherloadTo be honest I didn't even know this game existed until it showed up as a featured sale item. I did not purchase this game at full price and honestly I can't recommend anyone to do so. This version really only waters down the original and while the new powers are interesting the fact that the map is the same everytime means you will never be able to afford them. All the characters with unique abilities are also neat, but don't add enough to the game to make you want to try them all.While I understand the want to add a ""story"" to the game I feel that Motherload really didn't need it. I think it stems more from the fact they couldn't leave the final boss as SATAN HIMSELF due to obvious reasons. Thus they had to find a ""new"" final boss and therefore had to create a story to explain it all. Personally I think THE LITERAL DEVIL hanging out on Mars and exploiting humans for profit was pretty amazing. But keep in mind the original was made before ""PC culture"" even existed so they could get away with that. Big Bird with a pirate hat does not cut it in my book.Also on a side note: While I did enjoy the final boss fight I feel that it should have had a sequence at the core before the surface race began. You two duke it out and then have to escape the rising magma and the destruction of the planet is due to your climatic battle for the planet. The whole Death Star laser was just in bad taste I think.IN CLOSINGPROSDecent voice actingFun special abilitiesCo-opStill addicting gameplayInteresting final bossCONSProgression is much more streamlined and oversimplifiedUpgrades cost WAY too muchThe map is the same every time. No random generatingStory is uninterestingInsane volumes of the same 2 hazards = ""difficulty"" Not worth it for full price.Get it on sale and its a great purchase. Besides it comes with the Goldium Edition of the original so if you hate the new one you can live it up with the classic.**Edits for typos I missed			"

												Super Motherload is a game in which you mine resources balance cargo, fuel and upgrades. Throughout you have a storyline forming in with rescue missions from far below the planet Mars. It is a very fun and addictive puzzle game, where you have to figure out how to get to different locked ores and progress downward to see what is below. I am creating a video series on this game if you want to see actual gameplay then take a look and see what fun awaits!Gameplay of Supermother Load:

												Now hold on, I recommend this game because I enjoyed it. But in the same tank of fuel I still feel empty playing this game. >TL;DR Motherload is fun, short, maybe focuses too  much on puzzle solving. 5/10 might drill again for the achievements. I played Motherload back when it was on XGen Studios while I was a knee high lad, so I got the experience of having to drill again and again everytime I shut the browser down. That little experience has stuck with me all this time. I got excited when I learned that SUPER Motherload was in development, and placed it in my Wish List. Maybe my expectations were that of my pre-teen years but this game IS lacking SOMETHING from the original. Granted it is fun to play and relatively short to beat compared to some the length of some games. But possibly, there's too much focus on path finding and challenge beating. It was a fun game to begin with, but I feel maybe too much was put into the game about trying to face challenges and having to GRIND for everything that you need. The game is too repetitive to pay for something as much as 5 mil. They certainly did a good job, works awesomely with a controller, maybe I'm just being too nostalgic, but it doesn't hit home for me.  "

												For fans of the original ""Motherload""-game (which is included here) a must have!Everything from the old flashgame back then got improved, you can now combine elements on the go and the mining system is way better now. The best feature is the local-coop-multyplayer up to 4 players. It really makes fun to play and organize, and the ""storyline"" is for this gametype well done. You can even play as different characters with different vehicles.For 2$ in keyshops a true must-have for everyone. Even 5-9$ would be more than a deal for this game. The 15$ steam-price is just for fans of the genre relevant.			"

												if i really wana write the shortest review for this game in JUST one word it would be looking like this:""Digging""If i would add a bit more i would mayyyyyybe let it look like this:""Digging and grinding""But let me be honest about Super Motherload and give it a ""full"" review.Super Motherload is nicely made and looks really a lot more better than its original (you also can play the Goldium Version too). You ""explor"" the inner from Mars by digging your way into it. By getting stuff like gems and ores, you can Level up/ upgrate your Digger like more Full or can store more gems and stuff like. Its nicely made and the only (more or less) enemy is how greedy you are coz you only can DIG left, right and down and NOT up. Of course you can go back up coz your lil digger has helicopter wings too, so no problem to fly back and go back digging.But what IS the problem about the game feel....""lush""?Im honest, i only played it single player and had a good time with it but it feels like i just digged around like an idiot, searching the best ores and gems and...well...thats pretty much it. Good 2/3 of the game you just dig around till youre close to the middle of the Planet Mars, where anyhow the fun ended. Suddendly a lot really bugging things blocking your way like magma- and steelblocks you cant pass or only do by taking a huge % of dmg. the next problem is that I had to srs go back and clear up the sh*t i stored with my digger coz even a full upgrated store-place let you only carry 50 ores at the same time - and at the end you srs NEED to store more.""Why that?"" you may ask, ""arent 50 gems/ores not enough?"" Hehehehe - NO. There we come to the last 1/3 of the game, grinding. At the end it gives, and it is the ONLY one (ok lik ein the original but still), a END-Boss whom you need to deal dmg too. The problem is the whole game is about ""digging"" so it gives absolutly NO REAL weapon in this game (which makes it still weird looking for me if you see this ""Boss fight"" comming~). So what you have to do? The only way (as much as i know) is to ""bomb"" the sh*t out of the Boss and how you do that? With Bombs of course. So the problem is that you more or less need HUGE bombs which COSTS more of course - so where the grinding begins - and it sucks at the end coz of those magma sh*it and what not which bugs and blocks ALL possible ways. And it also slows the game a lot more down at the end: Where you simply can dig around the first areas you get pretty slower keeping forward at the end places where those stuff srs just bug you and you only get the GOOD stuff down there coz you need it to effort the high prices of the bombs.Got that?As i said i played ONLY the Singleplayer so i guess with at least 1-3 Friends it makes maaaaaaybe a bit more fun, sadly its ONLY LOCEL MULTIPLAYER, which means a Online-Multiplayer would be more fun at all (or at least handy~) but thinking about that we just ""dig and grind"" around...i guess after some minutes me and my friends would stop playing it...AND if i see it really GIVES a achievment that you CAN finish it in less than a Hour it makes it even more worse looking that Super Motherload has such a high price from 15€.So if i come to the factsIts just...digging and grinding.....and that for 15€? I mean even Terraria has not that high price and i can BUILD something there and digging....and...grinding...you know  (i DONT compair the games just in case someone would think so)? So i would coment to lower the price (like 8€ maybe) to get a fair deal out of it, you should really think twice about to buy it full price, really coz i guess you may play it ones and if youre done, you ARE done with it...
