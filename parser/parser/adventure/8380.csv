												Almost 10 years later, this game (and its 4 previous episodes) are fun and funny adventure games. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who never watched Homestar Runner videos back in the 2000s as you probably wouldn't get a lot of the humor. I was a big Homestar Runner fan and checked it daily for updates, but I never picked up this game until recently. I also feel you need to be a Gen X-er to get a lot of the ""80s"" humor (especially that fills this episode). Just a fun adventure game that harkens back to the days of the old Sierra Quest games.  Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the game considering its source material is funny little videos from a decades old web page.  "
